Moments into the first floor session, Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) introduced ameasure to throw out the writing tests takenby Minnesota 10th graders before they couldbe sent to be scored. The writing test is part of the state's Gradu- ation Standards program, which means stu-dents must pass before they can get a highschool diploma. Reuter said some 10th graders had objected to the test question, which asked them to writeabout one thing they would change aboutthemselves. He asked lawmakers to suspend normal rules and proceed with a vote on his proposalimmediately, instead of allowing it to be re-ferred to the House Education Policy Com-mittee to begin the committee process. ButReuter failed to persuade a two-thirds major-ity of his colleagues that such urgency wasneeded. On the prayer issue, Reuter said House rules that require prayers to be nondenominationalAction begins at gavel The 2000 session is expected to be brief but busy, much like theopening day, which included votes on two controversial matters and to \"respect the diversity\" of the membersof the House are impos-sible to follow. No oneprayer could possibly re-flect the many differentbeliefs of the Housemembers, he said. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) saidpeople who are invited togive a prayer on the Housefloor have for years beensent a letter asking them totry to keep their statementsnondenominational in na-ture. The House rulesadopted in 1999 simplyreflect the standard prac-tice, she said. \"It is not a gag; it is a request to please bemindful of the fact thatthere is diversity in thisbody,\" she said. Reuter's amendment to alter the House rules,so they would only saythat each session wouldbegin with a prayer by thechaplain, failed to winenough votes.While the 2000 Legislative Session began with little fanfare and an unusual amount ofaction, there was time to reflect on the loss ofa Capitol fixture. House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) noted the absence of Rep. Willard Mungerwith a moment of silence. Munger, the long-est-serving member of the House, first electedin 1954, died in July 1999. Newly elected Rep. Dale Swapinski (DFL- Duluth) will be serving the remainder ofMunger's term. House members applauded as Swapinski was introduced, and he said, \"I feel honoredand privileged to sit in this seat that was soably filled by Willard Munger for many, manyyears.\" House Minority Leader T om Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) praised Munger's impor-tant contributions to the state and invitedmembers and public to a memorial service inhonor of Munger planned for Feb. 7. As it turns out, the first day may be a har- binger of what comes this year. The 2000 ses-sion is expected to be brief but busy. The primary function will be to decide how To our readers: Welcome to the second year of Minnesota's 81st Legislative Ses- sion. It's the 17th year of publication for Session Weekly , and you may notice some changes. First, let's talk about what hasn't changed. We will continue to bring you complete, no-nonsense coverage of House committee meetingsand floor action. And handy sections such as the Bill Introductionsand the Committee Schedule can be found, as always, in the back ofthe magazine. The changes that have been made \u2014 some subtle, some not-so- subtle \u2014 are intended to make the publication more informative,easier to use, and more attractive. The Highlights section, which is consistently the best-read part of the magazine, will continue to provide concise, straightforward re-ports on all sorts of bills. A new section we've added, called At Issue, will offer in-depth sto- ries on major initiatives under consideration. This week, the sectionincludes pieces about the governor's bonding proposal and light-rail transit. To help you find the information you need, we've added an in- depth Contents section that will be on page 2 in every issue. It willoffer quick access to a list of the subjects covered in Highlights eachweek and of all the other articles and information. We have made several other editorial and graphic changes in the publication that we hope will make it more appealing to our readers. Many of the ideas for changes in Session Weekly were taken from the survey of readers conducted at the end of the 1999 session.Thanks to all those who replied. We hope you are pleased with themagazine. We welcome your comments and suggestions. Please call us at 651-296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550 if you need answers to generalquestions or assistance in following the legislative process. \u2014LeClair G. Lambert Rep. Joe Opatz ( left) listens to debate while Rep. Matt Entenza and Rep. Ann Lenczewski confer on the House floor the first day of session.4 February 4, 2000 IT'SAFACT Depressed no more A 70-year-old report shows many concerns remain, though economic conditions are wildly different In the late 1930s, Minnesota went looking for answers to economicproblems that had gripped the state \u2014 and the nation \u2014 for the entire decade. A special commission created to study the state 's economic woes came up with a list of solutions that \u2014 unlikely as it may seem after the boom of the late 1990s \u2014 included many ideas still advocated by some politi-cal leaders today. The House passed a resolution in 1937 that created the commission to examine thefactors slowing commercial and industrialdevelopment in the state. Two years later,the commission issued a report titled\"There is No Lack of Markets. \" The title reflected the commission 's con- clusion that it wasn 't a lack of consumer need that was hindering economic recov-ery. Rather it was the absence of purchas-ing power and the disparity betweenproducers and their ability to get fair mar-ket value for their goods. In the report, the commission took great lengths to make it clear that the downswingin the state 's economy was a direct result of the Great Depression, which had devastat-ing effects nationwide. Therefore, the reportsaid, complete recovery in Minnesota couldnot occur until the nation 's economy strengthened. The commission noted that Minnesota 's economy during the Depression declined ata sharper rate than the rest of the nationbut also was recovering at a quicker rate.Minnesota 's recovery was due in part to the relative strength of the state 's leading indus- tries \u2014 meatpacking, flour milling, news printing, book printing, and the productionof liquor. But something else was holding Minnesota 's recovery back. \"America has the manpower, machines and natural resources, skill and brains, \" the report said. \"Americans know how to pro- duce. Our factories, mines and farms are themost highly developed in the world. ButAmericans cannot buy the goods they pro-duce. We do not have sufficient buyingpower. Wages and farm prices are too low. \" Although Minnesota was a state that de- pended heavily on its agricultural resources,the commission said, income from agricul-ture in 1935 accounted for only 18 percentof the total annual income of the state 's people. T o remedy the lack of purchasing power, the commission recommended that thestate move to guarantee farmers fair pricesfor their goods. The commission also citedthe growing control of corporate farmingas harmful to the Minnesota farmer. \"During the Depression, the position of the farmer has become worse, \" the report said. \"The food trusts, with the power of monopolistic control, have protected theirprofits at the expense of the producer. \" The commission made other recommen- dations aimed at increasing consumer buy-ing power. It called for the state to upholdlabor 's power to bargain for a fair wage and to develop a tax system based on the abilityto pay. The state also needed to develop a sys- tem of long-term planning and managingthe state 's resources, the commission found. Conservation of the state 's timber, water, and soil was key, the report said, because\"the industries most important to the in- dustrial future of the state are those basedon our natural resources. \" Using tax concessions to attract indus- try ultimately was ineffective, the commis-sion concluded, because such moves onlytransferred Minnesota 's unemployment problem to neighboring states. \"Since Minnesota sells a large percent- age of its industrial products outside itsborder we do not gain when increasingunemployment cuts into this outside mar-ket,\" the report said. Seventy years later, Minnesota is in good times, with unemployment low and con-sumer spending high. But the issues of con-cern in late 1930s \u2014 from the plight of the family farmer to the economic competitionfrom neighboring states \u2014 continue to draw debate at the Capitol.to deal with another projected budget surplus and how much money to borrow for capitalprojects. But lawmakers likely will also act onmeasures to protect families from repeat sexoffenders and decide whether a proposal toreduce the size of the Legislature should ap-pear on the ballot in the November election. Plans for dealing with the projected budget surplus were not discussed on the House flooron the first day of session, but House Repub-licans are proposing tax cuts and another re-bate as their major agenda for the session. \"As long as the state continues to take more money from our families than it needs, Re-publicans will continue proposing tax cuts, \" Sviggum said. The proposed tax cut would reduce the per- centage of state income tax charged to eachbracket: 0.75 percent in the middle bracketand 0.5 percent in the upper and lowerbrackets. House Republicans are also proposing an- other sales-tax rebate, appropriations to re-duce property taxes, economic developmentprograms for rural communities, and one-time spending for road and bridge projects. The recent abduction and murder of Katie Poirier has influenced several crimeprevention proposals. Funding a statewidecomputer network that will prevent criminalsfrom hiding by changing their name or usingaliases and other proposals will be introducedand referred to as \"Katie 's Law. \" The main function of the 2000 session will be to determine how much money the state should bor-row by selling bonds to pay for capital projects. Gov.Jesse Ventura has recommended that the stateshould only sell $400 million in general obligationbonds. That number is based on the average size ofbonding bills in the past 15 years. Ventura 's bonding proposal also includes revenue from $34 million in user-financed bonds, $27 mil-lion from the trunk highway fund, and $1 millionfrom the general fund. The proposal also wouldcancel $37 million that has been previously autho-rized for capital projects but has not been spent. The governor 's plan would spend the funds to improve public buildings, natural resources, or otherinfrastructure areas like roads and water treatmentfacilities. The House Capital Investment Committee, chaired by Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), will beputting together an omnibus bill with input fromthe other House finance committees. Thecommittee 's task will include proposing a total amount to be bonded and a list of specific projectsto be funded. All in all, it appears the 2000 session should be one featuring debate on a variety of issues of sig-nificance to many Minnesotans. Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 1 - 3, 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #CRIME#CONSUMERS Tornado victims hit twice Two years after a tornado devastated St. Peter, the town 's residents are still reeling, in part due to unscrupulous contractors whotook people 's money and didn 't complete the job, said Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter), whohas proposed a bill to protect homeowners. Storm testified in favor of the bill ( HF2563 ) before the House Civil Law CommitteeFeb. 2. The committee took no action on thebill, but the proposal is expected to come upagain during the next few weeks. Storm shared horror stories about a con- tractor who col-lected money fromSt. Peter-areahomeowners, \"It's taken two years, with no reso-lution, \" she said. Jerold Lucas, a St. Peter attorney, toldthe committee thatone particular con-tractor conducteddishonest deals with15 homeowners in the area. The contractoreventually went bankrupt, but the mechanicliens were already placed on the homes, Lucassaid. \"It was a nightmare, \" Lucas said. \"It is a time warp. They couldn 't get out of it. \" Current state law says a builder, material supplier, or subcontractor can place a me-chanic lien on property if he or she is not paidfor work done on the property. The bill would create stiffer penalties for violators, said St. Peter resident Jerry Yushta,a police officer. In the St. Peter case, the con-tractor was charged with a gross misdemeanorfor each of the 15 cases. Yushta said the contractor should face felony charges for the amount of money hetook from the homeowners. Storm said the contracting industry helped draft the bill 's language.Capitol security needs help The Capitol complex might need a makeover in the next few years to prevent pos-sible acts of terrorism or dangerous incidents,according to a recent report on complex se-curity. Nicholas V . O 'Hara, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, told theHouse Crime Prevention Committee onFeb. 3 about the planned upgrades to the Capi-tol that feature metal detectors, X-ray con-veyor belts, and fewer entrances accessible tothe public. \"This is a managed approach to access, not a restriction of access, \" O'Hara said, explain- ing that people will still be able to enter theCapitol. The report was initially released on Jan. 17. The proposal recommended by the task forcewould cost the state $3.07 million. O 'Hara pre- sented four different protection packages,ranging from $1.8 million to $6 million. O'Hara said the Legislature should create a Capitol complex security oversight commit-tee, which would be responsible for the devel-opment and implementation of securitymeasures. The plan would require employees to carry color- and access-coded cards to movethroughout the Capitol complex. Vendors andother people who have business at the Capi-tol would be issued temporary identificationcards, the proposal states. There are currently 37 doors providing ac- cess to the Capitol. Under the proposal, thepublic doors would be reduced to seven. Intotal, there would only be 14 public doors be-tween the Capitol, Judicial Center, and StateOffice Building, the report recommends. O'Hara suggested the state increase secu- rity for the governor by assigning additionalstate troopers to the governor 's residence. Additional troopers should be assigned to fol-low the governor, the lieutenant governor, andlegislative and judicial officials, O 'Hara said. In addition, Capitol security should have auniform look so they are recognizable to the public, but distinguishable from other uni-formed officers. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) objected to the outfit changes, saying it is better for peopleto think Capitol security guards are police of-ficers. Skoglund suggested that people are lesslikely to commit a crime when they think anofficer is nearby. The $3.07 million proposal includes $1.67 million for screening devices and the accesscard system and $1.4 million for additionaltroopers, staff, equipment, and training costs. The committee took no action on the task force 's recommendations. Prison projects pitched Repairs to aging facilities and new construc- tion to handle emerging mental health andhigh security needs are the focus of theDepartment of Corrections ' capital budget for 2000. Department officials presented their bond- ing requests to the House Judiciary FinanceCommittee Feb. 1. Initially, corrections officials requested $25.6 million in bond funds for 2000. Gov.Jesse Ventura recommended funding for $19.5million, leaving two of the department 's ma- jor initiatives unfunded \u2014 a vocational build- ing at the Red Wing facility and an activitiesbuilding at Willow River. Several of the state correctional facilities are old and deteriorating, said Dennis Benson,deputy commissioner of corrections. Theproject requests for this year reflect that, andmany of the concerns have been problems forseveral years. Benson also said problems are approaching the point where the facilities will no longer bein compliance with state fire and buildingcodes if they continue to deteriorate. One project would fix the sanitary and storm sewer systems at the Faribault prison.A former state hospital, the medium-securityprison for men is more than 100 years old.Recent tests show that high, unsafe levels offecal coliform have contaminated the nearbyStraight River. Cost of the sewer project is$10.6 million. Officials have also proposed moving the current health services department at themaximum-security Stillwater prison into theformer laundry area, at a cost of $1.8 million.The health facility is now located outside thesecure parts of the prison, which requires staffCivil Law Chair: Scope: all areas of Minnesota's civil laws,including family law, per-sonal injury law, probate,landlord-tenant,nuisance law, and data privacy statutes.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILE\"They are eager to get rid of bad contrac- tors, too, \" Storm said. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) liked the bill, but he questioned why the proposal onlyapplies to residential construction. \"There is no harm to the homeowner to having this uniform (for all construction), \" Bishop said.6 February 4, 2000to transport inmates outside for medical care and increases risk, said David Crist, wardenat Stillwater. Ventura also recommended $1.8 million in funding to repair the crumbling 85-year-oldprison yard walls that surround the Stillwaterfacility. Also among Ventura 's recommendations is $855,000 to help build a high-security, self-contained unit at Oak Park Heights prison tohandle inmates who are a risk to themselves,other inmates, and staff. Most of the $13.9million total cost is being paid by the federalgovernment. Two other projects backed by Ventura would renovate the food service building atMinnesota Correctional Facility-Lino Lakesfor $3.9 million and renovate a cottage at Min-nesota Correctional Facility-Red Wing formental health needs at a cost of $801,000. The committee is expected to send its en- tire judiciary finance bonding plan to theHouse Capital Investment Committee in lateFebruary.During the Department of Corrections presentation before the Judiciary Finance Committee, Jim Bruton,warden at the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Oak Park Heights, points out features of a proposed ad-dition of 60 cells to house the worst of the worst inmates. Probation database planned The state Department of Corrections has developed a pilot project to integrate proba-tion data statewide in the ongoing effort tocreate a single criminal justice informationsystem in the state. The department presented its project to the House Judiciary Finance Committee Feb. 3. The project would take data about current and former probation cases and place it on asecure Internet site accessible by law enforce-ment personnel around the state. Each user would have an identification number or name and password to access thesystem. It would be available only to law en- forcement, said Dennis Benson, deputy com-missioner for the department. An official could search the database by us- ing a person 's first and last name or several other identifying factors, including driver 's license number or social security number. Inaddition, any aliases someone has used wouldalso be available. For example, an officer makes a traffic stop and finds out the driver of the car is namedJohn Smith. The officer suspects Mr. Smith hasbeen drinking and checks his driving record.The database also would allow the officer tosee if Mr. Smith is on probation for a previ-ous drunken driving violation that may in-clude a \"no drinking \" provision. The project is still in development stages. The department has been working on it forthe past 12 to 18 months. Benson did not know exactly how much the project would cost. He did say about $200,000had been transferred from the state Depart-ment of Public Safety for the project. He saidhe suspected it would cost more. Minnesota prison costs high Minnesota spends about $85 per inmate, per day to run the state prison system, correc-tions officials said at a Jan. 27 joint meetingof the House Judiciary Finance Committeeand Senate Crime Prevention and JudiciaryBudget Division. The committees held the interim hearing to discuss ways of cutting operating costs inthe correctional system. Concerns were ini-tially raised after a 1996 Bureau of Justice Sta-tistics report listed Minnesota as the mostexpensive state, spending $104 per day, per in- mate. Corrections officials testified that since the 1996 report, several changes have been madeto help lower the per diem costs to about $85a day on average. A chart prepared by the department shows the lowest per diem for 1999 was $75.55 a dayat the Stillwater prison and the highest was$137.96 a day at Oak Park Heights prison. David Crist, warden of the Stillwater prison, testified that because Minnesota incarceratesthe most serious offenders, costs are going tobe higher. Currently, the state has about 120,000 people on probation. Most state prisoners havecommitted crimes against people, not prop-erty crimes. Oak Park Heights prison, the state 's super- maximum security facility, takes the worst ofthe worst and costs the most per day to oper-ate, Crist said Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) said he wanted more information about how Minne-sota compares to other states regarding oper-ating costs and costs per inmate. Fiscal analystsfor both the House and Senate said statisticsfound in the annual corrections yearbook aretypically the most reliable, though it 's impor- tant to note how the figures are calculated. For example, the 1996 report included over- all prison operating costs, including adminis-trative positions. \"Any way you calculate it, we are extremely expensive, \" Kelly said. Members of both committees asked correc- tions officials to provide more informationabout how Minnesota 's costs compare to other states. The committees also briefly discussed ways to cut costs, including privatizing canteen ser-vices in the prison. Tracking criminals statewide Developing an integrated statewide law en- forcement database is a key priority, said thehead of the state 's Department of Public Safety during a Jan. 6 joint hearing of the HouseCrime Prevention and Judiciary Finance com-mittees. \"It's clear as a bell this issue is the most im- portant in criminal justice, \" said Charlie Weaver, commissioner of the department.\"The governor is focused like a laser on this issue. \" The interim hearing centered on an issue expected to be discussed during the 2000 Leg-islative Session. Many people believe that lawenforcement would be aided by a better wayof tracking criminals through the differentjurisdictions in the state.Session Weekly 7Committee deadlines for 2000 session Each year the House and Senate set deadlines by which most bills must be heard in a committee and forwardedthrough the process. Committee deadlines for this year will be officially determined by a joint House-Senate resolution. While that resolutionstill must be formally approved, it isexpected to contain the followingdeadlines and language further definingeach deadline. The first committee deadline will be Friday, March 3 . By that date, bills must pass out of necessary policy committeesin their house of origin. The second committee deadline will be Friday, March 10 . By that date, bills other than those containing appropria-tions will have to be passed out of allpolicy committees in the both the Houseand the Senate. The third deadline will be Friday, March 17 . All omnibus finance bills will have to pass out of committeeby that date. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. The taxes committees andrules committees in both bodies are ex-empt. And a bill can be heard after thedeadlines if the rules committee in eitherbody grants its permission.Officials want to avoid situations where a lack of information allows a criminal to slipthrough the cracks. Say a suspect picked upon misdemeanor charges in Martin Countyhas a warrant for his arrest on a more seriouscharge in Ramsey County. If the MartinCounty officials don 't know about the war- rant, the suspect will soon be back on thestreet. A statewide tracking system would en-sure the information would be available. Weaver described a Hennepin County project that will link computer systems fromthe county courts, county attorney, sheriff, andprobation offices. The pilot project will serveas a model for the state. Establishing otherpilot projects through state grants would bethe next step, Weaver said. Officials have not yet determined how much such a statewide system would cost the state.The department plans to coordinate the for-mation of a group to explore alternative tech-nologies and offers from vendors. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) asked if Gov. Jesse Ventura will support funding foran integrated system, even though the gover-nor has said he will back only emergency fund-ing measures this session. Weaver said it would be premature for the administration to support funding withoutknowing what the actual costs will be. #DEVELOPMENT Housing, history get support Bonding recommendations totaling $6.5 million greeted the House Jobs and EconomicDevelopment Finance Committee at its firstmeeting Feb. 2. The recommendations were part of the governor 's capital budget plan for 2000. The requests before the committee equal just 37.5percent of the total requested by the state De-partment of Commerce, the Housing FinanceAgency, and the Minnesota Historical Society. Among the governor 's recommendations are $2 million for loans to local governmentfor publicly owned transitional housing forlow- and middle-income people. Gov. JesseVentura 's plan also calls for $2.5 million for the energy investment loan program admin-istered by the Department of Commerce,which provides loans to public schools, cities,and counties to implement energy-efficientprojects. The governor is also requesting $1.75 mil- lion for the Historical Society for statewideasset preservation efforts along with $250,000to restore furnishings in the State Capitol inpreparation for the building 's centennial cel- ebration in 2005.Finally, the governor is requesting funding for a variety of wastewater treatment projects,Clean Drinking Water Act projects, and otherenvironmental programs. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), the chair of the committee, said that along with thegovernor 's proposals, the panel will consider many of the 62 projects requested by local ju-risdictions that were not included in thegovernor 's capital investment requests. Those projects total more than $407 million. McElroy said that the committee would hold a hearing for any bill whose author hasrequested a hearing, on the condition that theproject met the Nov. 1 deadline for submis-sions and has a Senate companion bill. He said one exception to these guidelines would be a potential request from the City ofMinneapolis for money for the Guthrie The-ater project. That project is expected to comebefore the Legislature this year, although a re-quest has not yet been made. #EDUCATION Progress Report BILL: HF2720 SUMMARY : Requires to 10th gradersand retesting of allstudents ACTION : House rejected procedural move to passimmediately Feb. 1 UP NEXT : Referred to House Education PolicyCommittee SENATE : Awaits hearing in Senate Children,Families& Learning CommitteeWriting test stands, for now An \"urgent \" attempt at revising a contro- versial statewide 10th-grade writing test fellshort during the first day of the 2000 legisla-tive session, and will now be taken up by theHouse Education Policy Committee later thismonth. The bill ( HF2720 ) will now travel through the regular committee process, after a motionto accelerate a vote failed. The statewide writing test, taken by Min- nesota sophomores during the last week ofJanuary, is requiredas part of the state 's Graduation Stan-dards program.Some students andtheir parents ob-jected to the write anessay about onething they wouldlike to changeabout themselves. Many people feel the questionwas inappropriatebecause it touchedon issues of self-esteem. Even Christine Jax, commissioner ofthe state Department of Children, Familiesand Learning, suggested the question mayhave gone too far. Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) intro- duced a bill Feb. 1 that would order destruc-tion of the current test, require students to be retested by answering a different question, anddemand legislative approval of future testquestions. \"I don 't think I need to remind you that this question went too far, \" Reuter said. Reuter moved that the House suspend nor- mal rules and allow members to vote on pas-sage of the measure without first requiring thebill to pass through committee. He argued the House needed to vote on the bill right away because the state was ready tosend the tests to be scored. Delaying action,he said, would cost the state additional moneyto re-administer the test at a later date. Themotion to suspend the rules, which requireda two-thirds majority to pass, gained only 63of the 90 votes it needed. Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), chair of the Education Policy Committee,urged members to vote against a suspensionof rules. Mares said it was only fair that thebill be heard by committee so that the publiccould have a chance to give its input. Several members agreed that the question went too far, but were adamant the bill should8 February 4, 2000travel through the committee process where the public could comment. Auditor eyes school finances A legislative auditor 's report released Feb. 2 says that Minnesota schools are in better fi-nancial condition than they were a decade ago. And although more than one-third of the districts surveyed reported making cuts thisyear, the statewide teacher-student ratio is ex-pected to hold at or near the level of the lastacademic year. The School District Finances report, which polled 79 percent of Minnesota 's school dis- tricts (accounting for 89 percent of publicschool enrollment), also indicated that moremoney is being received and spent on studentsthan 10 years ago. The growth in spending has largely gone for instruction or related activities, according tothe Office of the Legislative Auditor, whichproduced the report. To illustrate that point, John Yunker, project manager for the office, said more of the state 's school districts have added new programs thisyear than have eliminated them. But the report notes that the statewide av- erage teacher salary has declined 4 percentsince 1989. The dip in average teacher salary over the decade can be attributed in part to a greaternumber of new teachers who enter at the lowerend of the pay scale being hired to accommo-date enrollment growth, Yunker said. In a letter included in the report, Christine Jax, commissioner for the Department ofChildren, Families and Learning, said the re-port is both an accurate and fair portrayal ofthe trends in school district finance over thepast decade. \"Although the report indicates there is no evidence of a statewide financial crises in K-12 education, \" Jax wrote, \"we need to find ways to measure if Minnesota districts are makingthe most of current revenues, to tie spendingto measures of student success, and to developother accountability indicators to help guidedistricts and staff in making educational de-cisions. \" The report did not purport to measure whether current education funding is ad-equate to educate students or whether thestate 's schools are making the most of the rev- enue they receive. Vacancies may prompt changes Alternative ways to train and compensate teachers were considered by the House K-12Education Finance Committee during an in-terim hearing held Dec. 15, 1999. Officials estimate there will be 5,000teaching vacancies statewide for the 2000-01 school year, according to a report of the Min-nesota Department of Children, Families andLearning. By 2004, districts will need to re-place a total of 24,500 teachers. National and local experts who testified during interim hearings said teachers needmore opportunities for career advancementin the classroom and further development.They also said colleges and universities thattrain teachers need to work more closely withclassroom teachers. \"The days are gone when the people at the colleges and universities do the research andthe people in the classrooms do the practical, \" said Michael Tillmann, executive director ofthe State Board of T eaching. A bill ( HF1324 ) sponsored by Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria) would establish grantsfor programs that link local districts withteacher training programs. Local school districts could apply for one of five $20,000 grants to begin a program thatestablishes those links by such methods asplacing teaching students in K-12 classrooms,encouraging certified educators to teachcourses, or encouraging mentor. Another bill by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), would allowteachers to choose whether they are paid for a9-month or 11-month calendar. Those choos-ing the 11-month calendar would be requiredto spend the extra time on staff development. \"Many of our best teachers are already working that time, \" Folliard testified. \"But they're still being paid on a 180-day (9 month) schedule. I just don 't think that 's right. \"The bills are expected to be considered by the K-12 Education Finance Committee dur-ing the 2000 Legislative Session. MINNESOTA TEACHER OF THE YEAR House members cheer Minnesota Teacher of the Year Brett Smith during opening day proceed-ings in the House chamber Feb. 1. Smith, a teacher at O. H. Anderson Elementary School inMahtomedi, is one of four finalists for the title of National Teacher of the Year.Report says more info needed A report presented to the House Education Policy Committee Feb. 3 concluded there isn 't sufficient information to determine an accept-able standard for measuring overall schoolperformance. Submitted by the Department of Children, Families and Learning, the report said officialscannot recommend a sufficient definition forlevels of pupil achievement and overall ac-countability. The report also suggested that a study group continue to work toward developing a com-prehensive model that not only holds studentsaccountable for achievement but also identi-fies indicators that gauge the effectiveness ofthe system that supports continued studentimprovement. \"We don 't feel it 's fair to put all account- ability on a student 's back until we 're able to further examine the impact a community 's system of support has on that student, \" said Jessie Montano, assistant commissioner for thedepartment. Officials assembled a group of educators to assist in the development of policies that sup-port a successful K-12 education system,Montano said. The group met over the pasttwo months to review and discuss research andliterature on educational reform and account-ability, but could not reach a satisfactory con-clusion. The lack of a conclusion by the study group and the department, however, frustrated someSession Weekly 9#EMPLOYMENTlawmakers, including Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield). Tuma asked Montano pre-cisely when the committee could expect to seea more decisive conclusion. Montano was hesitant to give a definite an- swer and replied only by saying the depart-ment would continue to move forward asmore data became available. The department previously submitted rec- ommendations in December 1998 definingstate expectations for student achievement.Once adopted, the expectations were to beused by the state and school districts to evalu-ate if each school site met the performancestandard for a particular year. However, Montano said, shortly after Gov. Jesse Ventura took office in January 1999, theLegislature was asked to delay action on therecommendations and language contained inthe report, and another report was ordered forsubmission by January 2000. After presenting the most recent report, Montano offered to speak later that day withconcerned committee members in private andtake further comment back to the departmentfor consideration. Overview of job programs Studying the state 's employment and train- ing programs is the first step toward improv-ing workforce development efforts, an officialfrom the Department of Economic Securitytold the House Jobs and Economic Develop-ment Policy Committee Feb. 3. Jim Korkki, deputy commissioner with the department, said the state has had 27 consecu-tive months of unemployment rates below3 percent. The department projects that by2006, there will be just 337,000 workers for416,000 new jobs. The study was required as part of last year 's omnibus economic development law. Rep.Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) sponsored theoriginal legislation calling for the report. It marks the first time the state has ever looked at all the workforce development pro-grams as a whole. \"It was never the intention to ax programs, \" Gunther said. \"It was the hope to provide leg- islative oversight for dollars paid by taxpay-ers. We can look at ways to consolidate someof the programs to serve the people of Min-nesota better. \" Korkki said the study examined programs helping individuals assume jobs or advance inthe labor market. But, he said, the informa-tion in the report is not comprehensive be-cause the data collected was self reported, wasnot verified by an outside entity, and involvedcertain data privacy restrictions. The study looked at 78 programs administered by 14state agencies and three federal agencies. Those programs received $632 million in state funds, including $500 million from theMinnesota State Colleges and Universities sys-tem, and $255 million in federal funds. Officials from the Department of Trade and Economic Development presented an over-view of another study required by the 1999omnibus law, examining the state 's marketing plan for trade, tourism, and economic devel-opment activities. Steve Markuson, the director of the Office of T ourism, said the study found the statespends less than $10 million, or less than one-tenth of one percent of the state budget, an-nually on economic development marketing. Markuson said the study concludes that an integrated marketing approach between vari-ous state agencies and organizations will in-crease Minnesota 's competitive position in the marketplace. #ENVIRONMENT Environment & Natural Resources Board of Waterand Soil Resources.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILEVentura's bond plan questioned The debate over how much money to spend on the environment-related capital projects be-gan Feb. 2 in the House Environment and Natu-ral ResourcesFinance Committee. The panel heard an overview of Gov.Jesse V entura 's $462 million capital theenvironment. lawmakers objected to theamount of moneythat would be avail-able under Ventura 's plan. State agencies re- quested a total of$1.5 billion forcapital projects. Un-der the governor proposal, most ofthose requestswould be denied,which Rep. JeanWagenius (DFL-Mpls) said would create a backlog of maintenance projects that will needto be done in the future. \"How long will it take us to get out of that hole? \" she asked. Repairs that are ignored tend to get worse \u2014 and more costly to fix \u2014 she added. Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) ques- tioned the logic of the governor 's proposal, which is based on the average amount that hasbeen bonded in each of the last 15 years. Theamount of money to be bonded traditionallyhas been based on a percentage of general fundrevenue, Osthoff said. T o maintain the state 's bond rating, the state should spend less than 3 percent of its totalgeneral fund revenue in a biennium on debtservice. Under that guideline, the state couldauthorize more than $1 billion for fiscal years2000-2001, Osthoff said. One consequence of the governor 's proposal is that a project to clean up the MinnesotaRiver would be only partially funded.Wagenius pointed out that the state is eligiblefor $163 million in federal matching funds,but only half of that could be collected underthe governor 's plan. T o be eligible for the entire $163 million, the state 's contribution would have to be $70 million. The state has already allocated $10million for that purpose, and the governor 's proposal is to spend another $25 million. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), chair of the committee, said he plans to begin hearingproposals soon from other House memberson environmental projects that could be in-cluded in the House version of the bondingbill. DNR supports license fee hike A proposal to raise hunting and fishing li- cense fees has the backing of the MinnesotaDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR),which needs revenue to restore programs andstaff. \"This is not a total solution to the crisis in funding, \" Deputy Commissioner Steve Morse said. \"But it is important we do something this year. \" The issue was debated during an interim hearing of the House Environment and Natu-ral Resources Finance Committee held Jan. 11.Lawmakers are expected to take up the mat-ter again during the 2000 session. The DNR is seeking a $1 increase for fish- ing licenses, a $2 increase for small-game li-censes, and a $3 increase for firearms deerlicenses. The Senate passed a similar proposalduring the 1999 session, but it failed to passthe House.10 February 4, 2000Under the proposal, the state would provide $1 in additional support for every $2 raisedby the fee increase. The department estimatesthe fee increases would raise $6 million. The last hunting fee increase came in 1991, and the last fishing fee increase was passed in1997. Morse said fishing and conservation groups support the proposed fee increases. The addi-tional revenue will go toward restoring cutsin jobs and programs. Officials estimate the unreserved fund por- tion of the larger Game and Fish Fund willhave a negative balance in 2003. The Game andFish Fund is created through the license fees. Morse said Gov. Jesse Ventura supports the proposed fee increase, but even with the ad-ditional revenue, the department still fallsshort of proper funding levels for its fish andwildlife programs. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), commit- tee chair, said that the issue will be a majorfocus this session. \"Hopefully this committee and others in the House and Senate will bring up awareness(of the need for additional DNR funding), \" he said. Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) said it would be difficult to support the DNR 's proposal because it doesn 't provide a long-term solu- tion to the lack of funds. \"This is a two year, short-term fix. It is not solving anything, \" he said. #GOVERNMENT No consensus on House prayer House rules regarding the prayer that opens each floor session, a matter of emotional de-bate last year, made an encore appearanceFeb. 1, the first day of the new session. Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) intro- duced an amendment to the Permanent Rulesof the House that would have eliminated lan-guage calling for \"a nondenominational prayer by the chaplain that respects the religious di-versity of the House. \" In its place, Reuter sought to install word- ing simply requiring \"a prayer by the chap- lain. \" But his effort did not win enough support on the House floor. The amendmentgot a 69-63 majority of votes, but it failed tomuster the two-thirds support (or 90 votes)needed. The references related to religious diversity were added to the House rules during the 1999session. House leaders said the memos sent tovisiting chaplains have long included suchprovisions, and by putting them in the rules,the practice was simply made official. The matter was raised after a choirperforming as part of opening day events last session sang a song including references toJesus Christ. In debating the issue Feb. 1, Reuter said the new rule inhibits free speech and expression. \"If we tried to pass this as a law, \" he said, \"it would be unconstitutional. \" Reuter, who left the Republican Party after the end of the 1999 session, noted the displea-sure some expressed about seeing the matterraised again, but he said he felt it was impor-tant to revisit. \"This is the last remaining thing for me to fix of my legislative career, \" he said. Several other lawmakers argued in favor of the proposed amendment. Rep. T onyKielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) said the existingrule does not allow people to hear the uniquebeliefs of others or to express their own reli-gious values. \"We need to learn to respect that diversity and to allow people to experience that, \" he said. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) pro- posed an amendment that would haveremoved only the word \"nondenominational \" from the House rules. That amendment failedby a margin of 110-20. State must get more into jobs Despite research indicating an increase in the percentage of Minnesota welfare recipi-ents who are employed, a report presented tothe joint Legislative Audit CommissionJan. 27 suggested that the state must do more to help traditional welfare recipients. The report found that compared with most other states, Minnesota has more generouswelfare assistance levels and eligibility crite-ria, with less severe imposed sanctions, butalso lower participation rate by welfare recipi-ents in work-related activities. According to the report, in welfare house- holds where at least one adult was eligible towork, fewer than 50 percent of them wereworking or involved in work-related activitiessuch as school. That could prove to be a prob-lem for the state in the future, said LegislativeAuditor James Nobles. Minnesota could suffer financial penalties from the federal government if it fails to showthat at least half of its welfare recipients areparticipating in work-related activities in2002, Nobles said. A work-related activity, according to the report, includes schooling, job searching, oractual employment. The report suggests that lawmakers should use up more of the federal money the statereceives for programs to remedy the weak sta-tistics. By July of next year, Minnesota expectsto have $164 million in reserve. Information provided by the Department of Human Services suggests the state has ex-tra money because it continues to receive $267million per year from the federal governmenteven though caseloads have declined. The report also suggests the state impose stronger sanctions for people who aren 't mak- ing sufficient progress toward joining theworkforce by their established deadline. In WELFARE PROTEST JoAnn Gonzalez, right , holds a friend's grandchild as another participant carries a sign in pro- test to welfare changes during a rally in the Capitol rotunda Feb. 1. Protesters expressed op-position to the five-year lifetime cap on welfare eligibility.#HUMAN SERVICESSession Weekly 11#LOCAL GOVERNMENT #IMMIGRATIONJuly 1997, the state limited welfare recipients to 60 months of eligibility. Currently, the stiff-est penalty the state can impose on recipientsmaking little progress is a 30 percent reduc-tion of benefits. Proposals for job-training programs, hous- ing stipends, and other services to plug thegaps in the state 's welfare program are ex- pected to surface in both the House and Sen-ate this legislative session. Information on illegal employment Immigration and Naturalization Service officials (INS) would gain access to more staterecords, under a bill approved Feb. 2 by theHouse Civil Law Committee. The bill ( HF2522 ), sponsored by Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), would allow immigrationofficials to obtain employment records fromthe state Department of Economic Security. The bill will stay within the committee for now and is expected to be rolled into an om-nibus data practices bill later this session. Charles Midby, special agent in charge of the regional INS office, told the committee heinvestigated an area employer last year thathad several illegal immigrant employees.Midby said he tried to get employment recordsthat showed the employer knowingly hired theillegal immigrants, but the Department ofEconomic Security refused to turn over therecords. \"We decided to proceed without the more serious charges because we couldn 't get the information, \" Midby said. The company was still fined, but without the serious penalties that could have comewith more information, he said. Rick Caliguiri, budget coordinator with Department of Economic Security, said theinformation his agency collects is private andnonpublic, and the INS does not have statu-tory authority to gain the information. The bill would allow agents access to it.Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) ex- pressed concern about the proposal and ques-tioned how it would be known if immigrationofficials are investigating a company. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) asked if economic security officials can call immigra-tion agents when they suspect illegal immi-grants are working for a company. \"Is whistle-blowing going to get a [depart- ment] official in trouble? \" Skoglund asked. \"I think some of them are afraid. Are they introuble? \" Caliguiri assured Skoglund that no state employees would be in trouble, nor have anyemployees been disciplined in the past forreporting information to the immigration service. The bill would also allow immigration agents to gain access to employment recordswithout the consent of the individualemployees. Currently, the Department of Economic Security is allowed under statute to dissemi-nate the information to the departments ofRevenue, Labor and Industry, and Trade andEconomic Development. Assessments for rural addresses The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee approved a billFeb. 2 to allow counties to use special assess-ment procedures for address signs related to911 emergency services. In recent years, many rural residents re- ceived street addresses for the first time as aresult of enhanced 911 services. Many of thecosts of implementing that service were paidfor by telephone surcharges. Terry Overn, Le Sueur County auditor, said the costs of house signs cannot be assessedunder current law. Special assessment can onlybe used for county state-aid highways, countyhighways, waterworks, and sewer systems. Overn said the average cost of the special assessment in his county would come toaround $25 per household. He said rural resi-dents see the benefit of having a street addressas opposed to a route or box number for po-lice, fire, and ambulance services. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield), who is sponsoring the bill ( HF2549 ), said the assess- ment is akin to a user fee because residentsbenefit from the 911 services. \"Most of the rural residents I know want the signs. They appreciate them, \" Tuma said. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) said she was concerned that the bill would result in anincrease in property taxes and that the stateshould assist in helping to pay the costs be-cause it initiated the move to street addresses. The bill was referred to the House Taxes Committee. Mandatory bike registration A House committee approved a bill (HF2489 ) that would allow municipalities selling impounded bicycles to require pur-chasers to register the bikes. The registration fee is currently $9 for a three-year period. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), the bill 's author, said the measure is in response to arecommendation of a bicycle theft task forcehe serves on. He said there are an increasingnumber of \"strong arm \" thefts occurring in Minneapolis where riders are literally shovedoff their bikes by a thief. Skoglund said in such instances that it is difficult for a bike owner to prove that the bi-cycle belongs to him or her and not the per-petrator. He said the aim of the legislation isto return bicycles to their owners, as well asprevent thefts from occurring in the first place. The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee approved the billFeb. 2 and sent it to the House floor. State mandates, local strains Local government officials often complain about mandates from higher levels of govern-ment, especially when the higher level doesn 't help pay for the costs of complying with themandate. A recent report from the Office of the Leg- islative Auditor found that the state has sev-eral ways to resolve such conflicts betweenstate and local governments, but they are sel-dom used. The report was presented to the joint Legislative Audit Commission Jan. 26. One method involves local fiscal impact notes that give lawmakers accurate informa-tion on the potential costs passed down tomunicipalities in order to comply with thepending legislation. The chair or ranking mi-nority member of the House or Senate taxcommittee can request a local fiscal impactnote from the state Department of Finance. However, only eight local fiscal impact notes have been prepared in the last two years. A 1997 law requires the department to pre- pare a biennial local fiscal impact summaryreport that specifies local governments ' costs of complying with state mandates. Thedepartment 's first report is expected in September. Another option is for sponsors of pending bills to be asked to provide a \"mandate expla- nation, \" which must have seven specific types of information: policy goals of the bill, per-formance standards that allow flexibility forcompliance, how those standards govern staff-ing and other administrative requirements,revenue sources, reasons why voluntary com-pliance won 't work, input from affected agen- cies regarding their ability to implement theproposed mandate, and feedback from localgovernment officials in developing the pro-posed mandate. Many of those subjects are discussed during hearings on pending legislation, but accordingto the report, specific documents with all of thatinformation have not been requested or pre-pared. Mandate explanations can be requestedby a chair or ranking minority member of anylegislative committee.12 February 4, 2000Y et another remedy is to acquire a variance from a state agency, available for such thingsas child care licensing rules or water qualitystandards. Also, a local unit of government canapply for a waiver through the Board of Gov-ernment Innovation and Cooperation, or itcan request a state agency to amend or repeala rule through a petition process. The report recommends that legislators use the remedies already available, rather than try-ing to develop new ones. #RECREATION CELEBRATING PUBLIC SERVICE DAYGood marks for running parks Increasing demands for services at state parks have caused Department of NaturalResources officials to make some toughchoices. The Office of the Legislative Auditor re- cently evaluated the DNR 's process of mak- ing those choices and released a report on itsfindings. The joint Legislative Audit Commission dis- cussed the report Jan. 26. According to DNR surveys, park visitors have consistently expressed satisfaction withcampgrounds, hiking trails, cleanliness of fa-cilities and other features of the parks. Thereport found that the DNR does a good job inbalancing its priorities among the various ar-eas of park management: maintaining parkfacilities, providing educational and recre-ational programming, and preserving thestate 's natural resources. The DNR has rational standards for settingpriorities, such as ranking capital improve- ment projects and soliciting public input forprogramming decisions, according to thereport. However, the report also listed some areas that could be improved. One concern is that preserving natural re- sources is a lower priority than maintainingcampsites and providing educational or \"in- terpretive programming. \" That programming includes presentations or tours given by natu-ralists, publications that teach park visitorsabout natural resources or environmentalproblems, and many other types of programs. Bill Morrissey, director of the DNR 's Parks and Recreation Division, said that while pre-serving natural resources is important, it doesnot draw as much reaction from the public asa decision to save money by closing a camp-ground for the fall or spring seasons. Morrissey added that the division has in- creased spending on preserving resources overthe last 15 to 20 years. Pine trees were removedfrom Itasca State Park that were at-risk forspreading disease, for example. Controlledburns to restore pine forests and harvestingnative prairie seed are other examples of thedivision 's resource management programs, he said. Some of the funding for preserving natural resources comes from sales of merchandiseand equipment rental in parks. That moneygoes into a revolving fund, the Working Capi-tal Account, which is spent on resource man-agement and interpretive programs. Another concern is that assessing the con- dition and estimating repair costs of state-owned buildings has been inconsistent. The DNR is adding a new database for buildingmaintenance, which is expected to improvethat concern. Also, the report recommends that the DNR continue including estimates of future oper-ating costs of new buildings in its biennialbudget requests. #TAXES #TRANSPORTATIONClosing a tax loophole A change clarifying the assignment of non- business income for non-Minnesota residentsis one of the provisions in the Department ofRevenue 's policy bill this session. Department officials presented an overview to the House Taxes Committee Feb. 3 of twobills proposing technical, administrative, andpolicy changes in the state 's tax laws. The provision is a response to a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling last year that held thatthe term \"compensation for labor or personal or professional service \" did not include wages paid to an executive for managerial or admin-istrative work. The court ruling meant that the plaintiff in the case, Victor Benda, a T exas resident, didnot have to pay taxes on wages he earned whilein Minnesota. \"I am offended that Mr. Benda was able to get away with that, \" Rep. Ron Abrams (R- Minnetonka), the committee chair, said. The proposed change would replace the terms \"labor or personal or professional ser- vices \" with the word \"wages \" and thus would require wages earned by all employees forwork in the state to be assigned to Minnesota. That way, Minnesota could collect income tax on the wages. Jennifer Engh, deputy commissioner of the department, said the change would result in a$2.3 million revenue gain for the state. The committee took no formal action on the bills, but Abrams said they would be con-sidered as part of the omnibus tax bill thissession. Transit demands growing The Twin Cities region should double its fleet of buses in the next 20 years to keep upwith the area 's transportation needs, said Nacho Diaz, transportation planning directorfor the Metropolitan Council. Diaz testified before a joint meeting of the House Transportation Finance and Transporta-tion Policy committees Feb. 2. He said doublingthe number of buses and creating dedicated Stearns County Commissioner Rose Arnold waves to her fellow public servants after beingacknowledged by Speaker Steve Sviggum during ceremonies in the House chamber Feb. 3.Commissioner Arnold sent the speaker a letter that initiated \"Celebrating Public Service Day,\"which brought county, city and school board members to the Capitol to meet with their legis-lators.Session Weekly 13 roads for buses could keep 200,000 vehicles off the packed highway system each day. \"The Twin Cities continues to grow rapidly, \" Diaz said. \"But that leads to transit problems. \" There are 250,000 bus riders each day now, Diaz said. He hopes to increase that numberto 500,000 riders over the next 20 years. The state would need to invest $440 mil- lion by 2010 in buses to double its numbers,according to a transit report. There also wouldbe additional operating costs of $70 millionper year, the report states. To obtain more riders, the state must strengthen its current bus system, develop anetwork of dedicated transit corridors andpromote development along those corridors,Diaz said. A dedicated transit corridor, involving both light-rail lines and roads exclusively for buses,would speed passengers to their destination. Along with more buses, the state must pro- vide more garages, more park and ride loca-tions, additional transit stations, and otherpassenger amenities, Diaz said. T ed Mondale, chairman of the Metropoli- tan Council, told lawmakers he hopes that two,possibly three, dedicated busways can be builtduring the next 20 years. There are no plansfor light-rail lines outside of the HiawathaCorridor, he said. There are currently 100 miles of congestion on metro highways, Mondale said. \"T o do nothing now will ensure 300 miles of congestion in the future, \" he said. \"We know congestion is getting worse. \" Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), who chairs the transportation finance committee, ques-tioned the funding requests for Minneapolis. \"We're putting a lot of resources back into an area that lost population, \" Molnau said.Metropolitan Council Transportation Planning Director Nacho Diaz presents an overview of theMet Council's 2020 Transit Master Plan before ajoint meeting of the Transportation Policy andTransportation Finance committees on Feb. 2.Suburban road funds uncertain Areas throughout the state need more money for transportation infrastructure im-provements, state and local officials said at ajoint meeting of the House TransportationPolicy and Transportation Finance commit-tees Dec. 6, 1999, at the Woodbury City Hall. Several local officials testified at the interim hearing in favor of full funding for the projectto reconstruct the Wakota Bridge on Interstate494 between Newport and South St. Paul so ithas four lanes of traffic heading both east-bound and westbound. The plan also calls forthe widening of U.S. Highway 61 from fourlanes to six lanes through Newport. The Minnesota Department of Transporta- tion (MnDOT) estimates the cost of theproject at $168 million, nearly $50 millionmore than original numbers. The increasedcosts have prompted the department to pro-pose scaling back the project and delaying sev-eral portions until additional funding isfound. Supporters stressed the importance of mov- ing ahead with the entire project now. \"The individual parts of the project are too integrated with each other to remove themindividually, \" said Craig Y olitz, chairman of the I-494 Wakota Bridge Coalition. St. Paul Park Mayor Donald Mullan said the project is essential to his community becauseof safety issues. Gas tankers traveling from theAshland-Marathon Petroleum refinery use thecity streets to avoid traffic bottlenecks, he said. For Newport, the project affects both safety issues and concerns over the long-term viabil-ity of the city, said Mayor Tim Geraghty. \"With a half-build, 800 gas tanker trucks will still rumble by our elementary schooldaily, \" he said. \"Residents and businesses will still lose time, money and accessibility withinour own community. \" WWII memorial must wait The House narrowly defeated a proposal Feb. 3 to override Gov. Jesse Ventura 's line- item veto of $150,000 to plan and design amonument to honor Minnesota 's World War II veterans. The vote was 79-53 in favor of the override, but a two-thirds majority is needed to over-ride a veto \u2014 90 votes in the House and 45 votes in the Senate. The override motion was made by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int 'l Falls), who had sponsored the legislation that was vetoed fromlast year 's bonding bill. \"It's a disgrace, \" Anderson said. \"It's a#VETERANSdisgrace that we do not have a World War II memorial in this state. \" Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) urged House members to support the override, especiallybecause Ventura had stamped the bill with apicture of a pig, calling it a pork-barrel project. But House Majority Leader Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) and Rep. Jim Knoblach(R-St. Cloud), chair of the House Capital In-vestment Committee, promised Anderson thathis proposal would be included in this year 's bonding bill. Pawlenty said there is no reason to override the veto, which would be an \"affront to the governor, \" and that they should instead try to negotiate with him and persuade him not toveto the proposal this time. \"We owe (World War II veterans) this, and we will deliver it to them, \" Pawlenty said. \"It's just a matter of a few weeks away. \" In order to override a governor 's veto, the motion must pass through both the Houseand the Senate by a two-thirds majority. TheLegislature successfully completed one over-ride during the 1999 session \u2014 for the first time since 1982. As the 2000 Legislative Session be- gins, the House includes 70 Republi-cans, 63 DFLers, and one Independent.The Senate has 41 DFLers, 25 Republi-cans, and one Independent. The makeup of the House of Repre- sentatives changed slightly during theinterim. Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) left the Republican Party shortly afterthe conclusion of the 1999 LegislativeSession and declared himself an Inde-pendent. Later, the longest-serving member of the House, Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), died at age 88. A special elec-tion to fill his seat was won by Rep. DaleSwapinski (DFL-Duluth).14 February 4, 2000AT ISSUE: BONDING # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGERTwo years ago, Gov. Arne Carlson responded to the projected $1.3 billion surplus by proposing a$1 billion capital projects budget.A modest proposal The governor's bonding plan is relatively lean, andsome lawmakers fear it ignores critical needs This time around, it 's a new governor and an even bigger surplus. But Gov. Jesse V enturahas taken a different approach than his pre-decessor, submitting no supplemental budgetrequest and a $462 million capital budget,which lawmakers are calling \"thin. \" Ventura 's plan adheres to the promise he made last year that he would not recommendmore than $400 million in general-fundbacked bonding for 2000. He received requestsfor more than $1.5 billion in capital improve-ments, not all of which would be financed withgeneral obligation bonds. The governor 's plan centers on investment in state government infrastructure, specificallyrepairs for aging facilities. But he also placesemphasis on bonding for higher educationand K-12 education projects. Leaders from both the Republican and DFL caucuses in the House say the governor 's re- quests are low, especially considering the pro-jected $1.6 billion surplus and Minnesota 's strong bond rating. Some also want to pass supplemental bud- get appropriations this year, somethingVentura has said he won 't support. Ventura 's plan technically calls for $499 million in new projects for the state. However,through cancellations of old projects worthabout $37 million, the total new spending inhis capital budget is $462 million. Of that fig-ure, $400 million would be financed throughgeneral obligation bonding, $1 millionthrough the general fund, $34 million throughuser-financed bonds, and $27 million from thetrunk highway fund. Just as the heft of Carlson 's bonding plan raised a few eyebrows two years ago, currentlegislative leaders are concerned about howsmall Ventura 's proposal is. \"It's something that we 'll be using as a guide, \" said House Speaker Steve Sviggum(R-Kenyon). \"Two years ago, the bonding bill was huge. It was bloated. . .. This time aroundit is very thin. \" Preserving buildings and roads Ventura has proposed more than $65 mil- lion for state facilities for asset preservationor to fix those currently out of compliance ordangerously close to violating various build-ing and safety codes. Two such projects involve crumbling walls around the yard at the state prison inStillwater, estimated to cost $1.5 million, andthe replacement of the storm sewer at theFaribault prison at a cost of $10.6 million. The governor has also recommended fund- ing to relocate several state offices that haveoutgrown their facilities or can no longer use their facilities. Among those is the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension building and laboratory, whichis currently located in a former Departmentof Transportation garage. V entura has recom-mended $58 million to construct a new facil-ity in St. Paul. In addition, the governor is recommending bonding $11 million to acquire property forfuture state development on the Capitolcomplex. The governor 's plan also provides funding grants to political subdivisions including re-gional jail facilities, a sports complex inDuluth, several Minneapolis park projects,and an events center in St. Cloud. However, another major part of the governor 's plan calls for $30 million for local bridge repairs and replacement. Last year,V entura line-item vetoed $10 million forbridge repair. Higher education Ventura 's plan calls for a total of $118 million for the University of Minnesota and the Minne-sota State Colleges and Universities (M nSCU) system. Foremost among his recommendations is the governor 's support of the new biology research The Arts Building on the West Bank campus of the U of M would be replaced under the governor's bonding recommendations, which include a total of $54 million for the university.Session Weekly 15(86.6%)G.

Under his plan, $35 mil- lion would help finish the Molecular and Cellu-lar Biology Building on the Minneapolis campus.Another $10 million would match a private do-nation for the Microbial and Plant GenomicsBuilding on the St. Paul Campus. The governor has also proposed $30 mil- lion for infrastructure and preservation workon the Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities campuses. In addition, MnSCU would receive $34.3 million for additional science labs atNormandale Community College, remodelingfor the science and general education build-ings at North Hennepin Community College,and a new information center and remodeledlibrary at Minneapolis Community and T ech-nical College. The governor 's goal, his plan says, is to sup- port the state of the art research at the U of Mand help MnSCU campuses prepare collegeand corporate customers with the technicalskills they will need in the coming years. Agriculture and the environment Various projects, including an initiative to clean up the Minnesota River, are part ofVentura 's proposed $122 million for the envi- ronment. The state has until Sept. 30, 2002, to come up with a required match to receive $163 mil-lion in federal funds to retire 100,000 acres offlood-prone marginal cropland in the river 's watershed. T o that end, the governor has proposed about $36 million for easement programs thatwould pay farmers to agree not to farm cer-tain marginal agricultural land. In addition, V entura has recommended funding of $26 million for water managementissues. Among the programs is a loan programfor local communities to improve wastewaterand drinking water. Another loan programwould help restore lakes, rivers and streams,and groundwater acquifers. The governor has also recommended fund- ing of more than $14 million for state parks,trails, and forests. K-12 initiatives Primarily funded through local property taxes, K-12 initiatives are often minor partsof the capital investment proposals. However,two prominent projects are highlighted in thegovernor 's plan. Ventura wants $34 million for investments in several K-12 facilities that have demon-strated critical needs. Among projects identi-fied as critical are a new middle school in CassLake, an elementary school in Caledonia, andboth a middle and elementary school in RedLake.The Ventura administration is also consid- ering a proposal for an enhanced financingprogram for the next operating budget thatwould help schools better address their facil-ity needs. The governor also is seeking $17.7 million to complete the East Metro Magnet School inSt. Paul. According to the plan, the school isdesigned to expand voluntary desegregationin participating school districts. In addition, the plan calls for $3 million to plan a west metro magnet. Republican and DFL plans Even though higher education projects comprise nearly 25 percent of the governor 's bonding recommendations, leaders in boththe House Republican and DFL caucuses sayit's not enough. Sviggum said there are a number of critical facility needs beyond what the governor hasrecommended that need the Legislature 's at- tention. House Minority Leader T om Pugh (DFL- South St. Paul) agreed that the governor 's pro- posals fall far short of the goals his caucus has. \"Certainly we see great needs in the higher education systems, especially when our busi-nesses are looking for skilled workers to filljobs in the state, \" he said. Both men also agreed the lack of a supple-mental budget request from the governor 's office will make things tight this session.Republicans have already proposed spending$400 million on transportation projects. Pugh also discussed critical bridge and highway repairs. Both Sviggum and Pugh also said there needs to be more of a balance in the bondingbill between metro area projects and thosebenefiting Greater Minnesota. Though both party leaders say the Legisla- ture will weigh the governor 's requests heavily, they 're concerned that too many important projects will be sacrificed if constraints are tootight. \"T o get the concerns that we 're talking about in education and higher education wouldsqueeze out other projects, \" Pugh said. At the same time, Sviggum said, he 's well aware there have to be limits because bond-ing bills are especially difficult to pass if theyare too high or too low. \"It's just like a family budget, \" he said. \"Sometimes you need a repair. . . but you can 't always do them all in the same year. \" 16 February 4, 2000AT ISSUE: TRANSPORTATION # # # BY DAVID MAEDA AND MICHELLE KIBIGER Debate over light-rail transit will likely flare up during the 2000 session, in light of a cost-benefit analysis and a legislator 's lawsuit against Gov. Jesse Ventura and hisadministration. Several committee hearings held during the interim may have set the tone for the debate,with lawmakers and administration officialsclashing verbally over strategies for publictransportation. In addition, some legislators see light-rail transit as a metropolitan issue that conflictswith other transportation needs in GreaterMinnesota. They 're concerned that the light- rail project is going to eat up the money forhighways in need of repair elsewhere. \"The lives we 're going to trade away in my district for a train to nowhere is completelyunacceptable, \" said Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind. - Owatonna) at a hearing of the House StateGovernment Finance committee Nov. 15. (U.S.Highway 14, which statistics show is one ofthe more dangerous roads in the state, runsthrough Reuter 's district. Many in southern Minnesota want state funds to improve thehighway.) Officials from the Minnesota Department of Transportation presented a cost-benefitanalysis of the Hiawatha Corridor light-railtransit project at the November meeting. The rail line will include stops along Hiawatha Avenue between downtown Minne-apolis, the University of Minnesota campus,the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Air-port, and the Mall of America. Current esti-mates say the project will cost about $548million to construct, with much of the fund-ing coming from the federal government. According to the Transportation Depart- ment cost-benefit study, which includes op-erating, maintenance, and other costs upthrough 2028, the project will cost $765 mil-lion. The benefit gained is estimated at $379million. Therefore, the state will likely spend twice as much as it gets in benefit from the project,according to the study. Benefits include saved time, reduced vehicleBumpy ride The long, sometimes strange debate over light-railtransit continues at the Capitol and the courthouse and bus accidents, and lower auto emissions,as well as reduced infrastructure expenses andlower parking and vehicle ownership costsbased on the assumption that more people willlive within the urban core because of the trans-portation options available. The Legislature has provided $100 million for the project, or roughly 20 percent of theoverall construction cost. The federal govern-ment will pay for 50 percent, and the remain-ing 30 percent will come from HennepinCounty and the Metropolitan Airports Com-mission. The controversy regarding the project stems from steadily increasing cost estimates for lightrail. When the Legislature first considered theproject in 1998, cost estimates were $401 mil-lion, said Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) atthe November hearing. Last session, costs wereestimated at $446 million. Now, officials say,it will cost $538 million to build the light-railline. State law requires that when any project costs more than $5 million to construct, itmust undergo a cost-benefit analysis and thebenefit must outweigh the cost. If the projectdoes not achieve at least a one-to-one ratio,then the project will notgo forward, unless thegovernor finds that theproject is the most effec-tive way to achieve a pre-scribed goal. After the study was completed, Transporta-tion Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg sent aletter, dated Oct. 28, 1999, to Gov. JesseVentura asking him to deem the project as themost effective way to begin developing a re-gional multi-faceted transportation infra-structure, including both buses and trains. Ventura has signed a letter saying he agrees that it is. Nevertheless, members of the committee expressed their concerns about the project andits trend toward higher costs. Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview) said he is concerned that the Transportation Departmenthas not been forthcoming with information.Bob Winter, an engineer with the Transpor- tation Department, testified that throughoutthe process, officials have been giving legisla-tors project estimates in 1997 dollars to main-tain consistency. In other words, inflation andother factors that increase costs were not fig-ured in until now. Krinkie 's concern about the lack of open- ness and information regarding the projectprompted him to file a lawsuit in RamseyCounty, demanding that the governor andCommissioner Tinklenberg comply with thestate law. Krinkie, chair of the State Government Finance Committee, filed the lawsuit as a citi-zen, not in his capacity as a legislator. In thesame capacity, several other lawmakers havesigned on to the lawsuit, filed Dec. 29, 1999.They are paying for the legal expenses out oftheir own pockets. Despite the controversy over the Hiawatha project, many legislators say it 's a worthy idea to pursue. \"The only problem with the project is that we're probably doing it 20 years too late, \" said Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) at the Novem-ber hearing. Kahn also said other cities are leading the way in using light rail to cut congestion. It 's only a matter of time before Minnesota shouldbe considering a system that serves the entiremetropolitan area, she said. But lawmakers have also heard from sev- eral light-rail critics, including Jonathan Richmond of the Kennedy School of Govern- ment at Harvard University, who summarizedhis 18-month study of light-rail projects acrossthe country at the Dec. 7 meeting of Krinkie 's committee. Richmond said research shows most light- rail projects are built without proper study ofalternatives and proceed with little assessmentin how the rail systems perform. In the projectshe examined, Richmond told lawmakers, lightrail has made little contribution to total tran- \"It is time to demystify this and separate the myth from the facts.\" \u2014Jonathan Richmond of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University Continued on page 31Session Weekly 17BY CHRIS VETTER The farming sector in Minnesota has adopted biotechnology, or genetic engineering, as a nec-essary way to produce a higher yield and pre-vent insects from destroying the crops. But questions over whether genetically al- tered foods are safe and healthy linger in theminds of many consumers. Two doctors familiar with biotechnology discussed the issue Feb. 2 for the first event inthe annual Capitol Forum series at the Min-nesota History Center. House and Senatemembers were invited to listen to the discus-sion and ask questions. Dr. Michael J. Phillips, executive director for the Food & Agriculture Biotechnology Indus-try Organization, said genetically altered foodis completely safe. Currently, 75 to 80 percentof processed food is bio-engineered, he said. Phillips said legislators must base any billPOLICY # # # Bread & butter issues Biotechnology experts debate safety of geneticallyaltered foods as part of Capitol Forum series include enhanced nutritional value \u2014 more vitamin A or iron \u2014 or exclude allergenic sub- stances, making the food safe for people whohave allergies, Phillips said. While Phillips touted the products as a breakthrough for farmers and safe for con-sumers, Dr. Rebecca Goldburg from the En-vironmental Defense Fund, questioned thepotential unintended side effects of biologi-cally engineered foods. She referred to a May1999 Time article, which detailed how pollen from a genetically-altered plant was killing cat-erpillars. \"With biotechnology, we 're bringing in lots of new things that have never been in the foodsupply, \" Goldburg said. \"Regulatory decision- making cannot be just about science. Andthat's where the value of constituents come in. \" Goldburg said she expects constituents will prompt lawmakers to propose food-labeling\"I can assure you . . . if we did not have ac- cess to this biotechnology, our bad year thisyear would have been even worse, \" Phillips said. \"Farmers are very eager to have access to those products. \" Goldburg countered, saying the genetically altered crops don 't do Minnesota farmers any good if foreign markets like Japan or Europerefuse to buy them out of fear. Phillips said much of the fear in Europe is unfounded. He said Europe does not have anequivalent to the Food and Drug Administra-tion, and that those nations have been hit bybad foods, like beef tainted by the so-called\"Mad Cow Disease, \" which have made people unnecessarily leery. Goldburg questioned whether biotechnol- ogy foods from foreign countries could bedangerous for Americans. Phillips said thereis no need to worry. \"No country can import food into our country that is any less safe than what we havein our country, by law, \" he said. There is a potential harmful side effect to the environment as well as to people,Goldburg said. For instance, genetic cropscould cross-pollinate with adjacent naturalplants. Goldburg fears weeds or insects couldbecome resistant to the altered gene. Phillips said cross-pollination is not a con- cern because pollen from corn only travels afew feet, so it is not spreading to other fields. Many legislators spoke highly of the forum. Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel) said genetics in foodis nothing new. \"This provides information to help legisla- tors relate to the issues and understand theissues, \" Ness said. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) said many people believe this is just a rural issue,but he had many people talk about biotech-nology at a recent town meeting. \"People in the suburbs are interested in what type of food comes out of Greater Min-nesota, \" Chaudhary said. \"We legislators have only gotten the first taste of this huge topic. \" Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters), a farmer, questioned whose scientific results the legis-lators should listen to. He said the genetic in-dustries are far ahead of universities inproviding information on genetics. The forum was sponsored by the Blandin Foundation and leadership of both the Houseand the Senate. A second forum about bio-medicine policies will be held Feb. 9 at theMinnesota History Center. proposals on facts, not fears from constituents. \"Y ou must begin with a foundation, \" Phillips said. \"And that foundation must be science. \" Biotechnology is the scientific manipulation of living organisms at the molecular geneticlevel, according to a summary report. Com-mon biotechnology products include a strainof corn resistant to the European corn borer,which eats the corn stalk, and soybeans thatare resistant to commercially producedherbicides. Future genetically altered foods couldlegislation for biotechnology foods. Phillips said such a measure is unnecessary. If a com-pany thought it would be profitable to labelfood as non-altered, it would do so, Phillipssaid. Goldburg strongly disagreed, noting that all ingredients in food are listed. \"Y ou can read all the things, \" she said. \"People want to know what is in their food. It's a problem. \" However, Phillips contended that genetics has helped farmers cope with the lagging ag-ricultural economy.Dr. Michael Phillips (left), from the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, ofthe Environmental Defense Fund, debate the merits of genetically engineered crops.18 February 4, 2000HISTORY BY JON FUREIn the 1930s, proposals to reduce the size of the Minnesota Legislature were among the many ideas to help the state copewith the Great Depression. While the nationwide economic problems of that erainfluenced Nebraska 's switch to a unicameral Legislature, the concept didn 't catch on in Minnesota.Is less more? The long history of the unicameral issue in Minnesota includes a Depression-era pushby a third-party maverick Gov. Floyd B. Olson, a member of the Farmer-Labor party, advocated the switch toa unicameral Legislature in his 1935 inaugu-ral address. \"I am heartily in favor of a unicameral Leg- islature and I recommend that you submit aproposal to the people of the state for the establishment of that form of Legislature witha maximum membership, \" Olson said, sound- ing something like the current occupant of thegovernor 's mansion. But Olson, who was himself a third-party in- surgent, made his advocacy of a unicameral leg-islature seem like merely a polite suggestion. \"During past sessions of the Legislature many mem-bers of those bodies have in-formed me that the work ofthe Legislature is very diffi-cult because of the excessivenumber of members in bothHouses, \" he said. \"Accepting that as an exist- ing fact, I hope I am notoverbold in suggesting toyou that in a program of re-duction in the agencies ofgovernment by you, yourattention should first be di-rected toward reduction inthe numbers of your ownmembership. \" The debate of the 1930s was just a part of the issue 's complex history in Minne-sota and elsewhere. Whetherthe public is better served bya one-house legislature is aquestion that has been con-sidered long before Minne-sota became a state.Olson saw a move toward unicameralism as part of a larger effort to increase the effi- ciency of government. He urged the Legisla-ture to examine the structure of governmentcarefully. \"There will be bills introduced in this session of the Legislature for the purpose of either re-ducing or abolishing various state departmentsand bureaus, \" Olson said. \"You have my assur- ance that I will cooperate with you in every wayin such an endeavor, where no useful public ser-vice is crippled or eliminated. \" Although the governor supported a one- house legislature, it wasn 't at the top of his list of proposed reforms. Instead, Olson urged the Legislature to in- crease relief appropriations for drought-stricken farmers and unemployed people. Healso advocated redistributing wealth by re-forming the tax system. Blaming large industries for the Depression, Olson sought to increase taxes on iron ore,chain stores, and other industries. Olson also said that the cause of the Depression was not overproduction, but thatmassive unemployment and low wages forcommon laborers had led to \"under- consumption. \" \"We believe in restoring prosperity by re- storing the purchasing power of the men atthe bottom, \" Olson said. In the 1935 Legislative Session, a few bills were introduced that would have changed theLegislature from two chambers to one, butnone of those bills made it to Olson 's desk. One such proposal, sponsored by Rep. JohnW. Cox of Becker and Rep. John J. White ofOgilvie, sought to create a one-house Legisla-ture composed of an equal number of menand women. In the early days of Minnesota 's statehood, leaders chose a bicameral system because of its success elsewhere, according to The Debates and Proceedings of the Minnesota Constitu-tional Convention , an 1857 report by Francis H. Smith. Minnesota 's T erritorial Legislature in the 1850s was patterned after Wisconsin 's bicam- eral system, one that had prevailed in all otherstates at that time. In fact, the state 's early leaders did not de- vote much energy to other models for the Leg-islature. They focused on the pressing mattersof resolving statehood issues on the thresholdof the Civil War. Photo by Robert M. Fraser, from The Political Career of Floyd B. Olson , by George H. Mayer, 1951.Gov. Floyd B. Olson, a popular speaker among students, addresses a crowd at the University of Minnesota.# # #Session Weekly 19Congress gave the Minnesota T erritory per- mission to become a state in 1857. Minnesotanswere concerned with all of the nationwide ques-tions surrounding the threat of war, as well asbasic questions with becoming a state, such asdetermining the state 's boundaries, choosing the site of the state capital, and designating publiclands for railroads and a university. But even before statehood, the state 's two major political parties were jockeying for theright to control the Legislature. Even thougha slight majority of Republicans had beenelected, both parties alleged the other com-mitted election fraud. Delegates from both parties met July 13, 1857, in St. Paul to write the state 's constitu- tion. But each party refused to recognize theother, so they organized separately and eachparty wrote a separate state constitution. However, neither side disputed the idea of a two-house system. Both constitutions speci-fied there would be both a House of Repre-sentatives and a Senate. There were other differences between the two documents, but the two sides ultimatelyworked them out to form the state 's first con- stitution, and Congress approved Minnesota 's statehood May 11, 1858. The makeup of state legislatures proved tobe a fundamental question during the form- ing of the United States. Most colonies wereinfluenced by the two-chamber system ofBritish Parliament, where one chamber rep-resented a wealthier class than the other cham-ber that represented the common people,according to The Unicameral Legislature , a 1938 book by Alvin W. Johnson. However, Pennsylvania and Delaware had unicameral Legislatures as colonies, and they re-mained so after the United States was born. Thepractice was short-lived, though, as both statesswitched to bicameral legislatures by 1790. Vermont also was admitted as a state with a unicameral legislature in 1791, but it switchedto a bicameral system in 1835. Georgia had a bicameral Legislature as a colony, and then it switched to unicameralafter it ratified the U.S. Constitution. But likePennsylvania and Delaware, Georgia adopteda new state constitution in 1790 that made theLegislature bicameral. Many related issues influenced those changes. The rapid increase of immigrants in each state caused larger cities to be disproportion-ately represented compared to rural areas.Voting districts were re-apportioned to reflectthe changing populations, and the two-cham-ber concept was designed to foster good law-making decisions while accommodating thevolatile electorate.Members in one chamber, for example, would be elected to longer terms than mem-bers of the other body. Then the chamber withlonger terms would, in theory, make decisionswith a great focus on statewide impact. In some states, members of that \"upper \" chamber, as the House of Lords in British Par-liament was sometimes called, would be ap-pointed instead of elected, or would be electedon an at-large basis instead of by district.Members of the other \"lower \" chamber would serve shorter terms, and each member wouldbe chiefly concerned with the needs of hisparticular district. Also, the right to vote and to run for public office in some states was only given to menbased on the amount of land they owned. Inmany states, two chambers had different eli-gibility rules based on land ownership, so thateach chamber would be responsive to a dif-ferent social class. Proponents of a unicameral Legislature brought in the best advocate they could find \u2014 former NebraskaCongressman George Norris, who led the successful ini-tiative campaign to change the Nebraska Legislaturefrom two chambers to one in 1934. Well, it wasn't the real Norris who came to St. Paul. It was current Nebraska state Sen. David Landis, a histori-cal reenactor who has served in his state' s unicameralLegislature since 1978. Landis, decked out in period dress, played the role of Norris during a Feb. 1 event at the Capitol. And he ex-plained the virtues of a one-house system. \"I believed it would be simpler for the voters to fol- low,\" he said. \"They could see and understand what theirelected officials were doing on their behalf and how suc-cessful they were.\" Under the bicameral system in Nebraska, conference committees were used as a convenient excuse for law-makers who were trying to halt bills that were popularwith their constituents but were opposed by lobbyinggroups with a lot of money, Landis said. It allowed lawmakers to tell their constituents, \"We did the right thing,\" only to have the bill die in the con-ference committee. Nebraska's initiative and referendum laws were a cru- cial factor in the state's switch to a unicameral model.Those laws allow citizens to place proposed changes instate law on the ballot. According to Landis, Norris \"wore out two sets of tires\" while driving around the state urging voters to supportthe unicameral initiative. During the campaign at that time, Norris told audi- ences that the two-chamber system of U.S. Congress wasdesigned as a compromise between large and smallstates, but that the model doesn't serve a purpose onthe state level. Nebraska voters approved the initiative by nearlyNebraskan gets into the actIn Virginia, for example, Thomas Jefferson objected to the state 's system because no differ- ence was apparent in the two chambers of thestate legislature. Both chambers served the sameelectorate, which he said was \"superfluous. \" That same argument lies at the heart of today 's unicameral debate. The current Minnesota system is set up so that membersof the House and Senate represent the samedistricts. The senator represents all 66,000people in the district and two House mem-bers split those constituents. In Minnesota 's recent history, questions about the purpose of the bicameral system andabout the size of the Legislature have oftenbeen debated. But none of those proposalshave passed the Legislature or been put be-fore voters. Historical reenactor and Nebraska stateSen. David Landis performs a program onthe history of the unicameral Legislature inhis state. 93,000 votes. The system seems to be there to stay,Landis said, because no initiative has yet been placedon the ballot to switch back to a bicameral legislature.20 February 4, 2000If all your news about today 's youth culture came through the mass media, you would think the kids are only interested in trading Pokemon cards, listening to Britney Spears, and learning history by watching Regis Philbin 's \"Who Wants T o Be A Millionaire? \"Hands-on government Program gives students a chance to see the legislative process from the inside But as the participants of the YMCA 's Y outh in Government program prove, there areplenty of students also interested in deepersocietal issues. Nearly 1,500 high school students from throughout the state participated in a modellegislative session Jan. 13-16. The program,which begins in the fall, teaches the studentsthe nuts and bolts of the lawmaking process\u2014 from participating in mock caucuses, to holding committee hearings, to passing billson the House and Senate floors. Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer used the model session to stress the importance of get-ting involved at an early age and staying involved. \"The Constitution says we have a govern- ment of the people, \" she said. \"You are the people. Therefore, you are the government. Itis your government, and it is important tomake a life long commitment. \" Reg Pelowski, who was elected by his peers to serve as the speaker of the House, said thatone of the most beneficial outcomes in his fiveyears in the Y outh in Government program isthat his perspective on issues and his point ofview have been broadened. \"Most of the people in my neighborhood have views that are similar to my own, \" he said. \"It's been great to get to work with people with different points of view from all over the state. \" Pelowski, who is from White Bear Lake, is the nephew of Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona). The younger Pelowski said thatwhile he isn 't sure he wants to follow his uncle into politics, his experience has prompted himto want to learn more. He plans to studypolitical science in college next year. Pelowski said the students work hard on researching the topics for their bills and thatthe program tends to attract the more seriousstudents. \"We get to meet a lot of great people here, \" he said.

Lindquist said that during the nine years he has participated in the program he recalls acouple of student bills that led to actual(State Targeting Accessible Recreation Trails), is well underway. According to the DNR, about65 state trails have been surveyed. Work on aportion of the Old Logging Trail in Wild RiverState Park measuring 2.6 miles has been com-pleted. Design work for building accessibletrails has begun in six other state parks includ-ing Jay Cooke and William O 'Brien. This year students saw a variety of areas to examine and highlight. Among them were thestate 's abortion laws, a publicly funded base- ball stadium, and animal protection laws. While many of the bills have local implica- tions a few attempted to address broader so-cial issues. Rich Ahn, a Hastings student, said he re- searched a bill in Michigan to help him come upwith his proposal to make it mandatory thatwelfare recipients be drug-tested to remain eli-gible for benefits. Ahn said that as he researchedthe topic he became more and more convincedof the importance of finding ways to break thepoverty cycle in this country. Lindquist said that it is refreshing to see the students come in with a determination to learnhow they can participate in the process tomake a real difference.

THE STATES50 Lawyers and officials in several states are keeping a close eye oncourt rulings regarding \"right tofarm\" laws that could change thelandscape of rural America. Last February, the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to hear a case fromIowa that overturned the state's\"right to farm\" statute. The Iowa Su-preme Court ruled the statute un-constitutional. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, states across the country enacted\"right-to-farm\" laws in response topressures caused by suburbansprawl. The laws were meant to protect farms by offering them a qualifieddefense to nuisance lawsuits byneighbors who objected to thesmells and noise generated by farm-ing activities.Right to farm? Iowa case could put farmers in legal bind In 1998, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that by uniformly protectingfarmers from lawsuits, the law dimin-ished the value of neighbors' land, al-lowing the taking of land withoutpayment. The court reasoned that the Iowa statute created what amounted toeasements because it gave agricul-tural operations the right to do thingsthat could affect neighboring land-owners. The law also prohibited those land- owners from bringing a legal actionagainst the agricultural operation, thecourt said. That meant Iowa farmscould create a nuisance and neigh-bors could take no legal action. The U.S. Supreme Court justices without comment refused to reviewthe decision. Agricultural groups have said thatsimilar \"right to farm\" laws in other states could now be invalidated. Theprecedent set by the Iowa rulingcould stand because the SupremeCourt refused to review the case. Some experts say the issue could heat up as more and more peoplemove to the fringes of suburbia andinto rural areas, without thinkingahead about their farming neigh-bors. Conflict between livestock pro- ducers and neighboring residents isincreasing in many areas. New resi-dential homeowners sometimes findthe noise and odors produced bylivestock operations offensive. Pro-ducers often feel that pressure tochange their practices is unjust, inpart because it comes from relativelynew residents of their communities.*Bill introductions fromFeb. 3 were not available whenthis issue went to press.

He said supporters of light rail often base their support on the colorful role trains andstreet cars played in the nation 's history. \"It is time to demystify this and separate the myth fromthe facts, \" he said. Richmond said the politi-cal debate ac-companying this decision making detractsfrom the facts. He said rather than politi-cizing the process lawmakers should look atthe most cost-effective ways to improvetransportation systems, which usually in-cludes improving existing bus service.

O'T oole described the \"disease \" as spend- ing hun- dreds of million of dollars on \"Disneyland- like rides \" that produce no benefit to communities.

Medicare, a federal program that provides health coverage for seniors and people withsevere disabilities, does not cover prescriptiondrugs. The state program was created to tryto fill that void. Under the terms of Abeler's bill, Medicare enrollees, regardless of age, would be eligiblefor the state's drug program. That means dis-abled people onMedicare whoare under theage of 65 couldtake part in theprogram. The bill also would double theasset limit allow-able to$8,000 and onecar without it be-ing counted to-ward the assetlimit. The bill would set a sliding enrollment fee for individuals a cer-tain percentage above the federal poverty level. Currently, only people whose income is up to 120 percent of the federal poverty guidelines areeligible. Under the bill, a sliding fee would be assessed for people whose income is between 120percent and 300 percent of the guidelines. (Pov-erty guidelines vary based on the size of a house-hold and income levels. The 1999 poverty levelfor a for a single person is $8,240.) Abeler's bill comes at a time when public outcry over the high prices for senior prescrip-tion drugs is significant. In recent months,several local and national media reports havetold of seniors traveling to countries such asCanada and Mexico to purchase drugs at acheaper rate than they would have to pay inthe United States. Abeler said something needs to be done so seniors in Minnesota can afford to pay for pre-scriptions and still have money left over forliving expenses. Lawmakers in Minnesota are not alone in grappling with concerns about how to help se-niors pay for prescription drugs. PresidentClinton, the U.S. Congress, and most state leg-islatures are attempting to tackle the problemas well. Prescription drug plans now place among the top five priorities in more states than ever be-fore, according to analysts with the NationalConference of State Legislature's Health Care Program in Denver. So far, 29 states have senior pharmaceutical assistance programs on their legislative agen-das for 2000, according to the organization'sresearch. Sixteen states currently have\"I have been prescribed Nuerontin, which helps dull some of the sharp pain that I feel inthe side of my head because of the MS, \" sheexplained in testimony submitted to theHouse Health and Human Services PolicyCommittee. \"I do not take this drug as pre-scribed because I can't afford the $37 permonth co-pay.\" Grove would benefit from a plan to make the state's current senior prescription drugprogram available to more people, includingdisabled Minnesotans on Medicare. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), was approved Feb. 8 by the com-mittee. Abeler's bill would expand eligibility for the senior drug program by removing the age limitfor recipients, doubling the limit on financialassets, and increasing the income limit to 300percent of the federal poverty guidelines. Themeasure also proposes to change the name ofthe state's senior drug program to simply the\"prescription drug program.\" The existing program, which began in Janu- ary 1999, has seen enrollment far short of pro-jections. A significant portion of the moneyallocated to the program remains unspent,according to the Department of Human Ser-vices. That has opened the door for proposalsto expand eligibility. Abeler said his bill (HF1769) would provide the opportunity to receive aid to many morepeople in serious need. Members of the committee heard about how many seniors and people with disabili-ties who do not currently qualify are beingoverwhelmed by prescriptions costs. \"We believe there are a lot of seniors, and even non-seniors in a traditional sense, that could behelped by this program, enabling them to per- Bebe Rahman, right , of South Metro Human Services in St. Paul, testifies on behalf of Beatrice Anderson, who is mentally disabled, about the difficulty and costs ofkeeping her client on the medications she needs each day. A bill under consider-ation this year would include physically and mentally disabled people in a programthat helps senior citizens pay for drugs.4 February 11, 2000If the Cold War had erupted into a nuclear battle, Minnesota's governor would not have been at a loss for words. His response had been carefully scripted in advance. A 1971 report prepared by the Civil De- fense Division of the Minnesota Depart- ment of Public Safety included step-by-step instructions for the governor and other top state officials. Scripts for emergency proclamations by the governor also were drafted and incor- porated into the report. The first such message began, \"This is Gov. Wendell Anderson of Minnesota. I have announcements of the utmost grav- ity. Please listen carefully for the next few minutes. The information you hear may save your life and will help preserve this nation. \" Those words were meant to be transmit- ted on the Emergency Broadcast System if diplomatic efforts had broken down dur- ing an escalating international crisis. The roughly three-minute statement would have concluded with the following directive: \"T o all citizens, I appeal again. Prepare to take shelter. Listen to your ra- dio. Follow the instructions of your civil defense authorities so you and your neigh- bors may survive this emergency. \" The announcement to be made next, if a nuclear battle was under way, was brief and blunt. \"This is Gov. Wendell Anderson of Min- nesota. Y ou have just heard the attack warning signals that you [should] imme- diately take shelter from the threat of en- emy attack,\" the script began. \"Under the Minnesota Constitution and state laws, I now officially declare a state of civil defense emergency in Minnesota.\" The scripts were just a part of a 33-page document called the Governor's Manual for Civil Defense Emergencies . The plan now reads like a relic from a different time. The end of the Cold War has helped fears of nuclear war to fade from the forefront of the public's consciousness, but in the early 1970s, the threat of such violence seemed very real and urgent. The report laid out three \"readiness IT'SAFACT Just in case State prepared response to nuclear attack conditions \" \u2014 or levels of threat \u2014 and prescribed the appropriate responses at each level. At the final step, when \"hostile action \" was imminent or already occurring on this continent, things would have gotten very serious in the governor 's office. The first thing the governor was advised to do at such a time was to move to an \"Emergency Operating Center, \" where he could then oversee the state 's response to the crisis. Eight operating centers were listed in the document. The primary one was to be located in the sub-basement of the Capi- tol, but at the time the report was issued, no such facilities existed in the building. An alternate Capitol complex location \u2014 in the Transportation Building \u2014 was listed. Other designated centers were scat- tered around the state, in case the gover- nor was traveling when trouble arose. Instructions in the report called for the governor to immediately issue notice of a special session of the Legislature, if law- makers were not in session at the time. The special session would have convened within 30 days, presumably as soon as it was safe and otherwise feasible, accord- ing to the document. The report also included the line of suc- cession to the governor 's office. The list was eight people deep \u2014 from the lieu- tenant governor to the president of the Senate and on down \u2014 to assure that ev- eryone would know who was next in line. And the governor 's office wasn 't the only one to receive such treatment. The report also listed the line of succession for the director of the Civil Defense Division, the chief of the Highway Patrol, and other officials in similarly important positions. Little attention was paid to the rank- and-file of the governor 's staff. Their in- structions were short and to the point. If a crisis developed, they would have been required to secure all documents of \"major consequence. \" Then they would have been told to fend for themselves, ac- cording to their \"personal or family sur- vival plans. \"programs to assist low-income seniors in pay- ing for prescription drugs. Four of those states\u2014 North Carolina, Nevada, Delaware, and Maine \u2014 either expanded or adopted their subsidy programs last year. Drug assistance plans on state legislative agendas this year mostly fall under three cat-egories: bulk-purchasing arrangements, directprice controls, and subsidies. Two other states join Minnesota in having current plans moving through the Legislature.Last week, the Kentucky House considered abill to create such a plan. In the Virginia As-sembly, Democrats have also proposed subsi-dizing drugs for the elderly. Amid the abundance of plans to aid seniors in purchasing prescription drugs remains thequestion: Are 50 state plans better than onefederal solution? According to the AmericanAssociation of Retired Persons (AARP), it 's not an either-or situation. The organization saysboth levels of government must work togetherto ensure adequate coverage for seniors. Several groups that represent retired people and elderly Americans testified at the Feb. 8hearing. \"There 's the idea that the programs in the states diminish the need for federal Medicarebenefits, \" said Cheryl Matheis, director of state legislation for the AARP . \"Programs in the states aren 't going to be able to do the kinds of things that Medicare can do. \" Jeff Trewhitt, spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said histrade group would prefer a solution at the na-tional level rather than on a state-by-state basis. \"Doing business is difficult enough. If you've got 50 different laws, you 've got a po- tential nightmare, \" Trewhitt said. Many state legislatures disagree, however, and, like Minnesota, are active in creating so-lutions on their own instead of waiting forCongress to act. Doug Davis, spokesperson for the Minne- sota chapter of AARP , said data collected bythe agency shows that three out of five seniorsin the state need to buy prescription drugs andthat drugs can cost seniors an average of about$300 a month. \"We strongly support this bill and are very pleased that it proposes to raise the asset limitto allow more seniors to become eligible, \" Davis said. Abeler 's bill received the approval of the House Health and Human Services Policy Committeeand was referred to the House Health and Hu-man Services Finance Committee. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), chair of the finance panel, said his committee might notbe able to support all measures called for in thebill, given the financial constraints placed uponthe committee in a non-budget year. Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 4 - 1 0 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #AGRICULTURE Feedlot fines forgiven Feedlot operators issued fines by counties for environmental violations would receive abreak if violators use a large portion of thefine to correct theproblem, under abill approved Feb. 9by the percent imposedon a feedlot be for-given if the opera-tor of the lot putsthe money towardwork to mitigatethe violation or forother environmen-tal improvements. The bill would especially help op-erators of smallfeedlots who hap-pen upon bad luck,Ness explained. Rep. T ed Winter (DFL-Fulda) expressed concern that under thebill repeat offenders would continue receiv-ing breaks as long as they could demonstratemoney was being used in some fashion forenvironmental improvements. \"I worry that we 'd be encouraging lot op- erators to allow violations to occur again andagain if they 're able to continue to avoid stiff penalties simply by making improvements tothe lot, \" Winter said. Ness said it would be feasible to amend the bill later to make certain that repeat violatorspay the full amount of the penalty. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Policy Commit-tee for review. A hold on feedlot rules A bill that would temporarily halt the Min- nesota Pollution Control Agency 's proposed changes to the state 's animal feedlot rulesreceived the approval of the House Agricul- ture Policy Committee on Feb. 9. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bob Westfall (R-Rothsay), would mandate that the agency 's new feedlot rules could not be implementedor enforced before July 1, 2001. Doing sowould allow legislators more time to speakwith lot operators and address concerns thatmany farmers in rural Minnesota already haveabout the proposed changes, Westfall said. Roger Gilland, a beef producer in southern Minnesota, said he feels it 's unfair that feed- lots keep getting the blame in cases of waterpollution. Often, he said, it 's wildlife or out- side sources that pollute area rivers andstreams. Gilland proposed eliminating feedlot per- mit fees for large lots and stated \"more rules don't necessarily mean more environmental protection. \" Westfall said delaying changes to feedlot rules is necessary. \"I find, and many others find, the proposed rule changes to be controversial, hard to readand difficult to understand, \" he said. But Gary Pulford, feedlot manager for the Pollution Control Agency, said a revision ofthe rules has been a long time coming. Cur-rent state rules governing feedlots are 20 yearsold, he said. \"A lot of work has been done within the agency over the past 10 months to get the rulesto the point where they are now, \" said Pulford. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Policy Commit-tee for consideration. Alcohol by air mail Whether Minnesotans should be allowed to have alcohol shipped directly to their homeswas discussed at a Feb. 8 hearing of the HouseCommerce Committee 's Liquor Subcommit- tee. Under current law, it is illegal to have beer and liquor shipped directly to your house. There is an exemption to the ban, in what 's known as the \"wine reciprocity law, \" allowing a person to receive up to two cases of winefrom a winery per year. This exemption wasput into place to allow people to order winefrom wineries that don 't sell their products via retail outlets.The state has a three-tiered system separat- ing manufacturing, wholesaling, and retailingof alcoholic beverages that was established af-ter Prohibition. At the time, officials thoughtthat integrating the three tiers would lead toaggressive promotion of alcohol, which in turnwould lead to excessive consumption. Jim Farrell, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Li- censed Beverage Association and the MinnesotaWine and Spirits Wholesale Association, said thatbecause alcohol can be a dangerous substance,the state shouldn 't change the direct shipments laws making alcohol more available for youngpeople to obtain. \"It's a public safety issue, \" Farrell said. \"Why make it easy to purchase beer and spirits? \" Farrell said that the one-on-one interaction with a clerk while purchasing alcohol is im-portant to keep people under 21 from drink-ing. He said the state needs to collect moredata to stay ahead of the increasing impact theInternet has on our economy. Russell Turner, a biomedical researcher, said because youth prefer instant gratification, re-laxing direct shipment laws is unlikely to havea significant impact on underage drinking inthe state. Felony penalty for multiple DWI Stiffer drunken driving laws could have pre- vented David Rossini from ultimately killinganother person behind the wheel. \"It was not enough for me to lose my li- cense, \" Rossini of St. Paul told the House Crime Prevention Committee on Feb. 10. \"I drove anyways. \" Rossini testified in favor of a bill (HF2745) that would make a person 's fourth DWI con- viction in a 10-year span a felony. The committee approved the bill. It now goes to the House Judiciary Finance Committee. Fines, even jail time, did not stop Rossini from drinking and driving. He said he had hisfirst DWI in 1979, followed by another in 1989.But the third offense landed him in jail. Thatcame in 1993, when he was driving drunkwhen he killed another person. \"By the time someone has repeat DWIs like I did, it is clear the person has a problem, \" Rossini said. \"I never said, 'T onight, I 'm going to kill someone with my truck. '\" Drunken driving laws are not working, says Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), 10 DFL) Scope: Oversees state agriculture policy, pro- grams, and regulations.Reviews legislationregarding the regulationand inspection of farmpesticides, food to en-courage best manage-ment Overseesthe Department of Agri-culture.

Repeat offenders continue to amass DWI convictions, but never receivemore than a gross misdemeanor conviction. The bill would provide a mandatory sen- tence of five to seven years in prison, but ajudge could reduce the sentence to six monthsin jail or in the workhouse, coupled with in-tensive supervision, including alcohol moni-toring. If the offender then violates theprovisions of the reduced sentence, he or shewould go to prison. Stanek, a Minneapolis police officer, says Min- nesota must join the other 35 states that havefelony-level offenses for drunken driving. Minnesota has \"revolving door defendants \" who are unaffected by the current conse-quences of drunken driving, Stanek contends,which is why the stronger penalties are desired. Another law change would alter the DWI forfeiture provision, allowing officers to seizea vehicle not owned by the violator if thevehicle 's owner knew that the person did not have a license. Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar said there are 102 people in that county with10 or more drunken driving violations. \"We want them to know, 'Keep this up and you will go to prison. ' That message is not out there now, \" Klobuchar said. Stanek did not estimate the bill 's cost to theEasing up on clerks A proposal to reduce the criminal penalty for selling tobacco to minors approved Feb. 4by the House Crime Prevention Committee. The bill (HF545), sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), would make selling to-bacco to minors a misdemeanor rather than agross misdemeanor. The maximum penalty for a gross misde- meanor is up to a year imprisonment and$3,000 fine. The maximum sentence for a mis-demeanor is 90 days imprisonment and a $700fine. \"It just seems to me that the gross misde- meanor is overstepping the bounds, \" Solberg said. \"It's over-punishment for a mistake. \" The bill would do nothing to change the law prohibiting people under 18 from purchasingtobacco and tobacco-related devices, such aspipes or tobacco papers. The proposal comes from constituents who are worried about the penalty leaving a scaron their record, Solberg said. The bill does notcome from the tobacco industry, he added. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) agreed that the gross misdemeanor penalty, originallypassed in 1989, is too harsh. \"We really did overdo this punishment, \" she said. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) questioned the measure, askingSolberg if reducing the penalty would giveteens easier access to tobacco. McGuire sug-gested the committee adopt an enhanced pen-alty for repeat offenders, but she did notpropose a formal amendment so committeemembers never voted on her proposal. Solberg favored the enhanced penalty that McGuire suggested. \"If someone is doing it three or four times, it's probably not inadvertent, \" he said. Larsen said stores are doing a better job of watching for minors. \"I don 't think (this bill) takes away from the emphasis on retailers or clerks, \" Larsen said. McGuire said it was not her intention to stop the bill from moving forward. \"I do know mistakes happen, \" McGuire said. \"We want the penalty to fit the crime. \" The bill now moves to the House floor. New penalty for supplying alcohol Supplying alcohol to people under age 21 should be allowed to be a cause of civil actionas well as criminal penalties, said Rep. PhilCarruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center). Carruthers is sponsoring a bill (HF2555)Restraining order bill advances A bill that would eliminate filing fee waiv- ers for restraining orders and give judges morediscretion in which cases they hear narrowlypassed the House Crime Prevention Commit-tee on Feb. 8. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) is sponsoring the bill (HF2516), which he said is advocatedby many judges in the state. Currently, low-income people can file a re- straining order and have the $120 fee waived.The bill would do away with such waivers. The committee approved the bill after de- nying an amendment that would have retainedthe fee waiver. David Rossini, who has been convicted three timesof DWI, testifies for a bill that would make a fourthconviction within 10 years a felony. Rossini's lastconviction in 1993 came after a crash that resultedin the death of another person. Rossini's testimonycame Feb. 10 before the Crime PreventionCommittee.state or counties, who would pay for most ofthe treatment and probation services.that would give people who were injured in any way by an underage drinker the option tosue the people who supplied the alcohol to thatoffender. \"There has just been huge problems with parents having parties and serving alcohol topeople under 21, then the kids cause seriousproblems later, \" Carruthers told the House Civil Law Committee on Feb. 9. The bill would pertain to people who do not have liquor licenses, so it would cover eventslike house parties. The bill would require thehost to make reasonable inquiries into the ageof any guests where alcohol is available. The legislation would still allow parents to serve their under-age children under 21 alco-hol in the confines of their own homes. But ifthe underage child is allowed to leave the homein an intoxicated state, that could be a causeof legal action. Carruthers said he does not subscribe to the notion that it is better to have children drinkat home rather than out with friends. How-ever, Carruthers said many adults do share al-cohol with their children, especially duringreligious activities. Several committee members said they liked the bill, but questioned some of its language.For instance, Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud)wondered about the phrase \"providing alco- hol\" and wondered if that could be miscon- strued as merely having alcohol in the house. T om Brockway of St. Paul, whose son was killed in a New Y ear 's Eve car crash in 1997, said the bill is needed. The accident occurredafter the boy left a party where alcohol hadbeen furnished by parents. \"A civil liability law . . . is certainly appro- priate. It would couple well with the criminalliability, \" Brockway said. \"If there 's civil liabil- ity, it 's not going to make anyone rich, but it will be one more thing to add as a deterrent. \" The committee decided to lay the bill over until Feb. 16.Session Weekly 7\"I'm shocked judges are complaining about workload, \" said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL- Mpls) after the amendment failed. \"It's like charging a fee for calling 911. \" Sue Dosal, state court administrator, said there are too many people abusing the system.The state began tracking restraining order fil-ings in 1992, when 4,800 were filed. The filingfee waiver was created in 1995. Last year, 8,800retaining orders were filed. Judge Gregg Johnson, who serves on the district court in Ramsey County, said he doesnot want to close the door on worthy filings,but he listed some examples of frivolous re-straining order cases, such as one that wasbased on name-calling. \"When I 'm spending half a day settling a case like that, it means a more serious case . . .can't get on the docket, \" Johnson said. The court spends a great deal of money in subpoenas and the time of a judge and staffon these unnecessary filings, he added. Skoglund and Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) questioned the statementsabout frivolous cases. \"I don 't take these as trivial, \" Skoglund said. \"I don 't take these examples as next to noth- ing.\" \"I think we 're doing victims a disservice, \" Paymar added. Paymar argued that proposed language stat- ing judges would not be required to hold ahearing when a matter has no merit would freeup judges ' time. The fee waiver could remain in the law, he said. Smith said his bill would affect only cases involving someone being stalked or harassedby a stranger and would not include restrain-ing orders filed in domestic abuse cases. The bill also would expand the definition of harassment to include a single incident thathas a \"significant adverse effect \" on the vic- tim. The current law requires repeated of-fenses. The bill now heads to the House Judiciary Finance Committee. #DEVELOPMENT Police seek training facilities Several proposals to fund regional training centers for law enforcement and fire person-nel were considered Feb. 8 by the House Judi-ciary Finance Committee. The committee plans to make recommen- dations on the proposals and pass them alongto the House Capital Investment Committeeas part of the judiciary bonding bill. Bonding requests for four training facilities were submitted, but Gov. Jesse V entura did notrecommend funding for any of them. A bill (HF2885) sponsored by Rep. RichStanek (R-Maple Grove) would appropriate $3.22 million for a grant for the training cen-ter in Maple Grove and $3.1 million for a grantto Richfield for the south metro trainingcenter. The Maple Grove center has been in opera- tion for police training since 1993. The moneywould help fund an expansion of existing fa-cilities to accommodate firefighter training. Ramsey and Washington counties requested $5 million for an east metro training center. Inaddition, about $20 million was requested for asoutheastern Minnesota facility in Rochester. Several law enforcement and fire personnel from the Rochester area said the project is es-pecially important because individual depart-ments don 't have the resources for specialized training. \"We need to beg and borrow certain busi- ness buildings to train, \" said Steve Denny, fire chief in Stewartville. The Rochester, Maple Grove, and Richfield facilities would all have indoor shootingranges and computer simulators for both po-lice situations and pursuit training. Forfirefighters, each facility would have a firetower for burn training and hazardous mate-rials training. The Rochester facility would also provide detention training for jail and prison staff. The Legislature still has to determine what is considered a matching grant under the pro-gram. Stanek 's bill would require municipali- ties to match state grants with non-state funds.The Department of Public Safety, which wouldoversee the grant programs, has said spend-ing on existing facilities does not count towardthe matching funds. Hennepin County Sheriff Patrick McGowan said that if the state does not count the moneythe county and the city of Maple Grove havealready spent, then the county will turn downany state money. Jail plan pitched Several groups proposing regional jail fa- cilities made presentations to the House Judi-ciary Finance Committee Feb. 10. The committee plans to discuss all the pro- posals and make provisions for the ones theychoose in one bill (HF2890), sponsored byRep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada). The groups submitting proposals for state bonds primarily represent smaller counties inGreater Minnesota. Gary Waller, former sher-iff of St. Louis County who consulted for fourof the groups, said it 's important for the state to invest in regional jail facilities because statesentencing requirements contribute to thegrowth in jail populations over the years. The regional jail concept merely allows forsmaller counties that have small jails or no jail the option to build a regional facility under ajoint powers agreement. Officials say the re-gional jails cut operating and transportationcosts. They also say more programs are avail-able for inmates, because it 's more cost-effec- tive to provide them. Scott Arneson, administrator for Aitkin County, said the central Minnesota project,involving six counties currently, would pro-vide chemical dependency treatment, adultbasic education, anger management training,sentence-to-serve, work release, and otherfunctions that are simply too expensive on acounty-by-county basis. He also explained that the numbers of in- mates the counties need to house in their fa-cilities continue to grow beyond their capacity.And rural areas have a much more limited taxbase to help pay for their growing needs. Several projects have been proposed includ- ing cooperative efforts for central Minnesota,southeastern Minnesota, Tri-County jail innorthwestern Minnesota, Ramsey CountyRegional Jail, south central Minnesota, andsouthwest Minnesota. Several rural countiesand the White Earth Indian Reservation arealso requesting money. Many of the projects also include joint law enforcement facilities for county sheriff 's de- partments and the police department for thecounty seat. They range in price, dependingon the magnitude, from $16 million for thecentral Minnesota project to $51 million forRamsey County. E-businesses in rural Minn. Training businesses in Greater Minnesota to use the Internet to be more competitive inthe marketplace is the goal of a bill approvedFeb. 10 by the House Jobs and Economic De-velopment Policy Committee. The bill (HF2839), sponsored by Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter), would make a one-timeappropriation to Minnesota T echnology Inc.for the e-Business Institute. Jacques Koppel, president of Minnesota T echnology Inc., said that the institute is apartnership between his organization and theUniversity of Minnesota-Crookston. He saidthe appropriation request would be some-where between $1.2 million and $1.5 million. \"Seventy-five percent of the companies in Greater Minnesota have under 20 employees, \" said Koppel, whose publicly funded organi-zation assists companies in applying and de-veloping technology. \"Small companies are really at risk unless they maintain a competi-tive edge. \"8 February 11, 2000He said the institute does not provide tech- nical training to small business management,but rather trains them to make managementdecisions regarding technology and how it canaid their business. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) said that because the institute plans to contract with theUniversity of Minnesota, Crookston, to usefaculty and students, the services should beprovided for no charge. \"I know the University of Minnesota- Crookston has in its mission community out-reach, \" Trimble said. \"It bothers me to toss in dollars where people used to volunteer. \" Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee) said get- ting Greater Minnesota connected to and us-ing the Internet will help communities retaintheir population. But Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said he doesn 't believe the Internet is always the answer. \"No one is going to buy a pipe or a wrench from a store over the Internet, \" he said. \"What we need is people out there working who needa pipe from the hardware store. \" The bill now moves to the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee. The Land of Lakes Choirboys from Elk River entertain legislators and arts advocates in the Housechamber Feb. 10. The group is conducted by Francis Stockwell. The concert was part of ArtsAdvocacy Day activities.ARTS AT THE CAPITOL Wiring Main Street businesses The rapid development of the Internet has prompted a bill to help businesses in ruralcommunities participate in the neweconomy. The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Policy Committee approved the bill(HF2820), sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy(R-Burnsville), on Feb. 8. The measurewould provide $1 million to the Departmentof Trade and Economic Development forgrants to promote Internet access in ruralMinnesota. The grants would go directly to commu- nities to develop training programs.McElroy said that eventually private com-panies would provide the new technologyto rural Minnesota but that because of theregion 's economy it was important to speed things up. \"The purpose of this is to get things hap- pening a little faster than they would hap-pen without government, \" McElroy said. The bill does not specify the grants must go for any new technology, and they can beused for established technologies such as fi-ber optic cable, McElroy said. However, theproposal does recognize an emerging tech-nology, called multi-point microwave dis-tribution. The bill specifies that the grants could only to be used for capital expenditures andnot on planning costs. The maximum grantfor any single project would be $250,000 or 25 percent of the eligible project costs,whichever is less. McElroy said this limitwould create up to six grants from the ap-propriation. He said that although $250,000 will pay for only a fraction of the costs, the grantsare meant to be catalysts, spurring activitythat otherwise would not occur. He saidbecause of the state 's flat geography, Min- nesota is ideal for many of the new wirelesstechnologies and that a single tower couldserve a radius of 25 miles and several com-munities. The bill now moves to the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee. Upgrades at Camp Knutson The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Finance Committee considered a billFeb. 9 that would appropriate $500,000 forCamp Knutson near Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), would providemoney for new facilities and upgrades on ex-isting facilities at the camp, which offers sup-port and resources for children withdisabilities and their families. Joan Treichel, the parent of a 7-year-old deaf child, said the camp brings families together. \"It's just amazing to see families who come in scared \u2014 mostly the dads, \" she said. \"Then they see other dads participating, and they dotoo.\" Treichel said it is also significant for the families to see adult role models. \"Some families have never seen a deaf adult, and they wonder what is my child going to beSteel mill money considered A bill sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) would provide $44 million forroad and infrastructure improvements inconnection with a proposed steel mill inItasca County. The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Finance Committee discussed the bill(HF2739) on Feb. 9, and it remains alive forpossible inclusion in this year 's bonding bill. Solberg said $1 million was appropriated last session for the pre-design of the pro-posed steel mill that will be owned and op-erated by the Minnesota Iron and SteelCompany. Mary Ives, an Itasca County commissioner, said the project would have a significant eco-nomic development impact in the region. Shesaid it is estimated there would be between 1,000and 1,200 construction jobs. The plant would use the direct reduction process that uses natural gas to reduce theiron ore. John Lefler, president and CEO of Min- nesota Iron and Steel Company, said the millwould generate $30 million for the state ayear and create jobs that would pay about$25 an hour.like? T o be able to see successful deaf adults is an important thing, \" she said. Rob Lane, the camp 's program director, said the camp is geared towards children with avariety of different disabilities from those in-fected with HIV or AIDS, to those with Downsyndrome, skin diseases, deafness, and autism. The measure remains alive for possible in- clusion in this year 's bonding bill.Session Weekly 9#EDUCATIONThe nation's ergot capital A bill sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R- Dassel) would forever memorialize his home-town as the nation 's largest ergot processing center. Ergot is a toxic fungus found on rye plants. Prior to World War II, the plants hallucino-genic properties were thought only to causeinsanity in humans. However, during the war,ergot was used effectively as a blood clottingagent and in treating shell shock, said Dr.Roland Dille, a Dassel resident. Dille testified Feb. 7 before the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Com-mittee. By 1942, Dassel processed more ergot than anywhere in the United States. The bill (HF2727) would appropriate $100,000 for a grant to the city of Dassel tocomplete the renovation and accessibility im-provements for a historical society ergot mu-seum. The committee took no action on the bill, but will consider it among its other supple-mentary budget proposals this session. New plan for writing test An amendment offered by Rep. T ony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) that significantly alters HF2720, a bill related to the statewide10th grade writing test, received the approvalof the House Education Policy Committee onFeb. 10. The bill was debated on the floor of the House the first day of the legislative session,when sponsor Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) tried and failed to get an imme- diate vote on his proposal. As introduced, Reuter 's bill called for the destruction of the tests, which students tooklast month, and would have required studentsto be retested. Critics said the test question,which asked sophomores to write about some-thing they would like to change about them-selves, was inappropriate and too personal. But because the tests have already been sent to be scored, Reuter decided not pursue thatplan further. Kielkucki 's amendment calls for the tests to be scored and returned to each student, so theinformation won 't be seen or used by anyone else. \"If we don 't do this, \" Kielkucki responded, \"teachers and any other diagnostic person is going to have an opportunity to read them. \" That language would apply only to the tests administered this year. T estifying before the committee earlier in the week, Anoka High School student NickPeterson said he could see how some studentsmight have been offended by the question, buthe didn 't want to be retested. \"I don 't feel that the nature of the question is relevant to the scoring of a student 's writ- ing mechanics, and so I ask that we not be re-quired to take the test again, \" Peterson said. Kielkucki 's amendment also contains lan- guage to prohibit the test question from be-ing used again in the future. Some members of the committee objected to the bill. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) called the plan an act of \"micro- management \" and said she felt it was unnecessary, given the effort on the part ofthe Department of Children, Families andLearning to address the situation. The bill now moves to the House floor. #ELECTIONS Javen Swanson, a 10th-grader from Pine River-Backus High School, speaks at a meeting of theHouse Education Policy Committee against a billthat would require the state's written compositiontest to be destroyed and mandate that studentsbe retested.One teen-ager, one vote Several high school students testified Feb. 7 before the House Governmental Operationsand V eterans Affairs Policy Committee in fa-vor of lowering the legal voting age to 16. The committee took no vote on the bill (HF1250), sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn(DFL-Mpls), which would place a constitu-tional amendment before voters in theNovember election in an effort to reduce thevoting age from 18 to 16. Proponents of the bill say most young people pay sales taxes and those that have part-time jobs pay income taxes, yet they have norepresentation in government because theycannot vote. #ENVIRONMENTPatrick Henry High School student VedranaPartalo, 16, left, and Roosevelt High School student Heather Day, 17, testify in front of the HouseGovernmental Operations & Veterans AffairsPolicy Committee Feb. 7 in support of a plan tolower the legal voting age to 16. Kahn has proposed similar measures in the past, and one of the major objections she hasheard is that younger people are not matureenough or responsible enough to vote forelected officials. But Kahn said that 16- to 18- year-olds are just like adult voters of all ages. \"Some are (responsible), and some aren 't,\" she said. Heather Day, a 17-year-old student at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis, saidjuniors in high school learn about Americanhistory and government, which would be theideal time to allow people to be eligible to vote. By teaching 16- and 17-year-olds about gov- ernment at the same time they are eligible tovote, they would likely establish a pattern ofvoting, which would improve the voting per-centage of 18- to 25-year-olds, Day said. Kahn said another benefit would be the national attention Minnesota would receive bybeing the only state that allows 16-year-oldsto vote for president. \"This state would be the center of discus- sion for all youth-related issues, \" she said. New authority for DNR officers A bill that would modify the responsibili- ties of conservation officers in the Departmentof Natural Resources was approved Feb. 8 bythe House Environment and NaturalResources Policy Committee. Conservation officers have many of the same responsibilities as police officers. Both,for example, have authority to give blood-alcohol tests under the state 's implied consent laws. But conservation officers can only issue those tests to people who are hunting whileintoxicated or who are driving snowmobiles,motorboats, or all-terrain vehicles \u2014 not au- tomobiles.10 February 11, 2000Under the bill (HF2962), sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), conservation offic-ers' implied consent authority would be ex- tended to include automobile drivers. Also, the bill would modify some proce- dures regarding forfeited vehicles or property. Under current law, conservation officers can seize firearms from hunters who are violatinglaws, such as shooting at deer from a road orpossessing too many game birds. In some in-stances, the officer later finds out that the per-son illegally possessed a firearm because ofprior criminal convictions or other reasons. In that kind of situation, current law re- quires the officer to send the firearm to thecounty sheriff 's office, even though that of- fice was not involved in the original incident. The bill would allow the DNR to adminis- ter the forfeiture instead of sending it to thecounty. The bill now moves to the House Crime Prevention Committee.House members paused Feb. 7 to give tribute to a man who dedicated much ofhis life to public service, most notably toprotect the quality of the state 's environ- ment and natural resources, and who willbe missed because of his hard work andgreat wit. Family members and friends of the late Rep. Willard Munger attended a memorialservice in the House chamber. The Housepassed a resolution commending Munger 's 43 years of service and his legacy of spon-soring legislation to protect the environment. Munger was recalled as \"Mr. Environ- ment, \" and Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Roches- ter) challenged any state to find someonemore deserving of that title. Bishop, whohas served with Munger in the House since1982, called Munger a \"man of integrity \" and said he was \"truly a giant for a genera- tion. \" Several House members took turns reading a part of the resolution aloud. Atage 87, Munger became the oldest legisla-tor in state history, and his 43 years madehim the longest-serving member of theHouse. Munger \"will be remembered for leaving ac- cording to Act, theGroundwater Protection Act, and the estab-lishment of the Environment and NaturalResources Trust Fund. Many of Munger 's successful environ- mental laws were new to the nation andhave since been copied by other states andby the federal government.Remembering Rep. Willard Munger Colleagues honor environmentalist as a man of integrity, a voice for the people, and a legislative giant Munger was able to stay young despite his age, said Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth), because he kept his old-fashionedideas while adapting to changes in theworld. Jaros described Munger 's work \u2014 both in and out of the Legislature \u2014 as a defi- nition of \"prayer, \" because anything that someone does right can be considered aprayer. \"Willard Munger 's work in the Legisla- ture and in his community has testified tothat, \" he said. \"Let's continue his legacy; let's continue his good work. \" Bishop pointed to a Latin phrase in the House chamber that translates, \"The voice of the people is the voice of God. \" Bishop urged his colleagues to use that phrase toremember Munger. \"Willard Munger heard the voice of the people, and he shared it with us, and all ofMinnesota has benefited, \" Bishop said. \"And we all will benefit for the rest of our lives. \" Early in the 1999 session, Munger was diagnosed with liver cancer. He attemptedto go attend daily legislative meetingswhile undergoing 11 at thehospice. Hewas 88. Munger is survived by two children, Willard Munger, Jr. of Duluth and PatriciaMunger Lehr \"On Eagles Wings\" as partof a tribute to the late Rep. Willard Munger during a recess ofthe Feb. 7 floor session. Munger died of cancer last July afterserving 43 years as a member of the House of Representatives.Wetlands plan to cut red tape Defining \"wetland \" sometimes depends on whom you talk to, and various local, state, andfederal agencies often disagree on how to regu-late construction projects near those hard-to-define bodies of water and weeds. A bill to clarify such confusion was ap- proved Feb. 8 by the House Environment andNatural Resources Policy Committee. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), bill sponsor and chair of the committee, said theproposal would cut bureaucracy that askslandowners to comply with conflicting regu-lations and would make it clear who 's in charge. The bill is designed to allow agreements between various agencies while maintainingthe standards of the state 's Wetland Conser- vation Act and related federal programs. Under current federal and state laws, if a road project causes a wetland to be filled, forexample, a new wetland needs to be estab-lished elsewhere. But various laws don 't always agree on such questions as how big the origi-nal wetland is, how big the new one has to be,and where it can legally be placed. Those and many other variables can cause nightmares for anyone who needs to get per-mits from different agencies. The bill would consolidate the regulatory process. The aim is to provide \"one-stop shop- ping \" for citizens with wetlands concerns and to create more consistency among state andfederal laws. The Senate passed the bill during the 1999 session, but many government and environ-mental groups proposed revisions during theinterim. Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora), SenateSession Weekly 11sponsor, recommended amending the bill to accommodate those revisions. The committee accepted Stevens ' revisions despite objections from Reps. Rod Skoe (DFL-Clearbrook) and Irv Anderson (DFL-Int 'l Falls). Neither objected to the overall conceptof the bill, but both raised questions about theamending process. The bill (HF1493/SF83*) now moves to the House Governmental Operations and V eter-ans Affairs Policy Committee. #GOVERNMENT#HEALTH#HOUSINGBond plan exceeds governor's A proposal to spend $192 million on capi- tal projects related to the environment wasconsidered Feb. 3 by the House Capital Invest-ment Committee. The money would be spent on several dif- ferent programs to purchase conservationeasements, protect and clean up state lakes andstreams, restore trees in state forests, repairbuildings and other facilities in state parks,and build or upgrade wastewater systems. Gov. Jesse Ventura 's capital budget plan pro- poses to spend $125 million in those areas. The committee did not vote on the proposal (HF2651), sponsored by Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield), but the various programs couldbe included in the committee 's omnibus bill. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) asked if the money would be spent on areas that wouldbe fenced off for hunting preserves or if itwould be for land that is open to the public. \"Will my kids in my district be able to go out and have a picnic on the land that our taxeshelped pay for? \" Trimble asked. Ron Harnack, executive director of the Board of Water and Soil Resources, said therehave been very few complaints where the statehas purchased easements and landowners haverestricted access to the property. Tuma acknowledged that the $192 million proposal, called \"Legacy 2000, \" is ambitious, especially in light of the governor 's recom- mendation. But it would meet only a fractionof the actual needs in those areas, he said, andMinnesota is known for its hunting, fishing,resorts, and parks. \"The quality of our outdoor recreation ar- eas is one of the critical elements of our eco-nomic future, \" Tuma said. Final word from Y2K office The soon-to-be defunct Minnesota Year 2000 Project Office gave a final presentationFeb. 8 to the House State Government FinanceCommittee. The office collaborated with governmentagencies and private sector organizations to avoid the much-publicized danger of com-puter system crashes as the year changed from1999 to 2000. Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview), chair of the committee, asked if the state 's $31 million contribution was necessary, or if it was \"much ado about nothing. \" Bev Schuft, director of the Administration Department 's T echnology Standards Division, said some services that the state provides prob-ably would have been forced to stop if it hadn 't been for the preparation. Old computer systems were tested before they had a chance to crash, and many wereupgraded or replaced. At-risk systems in-cluded sewer lift stations, electrical utilities,and many databases and computer networksthroughout the state. \"The problems were real; we just didn 't see the failures because of all the work that wasdone, \" Schuft said. Also, the project caused each state agency or department to conduct a thorough inven-tory of its information technology, and it ledto back-up plans being created for emergencyor disaster recovery services. The office will close March 16. Alternative medicine defended Alternative forms of health care, such as herbal medicines, could become more visiblein Minnesota if lawmakers pass a bill currentlyunder consideration. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is spon- soring a bill that would prohibit criminal sanc-tions against an unlicensed practitioner forpracticing medicine without a license. The House Civil Law Committee held two meetings to listen to testimony about the pro-posal. The committee has planned to vote onamendments at the Feb. 14 hearing. Boudreau said the bill (HF537) would not allow alternative health care providers to per-form surgery, dispense certain drugs, or doother things reserved exclusively for medicaldoctors. \"This is not a professional licensing statute, \" Boudreau said. \"They are practicing success- fully in the community. So why is it illegal? \" Diane Miller, a lawyer with the Minnesota Natural Health Reform Project, said her groupseeks legitimacy but not licensure. \"Practitioners want the right to practice without being thought of as criminals, \" Miller said. A dozen people testified in favor of the bill, telling stories of how herbal remedies curedasthma, allergies, and Crohn 's disease.Eric Sommerman, dean of the Northwest- ern Academy of Homeopathy, said alternativemedicines are safe. \"In our practice of over 15 years, we have safely and effectively treated people of all agesand many conditions of health, \" Sommerman said. \"Nationwide, there has not been a single lawsuit against any practitioners for any harmthat homeopathy has created. \" Bob Meichers of the Minnesota Medical Association said the bill would \"allow any per- son to hold themselves out to the public as analternative health provider \" even if they have no experience. \"This is not an issue of freedom, \" Meiches said. \"This is an issue of protecting the public. \" Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), a family physician who spoke against the bill, agreedthat citizens need more protection. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter) offered several amendments to the bill,including one that would require parents totake their children to see a regular licenseddoctor prior to seeking alternative medicineproviders. The committee has not acted on anyof the amendments. Affordable housing needed In Minnesota, 5,000 to 7,000 people sleep at homeless shelters every night, but thosenumbers reflect less than half the total home-less population in the state, said advocateMichael Dahl. \"Each night, we are turning away 700 to 1,000 people at the shelters, \" Dahl told the House Family & Early Childhood EducationFinance Committee on Feb. 9. Dahl, director of the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless, told legislators that morethan half the people at homeless shelters arechildren, and most homeless people are work-ing. About 16,000 Minnesotans are classifiedas homeless, he said. \"This points to the main problem. We don 't have enough affordable housing, \" Dahl said. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) is spon- soring a bill (HF2678) that would provide anadditional $5.6 million for transitional hous-ing programs in fiscal year 2001. \"Home ownership is the ultimate goal, \" Nornes told the committee. Monica Nilsson of Simpson Housing Ser- vice told the committee that her organizationprovides beds in a basement of a church inMinneapolis. People are asked to contribute40 percent of their paycheck in exchange for abed. Nilsson said the church is now filled withpeople who are homeless but have jobsthroughout the Twin Cities.12 February 11, 2000Homelessness is not just an urban problem, said Robynn Galrapp of West Central Minne-sota Community Action. Galrapp said she seesmany families that face homelessness in ruralMinnesota. \"Permanent affordable housing is what we need, \" Galrapp said. \"Jobs don 't always pro- vide us that. \" Rep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake) objected to the system for counting homeless people. Ac-cording to Minnesota Coalition for the Home-less statistics, people who do not have apermanent address and are staying with fam-ily or friends are counted as homeless. About8,000 homeless people fall into that category. Olson suggested the homeless organization should not include those people as homeless. The bill has been laid over for possible in- clusion in the omnibus bonding bill. #HUMAN SERVICES Program out of budget trouble The budget deficiencies incurred by the State Services for the Blind will not be re-peated, the head of the agency that overseesthe program said. Department of Economic Security Com- missioner Earl Wilson told the House Jobs andEconomic Development Finance CommitteeFeb. 7 that the program 's financial difficulty was a result of several factors. Wilson 's testimony was part of a study at- tached to emergency funding approved by theLegislature during the 1999 session. Last session, State Services for the Blind re- ceived $10.9 million in state funds over thebiennium, including $370,000 in funding tocover a shortfall in the agency 's budget, with a stipulation requiring the Department ofEconomic Security and the Department ofFinance to determine why the deficiency oc-curred and what could be done to prevent theproblem in the future. The program provides services to the blind residents of Minnesota including vocationaltraining, job placement assistance, and learn-ing alternative techniques including Brailletraining. Wilson said that after a period of signifi- cant increases during the 1980s, federal andstate funding became essentially flat after 1992.With increasing numbers seeking services, theprogram failed to prioritize or reduce servicesoffered. T o add to the difficulties, a federal one-time appropriation was added to the program 's base budget and not treated as one-time resources.Therefore it looked like the program had moremoney than it did.\"There was no signs of malfeasance or mis- management, \" Wilson said. However, he said, program staff didn 't re- spond quickly enough once the deficiencybecame apparent. \"They were living on a champagne diet with a beer budget, \" he said. Wilson outlined several steps taken to pre- vent a future reoccurrence. Among these stepswas assigning an assistant commissioner tooversee the program. Rep. T orrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake) en- couraged the department to seek input fromstaff to correct future problems in the pro-gram. \"Every time I talk to the staff they are very reluctant to say anything for fear of retribu-tion, \" Westrom said. Lieutenant Gov. Mae Schunk explains how the Ventura administration plans to use federalTemporary Assistance for Needy Familiesfunds to support after-school programs.Schunk spoke during a Feb. 7 hearing of theHouse Family & Childhood Education FinanceCommittee.#INSURANCEPLANS FOR THE NEEDYPayment system fix proposed A bill sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) aims to establish a minimumfor operating cost reimbursement to addressthe inequities in cost-based and alternativepayment systems for nursing homes. The bill (HF2699) would create a set of operating cost per diems for the nursing homeindustry 's 11 case-mix categories. It also would lift nursing homes currently operatingat the low end of the reimbursement scale up to the 60th percentile of all facilities in Min-nesota being compensated statewide. The House Health and Human Services Policy Committee approved the bill Feb. 8 andreferred it to the House Health and HumanServices Finance Committee. Increasing the minimum level of reimburse- ment by raising the bar is expected to helprural nursing facilities compete for patientsmore evenly with homes located in urban set-tings, officials said. The bill would allocate $10million for the restructuring of operating costreimbursement levels. Speaking on behalf of Lutheran Senior Citi- zens Home in Little Falls, Darrel Schwartz saidhe appreciated what the bill is attempting todo. Schwartz said he worries, however, thatmany nursing facilities would not be able tobenefit from the changes to cost reimburse-ment as proposed by the bill. \"My only hope is that we don 't get so far behind that we 're not able to catch up, \" he said. While supporting the bill, Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Rush City) questioned whether$10 million would be adequate to spend. \"I can assure you that $10 million will not completely solve the problem, \" said Goodno. \"We will still need to look at other ways to keep nursing homes in other parts of the state com-petitive. However, the bill is a start to correct-ing the inequity in the system that 's been present for quite some time. \" Liability for loaners The House Commerce Committee ap- proved a bill Feb. 8 that would shift insur-ance liability costs on vehicles loaned out byrepair shops. Pat Whalen, owner of PJW Automotive in New Brighton, said many repair shops pro-vide loaner vehicles while servicing theircustomers ' cars. But some shops are discon- tinuing the service because their insuranceis responsible for covering the costs if theloaner vehicle is involved in an accident. The bill (HF2719), sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), wouldshift the costs of damages to the driver 's li- ability insurance coverage. The repair shop 's insurance would only pay the amount inexcess of what the driver 's insurance covers. The bill was sent to the House floor.Session Weekly 13#LOCAL GOVERNMENT #RECREATIONWhat's in a name? When the residents of Lake Edwards T own- ship in Crow Wing County decided to dropthe \"s\" from the town 's name, they didn 't real- ize it would be so complicated a process. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) said for years there has been confusion about whetheror not the legal name of the township had the\"s\" at the end. She said the confusion has led to delays when the town has had to file docu-ments with state and federal governments. T ownship officials discovered to legally change the name from the T ownship of LakeEdwards to T ownship of Lake Edward, wouldrequire a petition signed by at least 55 per-cent of the number of residents who voted inthe last general election. For Lake Edwards, a rural town located in the central part of the state with a populationof approximately 1,500 people, the costs of thisprocess seemed too high. HF2521, sponsored by Hasskamp, would allow the county board to change the name ofthe township upon receiving a resolution fromthe town board requesting the change. The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee approved the billFeb. 9. Jim Gelbmann, executive director of the State Board of Government Innovation andCooperation, said that since the board has nopower under current law to authorize thechange, legislation is required. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield), said that the change may not clarify the issue for thetown when it deals with other units of gov-ernment since each governmental agency 's records may or may not have the \"s\" at the end of the township name. Changing the name atthis point, Tuma said, won 't really clarify those records. Gelbmann said that documents from the time the town was formed are lost, and thus itis unclear what the legal name is. The billwould establish once and for all what the le-gal name of the town is. The bill now moves to the House floor. Cities seek more aid Three cities that are requesting increases in their local government aid from the state pre-sented their cases to the Property Tax Divi-sion of the House Taxes Committee on Feb. 9. The cities, Kelliher, Darwin, and Osseo, are requesting increases in the city aid base andalso increases in the maximum amount oftotal aid. HF2509, sponsored by Rep. Rod Skoe (DFL- Clearbrook), would increase the base aid forKelliher by $32,000. HF2724, sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), would increaseDarwin 's aid payment by $7,200. HF2640, sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin),would increase Osseo 's payment by $300,000. Gregg Thayer, a former Kelliher council member, said the city receives far less aid thanneighboring cities and cities of similar size. Asan example, Thayer said the city 's population is around 372 and it will receive less than halfof the aid given to the city of Northhome,which has 90 less people. Ness said the city of Darwin is being penal- ized for its \"frugality. \" He said that other small cities with no greater need than Darwin getmuch more aid because Darwin chose to levyand spend at a much lower rate than the aver-age city. David Callister, the Osseo city administra- tor, said that the city is landlocked, limitingany expansion to its tax base. He said that al-though the median value of homes in the cityis among the lowest in Hennepin County, thecity's property tax rates are among the county 's highest. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) said she hopes the administration would considerchanging the aid formula. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) said that he has had discussions with the Departmentof Revenue indicating that the governor 's re- form package that will be presented next yearmight address the local aid formula. Soccer field funding sought A program to provide local grants for soc- cer fields was discussed Feb. 9 by the HouseCapital Investment Committee. The bill (HF2733) would provide $12 mil- lion in bond proceeds to provide grantsthrough the Minnesota Amateur Sports Com-mission. Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake) said soccer is the fastest growing sport in the state,and unlike most other sports, it is equallypopular among boys and girls. The grantswould be similar to the \"Mighty Ducks \" grants that were used to help cities throughout thestate build ice arenas. Mares estimated that the money would help pay for about 500 soccer fields, and the moneywould be distributed equitably among thestate 's congressional districts. Grants would be matched equally with lo- cal money on projects that cost less than$20,000. For projects costing $20,000 to$75,000, each $1 in state grant money wouldhave to be matched with $2 locally.

The costs of soccer fields include the pur- chase of the land, grading and developing thesite, fencing, lighting, parking, and restrooms. Gov. Jesse V entura vetoed portions of the omnibus state government finance bill in 1999that appropriated money to the sports com-mission for ice arenas and soccer fields. The committee did not take action on the bill, but it could be included in the omnibuscapital investment bill. Rebate eligibility could expand A driving force behind last year 's $1.3 bil- lion sales-tax based rebate was that it was, forthe most part, automatically generated. Taxpayers were not required to file addi- tional forms because the Department of Rev-enue had the information needed todetermine the rebate amount. The House Committee on Taxes heard sev- eral bills Feb. 4 that would either expand theeligibility requirements allowing people toretroactively apply for a 1999 rebate or extendthe application deadline for people who wereeligible but did not apply. Several legislators were concerned that the window for applying last year was too small.The rebate bill was passed May 24, 1999, andthe deadline to file was only three weeks later. HF2542, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gleason (DFL-Richfield), would extend the rebate tostudents claimed as dependents by their par-ents.14 February 11, 2000Dave Giese, a student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, spoke in support ofHF2542, saying many young adults who were in school were penalized as students becausetheir parents claimed them as dependents. \"I was very disappointed to be excluded from the rebate, \" he said, \"I, along with many other students, contributed toward the surplus. \" HF2537, also sponsored by Gleason, would include non-taxable social security and dis-ability income in calculating the rebate. Former Rep. Mark Mahon, representing the American Association of Retired Persons,spoke in favor of HF2537, saying many seniorcitizens were unaware of the rebate process. \"If this is truly a sales tax rebate, then this group has to be included, \" Mahon said. \"Se- niors, probably more than any other group,spent most of their money in Minnesota. \" HF2487, sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), would extend the deadline forthose already eligible for the rebate. HF2526, sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), and HF2540, sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), would both extendthe deadline and eligibility for the rebate todependents and people over 65. The committee took no action on any of the bills, but Abrams said each would be con-sidered for inclusion in this year 's omnibus tax package. Governor seeks tax reform The governor plans to propose a tax reform initiative next session as part of the biennialbudget, the head of the Department of Rev-enue told the Property Tax Division of theHouse Taxes Committee on Feb. 7. Commissioner Matt Smith said tax reform is part of the governor 's \"Big Plan, \" empha- sizing service not systems. \"A tax system should be simple and easy to deal with for taxpayers, \" Smith said. \"It should also be understandable and predictable, so tax-payers know how much they 're going to pay. \" Smith said a better tax system should also be fair, so taxes are based on taxpayers ' ability to pay and the cost of services they use. The systemalso must be modern, keeping pace with changesin the economy and technology, and be consis-tent with the overall goals of the state. Gordon Folkman, a policy analyst for the department, said reforming the state 's prop- erty tax system requires a better understand-ing of the entire system. \"Every property tax system has features which make the system complex to administer anddifficult for taxpayers to understand, \" Folkman said. He said there are many factors that make it difficult for state and local officials to explain #TRANSPORTATION Rheanne Zimmerman, right , a fourth-grade student at Paynesville Elementary School who is also home-schooled part time, testifies before the House K-12 Education Finance Committeein support of a bill that would establish permanent funding for gifted and talented programs.Alisa Eland-Smithburg, left, an eighth-grade student at Chaska Middle School, also testified at the Feb. 7 hearing.GIFTED STUDENTSthe system in an understandable way for tax-payers. Among these factors are the changingmarket value on a property or a market valueon another property in the same taxing dis-trict may change, shifting taxes from one prop-erty to another. Changing local levies andreferendum approvals of levy increases alsocontribute to the complexity. Smith said that one of the strengths of prop- erty taxes in general is that taxpayers can holdtheir local officials accountable for any increases. But, he said, because the system is difficult to understand much of that accountability is lost. Rights to railroad land Grain elevator owners would have the first opportunity to purchase land along rail cor-ridors if the railroad company decides to sell,under a bill advancing in the House. Bill sponsor Rep. William Kuisle (R-Roch- ester) brought the bill before the House Trans-portation Policy Committee on Feb. 8. Thecommittee approved the bill, which nowmoves on to the House Civil Law Committee.Several elevator owners told the committeethey feared that a railroad company could sellsuch property to another entity, which thencould raise lease rates on the land. \"We can 't just pick up the elevator and move, \" said Bob Zelenka, executive director of Minnesota Grain and Feed Association.\"If a third party bought it and jacked up the rate, we would have to pay it, \" said Curt Pederson of Farmer 's Elevator in Bellingham. Brian Sweeney of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway opposed the measure. \"There 's no protection for us in this bill, \" Sweeney said. \"Why would we drive them out of business to make an extra $5,000? \" The bill (HF919) stems from a Minnesota railroad company 's attempt in 1999 to sell the land near the elevators to the elevator ownersfor ten times the amount of the annual lease.The elevator owners balked at the sale offer,saying the land is not worth that much. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) ques- tioned why elevator owners wouldn 't want to purchase the land, noting that lease rateswould equal the purchase price in one decade.Zelenka responded that it is difficult to ob-tain that much money in a short period, andthe elevator owners prefer the annual leases. Sweeney said no railroad companies have raised lease rates or sold the property to a thirdparty due to elevator owners declining the saleoffer. A photo caption in the Feb. 4 issue of Session Weekly stated that construction of a new Arts Building on the University of Minnesotacampus was called for in the governor's 2000bonding recommendations. The governor did not recommend funding for the project, estimated to cost $21 million.CorrectionSession Weekly 15BY CHRIS VETTER Henry Oertelt was calm when he explained how German officials had burned numbers inhis arm in a Nazi concentration camp. The Holocaust survivor shared his tale with the House Crime Prevention Committee as ifhe has told it many times before. But this timehe was hoping to sway legislators to support anew bill aimed at hate crimes. As he testified, the 79-year-old St. Paul man recalled walking down the streets in his na-tive Germany and seeing swastikas, \"Death to Jews, \" and other hateful messages written on buildings and shops. \"All you need is the slippery slope of holes in the law, and it could happen here, \" Oertelt said. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park) dis- played obvious sadness as he sat beside Oertelt.Rhodes, who is Jewish, is sponsoring HF1502,which would enhance penalties for bias-mo-tivated crimes. The committee approved the bill Feb. 8 and sent it to the House floor. A bias-motivated crime is defined as an of- fense when the perpetrator selects the victimbased, in part or in whole, on the victim 's per- ceived race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,disability, age, or national origin. The state already has a bias-motivated crime law in statute, said Margaret Chutich from theAttorney General 's Office, which is also sup- porting the bill. Chutich said the state passedits initial law in 1989, which enhances penal-ties on three crimes \u2014 assault, criminal dam- age to property, and harassment. Rhodes ' bill would extend bias-motivated penalty provisions to such crimes as interfer-ing with religious observance, third-degreearson, trespassing, public nuisance, and dis-orderly conduct. However, the measure would not make cer- tain acts typically considered part of a hatecrime illegal. For example, burning a cross is not illegal. Neither is displaying a swastika. But if youdamage someone 's property to burn a cross or paint a swastika on a building wall, that isagainst the law.Crimes of hate Proposal would increase penalties for crimesmotivated by prejudice And under the bill, that property crime would carry an enhanced penalty. After the hearing, Rhodes ' sadness was re- placed with a wide smile. He said his aim is to include all other bias- related offenses that were not included in theoriginal law a decade ago. Shepard Harris of the Jewish Community Relations Council said the bill does not limitfree speech, but rather focuses on thebehavior. \"If someone spray paints 'Vikings stink, ' that's property damage, \" Harris said. \"But if the person painted a swastika on the wall andknowing that the person inside is Jewish, thatleads to the enhanced penalty. \" Though no specific incident of hate crime was raised as an impetus for the bill, officialsare alarmed at the steady increase of bias-re-lated offenses in Minnesota. Such offenses in-creased by 10 percent from 1997 to 1998,Chutich said. Under the bill, an offense punishable as amisdemeanor would be elevated to a gross misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor crimeswould be elevated to felony-level penalties. A 1993 U.S. Supreme Court decision, known as Wisconsin vs. Mitchell , upheld en- hanced penalties for hate crimes, regardless ofthe race of the perpetrator and the victim. In the Mitchell case, an African-American attacked a white man after seeing a movieabout black oppression in the South. TheCourt upheld the state 's law, which increased the penalty because the victim was selected byhis skin color. \"It impacts the victim when you know you've been targeted, \" Chutich said. The Court held the crime was \"speech incidental to conduct, \" she said. Chutich helped craft the bill 's language. \"We were looking for something that made sense in Minnesota, \" she said. T om Prichard, president of the Minnesota Family Council, spoke against the bill, sayingthe legislation gives special protection togroups rather than individuals. Prichard con-tends the bill punishes thought. \"If you are a member of a group, you re- ceive greater protection, \" Prichard said. \"We think that is fundamentally wrong. \" Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) criti- cized Prichard, wondering if the MinnesotaFamily Council opposes the measure becauseit offers protection to gays and lesbians. Prichard said he would oppose the bill re- gardless of the sexual orientation portion. Rhodes disagreed with Prichard, saying the bill would not divide people into groups. \"This isn 't going to fracture society, it is going to enhance society, \" Rhodes said. The bill includes an education provision, requiring all juvenile offenders to complete aprogram where they learn how their acts hurtthe victim and society. What the program en-tails would be up to the individual sentencingjudge. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) said the increasingly diverse population in Minnesotamakes this bill important. Chutich said it 's important to note that the motivation behind a crime is always consid-ered in court. For example, she said, the mur-der of a child is viewed differently than themurder of an adult. \"We've never had 'a crime-is-a-crime-is-a-AT ISSUE: CRIME # # # Henny Oertelt of St. Paul, a Holocaust survivor, tes- tifies in favor of a bill that would increase the pen-alties for hate crimes. Continued on page 3916 February 11, 2000BY JON FUREIf Gov. Jesse Ventura gets his way, Minne - sota voters will be asked if the MinnesotaHouse of Representatives and Senate should be replaced by a single legislative body. But before that question makes it onto the November election ballot, lawmakers andother interested parties have some questionsof their own. Ventura testified at a joint hearing of the House Governmental Operations and V eter-ans Affairs Policy and Senate Election Lawscommittees on Feb. 7. He stressed that hewants voters to be able to determine this is-sue, and asked for support from proponentsof the current bicameral system. \"If it really is the best system, why not have the courage to put your system before the vot-ers and let them be the ultimate decision-mak-ers?\" he said. Ventura previously testified about unicameralism at a House committee hearingin Fergus Falls, but the governor did not stayaround to answer members ' questions. This time, he stayed for the duration of the meet-ing and debated the merits of his proposalwith committee members. Under V entura 's proposal, which is con- tained in a bill (HF159)sponsored by HouseSpeaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), the one-house legislature would be called the \"Senate \" and would consist of 135 districts. Currentlythere are 67 Senate districts, each of which isdivided to make 134 House districts. The pro-posed terms would be four years, and theywould be staggered \u2014 half of the members ' terms would expire every two years. Those changes would take place in 2003, if the voters were to approve the constitutionalamendment. Senate President Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring the companion bill. Basically, if the ballot question were to pass as it is currently proposed, the people who takeoffice in 2001 would have the task of re-draw-ing district boundaries and establishing spe-cific rules for those who would later be electedto the unicameral Legislature in 2003.Three for one Ventura, Sviggum, and Spear \u2014 three of the mostinfluential people in government \u2014 pushed for aunicameral legislature this week Proponents of the unicameral plan envision a simpler legislative process that would allowmore citizen involvement. A bill would beheard in several committees, and then on the\"Senate \" floor. Every lawmaker would vote, and if a measure passes, it would go on to thegovernor to be signed into law or vetoed. That process would likely be more \"stream- lined \" compared to the current system, pro- ponents say, where different versions of thesame bill are sometimes passed in both cham-bers, and then conference committees are ap-pointed to resolve differences between the twoversions. The conference committee report is sent back to both chambers, and members can voteyes or no, but cannot offer amendments. (Law-makers can also move to sent a bill back toconference committee for further consider-ation.) Spear said the conference committee pro- cess is \"unreformable. \" \"The only thing we can do to reform that part of the process is to remove it, \" he said.One argument against a more \"streamlined \" process is that the conference committees slowdown the process, which some say is neces-sary because only the ideas that have broadsupport prevail in the end. That can helpeliminate the influence of special interests. \"My constituents consistently have told me that they do not want making laws to beeasier, \" said Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph). Many of the evils associated with confer- ence committees are things of the past, saidRep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), who has servedin the House since 1972. House rules requireconference committee reports to contain onlythose provisions that had been approved byat least one chamber, so that new items can-not get tucked in with little or no scrutiny. Kahn said the only exception to those rules has been when a governor absolutely insistson adding a proposal into the bill. And Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview) pointed out that people can vote against a con-ference committee report. He described aninstance when the Republicans were in theminority, yet he persuaded enough of his col-leagues to vote \"no\" because he objected to cer- tain provisions in a bill. The conferencecommittee resumed meeting, and those ob-jections were resolved, he said. Proponents of the current system say the hard-fought battles between the House andSenate create checks and balances within theLegislature. But Sviggum said checks and balances his- torically have come from the existence of threebranches of government \u2014 executive, legisla- tive, and judicial. He added that the opennessof the unicameral system would enhance therole of citizens. \"If you 're comfortable with how you repre- sent your constituents, the more open the bet-ter,\" he said. \"An open process that is accountable to citizens is the best check andbalance we can have. \" Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), who said the discussion has been too narrow, has in-troduced two reform plans that provide alter-natives to a unicameral legislature. McElroy said the unicameral debate is criti- cally important because the impacts of chang-ing the size and structure of the Legislaturewill be felt for many years. \"Clearly this is a multi-generational deci- sion, \" he said.AT ISSUE: GOVERNMENT # # # Former Secretary of State Joan Growe testifies against a unicameral legislature proposal Feb. 7before the House Governmental Operations & Vet-erans Affairs Committee. Continued on page 39Session Weekly 17BY DAVID MAEDAThe rights of an individual don 't always coincide with what may be in the bestinterest of the greater community. In the area of private property rights, the two cansometimes collide. That is what legislation proposed by Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township) is at-tempting to address. Anderson is sponsoringa bill (HF590) that would establish and enacta \"private property protection act \" in the state. Anderson presented his bill Feb. 8 to the House Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee, and the plan promptedmuch debate. The committee took no actionon the proposal. \"The right to private property is the guard- ian of every other right, \" Anderson said. \"It is a travesty that I have to bring this bill to thiscommittee. \" Anderson said loss of property rights ulti- mately means a loss in freedom. The bill, which is similar to legislation that has been considered across the country, seeksto protect property owners who have beendenied use of their property due to govern-ment regulation. Under the proposed private property pro- tection act, the Legislature would recognizeactions taken by the state and local units ofgovernment may inordinately burden privateproperty rights without amounting to a tak-ing from the property owner. George Deschenes, an Elk River resident, testified that he has been hurt by governmentaction. He said the city is forcing him to movehis business and is not providing fair compen-sation to find a new location that is as valu-able as the old location. \"They are offering a bear market value, not a fair market value, \" he said. The city plans to rezone his industrial prop- erty to accommodate a mixed-use residentialhousing area. In effect, Deschenes 's property has been condemned, and he is being forcedfrom the land. However, he feels the compen-sation rate is too low.Balancing act Legislation attempts to protect private propertyrights versus expanding community developmentand infrastructure needs The bill would establish a process for deter- mining relief or compensation for a propertyowner. A property owner suing under the actwould submit a written claim to the local gov-ernment entity with an appraisal of the value ofthe property. The government body would thenbe required to notify owners of property bor-dering the property and other parties. The governmental entity also would be re- quired to make a settlement offer during thenotice period. If a settlement is not reached, ajury would determine the damages. Mike Podulke, an Olmsted County commis- sioner, said the board of directors of the As-sociation of Minnesota Counties has concernsabout the bill. Among those concerns is thatthe compensation provisions address antici-pated usage and not actual usage. He said that in compensating one neighborfor diminished property value, it could then encourage another neighbor to claim that thevalue was thus diminished, leading to an end-less cycle of claims. \"This bill tries to solve a lot of complex prob- lems with a simple solution, \" Podulke said. Remi Stone, from the League of Minnesota Cities, said the measure could lead to a largeincrease of lawsuits against cities. Stone citedseveral other concerns including that the billhas no implicit provisions for nuisances, con-tains no exceptions for transportation issues,and has no language for temporary impacts.And, she said, cities would still be liable evenwhen enacting state and federal programs. \"I am an attorney, and I could retire off this bill just by bringing lawsuits against cities, \" she said. Richard Stafford, the chair of the Washington County Board, said that property rights issuesare not always cut and dried. He said that in someinstances a person moves into an area knowingfull well the potential development and infra-structure concerns of the area. \"If you see a railroad track, there 's probably going to be a train, \" Stafford said. He said that recently his county board heard a case where a gravel company that has beendoing business in the county for 40 years ap-plied for a permit to expand its mining onproperty it already owned. He said a neigh-bor to the gravel pit came forward protestingthe application. The person said he had livedthere for six months. \"I asked him, 'Didn 't you see the gaping hole in the ground? '\" Stafford said. It was an example, he said, of how provi- sions of Anderson 's bill would still hold the county responsible to compensate neighbor-ing homeowners for the decline in their prop-erty values. Stafford said that property rightslegislation should include a test to validate anyactual loss of value and somehow calculate thepercentage of responsibilities between estab-lished entities and people who have recentlymoved to the area. Larry George, the executive director of Oregonians in Action, a nonprofit organiza-tion that advocates property rights issues inthat state, supported the bill, arguing that gov-ernmental entities should establish goodworking relationships with affected taxpayersfrom the start to avoid conflicts. \"The people who cannot fight are lower income people affected most by regulation, \" he said.

But some critics claim the pie itself is too small and Gov. Jesse Ventura 's higher educa- tion plans just won 't cut it, especially consid- ering the amount usually targeted for buildingprojects at colleges and universities. \"This is a time of plenty, and we should be making a commitment to higher education, \" said Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) dur-ing a Feb. 7 meeting of the House Higher Edu-cation Finance Committee. In that meeting, Department of Finance officials were called to explain the process used to assemble the administration 's bonding package. The officials were met with criticismand tough questions from lawmakers on thepanel. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), who chairs the committee, said higher educationprojects usually account for about 40 percentBricks and mortarboards Critics of the governor's bonding plan want more forMinnesota colleges of capital spending and Ventura 's recommen- dation is well short of that. \"Twenty-five percent is nowhere near the historical standard, \" she said. Higher education projects actually make up slightly less than 25 percent of the governor 's bonding proposal this year. Ventura 's plan calls for $499 million in capi- tal projects. Through cancellations of oldprojects worth about $37 million, the totalnew spending in his capital budget is $462million. T o get to that figure, the governorwould use $400 million in general obligationbonding, $1 million directly from the generalfund, $34 million in user-financed bonds, and$27 million from the trunk highway fund. Lee Mehrkens, capital budget coordinator for the Depart-ment of Fi-nance, said thegovernor fo-cused governorsets forth a $400million target, itmeans we 're not going to fund all agency requests, \" Mehrkens said. \"That 's just the way it is. \" The governor 's target of $400 million in general obligation bonds is based on what theadministration claims is the 15-year averagefor such spending. Ventura also \"has a philoso- phy that we should move the bonding bill backto a more traditional focus, \" Mehrkens said. A total of $118.3 million would go to higher education projects under Ventura 's recom- mendations. Minnesota State Colleges andUniversities (MnSCU) institutions would see$64.3 million in projects, and the Universityof Minnesota would get $54 million. Those numbers come up far short of the $230 million requested by MnSCU and $134million requested by the U of M. Lawmakers took issue with Ventura 's deci- sions about which projects to fund and raisedquestions about the criteria he used to makethose decisions. Some committee members questioned why the priorities set by the institutions themselveswere not followed. For example, the U of M submitted a list of its top 10 bonding priorities in order of im-portance. V entura recommended funding thefirst, second, and fourth projects on the list. Third on the list of the U of M 's priorities was a $21 million plan to replace the ArtsBuilding on the West Bank of the Minneapo-lis campus. Leppik said the condition of the existing building is \"abysmal, \" and Folliard wondered why the Microbial and Plant Genomics Build-ing, listed as the university 's fourth priority, jumped ahead in line under the governor 's plan. Mehrkens said the governor chose projects that fit the \"over-arching themes \" of his bond- ing plan. \"How the project lined up against his crite- ria was the primary driver of whether a projectwould be included, \" Mehrkens said. V entura 's bonding plan also drew criticism from some lawmakers who argued there is alack of balance between projects in the TwinCities area and those in the rest of the state. MnSCU submitted a request for bond funds to finance more than 20 priorities around thestate. The governor 's plan includes only four. V entura is proposing $30 million for main- tenance projects \u2014 from roof repair to re- placement of aging boilers \u2014 at MnSCU campuses throughout Minnesota. MnSCUrequested $100 million for such purposes asits top priority. The other three MnSCU requests supported by the governor are all at metropolitan-areacampuses. Laura King, vice chancellor and chief financial officer for the Minnesota State Col-leges and Universities, and Associate Vice Chancellor Allan Johnson present thesystem's $230 million bonding request during a Feb. 9 meeting of the House HigherEducation Finance Committee. Continued on page 39Session Weekly 19POLICY # # # BY CHRIS VETTER Advances in biotechnology are like an oncoming train, said Dr. Stephen Joseph.Americans are underestimating the speedof the train, and it cannot be stopped. \"It is an enormously powerful eco- nomic engine that is just being born, \" Jo- seph told legislators in a Feb. 9 lecturegiven as part of the Capitol Forum series.\"It's going to make an unbelievable im- pact on the 21st Century. \" Joseph, a doctor with the National Cen- ter for Genome Resources in New Mexico,discussed the Human Genome Project,through which biologists hope to identifyall of the 100,000 genes in human DNA.The project is funded by the U.S. Depart-ment of Energy and the National Institutesof Health. \"We can understand the genetic se- quences that lead to red hair, \" he said. \"But we don 't understand how the proteins work. \" He added, \"It is the Holy Grail for bi- ologists. \" Once the genes and sequences are un- covered, doctors will change the way theyperform therapy or diagnose sicknesses,Joseph contends. \"It will change every single facet of biomedi- cine as we know it, \" he said. While Joseph spoke with passion about the wide array of possibilities that biomedicineadvances could bring, he recognized there aremoral and ethical dilemmas with the newtechnology. He spoke of limits versus choice and limits versus privacy. What do people think of clon-ing or creating genetically modified organ-isms, including people? Compared to the tidalwave ahead, the abortion debate is small,Joseph said. \"It is nothing compared to the ethical and religious aspects of genetically-modified 'us,'\" he explained. This new technology could open the door- way to make a \"right weight, right height, or right skin color, \" Joseph said. He expressed hisPanacea or pitfall? Medical and ethical implications of genetic engineering discussed in Capitol Forum series concern over who determines what those\"right \" things are. Furthermore, he said, many of the questions about morality will likely fallon state legislators. Another possible impact of genetic engi- neering is 'behavior modification, ' which could include changing a person 's attitudes and conduct. Legislators should revisit the discussion of eugenics from 90 years ago, Joseph said, whenthere were open discussions of sterilizing thementally handicapped. \"They will come back in a more subtle, po- litically correct way, \" he said. Genotypes could reveal a future genetic dis- order, like Lou Gehrig 's disease or Parkinson 's Disease. Gene therapy potentially could re-move those genetic disorders before theymanifest themselves, Joseph said.Along with the sudden growth in biomedi- cine, the advancement in computer sciencecannot be overlooked, Joseph said. Man wouldnot be able to comprehend all the possibili-ties of genetic deciphering without the aid oftoday 's computers. \"It's too much data, it comes too fast for the human brain, \" he said. Now, he said, biomedicine and com- puter science are intrinsically linked. However, all these advances in tech- nology will not lower the cost of healthcare, Joseph argued. While technologicaladvances have led to falling prices, Joseph said those new technologies are sold enmasse to the public. However, biomedi-cine is geared toward a more centralized,more select group of people, thus, caus-ing higher prices. While some legislators may fear the advances in technology, Joseph said sci-ence cannot be stopped. In his closing remarks, Joseph sug- gested the Legislature should create a sci-ence or technology organization to turnto for answers. \"Think hard about how you are go- ing to get some help, \" he said. Several legislators said they learned a great deal during the discussion. \"We needed to hear another three hours, \" said Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jack- son). \"He gave some eye-opening per- spectives on where we 've been and where we're going in health care. \" Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), who sits on the House Higher Education Fi-nance Committee, said the discussion showedthe importance of having a powerful researchengine like the University of Minnesota in thestate. \"One of our challenges is to build on that strong research institution, \" Carlson said. The amazing technology advances in the past 100 years make it impossible to guesswhere biomedicine is going to take us, Carlsonsaid. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) said legis- lators must remember that not all answerscome from science. He said some answers haveto come from the heart. \"If technology grows faster than our ability to love one another, we will blow ourselves up, \" Dehler said. \"We will kill each other. \" Dr. Stephen Joseph of New Mexico discusses the future of biomedicine and genetics at a Capitol Forum serieslecture on Feb. 9.20 February 11, 2000HISTORY # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGERIn 1900, the people of Minnesota elected Samuel R. VanSant as governor, in a close race that saw VanSant defeat incum - bent John Lind by roughly 2,300 votes. T o many observers at the time, the election signaled a turn-around in Minnesota politics and a move away fromthe populism of the late 1800s. They were wrong.A state of transition Urban growth, rural concerns dominate 100 yearsof Minnesota politics Though he had only been governor for two years, what Lind borrowed from the Populistsand added to his progressive agenda \u2014 par- ticularly the notion of putting the \"people \" before \"special interests \" \u2014 would define po- litical life in Minnesota for the next 100 years. And as you listen to today 's political debates at the Capitol, you will hear the same themesstill resonating with the people. The late 1800s and early 1900s proved to be a very dynamic time in the political history ofthe state. Ballots, especially for the major of-fices, contained numerous candidates repre-senting many different parties. New parties, such as the Farmer 's Alliance and the People 's Party, also known as the Populists, sprang out of a depressed farmingmarket in the 1890s, in an effort to combatthe rise of the urban, industrial centers. The progressive movement, which rose early in the 20th Century, would be the one to em-phasize the virtue of rural, farming commu-nities. It focused on the need to balancegrowing national interests of business and in-dustry versus the traditional Minnesota val-ues of rural life. Agriculture was the dominant portion of Minnesota 's economy at the turn of the cen- tury. Forty percent of those employed in Min-nesota were working in the agricultureindustry in 1900. Most of them \u2014 nearly 98 percent \u2014 were men. In fact, more Minnesotans lived in rural areas in 1900 than the state 's cities. Seven out of the 10 largest counties in 1900, in terms of population, were outstate counties. By 1998, only four of the top 10 most-populated counties were not part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. And of the four re-maining counties, one is just outside the metroarea and the others include cities such asDuluth, Rochester, and St. Cloud. In addition, the largest cities in the state in 1900, behind Minneapolis and St. Paul, wereDuluth, Stillwater, and Mankato \u2014 all of which were transportation and commercialhubs for the agriculture market. Cities suchas Red Wing, Fergus Falls, Little Falls,Owatonna, and Austin also were ranked highin population. One hundred years later, only Duluth, Rochester, and St. Cloud could break throughthe strong population numbers from metroarea cities. It wouldn 't take long for the employment opportunities in the cities to shift populationfrom the rural to the urban areas. A large in-flux of immigrants looking for work also con-tributed to the shift. By 1900, manufacturing industries in Minnesota were carving out their own nichein the state 's economy. About 15 percent of the men in the job market filled manufactur-ing jobs. And Minnesota led the nation in flourmilling, the state 's top manufacturing indus- try in 1900. The prevailing rural dominance in Minnesota was evident in the state 's political decisions at the turn of the century. So was the notion that leaders neededto protect rural interests in light of the growthin Minnesota 's urban centers. Gov. Knute R. Nelson illustrated this in his inaugural speech in 1893.\"While Minnesota is rapidly developing her vast mineral resources and is fast becoming agreat manufacturing state, it is still in pursuitof agriculture that a large plurality of herpeople are engaged, \" he said. Mines on the Iron Range and railroads throughout the state were growing. As a re-sult, the Legislature enacted taxes on mining,railroads, and businesses to shift some of thetax burdens off farmers in the early 1900s. Farmers had begun to join the Populist movement during the late 1800s and trulydefined an \"us-ver- sus-them \" platform. However, what Linddid with candi-dacy theconcerns of smalltown pro- gressive movementbucked the trends ofbig business and banks that were being estab-lished in the eastern cities and were slowlymoving west. The movement also carried withit a moral agenda, arguing that personal vir-tues of honesty, fairness, and responsibilityshould be reflected in professional and politi-cal circles, as well. For instance, officials were already becom- ing concerned with perceived improprietiesinvolving lobbyists at the Legislature. \"In several of the states, steps have already been taken to exclude the lobbyist from the Gov. John Lind Photos from the book The Progressive Era in Minnesota 1899-1918 by Carl H. Chrislock, 1971.Gov. Samuel R. VanSant, a Republican from Winona with a fla 1905. He is pictured here delivering one of his many speechSession Weekly 21halls of legislation and eliminate one of the greatest evils to political economy and politi-cal decency, \" said Gov. John A. Johnson in his 1907 inaugural speech. Progressive viewpoints would dominatethrough the 1920s, especially inwomen 's suffrage and prohibition movements. Candidates from both partiesadopted some of the tenets of progressivism,and the Legislature enacted progressive mea-sures despite opposition. Ultimately, that opposition and fractional- izing within the progressive movement re-sulted in its demise. However, the reformistviewpoints in the movement continue todayin the proposals to reduce the influence of lob-byists, plans to limit the tax burdens on indi-viduals and small businesses, and bills tomodify the structure of government. Despite the volatile nature of politics at the turn of the century and the years that followed,leaders were very optimistic about Minnesota 's position. Agricultural pursuits were gaining strength after a brief setback. State finance officials hadpredicted surpluses in revenue during the lat-ter years of the 1890s. Minnesota 's lumber, milling, and meat-packing industries wereamong the most productive in the nation. They were also looking forward to the open- ing of a new State Capitol, which was alreadyunder construction in St. Paul. Overall, the leaders of the day were opti- mistic about the state 's future. In fact, times were such that Gov. William R. Merriam inhis final biennial address in 1893, warned the Legislature not to pass too many laws. \"It is one of the prevailing evils, if I may be permitted to say so, of all legislation of thepresent time that there is too great a tendencyto seek remedies for ills that are impossible tocure through legislative enactment, \" Merriam said. \"To provide a panacea for every trouble, whether imaginary or real ... must result inclogging the statute books with legal formsutterly impossible of execution. \" Old-world flavor Celebration marks the re-opening of the restored Capitol cafeteria Lost for decades underneath layers of paint and plaster, the Capitol cafeteria hasre-emerged in nearly its original form. The Minnesota Historical Society de- voted an entire week to celebrating its re-opening Feb. 7 to 11. The week kicked off with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday morning with Gov. JesseVentura, Lt. Gov. Mae Schunk, and DavidFisher, commissioner of administration. The cafeteria is known as the Rathskel- ler, which is the German word for \"meet- ing place \" Fisher said. The idea behind the original cafeteria was to give the men of theLegislature \u2014 since women weren 't even al- lowed two years and cost more than $2 mil-lion, recreated most of the 29 German mot-toes and 16 design motifs found on the archedceilings of the room. It took six months aloneto uncover the original artwork and draw rep-licas to match it. Several renovation projects over the years had covered up the original designs. Fishersaid that during the temperance movementin the early 20th Century, officials decidedto change some of the mottoes, which en-couraged drinking and leisure time, so thatthey reflected the virtues of temperance,thought to be more prudent at the time.Anti-German sentiments during World War I led to the mottoes and German sym-bols being painted over. The people who worked on the restoration of the cafeteria used photographs and otherhistorical documents to determine what theartwork looked like and to recreate it. Conservator Dan Tarnoveanu deliber- ately chose slightly different colors for thereplicas, so it would be clear that they aredifferent from the originals. Throughout the week, the project archi- tect and art conservator delivered speechesabout the project. Staff at the historical so-ciety also gave presentations on the history of the cafete-ria and thetraditional foods served there. A German well. \"There 's no other way to gather people together thangood food, \" said Schunk. V entura, in his speech, said he hopes the new cafeteria will foster goodwill amongthe lawmakers and give them a place to re-lax in between meetings. He even joked that the Capitol reporters, with whom he has clashed at times duringhis term, might benefit from the new design. \"Maybe even the Capitol press corps will be nice to us now that we 've given them a nice place to go and have lunch, \" the gov- ernor said. Gov. Jesse Ventura, right , cuts the ribbon during ceremonies Feb. 7 to open the newly restored Capitol cafeteria. Other offi-cials on hand included, from right , Lt. Gov.

Sept. 21, \"We are always making distinctions in crime based on harm done. \" Brian Rusche, executive director of the Joint Religious Legislative Coalition, said he waspleased with the bipartisan support for the bill. \"We feel very strongly this legislation can repudiate these acts and isolate perpetrators, \" Rusche said. He said it 's important for people who burn crosses and paint swastikas on buildings tounderstand the magnitude of their acts, eventhough the crimes associated with them aretechnically only minor property crimes. \"I can 't see how (a misdemeanor) reflects the terror that crime brings into a commu-nity,\" Rusche said. Oertelt is hopeful the bill would lead to change. \"My hope is these idiots will be a bit more scared because they will be punished for some-thing they weren 't before, \" he said. Oertelt is writing a book about his experi- ences that he hopes will be published this year.He said he is occasionally the victim of biascrimes, often in the form of hate mail. \"It is frustration and anger, \" he said. \"People who refuse to learn from history. \" The committee had discussed this proposal during an interim meeting last October. TheSenate, which passed a similar bill last year,currently has a version awaiting a hearing inthe Senate Crime Prevention Committeesponsored by Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St.Paul).Continued from page 15 One proposal (HF2617) would establish joint House and Senate standing committees,a concept that is found in the Connecticut andMaine legislatures. Instead of having two ver-sions of the same bill in each body, the jointcommittees would introduce one bill thatwould \"ping pong \" back and forth to recon- sider and amend the bill. The other (HF2718) proposal is loosely based on Sweden 's parliament, McElroy said. It would retain two bodies, but each wouldhave slightly different duties. One body \u2014 the \"Assembly \" \u2014 would be like the proposed unicameral Legislature, re-sponsible for passing most legislation and de-termining the biennial budget. The other body \u2014 the \"Council \" \u2014 would confirm some types of legislation, such as lawsthat change the number of members of thelegislature, change district boundaries, pro-pose a constitutional amendment, cause theContinued from page 16 Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) said it seems the governor \"overlooked rural Minne- sota\" and asked why the administration 's plan isn't more balanced. The $1 billion bonding law passed in 1998 included more than $281 million for highereducation facilities. This year 's Legislature is free to add or subtract projects from thegovernor 's proposal. On Feb. 9, MnSCU officials came before the Higher Education Finance Committee to be-gin explaining the system 's bonding requests in full. Chancellor Morrie Anderson said MnSCU is a \"big system with big needs \" and he told lawmakers that the state 's strong economy is at least partly a product of good colleges anduniversities. \"We have an opportunity because of good times, \" Anderson said. \"I think that should be a winning opportunity. \"Continued from page 18state to incur debt, change tax rates, eliminate a tax or establish a new tax. The \"Council \" would also confirm governor 's appointments, which is currently done by the Senate, exceptthat McElroy 's proposal would add judicial appointments and deputy commissioners tothose that are currently confirmed by the Sen-ate. Also, members of the \"Council \" from the metropolitan area would serve as the Metro-politan Council, and remaining memberswould form a \"Greater Minnesota Council. \" The Met Council is currently an appointed body. Leaders have criticized that structure,saying it makes the council less accountablebecause its members don 't have to face voters periodically. The Governmental Operations and Veter- ans Affairs Policy is considering the unicam-eral bill and other reforms proposed by Housemembers. No action has been taken yet on thebills.MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 S TATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

Jesse Ventura's 2000 tax plan ran into strong criticism in a Feb. 15 hearingof the House Taxes Committee. In fact, two of the people carrying the governor's tax bill in the House \u2014 chief spon-sor Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) and co-sponsor Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope)\u2014 were among the harshest voices in the mix. On one point, committee members agreed with the Ventura administration \u2014 Minne-sotans will likely receive a tax rebate sometimethis summer. But lawmakers found much to criticize in the specifics of the governor's proposal, whichincludes a plan to establish a $75 maximumfee for motor vehicle license tabs. Abrams ripped the governor's proposal to carry over $855 million from the current bud-get surplus into the next biennium, to be usedfor tax reforms. Several legislators this year are pushing vari- ous proposals to cut taxes, while it seems thegovernor's carryover plan would leave the tax-cutting debate until next year. \"This is a governor who during his cam- paign said he was going to send it all back,\"Abrams said. Rest agreed that there is little chance the Legislature will approve that amount ofcarryover. She said with no concrete reformproposals on the table, it is fiscally irrespon-sible to not balance the state's books at the endof the biennium. Right now, the state has a forecast surplus of $1.58 billion, which could be eliminated this bi-ennium through tax rebates, new spending, or,most likely, a mix of both. The governor wouldbring some of that surplus into the next budgetcycle. Committee members also criticized parts of the governor's plan involving significantchanges to the funding structure for state op-erations such as transportation. The committee took no action on the bill (HF2938) but will consider it further whencompiling this year's omnibus tax package. Matt Smith, commissioner of theDepartment of Revenue, presented the governor's proposal, which would use surplusbudget funds for a sales tax rebate. \"It will return the remaining '99 balance to the same general population as last year's re-bate, \" he said. \"It is a $470 million sales taxrebate returned to around 3.2 million people. \" Under the governor's proposal, the Revenue Department would mail rebate checks by mid-summer. Smith said the governor's bill is more inclu- sive this year, adding about 245,000 people toreceive rebates by expanding the pool to includesenior citizens living on Social Security andpeople receiving disability income. There also is a proposed extension for those who were eligible to receive a rebate last year but did not file in time. It is estimated thatthis extension would allow 12,000 people toreceive a rebate at a cost of $3.5 million. However, the governor's proposal would not expand the rebate to those claimed as depen-dents on their parent's tax returns. Smith saidto include them would require a manual pro-cess that would be inaccurate, cumbersome,and expensive.Under the bill, the average rebate for mar- ried couples would be $280, and for single in-dividuals $139. The minimum for marriedcouples would be $125, with a maximum of$1,750. For single filers, the minimum wouldbe $71, while a maximum of $875. However, several state funding provisions in the governor's bill raised alarm among com-mittee members. Abrams raised two issues from the 1999 ses- sion where the governor appears to have cir-cumvented the legislative process. He said that one of the governor's propos- als last year approved by a House-Senate con-ference committee was an automatic \"settleup\" provision establishing the criteria for howrebates will be issued from future budgetsurpluses. Then the governor vetoed a proposed cut in the health care provider tax, an action thatincreased the amount of last year's surplus by$85 million dollars without any legislative in-put. Abrams said to allow a governor to set the eventual amount of a budget surplus is too easily susceptible to politics. \"This points out why the Legislature ought to be setting the amount of the rebate,\"Abrams said. Abrams said the veto of the proposed trans- fer of general fund money to supportMinnesotaCare, the state's health insuranceprogram for low-income people, led to a vio-lation of law by Department of Finance Gov. Jesse Ventura announces his proposed $470 million sales tax rebate during a news conferenceearlier this month. The governor's tax plan has met criticism in the House.4 February 18, 2000IT'SAFACT In the 1950s, certain Minnesota busi- nesses exploited scores of children, whosesize and speed made them valuable com-modities. The state 's child labor laws were often overlooked, trumped by the need forcorporate profits. But the children were not being pressed into labor in some awful urban sweatshopor forced to spend long days at work in anorthern mine. The sector of the business world respon- sible for the most child labor violations?Bowling alleys. T een-agersaround the state worked aspinsetters, and their em-ployers seemed to havesome trouble abiding by therelatively lax limitations ofMinnesota 's labor laws. State law at that time made it illegal for minors under 16to work after 7 p.m. or before7 a.m. Those children alsocould not work more thaneight hours a day and 48hours a week. And the law prohibited chil-dren under 14 from working in a factory, mill,or mine, or in the construction of anybuilding. Between July 1, 1956, and June 30, 1958, the state issued 446 citations for violations ofchild labor laws. A total of 345 of those werefor running afoul of standards regardinghours of work (mostly for keeping childrenon the job too late in the evening). Fifty-sixwere for \"dangerous employment, \" and 26 were for employing children in \"beer parlors or where liquor was served, \" according to the biennial report of the Department of Laborand Industry 's Industrial Commission. The violations involved a total of 647 children. Most of them \u2014 395 to be exact \u2014 were 15-year-olds, but some of the cases involved much younger children, including10 workers who were just 10 years old. Bowling alleys, retail stores, restaurants, and theaters, in that order, were responsiblefor most of the illegal employment prac-tices, the Industrial Commission found. In most cases, businesses that violated child labor laws were issued orders to com-ply, and inspectors would return to ensureA different kind of strike 1950s teens were not spared from illegal labor practices violations did not persist. Criminal pros-ecution was rare, coming only when seri-ous offenses continued after repeatedwarnings. During the two years detailed in the re- port, three bowling alley operators wereprosecuted for violations involving child la-bor. All three cases ended in convictions. The report bemoaned the fact that Minnesota 's child labor laws were outdated \u2014 most of them had been enacted in 1909 \u2014 and called on the 1959 Legislature to make changes. Foremost amongthe Industrial Commission 's recommendations was a callfor the minimum age for fac-tory, construction, or minework to be moved from14 to 16. There were no recom- mendations specifically re-lated to bowling alleys andtheir frequent violations. Child labor laws had not changed by the time the In- dustrial Commission issued its next bien-nial report in 1960, and the number ofcitations issued by the state had increasedby more than 200. But bowling alleys were no longer the chief violators. Retail stores, restaurants, and agri-cultural operations, in that order, were moreoften cited for child labor offenses. So what happened to knock bowling al- leys out of the top spot? A change in the bowl-ing industry might have played a part insolving the problem. Brunswick had installedthe first automatic pinsetter in 1956, sealingthe ultimate fate of teen-age \"pin boys. \" Minnesota 's current labor laws are more restrictive than those of 40 years ago. Children under 14 cannot be employed, except as newspaper carriers, actors, models,or farmhands. Limits on the employment of14- and 15-year-olds dictate the hours of daythey can work and the maximum number ofhours they can log in a week. The child labor law also includes a long list of prohibited occupations for all mi-nors. The list includes mining, logging,construction, operating heavy machinery,and bartending.

Abrams said shefailed to do so, knowing it was unlikely any-one would sue the department over the viola-tion. \"Just because someone thinks it 's the right thing to do doesn 't mean it 's the legal thing to do,\" he said. \"The governor was able to take credit for the veto, and not take responsibilityfor the rest of the statute. \" Abrams was also critical of the governor 's proposed cut in the motor vehicle registrationtax. The bill would set maximum tab feesat $75. Smith said the cap was a key part of the governor 's plan, being a permanent tax cut provision. He said that as the governor hastraveled across the state he has continued tohear from people who dislike the tax and feelit should be reduced. He said that 55 percent of vehicle owners in the state would see an immediate reduc-tion. Currently about 40 percent register at theminimum $35 amount. Revenues from the tax currently go to the state 's highway fund and would be replaced with a one-time general fund payment of $276million. The governor supports placing a con-stitutional amendment on November 's ballot proposing the dedication of 54 percent of fu-ture motor vehicle sales taxes to go to the high-way fund to offset the revenues lost createdby registration tax reduction. In addition, the governor is proposing to create a new multimodal transportation andtransit fund that would be receive its revenuefrom a statutory dedication of 46 percent ofthe motor vehicle sales tax. Thus overall trans-portation funding would increase under thegovernor 's plan even though the motor vehicle registration tax would be reduced. However, the governor hasn 't developed an alternative plan, should the constitutionalamendment fail at the polls. In comparison to neighboring states, Min- nesota does have a higher tax, Smith said. Abrams suggested Ventura 's motor vehicle tax plan is too regressive, shifting more of theresponsibility to those less able to pay. Smith acknowledged that is somewhat true, but he also emphasized those objectionsshould not derail the plan. \"The tax relief proposal needs to happen, \" he said. \"The governor sees the need to in- crease transportation funding. It is clear howcritical infrastructure investment is the kindof thing we need to do to keep Minnesotacompetitive. \" A young pinsetter at work in a St. Paul bowling alley. (N. Healy)Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 1 0 - 1 7 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #CHILDREN#BUSINESS Subsidy requirements reconsidered Easing reporting requirements for small businesses that receive government subsidiesis one of the goals of a bill approved Feb. 17by the House Jobs and Economic Develop-ment Policy Committee. The bill (HF3057), sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), would make a num-ber of changes to subsidy reporting require-ments that were established last year. McElroy said that the increased reporting requirements were originally included in a1999 bill authored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls). That bill did not pass the House butseveral of its provisions were included in theSenate 's omnibus tax bill and were agreed to by House conferees. McElroy 's bill would re-define the term \"business subsidy \" to apply only to amounts over $100,000. Currently, subsidies are definedas those over $25,000. The existing law also requires wage and job goals for all subsidies. The bill would allowthose job goals to be set at zero, if it is deter-mined that job retention and creation are notpurposes of the subsidy. A zero job goal wouldrequire a public hearing. McElroy said the bill also would change the current law prohibiting a recipient of a sub-sidy from moving locations within five years.The bill would allow the recipient to move atany time after a public hearing is held. Clark offered an unsuccessful amendment that would have kept the dollar amount de-fining a subsidy at $25,000. That provision waspart of her bill last session after a task forceconcluded it was a fair amount, she said. She said that welfare recipients have strin- gent reporting requirements for every dollarthey receive and it was not unfair to expectthe same from businesses who receive publicsubsidies. Iric Nathanson, from the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, said thatthe reporting requirements discourage smallentrepreneurs, particularly immigrants, fromseeking the assistance they need to get a busi-ness going. Beth Fraser, from the Minnesota Alliance for Progressive Action, said that in 1997, 177 sub-sidies fell under the $100,000 threshold. Shesaid this amounted to more than $11 million.For such substantial amounts of public fund-ing, subsidy recipients should be held account-able for the goals they set, she said.The bill was sent to the House Local Govern- ment and Metropolitan Affairs Committee. Bonding request advances Although Gov. Jesse V entura did not rec- ommend any bonding for early childhoodlearning facilities, the House Family and EarlyChildhood Education Finance Committee onFeb. 16 approved $5 million for such projects. The measure will advance in the form of a recommendation to the House Capital Invest-ment Committee. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) said she was angry the governor didnot include any early childhood projects in his$400 million bonding plan. The committeeagreed with her, and members approved therequest. \"This is the least we need, \" McGuire said. \"If we come in with only $1 million, they will think that is all we need. \" Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) sided with McGuire, saying the education facilitiesare needed. \"I think it looks really bad for the House in a bonding year to do nothing for early child-hood facilities, \" Mariani said. \"The governor thinks what we do here is 'nice. ' It's not nice to not invest in kids. \" The bonding request does not pertain to any#CONSUMERS Visitors to the Capitol rotunda Feb. 16 were treated to a short concert by the Anoka ClusterElementary Honors Choir. The choir, conducted by Debra Halstenson, is composed of fourthand fifth graders from seven schools in the Anoka-Hennepin School District.KIDS' CONCERTspecific sites or projects; it only aims to givethe money to the Department of Children,Families and Learning for construction of fa-cilities to promote early childhood education. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior), who chairs the committee, initially suggested the commit-tee aim for $1 million because of the tightbonding bill requested by V entura. McGuire was critical of V entura for mak- ing \"healthy and vital communities \" a major portion of his Big Plan initiative and then notfunding this request. Tracking telemarketers T elemarketers should be required to regis- ter with the state and should not use technol-ogy to block caller-identification devices, saidRep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee). Daggett is sponsoring a bill (HF2942) that would require telemarketing firms to pay a $75registration fee to the secretary of state. Violators would have to pay a $50 fine within 60 days. If a solicitor continued to vio-late the law, the state would assess a $500 finefor every 60 days until the solicitor isregistered. The Regulated Industries Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee approvedthe measure Feb. 14 and sent it to the full com-mittee, which approved it Feb. 17.6 February 18, 2000#CRIMEThe bill would also require that telemarketers be fined $500 for blocking theirphone number from appearing on caller-iden-tification boxes. Registration information would have to in- clude name, address, telephone and fax num-bers and e-mail addresses. Informationchanges would cost an additional $35. \"There 's been a lot of fraud, especially with senior citizens who are very vulnerable, \" Daggett said of telemarketers. \"They are not reputable and we have no way of knowing whothey are. \" The bill would not ban telemarketing; it would only require registration. Daggett said300,000 Americans work as telemarketers,making 1.8 million calls each day. None of thefirms those workers represent are registeredin Minnesota. Glen Dorfman of the Minnesota Associa- tion of Realtors opposed the bill. Dorfmansaid people can register on a federal 'do not call' list. People also have the option to ignore telemarketers, Dorfman said. \"Enough is enough, \" Dorfman said. \"Sup- port current law. If citizens don 't want these calls, let them hang up. \" Citizens gain valuable information from telemarketers, Dorfman added. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) ques- tioned why the bill pertains only to telephoneadvertising and does not include solicitorswho use e-mail or U.S. mail. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) supported the Daggett bill, sharing a story about how hisgrandmother was swindled by a phone scam.He said it is much easier to discard mail thandisregard a phone call. \"These people can be very persuasive and really play on your emotions, \" Gunther said. Need for lab questioned Members of the House Judiciary Finance Committee heard a bonding request Feb. 17to build a new Minnesota Bureau of CriminalApprehension facility in St. Paul. The Department of Public Safety, which administers the bureau, is asking for $58 mil-lion in bonds to finance construction of thefacility. Gov. Jesse Ventura has recommendedfull funding for the project. Frank Dolejsi, director of the bureau labo- ratory, said that a number of renovations havebeen performed on the existing lab on Uni-versity Avenue. However, the needs of law en-forcement agencies in the state are no longerbeing supported. For example, it takes the lab 74 days to ana- lyze DNA, 60 days for drugs, 90 days fortoxicology reports, 150 days for firearms analysis and 120 days for latent fingerprints.The goal in the new facility is 30 days for allanalysis, Dolejsi said. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) ques- tioned whether the analysts could use the cur-rent lab space and staff it 16 or 24 hours a dayto speed up the analysis. Public Safety Com-missioner Charlie Weaver said even if the labworked around the clock, it wouldn 't have the space to do all the work. Several law enforcement officials from around the state also testified in favor of theproject. St. Paul Police Chief William Finneysaid his department 's lab does not accommo- date some of the sophisticated analysis thatthe bureau laboratory does. Police officials in outstate Minnesota said they could not sufficiently investigate crimeswithout the bureau. Dolejsi also discussed concerns over an ex- isting mold problem in the ceiling at the bu-reau laboratory. He said there 's a possibility evidence could be altered because of the moldproblem. The committee will soon rank bonding pro- posals and forward a recommendation to theHouse Capital Investment Committee. State courts in funding pinch State judicial branch officials argued their case before House Judiciary Finance Commit-tee on Feb. 15 for more money to cover severebudget shortfalls anticipated through fiscalyear 2001. The judicial branch is requesting $3.1 mil- lion in funds to cover a deficit for fiscal year2001. Officials say the court system 's operat- ing budget has been forced to absorb signifi-cant increases in personnel costs over the pastfew years. That budget is no longer sufficient to cover the increases, said Sue Dosal, state court ad-ministrator. \"We have literally wrung out every little bit of flexibility that we had, \" Dosal said. More than half of the shortfall \u2014 $1.98 million \u2014 involves insurance costs alone, which increased between 23 and 42 percent,depending on the program employees elected. Though they 're not requesting the money, the courts expect to accumulate a $2.1 mil-lion deficit for the current fiscal year. Dosal said the judicial branch is trying a number of strategies to cut costs, includingholding all new judgeships or existing judge-ships open for five months, holding open lawclerk and other staff positions, reducing fund-ing for jury trials, reducing use of retiredjudges, and holding down the bottom of thepay range.However, officials said, these cutbacks will ultimately affect the citizens relying on theefficiency of the court system. Judge Leslie Metzen from South St. Paul said many judges are going without clerks, so theyare required to do their own research and filetheir own orders. The more time they spendon these administrative tasks, Metzen said, theless time they spend on the bench. And with increasing caseloads, she said, they don't always have spare time during the day to get to the orders and filings fast enough,thus making parties on both sides wait longer. \"This ultimately has an effect on them, \" she said. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), who chairs the committee, said the panel willconsider the branch 's request among other spending proposals, possibly combining theminto one bill. Drunken driving laws clarified Drunken driving laws would be clarified under a bill approved Feb. 11 by the HouseCrime Prevention Committee. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji), who is spon- soring the legislation, led a task force thatworked during the interim on plans for sim-plifying the laws. Police officers would have abetter grasp of DWI laws with this legislation,he said. All drunken driving laws would becompiled in one new section of statute. The bill would provide few substantive changes to DWI laws, but it would create sepa-rate levels of impaired-driving crimes. Therewould be a three-tiered system of first-, second-and third-degree drunken driving offenses. The third-degree offense, a misdemeanor, would apply to all impaired driving offenses.The second-degree level, a gross misdemeanor,would include one aggravating factor. A first-degree offense would have two or more ag-gravating factors. Aggravating factors are prior impaired- driving offenses in the past 15 years, a blood-alcohol concentration higher than 0.20 at thetime of the offense, and driving impaired withchildren under age 16 in the vehicle. The bill would remove one aggravating fac- tor \u2014 driving drunk while crossing train tracks. State Trooper Mike Asleson told the com- mittee the bill doesn 't change the law much, but it would help officers understand the com-plex DWI statutes. \"It's so important that this be simplified for officers, \" Asleson said. The bill (HF2995) was referred to the House Judiciary Finance Committee.Session Weekly 7#EDUCATION Profile of Learning moratorium passed Minnesota 's Profile of Learning would be put on hold, under a bill the House approvedFeb. 17. The vote was 97-34. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), was amended on the Housefloor to include an indefinite moratorium onthe Profile. When it arrived on the House floor, the bill was focused on the controversial writing testadministered to high school sophomores lastmonth. Kielkucki 's bill (HF2720) would require test booklets to be scored and returned to students,and it would guarantee that the question givento students this winter would not be usedagain. The test asked students to write aboutsomething about themselves they would liketo change, and it drew fire because of the per-sonal nature of the question. On the House floor, Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) offered an amendment toplace a two-year moratorium on the Profileof Learning portion of the state 's Graduation Standards initiative. \"We're going to have a train wreck at gradu- ation time if we don 't do something, \" Pelowski said. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall) upped the ante, asking lawmakers to change the amend-ment so it called for a \"permanent moratorium. \" Seifert 's plan won approval and the bill was passed with the amendment attached. The leg-islation now goes to the Senate. Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm) expressed disappointment over the amendedversion of the bill, calling it a missed oppor-tunity to improve the Profile of Learning hadthe House simply limited the moratorium totwo years of study. \"We had an opportunity to do something positive for school districts in the form of Rep.Pelowski 's amendment, but what we ended up with is legislation that will never receive thegovernor 's approval, \" he said.Funds for physically disabled Separate bills sponsored by Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) would increase learn-ing opportunities for people who are blind orphysically disabled and appropriate money tostate academies for the deaf and blind for as-set preservation. The first bill (HF2790) would dedicate $1.35 million from the state 's general fund to the com- missioner of the Department of Children, Fami-lies and Learning for planning, design costs, andimprovements to the Library for the Blind andPhysically Handicapped in Faribault. The second bill (HF3287) would authorize the state to issue up to $3.8 million in bonds for vari-ous improvements at the Minnesota Academiesfor the Deaf and Blind, including electrical up-grades and sewer and water improvements. Both bonding requests were given consid- eration by the House K-12 Education FinanceCommittee Feb. 16, although a decision to takeaction was delayed until further informationon precisely how much money would be avail-able for bonding projects is released. Speaking in support of HF2790, Edina resi- dent Nadine Jacobson, who is blind, told thecommittee a bill that would allow the libraryin Faribault to expand its book and tapeselection would be of benefit to her andfamilies in situations like hers. Jacobson said her husband and two adopted children are also blind and appreciate the re-sources the Faribault library and librariessimilar to it provide. \"In considering this issue, I would hope you'd remember that libraries for the blind and handicapped have special funding needsand should not be treated in the same breathas other public libraries, \" Jacobson said. Gov. Jesse Ventura has recommended pro- viding only $600,000 for the Library for theBlind and Physically Handicapped in hisbonding proposal. Mary Helen Pelton, superintendent of Cass Lake-Bena School District, holds up art work made bystudents from Cass Lake-Bena ElementarySchool during her testimony before the HouseK-12 Education Finance Committee in support ofa bill that would provide bond funds for theschool district.K-12 bonding projects pitched Education-related capital projects totaling upwards of $53.1 million were consideredFeb. 14 by the House K-12 Education FinanceCommittee. Project requests presented before the com- mittee have received the support of theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing and were submitted to the Department ofFinance. The governor 's bonding plan was drawn from requests sent to the latter. The committee delayed action on the projects until further information is released regardingprecisely how much money will be available for K-12 projects in this year 's bonding bill. The proposals call for bond proceeds to go to the Caledonia, Cass Lake, Red Lake, LaPorte,and Ulen-Hitterdal school districts for either building projects orimprovements toexisting structures. The Caledonia School District a current secondary school toserve as an elemen-tary school. Bonds totaling about $7.5 millionare also beingsought by the CassLake School Districtto fund a newmiddle school forgrades 5 to 8. The Red Lake School District isseeking $11.2 mil- lion to construct an early childhood facilityand to renovate a middle school and elemen-tary school. The LaPorte School District is seeking more than $7 million in for a variety of projects. Officials from the Ulen-Hitterdal School District came before the committee in searchof about $4 million for the construction of a building to house kindergarten through 6thgrade students. Of the requests mentioned, Gov. Jesse V entura has suggested partial funding for theprojects in the Caledonia, Cass Lake, and RedLake school districts. The governor 's bonding proposal provides no funding for the LaPorteand Ulen-Hitterdal districts. The committee also considered a handful of requests not originally submitted to theDepartment of Finance. Those requests in-cluded $4.1 million in general obligationbonds to construct a K-8 facility in the PinePoint School District and $5.2 million toSt. Paul 's Achievement Plus program for con- tinued construction. K-12 Education Finance Members: 17 (10 R, 7 DFL) Scope: Provides policy direction and funding for the state's K-12 sys- tem, including all publicschool districts, the Department of Children, Families & Learning,public libraries, and the Permanent School Fund.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILE8 February 18, 2000#ENERGY Code exemption proposed The House Commerce Committee ap- proved a bill Feb. 15 that would exempt bor-der cities from the state 's new energy code requirements. The bill (HF2652), sponsored by Rep. KevinGoodno (R-Moorhead), would allow the cit- ies of Breckenridge, Dilworth, East GrandForks, Moorhead, and Ortonville, which arelegally designated as border cities, to revert tothe energy code that was in place prior to July1999. Last year the Legislature passed a law requir- ing the Department of Administration to de-velop design and construction standardsregarding heat loss control, illumination, andclimate control. These standards are in addi-tion to the other building-related standards. Goodno said that the new energy code will increase the cost of construction on newhomes from $3,000 to $10,000. He said thatcost increases put border cities at an economicdisadvantage. \"This increase will stifle new housing starts, \" he said. Greg Johnson, a spokesman for the Asso- ciation of Minnesota Building Officials, spokeagainst the measure. Johnson said that allow-ing exemptions to the code would be confus-ing to contractors who would not be surewhich code requirements applied in the par-ticular jurisdiction. \"What 's good for Minnesota is good for all of Minnesota, \" Johnson said. Linda Taylor from the Department of Com- merce also testified against the bill. Taylor saidthe new energy code was written so that theenergy savings would offset the increasedbuilding costs within 10 years. She said if thebill passes it would leave the border cities withno residential code requirement. \"Non-uniformity is not good public policy, \" Taylor said. Goodno said that the new energy code would not necessarily save homeowners en-ergy costs and that even under last year 's leg- islation, the state does not have a uniformenergy code. He said the statute currently ap-plies to cities with populations of more than2,500 people. The bill now goes to the House Governmen- tal Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee.Matching workers with jobs Identifying areas where there may be skilled workers whose abilities are not being used isthe focus of a bill proposed by Rep. GeorgeCassell (R-Alexandria). Cassell told the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee on Feb. 14that the bill (HF2840) would appropriate$600,000 to the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development for grants to study areaswhere the skill sets or education of the availableworkforce are underused. The grants would goto local or regional development agencies. \"This would help us identify workers that have specific skills but aren 't using those skills in their current employment, \" said Gary Fields, a department official. The bill was approved Feb. 16 and sent to the House Ways and Means Committee. Fields said studying the area would help both the companies looking for workers witha specific skill and the workers themselves. Dr. Richard Lichty, a professor at the Uni- versity of Minnesota, Duluth, said that the northeastern region of the state was surveyed in 1994 with a grant from Minnesota T ech-nology, Inc. The survey identified several is-sues related to the emerging workforceshortage. This bill, Lichty said, would establish simi- lar projects to collect information covering theentire state. According to the measure, the department would establish the criteria for the grants, withprojects eligible for up to 60 percent of thetotal project costs. Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) said she was concerned that the bill doesn 't attempt to ad- dress a larger problem of businesses not pay-ing high enough wages to attract and retainqualified workers. Lichty said that he agreed that high paying jobs are needed to address the workforce shortage. \"I'm not an economist, but there is no shortage if the price is right, \" he said. Light from litter A bill that would pave the way for a power plant designed to burn poultry lit-ter as fuel was approved Feb. 16 by theHouse Commerce Committee 's Subcom- mittee on Regulated Industries. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), spon- sor of the bill (HF2757), explained the pro-posal stems from the 1994 Prairie Islandlegislation, which required a public utilityoperating a nuclear powered plant to de-velop 125 megawatts of electric energy gen-erated by farm grown biomass.#EMPLOYMENT Tracking success of adult education The state would begin tracking adult basic education graduates after they have completedthe program, under a bill considered Feb. 16by the House Family and Early ChildhoodEducation Finance Committee. Sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excel- sior), the bill (HF2554) would require adultbasic education providers to ask students fortheir Social Security numbers. The state wouldthen receive information from the Depart-ment of Economic Security regarding whetherthe graduates are employed and how muchmoney they are earning. \"When they leave our program, we have no idea what happens to them, \" said Carlye Peterson of the Minneapolis schools district.\"We have no way to track our learners. \" Tracing economic information through the department is easier and more cost-effectivethan telephone surveys, said Barry Shaffer ofthe Department of Children, Families andLearning. He estimated the state would spend$55,000 to $75,000 on data matching. T ele-phone surveys would cost $200,000 to$400,000, he said. Peterson said she prefers the data match- ing. She said many people have disconnectedtheir phones, phone numbers change, andmail is rarely returned. \"It would be difficult to ask a person, 'Do you have a job and how much do you make? '\" Peterson said. Adult basic education teaches skills to people who do not have high school diplo-mas. Many of the participants are foreign-born and are just beginning to learn English. Federal law requires the information to be collected, Shaffer said. Each state can decidethe best route for collecting the data. Federallaw also says states cannot use sampling mea-sures to obtain its information. Even though providers would have to ask, under the measure, students would not be re-quired to provide the Social Security informa-tion. Shaffer said in other states that collectSocial Security numbers, about 5 percent ofpeople decline. \"They want to learn, they want to be there, and they would probably provide it, \" Shaffer said. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) wanted to know if students wouldbe given a written statement saying how theinformation would be used. Sykora said thatis not in the bill. The bill would cost about $52,000, Sykora said, but that cost would be paid by the fed-eral government. Claudia Fuentes of the Urban Coalition in St. Paul said the legislation would have a nega-tive effect on adult basic education students. She said many of those students from foreigncountries are fearful of government. It maykeep some of them from attending classes, shesaid. The committee took no action on the bill.Session Weekly 9Jennings said the bill would provide 50 of the 125 megawatts from a facility that usespoultry litter as its primary fuel source. Rubert Fraser, the chief executive officer of Fiberwatt, the British company proposing tobuild the plant in Minnesota, said because thestate is the second largest turkey producingstate in the country, it is an ideal location forthe facility. Fraser said that the plant is similar to two other biomass projects already approved bythe Public Utilities Commission \u2014 one that uses urban wood waste and another whosefuel source is whole tree combustion. \"We're just looking for a level playing field, \" Fraser said. Fiberwatt owns and operates three poultry litter power plants in Great Britain. The plantsproduce energy by burning the litter at 1,500degrees Fahrenheit, producing steam thatdrives a turbine. Fraser said the company works closely with the local communities to adapt to the plantsettings. \"We are good neighbors and responsible members of the community, \" he said. David Morris from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit organization thatresearches environmental economic develop-ment issues, said that instead of focusing onone technology and one company, the statewould be better off investing in other energysources including wind-generated power. \"This bill is premature and ill-conceived, \" Morris said. He said the bill would provide an$80 to $140 million public subsidy to burn an Rupert Fraser, chief executive officer of FibrowattLimited, testifies before the Regulated IndustriesSubcommittee of the House Commerce Commit-tee on Feb. 16 in support of a bill that wouldmodify the state's biomass mandate to allow a fa-cility that uses poultry litter to generateelectricity.First law of 2000 session extends ice fishing season The 2000 ice fishing season was ex- tended by nine days, under a law signedFeb. 16 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. It is the firstnew law of the 2000 session. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), who said it would helpsmall businesses and resorts in areaswhere ice fishing is popular. Those busi-nesses lost potential income due to un-usually warm weather in the early winterand a lack of snow. Under state law, the ice fishing season lasts until the third Sunday in February,which this year would be Feb. 20. The new law extends the season through Feb. 29. The extension also in-cludes the spearing season. The Senate sponsor was Sen. Pat Pariseau (R-Farmington). The law (HF2980/SF2763*/CH251) was effective Feb. 17.inexpensive fertilizer that might be in shortsupply. Linda Taylor, from the Department of Com- merce, said that the department is suggestingan alternative proposal to tally up the biom-ass energy created by Northern States PowerCompany sources and then accept bid propos-als to make up the difference. The bill now goes to the full Commerce Committee. #GOVERNMENT #HEALTHUnicameral proposal advances The secretary of state would be required to publish an informational guide for voters re-garding a proposed switch to a unicameral leg-islature, under a bill that was sent forward bythe House Governmental Operations and Vet-erans Affairs Policy Committee on Feb. 14. The committee voted unanimously to send the bill (HF159) without further recommen-dation to the House State GovernmentFinance Committee. The bill, sponsored by House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), would put a constitu-tional amendment on the ballot in Novem-ber. If the voters were to approve theamendment, the House and Senate would bereplaced by a single legislative body in the year2003. Rep. Mark Gleason (DFL-Richfield) sug- gested the requirements for the voters ' guide, which would contain \"arguments commonly advanced in support of and opposition to bi-cameral and unicameral state legislatures. \" The voters ' guide would be distributed statewide, and related legal notices would be publishedin qualified newspapers. Rep. T ony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), co- sponsor of the bill, disagreed with Gleason 's proposal, because it would be hard to define\"commonly advanced \" arguments. Many ar- guments have been presented on the issue, andhe said it would be hard to provide an equalamount of information on all of them. But Gleason said he would welcome any attempt to provide balanced information.Holding up a brochure on unicameralism thatwas published by Gov. Jesse V entura 's office and Minnesota Planning, Gleason said itsclaims are not supported with facts and itdoesn 't list any counter arguments. \"The governor is trying to promote this idea, and this does not make any attempt tomake it unbiased, fair, objective, or balanced, \" he said. \"I have a problem with them spend- ing taxpayers ' money on this and not provid- ing any balance. \"Alternative health care bill on hold After several hours of debate, the House Civil Law Committee delayed a vote on legal-izing alternative health providers. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is spon- soring a bill (HF537) that would allow alter-native health providers to practice inMinnesota. However, several legislators ex-pressed concern about the lack of consumerprotection in the bill. Alternative health practitioners include people who provide services such asacupressure, energetic healing, aromatherapy,herbalism, and meditation as a means to curesicknesses. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter) proposed an amendment that would haverequired all alternative health providers toobtain an official license. \"I'm not willing to give them greater pro- tection than licensed practitioners, \" he said. Diane Miller, a lawyer with the Minnesota Natural Health Reform Project, said her groupobjects to licensing. \"It eliminates many, many alternative health providers that are already practicing, \" Miller said. She suggested that instead of licensing them, alternative providers should be required by lawto prepare a disclosure form of their prior ex-perience and give it to clients. That way pro-viders would be bound by fraud statutes andface potential lawsuits if they were untruth-ful. Carruthers said licensing might be10 February 18, 2000necessary. He opposed language in Boudreau 's bill that would eliminate criminal sanctionsand limit civil actions that could be broughtagainst unlicensed health providers. \"If licensing is so bad, proponents of this bill should say, 'We should get rid of licensed doctors and dentists, '\" Carruthers said. \"Who wants to visit an unlicensed dentist? \" The full licensure amendment failed, along with another Carruthers amendment thatwould have established an investigative andenforcement measure within the Health De-partment. The amendment also outlined dis-ciplinary action and conduct that wouldexclude a person from practicing alternativehealth. \"It does what they say they want, but with- out all the special protections, \" Carruthers said. The investigation amendment also failed.The bill can be recalled at anytime by the committee chair, Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound). Boudreau said she believes she had enough votes to pass the bill before it was delayed. \"I don 't think the concept is destroyed, \" she said. Eight-year-old Robby Mancini, Oakdale,stands next to his father, Bob, in the Capitolrotunda Feb. 14. Robby, who was diagnosedwith diabetes when he was 2 years old, wasone of many who spoke about how diabeteshas affected their lives. The event was spon-sored by the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. DIABETES RALLYHotdish and health standards Much to the delight of scores of casserole- loving Minnesotans, a bill that would easehealth regulations regarding food served atcommunity potluck events was approvedFeb. 15 by the House Health and Human Ser-vices Policy Committee and sent to the Housefloor. \"I'm hearing from church ladies from all over the state, \" joked Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL- Willmar), who said his bill (HF2707) is an at-tempt to clarify state health regulations as theyapply to community potlucks. The idea behind the bill originated when Juhnke, attending a DFL bean feed at theAmerican Legion in Willmar, was told healthregulations prevented outsiders from bring-ing prepared food into community potlucks. Aggie Leitheiser, assistant commissioner of the state 's Health Protection Bureau, said such restrictions exist to prevent outbreaks of food-borne disease. Over the past four years,Leitheiser said, 16 percent of the confirmedfood-borne disease outbreaks in the state weretraced to privately prepared food. So, following health regulations to the let- ter, organizers of the event in Willmar politelyrejected Juhnke 's beans, asking him to return them to his car. After the experience, Juhnke said he felt all people should be allowed to attend commu-nity potlucks and share their food withoutbeing subject to health inspection.The bill Juhnke brought before the committee would allow any person attendinga potluck event, not just members of the or-ganization sponsoring the event, to bring in-dividually prepared food for consumption. It also would allow an organization sponsor- ing potluck events to advertise the events andpermit people who are not members of the or-ganization to attend the event and eat the food. Patient privacy A bill that would specify when health main- tenance organizations (HMOs) are prohibitedfrom disclosing personal, privileged, and gen-eral health information about patients or ap-plicants received the approval of the HouseHealth and Human Service Policy Commit-tee on Feb. 17. Sponsored by Rep. Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley), the bill (HF3225) would make it clearwhat HMO responsibilities are concerning is-sues of data privacy. An existing subdivision of law prohibits the release of data relating to the diagnosis, treat-ment, or health of any enrollee or applicant,but does not specify to whom it applies. Gerlach 's bill would rewrite the subdivision to make it apply to HMOs, granting excep-tions when there are cases of express consent,a court order, or when an individual is sus-pected of violating a law. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said he sup-ports the bill but that it needs clarification on how the bill might be interpreted if a com-municable disease outbreak were to arise. \"My only concern in looking over this bill would be that it might lock things up so tightlythat it would prohibit, say, counties from act-ing in cases of public good, \" Haas said. According to information provided by the nonpartisan House Research Department, theMinnesota Department of Public Health hasstatutory authority to collect data about pa-tients when a public health epidemic surfaces.St. Paul resident Richard Neumeister spoke infavor of the proposed legislation and offereda few possible changes to the bill the authormight consider as the measure travels throughthe process of committee. Some of Neumeister 's suggestions to modify the bill included establishing an enforcementmechanism to aid patients in getting access totheir records and making the willful or negli-gible disclosure of patient health informationa crime punishable by law. The bill was referred to the House Civil Law Committee. Organ donation plan advances Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) wants to disseminate more information aboutorgan donations. Luther, who had an emer-gency liver transplant in February 1998, issponsoring a bill that would raise money forpublic awareness of donations. The House Transportation Policy Commit- tee approved the bill (HF2635) Feb. 15. Thebill would create a $1 checkoff on driver 's li- cense applications. Money raised from thecheckoff would then be used to make pam-phlets and purchase equipment, such as amobile unit, to increase awareness of theprogram. \"It's an innovative approach to solve this crisis, \" Luther told the committee. Approximately 1,160 Minnesotans are cur- rently on organ donor waiting lists, said Su-san Gunderson, executive director forLifeSource. \"Every day, 12 people die waiting for an organ transplant, \" Gunderson said. About six in 10 Minnesotans have signed on as organ donors on their driver 's license, Gunderson said. \"If everyone who could donate when they died did we would virtually eliminate the wait-ing list, \" she said. \"When people have the cor- rect information, the checkoff rate is evenhigher. \" Several states have a $1 checkoff program, Luther said. Ohio has raised $1.7 million withits checkoff, she added. Luther said she would be happy if theSession Weekly 11program netted $250,000 in Minnesota next year. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), who voted against the measure, said she feared that cre-ating the organ donor checkoff would lead tobills for more checkoffs from other goodcauses. Molnau said she would rather see a finan- cial checkoff on income taxes, similar to thenatural resources checkoff. Luther said it is better to place the checkoff on driver 's license forms because people are already choosing whether they want to be adonor at that time. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) noted the Department of Public Safety is equipped tocollect and disburse the checkoff funds be-cause it fulfills that function for other pro-grams. The bill passed after Rep. T om Workman (R- Chanhassen), chair of the committee, attachedan amendment that would require the fund-ing recipient to report to the Legislature in2002 on total receipts and expenditures raisedthrough the checkoff. The bill now awaits action in the House Transportation Finance Committee. Susan Gunderson, left , executive director of LifeSource, and Jim Connolly, chief of examina-tions and inspections for the Driver and VehicleServices Division of the Department of PublicSafety, testify in support of a bill that would re-quire that an application for a new or reneweddriver's license contain a provision allowing theapplicant to add a $1 donation for purposes ofpublic information and education on organ dona-tion. Plan to cover health costs A proposal that would use money generated by the state 's lawsuit against Big T obacco to off-set the cost of premium taxes and healthcare provider taxes received the approval ofthe House Health and Human Services PolicyCommittee Feb. 15. The bill (HF2716), sponsored by Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), would transfer one-time and ongoing tobacco settlement pay-ments into the state 's health care access fund, and provide for a contingent elimination ofboth the 1 percent premium tax andMinnesotaCare provider tax beginningJan. 1, 2001.\"We have a great opportunity here with the funds available from the tobacco settlementto make health care coverage more affordableby offsetting what many feel are, quite frankly,hidden taxes, \" Bradley said. Bradley 's bill comes at a time when many people are expressing concern over risinghealth care coverage costs. Figures show thatthe average family in Minnesota pays approxi-mately $6,000 a year for health care coverage,according to Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth), co-sponsor of the bill. Huntley said what many people do not re- alize is it 's ultimately the employee, and not the employer, who pays the cost of his or herhealth benefits. T o support Huntley 's claim, some studies have shown that between 83 and 100 percentof the real cost of employer contributions tohealth coverage is borne by workers, throughoffsetting wage cuts. Blanton Bessinger, from the Minnesota Medical Association, spoke favorably of thebill and told the committee it would providethe greatest relief to low-income patients andfixed-income senior citizens with substantialpharmaceutical costs. \"Our health care tax system, as it exists now, is rather flawed and regressive, \" Bessinger said. Regressive in the sense that the poorest 10percent of Minnesotans account for onlyabout 1 percent of income earned but pay 2.6percent of the MinnesotaCare tax, while therichest 10 percent pay a far less percentage oftheir total income to the tax, Bessinger said. The bill now heads to the House Health and Human Services Finance Committee. #HIGHER EDUCATION Art Building must go, officials say Deplorable. That 's one word Steven Rosenstone, dean of the College of Liberal Artsat the University of Minnesota, had for thecondition of the Art Building on the Minne-apolis campus. \"'Deplorable ' hardly begins to describe it, \" said Rep. Peggy Leppik, chair of the HouseHigher Education Finance Committee. \"It is an absolute disgrace to the university and tothe state. \" Rosenstone and other U of M officials de- tailed the university 's capital spending pro- posal during Feb. 14 and Feb. 16 hearingsbefore Leppik 's committee. The U of M is seeking $134 million in bond proceeds to finance 10 capital initiatives. TheArt Building has become a focus of attentionfor several reasons, not the least of which isthe governor 's lack of support for the project.Gov. Jesse V entura 's bonding proposal would provide $54 million for the U of M,with funds for three of the university 's top four priorities. He left out the Art Building, whichthe university ranked third. The U of M wants to tear down the Art Building \u2014 actually a 1921 industrial facility converted for university use in the 1960s \u2014 and replace it with a new structure consideredthe centerpiece of the \"arts quarter \" being de- veloped on the West Bank. The new building would cost $44 million, but only $21 million would come from thestate. The rest would be paid for with univer-sity funds and private donations. A 1998 lawprovided $730,000 in state funds for planninga new building. Rosenstone painted a grim picture when he told lawmakers about the problems of the cur-rent facility. For starters, the building is notup to snuff when it comes to fire safety, airquality, and handicap accessibility. \"The building is a hodgepodge of dysfunc- tional spaces, \" Rosenstone said. The governor 's plan would provide $35 million for the Molecular and CellularBiology Building on the Minneapolis campus,$10 million for a Microbial and PlantGenomics Building on the St. Paul campus,and $9 million for maintenance work on allcampuses. V entura did not recommend fund-ing for a proposed music performance centerat the Duluth campus, a sports facility inDuluth, and renovation of buildings atCrookston and Morris. Lawmakers took no action on the matter, but the committee will eventually compile aset of bonding recommendations for post-sec-ondary institutions in Minnesota and sendthat list to the House Capital InvestmentCommittee. A major maintenance backlog A backlog of nearly $500 million in main- tenance work would continue to grow underthe governor 's bonding plan for the Minne- sota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU)system. MnSCU requested $100 million in bond funds for repair and maintenance projects atits 36 institutions. The money would pay for294 individual projects such as roof repair,tuckpointing, plumbing work, heating andcooling system improvements, and fire sprin-kler installations. During a Feb. 11 meeting of the House Higher Education Finance Committee, offi-cials from MnSCU explained their 20-yearplan to eliminate the backlog of maintenanceprojects. The committee took no action on thematter. Allan Johnson, MnSCU 's associate vice12 February 18, 2000chancellor for facilities, said the backlog would continue to grow if lawmakers follow Gov.Jesse V entura 's plan to provide only $30 mil- lion for maintenance work. Under the governor 's plan, there would be enough money to repair \"only the worst of the worst, \" Johnson said. The $100 million request would allow MnSCU to begin chipping away at a backlogcreated by years \u2014 even decades - of deferred maintenance, Johnson said. At least $56 mil-lion would be needed just to prevent the main-tenance backlog from growing even larger. The governor 's $30 million would pay the $6.1 million needed for boiler repair and re-placement at Winona State University, an itemVentura line-item vetoed from the 1999 bond-ing bill. But approval of only $30 million would force MnSCU to delay dozens of other repairprojects, such as roof replacement at theMoorhead State University library, asbestosabatement at Normandale Community Col-lege, and replacement of bleachers at severalcampuses. The repair and maintenance spending is listed as MnSCU 's top priority for this year 's bonding bill, but the system also requestedfunds for 23 new construction projects. The list of priorities is topped by an $18.1 million addition for science classrooms and labsat Normandale Community College, an $11.1million addition at North Hennepin Commu-nity College, $8 million to renovate and add onat St. Cloud T echnical College, and $18.3 mil-lion for a new library at Minneapolis Commu-nity and Technical College.Justin Bing, center , a student at Normandale Community College, carries a sign challenging Gov. Jesse Ventura for financial aid during a Feb. 16 rally on the Capitol steps. The Minnesota State College Stu-dent Association's annual lobby day gave students the opportunity to talk with legislators about sev-eral issues, including lower tuition, bonding to renovate facilities, and the proposed closure ofAnoka-Hennepin Technical College. #HUMAN SERVICES#LOCAL GOVERNMENTThe governor 's plan does not include funds for the St. Cloud project or for 19 otherprojects proposed by MnSCU. MnSCU 's total request of $230 million in- cludes other projects ranging from $16.7 mil-lion for a new library at Metropolitan StateUniversity to $300,000 for renovations atRiverview Hall at St. Cloud State University. Benefits verification program The state would begin using a service that tracks undocumented aliens who apply forpublic assistance, under a bill approved by theHouse Civil Law Committee. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is spon- soring a bill (HF2837) that would require thecommissioner of Children, Families andLearning to verify the immigration status ofall recipients using a federal program calledSystematic Alien Verification for Entitlements(SAVE). The SA VE program ensures that benefits would only go to citizens and qualified non-citizens, Boudreau said. Assistance includes food stamps, general assistance, and Minnesota Family InvestmentProgram (MFIP), which is the state 's welfare reform initiative. It is unclear what the total cost of the pro- gram would be. The cost for each inquirywould range between 2 cents and 23 cents, butBoudreau did not say what makes one inquirycost more than another. The software and employee training also must be factored intototal costs, she said. Currently, 45 states use SAVE to determine whether a person is eligible to receive benefits,Boudreau added. Minnesota received a waiverfrom participating in SAVE, and this bill wouldeliminate the waiver. Patricia Mattos, an immigration lawyer, spoke against a second part of the bill that re-quires the department to turn over data onunregistered immigrants to the U.S. Immigra-tion and Naturalization Service (INS). Mattos said the INS provision will have a \"chilling effect \" on people who are in the country legally and qualify for benefits. INSsearches could cause delays for people seek-ing benefits, she said. She said she fears the bill would cause people to be singled out by law enforcementfor \"looking Mexican and speaking Spanish. \" She told the committee about a lawsuit in Ari-zona because the state did not comply withthe Civil Rights Act. However, Mattos said she does not have any concerns about using SA VE for benefits. The committee sent the bill to the House Health and Human Services FinanceCommittee. Funds for wastewater treatment The House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee was given an overviewFeb. 16 of the governor 's $26 million bonding request for wastewater treatment projects. T erry Kuhlman, director of the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority, said the governor 's request includes $12.8 million for the statematching funds that would draw five federaldollars for every state dollar. The loans to local governments would be made available through two different pro-grams: the Water Pollution Control Revolv-ing Fund administered by the MinnesotaPollution Control Agency and the DrinkingWater Revolving Fund administered throughthe Department of Health. The funds would be used to address critical infrastructure needs associated with drinkingwater and wastewater facility improvements. Kuhlman said the funds help communities contain the high costs associated with theprojects. And he told lawmakers the governor is also recommending $8 million for the agency 's Wastewater Infrastructure Funding, whichsupplements water pollution loans to matchgrant assistance from the U.S. Department ofAgriculture.Session Weekly 13Christopher English, an engineer from the federal Agriculture Department, said that sev-eral of the state 's smaller towns and cities are not properly treating and disposing of theirwastewater. He said many communities havesewer systems that are failing to meet perfor-mance and discharge requirements. The esti-mated cost to upgrade and replace thosesystems is over $1 billion. Nancy Larson, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Association of Small Cities, and Remi Stone,a lobbyist for the League of Minnesota Cities,said the governor 's decision not to recom- mend additional funds for the WastewaterInfrastructure Fund would mean several cit-ies would not be able to complete theirprojects. Stone said the fund provides gap funding for low-revenue communities. Also, by notproviding matching funds, the state is in es-sence turning down federal funds. \"It is a huge mistake, \" she said. The Wastewater Infrastructure Fund re- ceived $20.5 million in the 1999 bonding bill,of which approximately $3 million is left.#RECREATION New storm sewer requested The city of Bayport asked the House Judi- ciary Finance Committee to fund a new stormsewer project Feb. 17. The city, which is home to the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Stillwater, suffers fromperiodic flooding in the winter, because thestorm sewer system built to service the prisonis damaged. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) testified for the project, along with Bayport City Ad-ministrator Ken Hartung. Holsten said the old storm sewer pipe, con- structed from clay, used to flow directly intothe St. Croix River. However, damming on theriver has raised the water level and the stormsewer pipe is now covered over by water. As aresult, the pipe is damaged. In addition, a spring-fed pond, which the prison had used for water supply for manyyears, is not being drained enough and thewater is flooding areas of Bayport via a stream,Hartung said. The project cost is estimated at $3.8 mil- lion. Bayport is requesting bonds for theproject because the storm sewer is technicallythe state 's responsibility. Members of the committee will consider the proposal for inclusion in its omnibus bond-ing request.ATVs on forest trails A bill that would modify some of the state 's policies regarding all-terrain vehicles in stateforests was approved Feb. 15 by the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources PolicyCommittee. The bill (HF3213) also would modify the procedures used by the Department of Natu-ral Resources to conduct timber sales. A 1999 law deleted some of the DNR 's ad- ministrative rules relating to the use of all-ter-rain vehicles in state parks and forests. The bill,sponsored by Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), would restore some of those de-letions. Under the bill, those vehicles would be al- lowed only on specific, designated trails. Theonly exception would be for big-game hunt-ers in October through December who use thevehicles to help carry animals. Steve Simmer,recreation and land programs coordinator forthe department, said the vehicles cause lessdamage during those times because theground is generally frozen. Also, the bill would specify that no one may cut trees to construct unauthorized, perma-nent trails on forest lands. The provisions of the bill related to timber sales are designed to improve customer ser-vice and administrative efficiency within thedepartment, said Bob T omlinson, assistantdirector of the DNR 's forestry division. Zoo bonding requests Minnesota Zoo officials explained their $5.1 million request for capital projects to theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesFinance Committee on Feb. 14. The request includes $1.1 million to replace parts of the heating and cooling system. Thesystem mainly consists of a boiler and under-ground pipes, which carry water to controltemperatures in buildings and in exhibits. Thepipes are leaking in some areas, and the boileris more than 20 years old. Jim Reinholdz, vice president of finance for the zoo, said the system is critical because BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE Leah Lumley, left, and her sister Hannah share the best seat in the House, their grandfather Rep. Howard Swenson's, during the Feb. 17 floor session. The girls are the daughters of Markand Ruth Lumley of Austin, who were visiting for the day.The department determines how much tim- ber can be harvested each year on state-ownedlands while sustaining forest areas. Some committee members wanted the pub- lic to be more involved in those decisions. Rep. Margaret Anderson Kelliher (DFL- Mpls) proposed an amendment that wouldrequire the DNR to publicize each timber auc-tion. Also, each geographic unit of the forestrydivision would have to prepare a public noti-fication plan every five years. The committee voted against Kelliher 's pro- posal. But a similar proposal by Ozment wasadopted. Under that proposal, the DNR wouldbe required to notify the public each year be-fore its annual harvest plans. The bill now moves to the House Govern- mental Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee.14 February 18, 2000 #TRANSPORTATION THE STATES50 Evidence on file States fight crime with by collecting, storing DNA profiles Law enforcement officials across the United States are increasingly using DNA technology as a crime-fighting device, and not merely as evidence for trials. As a result, several states and the federal government are working more aggressively to col- lect DNA samples into massive databases. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) residue provides a genetic fingerprint often used to identify suspects from hair, bodily fluids, or other materials found at crime scenes. Currently, every stateallows the collection of DNA samples from some convicted criminals. Last October, the FBI unveiled a nationwide system, linking databases from all 50 states into one integrated information system of convicted criminals' DNA samples. However, each state gathers the DNA data differently. Thirty-one states require people con- victed of any violent crime to provide a sample. Nineteen states require only sex offenders todo so. Louisiana is the only state that allows DNA testing of people arrested (as opposed to con- victed) in certain sex crimes. Implementation of that practice has been delayed because of aneed to upgrade the police laboratory to handle the increase in testing. Opponents of the increasing the number laws requiring DNA samples worry about privacy issues, while proponents say that DNA samples are merely more detailed fingerprints, whichare commonly gathered in databases. In New York, a new law that took effect on Dec. 1, 1999, added 86 crimes \u2014 including arson, burglary, and drug offenses \u2014 to the number of offenses subject to mandatory testing. Previ-ously only eight percent of convicted criminals in the state were obligated to give DNA samples,mostly those convicted of violent crimes. New York Gov. George Pataki, with the support of the New York City police, actually pro- posed a measure that would have required the collection of DNA samples from anyone cur-rently serving a felony sentence. It also asked for a feasibility study of taking DNA samplesfrom suspects arrested for any felony-level crime. In Minnesota, samples are currently only required from registered sex offenders. After July 1, 2000, people convicted of murder, assault, kidnapping, and burglary will also be required togive DNA samples. (D. Maeda)Rail maintenance funds requested Railroads across Minnesota would be up- graded if the Legislature provides an addi-tional $12 million for the Minnesota RailService Investment Program. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) is spon- soring a bill (HF3011) that would authorizegeneral obligation bonds for the upgrades. \"The rail needs upgrading, \" Swenson said. \"If it was upgraded, it would be used a lot more. \" Al Vogel, an official with the state Depart- ment of Transportation, told the House Trans-portation Finance Committee on Feb. 16 that$17 million has been requested in projects, butonly $6.3 million is currently available. Theadditional $12 million would sufficiently meetthe current needs. The project was not included in the governor 's bonding proposal, Vogel said. Francis Schweiss, Renville County commis- sioner, told the committee the rail upgradesare needed. \"We consider it the lifeblood of the farm- ing community, because it is the best way to#TAXES Property tax cut proposed The Property Tax Division of the House Taxes Committee heard two bills Feb. 14 thatwould address the rising cost of renting anapartment. HF2201, sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), sponsored byTim Wilkin (R-Eagan), would reduce the classrate on the market value of apartment build-ings (those with four or more units) from 2.4percent to 2 percent. \"I hate to use the term, but it would be a shift in taxes, \" Dawkins said. \"It would shift on to the state sales tax and income tax andreduce the government 's over-reliance on the property tax. \" Wilkin 's bill would reduce the rate in 2001 while Dawkins ' bill would spread the costs out over two years, reducing the rate from 2.4 per-cent to 2.2 percent in 2001 and to 2 percent in2002. The Department of Revenue estimatesthe costs of either bill would be $39.3 over thebiennium. The committee took no action on either bill but will consider them for inclusion in theomnibus tax bill. Wilkin said the rapid increase in the costs of rent is directly related to having too manyrenters and not enough apartments. Jack Horner, from the Minnesota Multi- Housing Association, said that the average rentin the metro area is $728, while the averagevacancy rate is 1.7 percent. He said that ide-ally the area should have a 4 to 5 percent va-cancy rate. Horner said reducing property taxes would encourage new construction and rehabilita-tion of aging apartment complexes, thus in-creasing and preserving the supply. He said that landlords have learned that sim- ply increasing rental rates to offset tax increasesis not efficient. At the same time, he said, moregovernment subsidies are also not the answer. \"It is not good for the government to be the primary financier of housing, \" Horner said. \"In other countries where government is, it doesn 't work very well. \"many of the animals need certain tempera- tures to live. The zoo opened in 1978 afterabout four years of construction, so parts ofthe facility are deteriorating. The remaining $4 million of the request would be to rebuild paths, roads, and parkinglots at the zoo. The committee will consider including the zoo's request in its recommendation for capi- tal projects.move our goods, \" Schweiss said. The program was created in 1976 to rehabili- tate rail lines. The system usually provides grantsup to $200,000 on short lines, Vogel said. Since the program began, the state has spent $52 million, which has generated an additional$42 million in private or federal dollars, he said. Gene Short, Redwood County commis- sioner, said each train car carries about thesame capacity as 3.8 semi-tractor trailers. Iftrain lines are not improved, more trucks willbe on the road on two-lane highways, he said. Schweiss said there are several gravel quar- ries in his county. \"Everything right now is being shipped by truck, \" he said. Bruce Pinske, Seneca Foods plant manager, said his company is losing profits because itships by truck instead of train. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) asked if money from this program could be used oncommuter rail improvements. Vogel said itcould not, noting this money is aimed spe-cifically at the smaller rail lines. Legislators will consider including the bill in the committee 's bonding proposal.Session Weekly 15Subsidizing success Increasing support for productive ethanol plants is key to success in a depressed market, farmers say BY MIKE DELARCOSteve Muller, a farmer from Cottonwood County, is aware of the hardships thatlow crop prices and unpredictable weather can present for families dependentupon agriculture to pay the bills and put din-ner on the table. For a growing percentage of farmers, Muller said, concern over the uncertainty of crop rev-enue during any given year can, at some point,be overwhelming. But many farmers who, likeMuller, grow corn in Minnesota have foundthat production of ethanol might be morethan just a temporary solution to a somewhatsagging farm economy. Muller, a partner in the Ethanol 2000 plant in Bingham Lake, said that state subsidies forthe production of ethanol have providedfarmers in his area an alternative when cornprices are low. The plant, he continued, has also created many jobs. \"The ethanol industry as a whole means a lot to myself, my family, and the communitywhere we live and work, \" Muller said in testi- mony before a House committee. Ethanol is a form of alcohol distilled from corn and used as an additive to fuel. SinceOctober 1997, all fuels sold in Minnesota must have an oxygenated additive like ethanol. Growth has been a staple at the Ethanol 2000 plant since its inception. A few ethanolplants in the state, including the plant inBingham Lake, have, in fact, been able to ex-ceed their approved eligibility level of 12 mil-lion gallons a year. But, because such plantsare not eligible to receive payments for pro-duction above the agreed-to level, many feeltheir progress is not being rewarded. A bill sponsored by Rep. Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea) would allow ethanol producersto qualify for state provided payments basedupon actual production rather than documentedcapacity levels. The bill (HF2698) was approvedFeb. 10 by the House Agriculture and RuralDevelopment Finance Committee. Dorman 's proposal would increase the maximum production level for producer pay- ments to 15 milliongallons per year perplant. Currently,plants that were oper-ating at the approvedcapacity of 12 milliongallons per year as ofJuly 1, 1998 but arenow producing morecould only receiveproducer paymentsup to the 12 milliongallon limit. Currently, plants are receiving pay-ments of 20 cents pergallon of ethanol. \"In a year when we have a surplus of dol-lars at our disposal, Ithink this is a pro- posal that should be fully funded, \" Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) said. In addition, the bill would increase the amount of ethanol payments from $68.4million approved in 1999 to $72.4 million. Osthoff said he is also planning to propose legislation that would place a ban on the useof the oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline in Minnesota later thissession. Concern has surfaced in recentmonths that spills of gasoline containingMTBE can lead to problems of drinking wa-ter contamination. A proposal to ban the use of fuel contain- ing MTBE could benefit the ethanol industryby increasing demand for the fuel additive. Government subsidies for ethanol produc- tion were introduced in the 1970s partly toreduce America 's dependence on foreign oil and partly to trim pollution associated withthe burning of traditionally-blended fuel. Proponents of ethanol-blended gasoline con- tend its use reduces pollution, helps to betterbalance the United States ' trade deficit, and ex- pands the American job market as ethanol-pro-ducing plants continue to surface in rural areas\u2014 not just in Minnesota, but across the nation. Many ethanol plants in Minnesota are owned and operated by farmer cooperatives. Encour-aging the ethanol industry to continue to growwill allow for a bit more stability in farming com-munities across the state, Dorman said. Dorman 's bill would also remove a quar- terly cap of $8.5 million in total producer pay-ments by the state and allow a plant that hasactual production below approved capacity inany of the first seven quarters of a bienniumto recapture the \"lost\" payments in the last quarter of the biennium by producing more. The bill would keep the cap on total annual payments to a plant at $3 million. There continues to be some opposition to the use of ethanol-blended gasoline. T ests haveshown that fuel containing ethanol can leadto lower gas mileage. Also, the vapor pressureassociated with ethanol-blended gasoline ishigher and occasionally can hamper a car 's acceleration capability. Maple Grove resident Bret Collier testified before the committee in support of eliminat-ing subsidies for ethanol production. Collier said his car had engine problems in the past due to ethanol-blended gasoline, andhe argued that reports have shown there is noscientific proof that ethanol-blended gasolinesignificantly benefits environment. Also, big oil companies have consistently opposed subsidies to the ethanol industry,claiming that doing so is unfair for purposesof marketplace competition. Dorman 's bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. AT ISSUE: AGRICULTURE # # # Dave Kolsrud, board chairman of a Luverne farmer cooperative, testifies be-fore the Agriculture & Rural Development Finance Committee on Feb. 10 insupport of a bill that would increase subsidies to ethanol producers.16 February 18, 2000BY CHRIS VETTERAdvances in DNA testing mean evidence can remain fresh for years after a crimeis committed. \"Memories fade, but DNA profiles never change, \" Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner told the House Crime PreventionCommittee on Feb. 15. But even with that compelling evidence, if time has run out on the ability to prosecutethose cases, officials are powerless to bring theperpetrator to justice. Gaertner hopes to eliminate the state 's cur- rent statute of limitations guidelines on sexoffense crimes, manslaughter, and criminalvehicular homicide offenses. Statute of limitations refers to the number of years that attorneys have to convict an of-fender after a crime has been committed. Forinstance, the law states that an arsonist can-not be convicted after five years have passedsince the incident. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) is spon- soring a bill (HF2892) that would eliminatethe current nine-year statute of limitations onsex offense crimes when the victim is olderthan age 18. The bill also would eliminate thestatute of limitations on any crime that re-sulted in the death of a person, from vehicu-lar homicide or manslaughter. With new technology developed in recent years, detectives can compile physical evidencefrom fingerprints to fiber analysis to catch anoffender. Gaertner, who for the first time brought DNA evidence before a jury in 1989, told leg-islators the practice is now commonplace. Gaertner also described a series of rapes in Milwaukee in 1993. The crimes were all com-mitted in a similar style. Samples taken from thethree victims have been matched to the same of-fender. Now, about seven years after those rapes were committed, the offender has not been caught.The prosecutor in Milwaukee filed criminalcharges last October against John Doe based onthat man 's DNA, in hopes to circumventTime to fight crime Some seek to extend the statute of limitations for sex crimes and other serious offenses Wisconsin 's statute of limitations law. The likelihood that another man has the same DNA as John Doe is one in 1.96 billionto one in 7.25 billion, according to the courtcomplaint. Gaertner fears the plan will fail, and she doesn 't want to see Minnesota prosecutors try a similar route. \"We're asking the Legislature to move on this now, before any prosecutor has to standbefore you and say, 'It's too late. Maybe next time, '\" she said. According to Gaertner, DNA evidence has linked a prison inmate to a murder that oc-curred four years ago in Rochester. It also con-nected a sex offender to a rape in Minneapolisseven years ago. Statutes of limitation couldstop similar cases from leading to convictionsin the future, she said.More of these older cases could be solved in the future as states link together through anational DNA database. Minnesota is among23 states that are linked in the system that wascreated in October 1998. Statutes of limitation are in place because witnesses die and memories fade over time,according to the nonpartisan House ResearchDepartment. Ideally, a case would be broughtto the court when the details are fresh in theminds of witnesses. In the past 10 years, Minnesota has loos- ened its statute of limitation rules. In 1989,the state approved a special limit for cases in-volving minors who fall victim to sex offend-ers. Cases involving minors, who may haverepressed memories of sex crimes or kept si-lent out of fear, were given two years of extratime. In 1991, the state expanded that timeframe from two to three years. Then in 1995, the statute of limitations on all criminal sexual conduct cases was stretchedfrom seven years to nine years, giving pros-ecutors more time to seek convictions. An important rule in sex crime cases is the offense must be reported within 72 hours, ifthe victim is 18 or older. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire(DFL-Falcon Heights) asked if the length oftime should be longer. Gaertner said the hour-limit should stay in place, saying it gives the victim some time torecover from the incident, but it also givespolice prosecutors ample opportunity to col-lect samples and begin an investigation. Stanek 's bill is expected to become part of a larger measure addressing sex offender lawsthat will be assembled later this session. Another proposal expected to be part of stat- ute of limitations legislation this year pertainsto kidnapping cases. Rep. Wes Skoglund(DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring a bill (HF2493) thatwould eliminate limitations in kidnapping cases. Skoglund said the bill arose from his con- cern over the Jessica Swanson case, in which athree-year-old girl vanished in GoodhueCounty in 1995. Dale Jenson, the boyfriendof Swanson 's mother, admitted to accidentally killing the girl last year, but he could not beprosecuted for kidnapping because the timelimit had expired. While the likelihood of a similar case oc- curring is remote, Skoglund said, the stateshould pass a law to keep the case open be-yond the current three-year limit.

County law enforcement officials are concerned that their lim- ited resources inhibit their ability to even house the area 's prisoners, let alone keep them from coming back.A full jailhouse Local officials want to replace overcrowded, outmodedcounty jails with new regional facilities Landborg and other officials say rural jails aren 't providing the adequate pro- gramming services to keep inmates fromreoffending. And the officials contend newregional facilities are necessary to provideenough space to house all the offendersand to provide rehabilitation programs. \"The people in these facilities keep coming back, coming back, comingback, \" said Scott Arneson, coordinator for Aitkin County. \"Why? It 's because we're not doing a lot to try and get these people to not come back. \" Aitkin County is one of many in Min- nesota working in cooperation withneighboring counties to build regional jailfacilities. The House Judiciary FinanceCommittee has heard requests for nineregional construction projects at a totalestimated cost of nearly $163 million. Most of the consortia are requesting that a portion of the projects be funded by statebonds. The rest would be covered with localmatching funds. Kevin Corbid from the Association of Min- nesota Counties said each community request-ing funds has assumed no more than 50 percentof the total costs will come from the state. Only seven of the regional jail projects were submitted to the Department of Finance bythe September 1999 deadline. Those seven re-quests totaled $67.3 million in state bonds. From 1989 to 1998, average daily population in the state 's jails grew from 3,718 to 5,282, an increase of 42 percent. Officials attribute the in-creases to several factors, most of which are con-trolled by state policy-makers. For example, in the early 1990s, studies showed that states could save large amountsof money if certain felons were sentenced tojail time rather than state prison, otherwise known as downward departures. In 1997, the state sent 880 felons to county jails. According to the state Sentencing Guide-lines Commission, Minnesota saved more than$68 million in operating costs during that year. Aitkin County has experienced a 32 percent overall inmate increase in the past five years.It has organized with five neighboring coun-ties \u2014 Cass, Crow Wing, Morrison, T odd, and Wadena \u2014 to build a 174 bed facility in Brainerd at an estimated cost of $16 million. Currently, those six counties have an average daily population of 251 inmates in their jails anda total population of 325 inmates including the74 being monitored electronically. However, 39 inmates are housed out and 83 people in those six counties are currently onwaiting lists to get into jail and serve their sen-tences.\"If you want my opinion, that 's a crime right there, \" Arneson said. \"People should not have to wait to get into jail after they commit acrime. \" Other consortia of counties in the state are following suit. Only two regional facilities arecurrently operating in Minnesota. One ofthem, operating since 1976, needs to buildanother facility to meet growing needs. Tri-County Community Corrections, a joint venture of Red Lake, Polk and Normancounties, plans to build a new 200 bed facilityfor $16.9 million. Officials from rural counties say their con- cerns go beyond merely locking up lawbreak- ers. With limited resources and smalljails, each individual county cannot pro-vide adequate programs to keep offend-ers from going back behind bars. The central Minnesota proposal in Brainerd includes operating the jail with17 chemical dependency counselors,adult basic education programs, andother mental health resources. The practical impact of increased penalties and downward departures ofthe 1990s is that many of the state 's DWI and drug offenders serve their sentencesin county jails. As a result, those inmatesneed treatment. But beyond that, officials claim, many of the inmates lack work and social skillsto keep them from falling back into de-structive lifestyles. \"A lot of these people are missing basic life skills, \" Arneson said. The requests for state funds for the regional jails may be coming at a bad time. Gov. JesseV entura has not recommended any bondfunding for the projects. In addition, the gov-ernor has given judiciary spending a low pri-ority among other capital projects. \"It's not that I don 't support the idea, \" said Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), chair ofthe Judiciary Finance Committee. \"The commit- tee thinks there 's a definite need for regional jails, but a lot of the members are concerned. \" Beyond the money factor, legislators have ex- pressed concerns about the precedent that mightbe set if the state starts funding local projects. \"That 's the biggest argument against it, \" Broecker said. Broecker agreed that in order for the no- tion of regional jails to succeed, local govern-ments have to match any state funds. Regional Jail Bonding Proposals Source: House Judiciary Finance CommittteeAT ISSUE: CRIME # # #18 February 18, 2000BY BRENDA VAN DYCKMinnesota 's sex offender laws are more stringent now than 10 years ago. Tragically, it 's often been terrible crimes that have forced the toughening of these laws. And with the abduction and apparent murder of 19-year-old Katie Poirier last May, legislators are already looking to increaseenforcement of registration laws, close loopholes, and otherwisestrengthen the state 's sex offender laws.A continuing threat Infamous crimes have prompted efforts to protect citizens from sex offenders Efforts to toughen laws began in 1988, after two women were sexually assaulted and thenmurdered in Minneapolis parking ramps. Inboth cases, the perpetrators had extensive histo-ries of sexual violence against women and hadrecently been released from prison for sex crimes. Legislators responded in the 1989 session by increasing prison time for convicted sexoffenders. Under the law, individuals con-victed of first-degree murder, who either hadprior murder convictions or were guilty offirst- or second-degree criminal sexual con-duct (involving force or violence), would besentenced to life in prison without parole. In addition, a person with two previous sex offense convictions who was then convictedof first- or second-degree criminal sexual con-duct would be subject to a mandatory 37-yearprison sentence. The law also allowed courts to deviate from sentencing guidelines for offenders who couldbe defined as predators. For example, judgescould double sentences and require treatmentupon the person 's release. In addition, courts could civilly commit a patterned sex offenderunder the psychopathic personality statute. Other provisions in the 1989 law required probation officers to notify local law enforce-ment authorities of the address of a sex offenderwhen he or she was released from jail. The lawalso allocated more money for sex offender treat-ment programs for adults and juveniles. The Legislature followed up in 1991 by pass- ing a law requiring sex offenders to register theiraddresses with local law enforcement authori-ties when they were released from prison.In 1991, the state was again stunned by the rapes and murders of two young women. Oneof the women, Melissa Johnson, was sexuallyassaulted and killed by Scott E. Stewart, whohad been released from prison four days ear-lier for a 1988 rape. The murders promptedsome lawmakers to propose reinstating thestate 's death penalty. Then-Gov. Arne Carlson formed a 25- member Commission on Violent Crimes,which recommended creating a new \"preda- tory offender \" crime classification subject to life imprisonment. The commission also rec-ommended increasing the use of the psycho-pathic personality law, and increasingsupervision following release from prison to10 years for violent criminals. The 1992 Legislature followed some of those recommendations and passed a crime law thatagain increased sentences for sex offenders.Under the law, rapists who murdered theirvictims would be subject to life in prison with-out parole; they wouldn 't have to have prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct, aswas the case under the 1989 law. Offenders convicted of a rape for a third time would be subject to a mandatory life sen-tence with the possibility of parole after 30years. Those convicted of rape who had ear-lier been convicted of aggravated rape wouldbe subject to a mandatory 30-year sentence. All sex offenders would undergo intense su- pervision upon release from prison. Sixmonths prior to their scheduled release, all sexoffenders would be reviewed for possible civilcommitment to the state 's mental health hos-pital under the psy- chopathic personalitylaw. The law also in- cluded provisions forsexual violence pre-vention and sexual ha-rassment education. In 1994, the state was forced to deal withits psychopathic per-sonality law, then morethan 50 years old. Thelaw allowed the state tocivilly commit crimi-nals at the end of theirprison sentences. (Thelaw also allowed thestate to commit peoplewho hadn 't been con- victed of any crime, ifthey were proven to besexual psychopaths.) Passed in 1939, the law allowed commit-ment of anyone who showed \"emotional in- stability, or impulsiveness of behavior, or lackof customary standards of good judgment, orfailure to appreciate the consequences of per-sonal acts, or a combination of any such con-ditions, as to render such person irresponsiblefor personal conduct with respect to sexualmatters and thereby dangerous to other per-sons. \" In 1940, a requirement was added that a per- son could be committed if he or she had an\"utter inability \" to control his or her impulses. In essence, the law allowed the state to indefi-nitely hospitalize sexual predators if their be-havior was considered unstoppable. Registering sex offenders Sex offenders in Minnesota are separatedinto three different classifications, based onthe risk the offender poses to re-offend in thecommunity. Level 3 is the most serious clas-sification. The state's community notificationlaw requires information to be released ac-cording the offender's classification. Level 1: Victims and witnesses who have re- quested notification, people designated bythe prosecuting attorney, and other law en-forcement agencies are told of the offender'srelease and whereabouts. Level 2: Schools and day care centers are added to the list of those to be notified. Theyalso receive the offender's picture. Level 3: Community notices are posted and hearings are held, where law enforcement in-forms the community of the offender's re-lease and residence.Pam Poirier, at podium , lends her s Katie, was allegedly abducted an Fletcher, Rep. Karen Clark, Minne a and House Minority Leader Tom PAT ISSUE: CRIME # # #Session Weekly 19In January 1994, the state Supreme Court upheld the law by a 4-3 vote. Wanting to bol-ster the law against court challenges, the 1994Legislature set up a task force to study whatto do with the law and sexual predators. Thatsummer, the state Supreme Court ruled thattwo sexual offenders who had been civillycommitted should be released because theydidn 't display behavior that would mandate their commitment under the law. One of the men scheduled to be released was Dennis Linehan, who was civilly committed af-ter serving 27 years of a 40-year sentence for the1965 murder of a 14-year-old girl. Shortly afterthe murder, Linehan admitted raping a womanand assaulting a 12-year-old girl. He escapedfrom prison in 1975 and attempted to molest a12-year-old girl in Michigan. The Legislature met in special session to fix the law before any people who had been civ-illy committed could be released. Legislatorssettled on a law that created the category of\"sexually dangerous person. \" Such a person, according to the law, could be committed to a state hospital if he or she had ahistory of harmful sexual offenses, had a sexualmental disorder or dysfunction, and was con-sidered likely to engage in harmful sexual con-duct in the future. A key provision of this law isthat it did not require showing that the offenderwas unable to control his or her impulses. The law was upheld by the Minnesota Su- preme Court in 1996. That was also the year that the Legislature passed a community notification law, whichrequired authorities to notify communitieswhen convicted sex offenders were being re-Still seeking solutions Lawmakers propose new ways to combat sex crimes Sex offenders would be subject to stiffer pen- alties, longer registration periods, and restric- tions on legal name changes, under sex offenderbills advancing in the House. The bills come in the wake of the 1999 abduc- tion and apparent killing of Katie Poirier. The sus-pect in that case, Donald Blom, has a criminalrecord dotted with sex offenses. \"You're going to see a very tough bill on sex offenders,\" said Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove),who chairs the House Crime Prevention Commit-tee. \"It's our job to close loopholes, and we're do-ing it.\" Stanek's committee approved a handful of bills Feb. 15 and Feb. 17 related to sex offenders. Stanek is carrying a bill (HF2892) that would eliminate the statute of limitations for sex of-fenses. Rep. Barb Haake (R-Mounds View) is sponsor- ing a bill (HF2746) that would increase penaltiesfor not registering properly as a sex offenderfrom a gross misdemeanor to a felony. The state knows where only 35 percent of sex offenders live, Haake said. The existing penaltyis not strict enough to make offenders care aboutfilling out all the paperwork every time theymove or change jobs, she said. The maximum penalty for failure to comply with registration would be two years in prisonand a $4,000 fine. A second offense would leadto a maximum penalty of five years in prison anda $10,000 fine. Another bill (HF2747) would restrict the rights of all felons to change their names. The sponsor,Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), said the pub-lic should be given the right to know when fel-ons change their name.Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie) is sponsor- ing a bill (HF2896) that would require the stateto create a Web site with information on allLevel 3 sex offenders. Currently, the state pro-duces quarterly newsletters. Police would have the right to impersonate children in Internet chat rooms, under a bill(HF3037) sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund(DFL-Mpls). Skoglund is also sponsoring a bill (HF2993) that would allow, but not require, the Bureauof Criminal Apprehension to publicly share in-formation on sex offenders who have failed toregister. The information could be shared withthe media or on the Internet. \"I think the public would like to aid the (bu- reau),\" Skoglund said. \"I think it will have a posi-tive impact in gaining compliance.\" Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) is sponsoring a bill (HF3309) that would increase the proba-tionary period from 10 years to 20 years onLevel 2 and Level 3 sex offenders. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) is sponsoring a bill (HF2748) that would impose lifetime registra-tion for three categories of repeat sex offenders. Another measure (HF3112), sponsored by Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), wouldallow the checking of databases in the state tolocate the current residences of sex offenders. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) is sponsor- ing a bill that would require sex offenders toregister secondary (non-homestead) property. Stanek said all the sex offender bills will likely be rolled into one larger piece of legislation.The vehicle is expected to be HF2892, the billrelated to the statute of limitations for sex of-fenses.

Offenders are classified under three different levels and notification require-ments vary for each level \u2014 the higher the risk level, the higher the risk forreoffending. Therefore, notification be-comes more broad the higher the risk. The state 's community notification law is consistent with the national\"Megan 's law, \" which was named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was kid-napped, raped, and killed in 1994 by aNew Jersey neighbor, twice convictedof sexual assaults of young girls. In 1999, the Legislature passed a law that would revoke the teaching licenseof anyone convicted of criminal sexualconduct.

In the last two years, the state has autho- rized $100 million in bonding revenue to bespent on the Hiawatha Corridor light-railproject. But Republican members of theHouse would like to repeal that funding andlook for less expensive ways to achieve thesame benefits. \"Someone has to stand up for the public and say there is a wiser and more effective way tomove people, and we are willing to do that, \" House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon)said recently. The project, which would cover 11.4 miles from downtown Minneapolis to Bloomington,Transit trouble Some lawmakers now want to repealfunding for light-rail transit from companies that own underground util-ity lines where the project is to be built. Criticism of the project surfaced during a Feb. 15 informational hearing conducted bythe House Capital Investment Committee. Opponents of the proposal object to the costs and to the prospect of spending moremoney in the future to expand the systemthroughout the region. A recent cost-benefit analysis of the Hiawatha project, done by the MinnesotaDepartment of Transportation 's Office of In- vestment Management, found that the projectwould return about 42 cents for every dollarof construction and estimated operating costs. Jason Lewis, a conservative radio commenta- tor, spoke against the Hiawatha project duringthe Capital Investment Committee hearing. Hesaid light rail is likely to take riders away frombuses, but is not likely to get people to use tran-sit instead of their automobiles. Lewis said the project has other hidden ex-penses, such as costs ofpolice patrolling the sys-tem and of moving util-ity lines to accommodatethe construction. Lynn Woodward of Edina, who specializes inreal estate and urban landeconomics and opposeslight rail, said Minnesotashould spend more moneyto try and develop its owntechnology for tech- privatizing somebuses and developing rapid transit \" system. Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Cottage Grove) said the hearing was giving short shrift to sup-porters of light rail. Marko said the state should consider a va- riety of transit options, and she argued it 's unrealistic to think that any plan would elimi-nate traffic problems in the Twin Cities. \"We're going to have to live with a certain amount of congestion, \" she said. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) asked, \"if the goal is to get people out of their cars,couldn 't we just let people ride buses for free? \" Woodward said he regularly takes the bus, and it 's often standing-room only. \"I'm not in favor of reducing fees, \" he said. \"People want speed and convenience, and they 'll pay for it. \" Woodward said only two factors cause auto drivers to switch to a transit mode \u2014 visible passing speed of the transit mode compared toother vehicles and door-to-door travel time notmore than twice as long as it would take in a car. Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview) said the project 's cost estimate has risen since the House approved the $100 million. \"We were sold a much different package during session last year than we are looking atright now, \" said Krinkie. T o date, three lawsuits have been filed re- garding the Hiawatha project. Krinkie and other lawmakers have filed a lawsuit against the Transportation Depart-ment and the governor, claiming that the de-partment did not properly study theeffectiveness of the project. A separate lawsuitfiled by Leslie Davis and Earth Protector, Inc.,said the proposed route for the project haschanged, so the Transportation Departmentshould study the project 's environmental im- pacts again. In another lawsuit, a RamseyCounty court found that the departmentwrongly excluded a company from submittinga bid on a $400 million contract. Nacho Diaz, Metropolitan Council trans- portation planning director, told the HouseTransportation Finance Committee on Feb. 16that proposed bus-only transitways would costabout $100 million each. Three suchtransitways are part of a long-term plan andwould not replace the proposed light-rail line. Diaz said the Metropolitan Council is seek- ing $10 million this year for design and engi-neering costs for the bus transitways. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), chair of the Transportation Finance Committee, said thatthe bill to repeal funding for light rail has notbeen completed. The committee is also look-ing for alternatives to light rail for theHiawatha Corridor and the entire metropoli-tan area.

The shooting spree, perpetrated by teen- agers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, left 12students and one teacher dead and sent manymore to the hospital. Klebold and Harris, both described by peers as quiet yet quite intelligent, forced educatorsto examine district policies regarding violenceprevention and prompted legislators near andfar to ponder measures they could draft tomake schools safer for learning.Preventing school violence Legislators pitch programs to identify problems before violenceerupts and to equip schools with security in case it does In short, the shooting in Littleton created a sense of urgency to tighten rules and addressproblems so that the likelihood of anothertragedy occurring in our nation 's schools would be minimal. Several bills proposed in Minnesota this session seek to address the issue of violenceprevention in schools.\"It's absolutely essential that we ensure that people are safe in their homes, communities,and especially in their schools, and I think it 's the responsibility of government to see thatthat occurs, \" said Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R- Hastings), speaking before the House K-12Finance Committee on Feb. 23. Most who speak about education, however, believe that schools are very safe places for stu- dents to be, regardless of what occurred inColorado. Statistics would serve to affirm that notion. According to the U.S. Justice and Educationdepartments, of the more than 2,500 childrenwho were murdered or committed suicide in the first half of the 1997-98 school year, less than one percent were at school or at a schoolsponsored event. Four noteworthy bills pertaining to school safety and violence prevention have beendebated by the K-12 Education FinanceCommittee.One sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) would provide $2.5 million inbond proceeds for capital improvements togenerally improve the safety of students, teach-ers, and faculty who use public school build-ings. The bill (HF3141) would leave it to the direction of the commissioner of the Depart-ment of Children, Families and Learning toaward grants at the department 's discretion. The measure does not include more specific details about what improvements might meritfunding. A bill sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) would take things a step fur-ther by requiring that school safety plans de-scribe a process to make facilities safer andmore secure. The bill (HF2621) would appropriate $10 million in state aid for fiscal years 2000 and2001 to help districts fund safety-related mea-sures such as installing security cameras orhiring police liaison officers and adult hallmonitors. \"I truly hope that we, as legislators, will do something in the year 2000 to address issuesof school safety, \" Folliard said. But what are things that make up a safe school? Experts say they share certain charac-teristics. A report provided by the national Safe and Drug Free Schools Program suggests safeschools are ones with strong leaders, high aca-demic standards, and resources and trainingprograms to help teachers address students ' problems before they lead to violence. Schools that develop partnerships in the community and establish good relationshipswith law enforcement, youth services, andother community agencies are likely to pro-vide the type of learning environment wherestudents feel comfortable, the report said. Experts have also said that safety measures such as cameras in school hallways help to dis-courage school violence, but just as importantare measures that address the root of prob-lem. \"Many after-the-fact punitive reactions fo- cus on deterrents rather than causes of theproblem, \" said Del Elliot, director of the Cen- ter for the Study and Prevention of Violenceat the University of Colorado at Boulder. \"Se- rious violence continues because the under-lying problems are never addressed. \" Grace Dymanyk keeps an eye on the lobby at Mounds View High School during school hours, as part of one of the initiatives the school is using to improve safety. Officials have also instituted a gated parkinglot, and doors are locked from the outside to keep the school safer. Photo by A. J. Olmscheid4 February 25, 2000In early 1870, it appeared James Gilfillan 's career on the Minnesota Su- preme Court would be remembered forits brevity, not longevity. Gilfillan was down, having been re- jected by voters after serving only sixmonths as chief justice of the court, buthe wasn 't out. He was on his way to an unprec-edented comeback. The Civil War veteran went on to become thestate 's longest-serving chief justice and the onlychief justice to serve a splitterm.He also has the distinctionof being one of only twoforeign-born Minnesotachief justices and one oftwo chief justices to die in office. In 1869, Gov. Horace Austin appointed Gilfillan chief justice of the SupremeCourt. The seat was up for election at theend of the year, an election Gilfillanwound end up losing. (Justices are electedto the court, and mid-term vacancies arefilled by governor 's appointment.) Historians of the time note that Gilfillan was caught in political jockeyingatypical of judicial elections. Justices wereelected on nonpartisan ballots, but theysought and needed party support. Gilfillan had been a Republican favor- ite, but the party wound up backing a rela-tive unknown, Christopher Ripley, whoultimately won the election. Five years later, after Ripley resigned be- cause of poor health, Gilfillan was reap-pointed to the position of chief justice, aresponsibility he would carry out for theremainder of his career and, for that mat-ter, the rest of his life. Under Gilfillan 's leadership in 1881, the Minnesota Supreme Court expandedfrom three to five members. One of thejustices appointed when the court ex-panded was William Mitchell, destined tobe one of the state 's great jurists. During his tenure, Gilfillan authoredIT'SAFACT A life on the bench Chief justice knew the long and the short of it Justice James GilfillanTwo other bills considered by the K-12 Finance Committee would attempt to tackleissues that lead to crime. Bills sponsored byRep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) and Rep. LyndonCarlson (DFL-Crystal) would increase theamount of aid available to districts for drug,crime, and gang prevention programs. Abeler 's bill (HF2631) would allow districts to levy up to $1.50 per capita for crime pre-vention activities and require the state tomatch those efforts by a two-to-one ratio. If Abeler 's bill were to be fully funded, it would require $14.3 million in state aid. Dr. James Cole, assistant superintendent in the Anoka-Hennepin School District, spokein support of Abeler 's bill. Cole told commit- tee members the additional revenue could goa long way in helping districts pay for pro-grams and preventive equipment in theschools. The committee referred Abeler 's bill with- out recommendation to the House Crime Pre-vention Committee for review. Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), chair of the committee, said she wants the bill toreturn to the K-12 committee for further re-view, once the Crime Prevention Committeehas considered it. Carlson 's bill (HF3320) is similar to Abeler 's bill in design, but it would allow districts tolevy up to $3 per capita for crime preventionaid. Carlson 's bill would not require the state to match funds levied. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) voiced concern that plans by Abeler andCarlson to adjust levy limits for crime preven-tion encourages school districts to raise prop-erty taxes. She hinted at other ways to fundprograms that would leave a property owner 's tax bill undisturbed. \"If we agree there 's a need out there for in- creased safety measures in schools, let 's use some of the budget surplus money the statehas to protect our children, \" Johnson said.

His opin-ions as chief justice span 40 volumes ofMinnesota Reports , the first 20 volumes of which he personally revised and anno-tated. Gilfillan 's family had immigrated from Bannockburn, Scotland, shortly after his birth in 1829, settling on afarm in Chenango County,New York. He first showed an interest in law at the age of 16 and wasadmitted to the bar only fouryears later at age 20. Follow-ing seven years of practicinglaw in Buffalo, New York,Gilfillan moved to St. Paul in1857, in what was then theMinnesota Territory. Five years later, the young lawyer 's life would take a quite different turn. In 1862, Gilfillan volunteered formilitary service and was commissioned asecond lieutenant in the Minnesota Infan-try. He was soon thrust into battle against the Sioux in the Dakotas and later sawaction in the Civil War in T ennessee andKentucky. Just two years after volunteer-ing for military service, Gilfillan becamea colonel in the Eleventh Minnesota. After the war, Gilfillan returned to his law practice in St. Paul. His unusual ca-reer ended in 1894, when he died at theage of 65. In the days following his death, he was described as a man \"without fear or fa- vor\" whose \"life was pure and his reputa- tion stainless. \" At a memorial service in Jan. 7, 1895, Justice Isaac Atwater said, \"His fearless- ness in expressing his honest convictionwhenever demanded, even at the sacrificeof personal interest, his broad grasp ofequity and his entire impartiality betweensuitors, whether persons, corporations, orpolitical parties was unmatched. \" (M. D ELARCO )Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 1 7 - 2 4 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #AGRICULTURE#CHILDREN #CONSUMERSAid for ailing farms Factors such as crop disease and abnormal precipitation have, in successive years, resultedin economic hardship for farmers in certainareas of the state. A bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) would attempt to address those is-sues by appropriating $10 million of generalfund money to the state Board of Water andSoil Resources for a set-aside program to pro-vide short-term economic assistance tolandowners. The bill (HF3240) would allow farmers with land in a county under a presidential disasterdeclaration in 1998 or 1999 to set aside up to160 acres of farming property for paymenteligibility for a period of three years. An amendment, offered by Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter) and incorporated into the bill bythe House Agriculture Policy Committee onFeb. 23, would extend eligibility to includefarmers in counties that receive presidentialdisaster declarations in the future. The committee approved the bill and re- ferred it to the House Environment and Natu-ral Resources Finance Committee. Bruce Kleven, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Wheat and Barley Association, pledged sup-port for the bill. \"As the farming community is very aware, weather can, at times, be very unpredictable, \" he said. \"Certainly this is an initiative that could help our guys out. \" Language in the bill states that payments to farmers under the program would be basedon soil rental rates established by the federalConservation Reserve Program. One complaint farmers have about aid available for disaster relief through the Con-servation Reserve Program is that participa-tion in the program ties up property for aperiod of 10 years, Finseth said. A three-yeartime limit on participation in the proposedland set-aside program is in response to suchconcerns, he added. Under Finseth 's bill, land already covered by the Conservation Reserve Program wouldnot be eligible to receive additional aid. Finseth said if the bill were to become law, a program application process would need tobe established and landowners would likelyapply for set-aside aid on a first-come, first-served basis.Warning labels for Web porn Sexually explicit images on the Internet should have warning labels, says Rep. MarkOlson (R-Big Lake), and those labels shouldbe posted before any of those images appear. Olson is sponsoring a bill (HF3662) that would require all sexually explicit images thatoriginate in Minnesota to show the warning.Because the bill only refers to Minnesotans,Olson said he believes the bill would pass con-stitutional muster. Dubbing the bill the \"Internet Parent Infor- mation Act, \" Olson said he hopes the legisla- tion would keep pornographic images awayfrom children. The Regulated Industries Sub-committee of the House Commerce Commit-tee approved the measure Feb. 23. The Commerce Committee was scheduled to discuss the matter the evening of Feb. 24,after this edition of Session Weekly went to press. Other forms of pornography already place warnings on the product, such as colored plas-tic wrappers covering magazines. The defini-tion of a sexually explicit image would notchange from current law, Olson said. Internet providers and search engine opera- tors would not be held responsible for the dis-play of the images, according to the bill. The bill also would create the ability for in- dividuals to sue an Internet site for failing tocomply with the act. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) wondered what percent of Internet pornography actu-ally originates in Minnesota. Olson said he hasnot seen any research that shows where theimages originate. Kahn also asked if other states are pursuing similar laws. Olson said he is not aware of any.He said his bill could be a model for otherstates or the federal government to warnInternet users. Privacy on the Internet Internet patrons should know if informa- tion about them is being collected, said Rep.Jim Seifert (R-Woodbury). Seifert is sponsoring a bill (HF3731) that would require a state or local governmentagency that provides online services to disclosethe privacy policy. Seifert said consumers should know who is collecting the informa-tion, how it is being used, and for how long itwill be used. The Regulated Industries Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee approvedthe bill Feb. 23. The Commerce Committeewas scheduled to take up the matter theevening of Feb. 24, after this issue of Session Weekly went to press. Seifert 's bill would prevent unknown har- vesting of information by the government orInternet providers. While federal lawmakers are working through bills to keep Internet informationprivate, Seifert said the state can pass a bill that\"creates a foundation. \" If an organization can track what sites an Internet consumer has visited, the organiza-tion could predict whether the consumer haschildren, the consumer 's income, race, and religion, Seifert said. The bill would require state agencies and Internet providers to disclose any informationcollected on a person upon request by thatindividual. The individual would have theright to correct any errors in the information. The measure would be enforced through civil penalties, Seifert said. Plan seeks to halt fraud A bill approved Feb. 23 by the House Civil Law Committee would grant certain busi-nesses access to driver 's license pictures to serve as identification for customers usingcredit cards. The bill (HF3200), sponsored by Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), would allow storesto purchase photo equipment and access thephotos, which are currently classified asprivate. Here 's how the program works. A customer steps to the cash register to purchase itemswith a credit card. The store employee swipesthe card. Automatically, a picture of the cus-tomer appears on a screen, verifying the per-son is using his or her own credit card. Cort Holten, an attorney who is lobbying for Image Data Corporation of New Hamp-shire, testified before the committee. Holtensaid the photos would be stored in a separateand \"incorruptible \" database. Customers could opt-in to the program; participationwould not be mandatory. The photo imaging program aims to curb6 February 25, 2000the high volume of fraud that stores continue to face, Holten said. \"This type of system so vastly eclipses what we currently do, \" Holten said. \"This is a sys- tem where security people won 't have to com- pete with the technology of crooks. \" The computer screen would provide a large photo \u2014 about 3 inches by 5 inches. How- ever, the screen would show nothing else,Holten said. \"The store clerk gets no other information. Y our street address, your height, weight,whether you are an organ donor, is unavail-able, \" he said. Consumers would file paperwork choosing to participate at the bank or business. Con-sumers who choose to not participate couldstill show a driver 's license to clerks. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter) said clerks should still ask for a driver 's license, even if this program is implemented. \"I think retailers would be making a mis- take relying on these only, \" Carruthers said. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) wondered what the cost of the bill would be. Stanek saidthe fiscal impact has not been finalized. The attorney general 's office would handle any liability issues with improper display of pictures. The bill now goes to the House Judiciary Finance Committee. Photocop is watching Cars that zip through red lights are not just breaking the law \u2014 they are dangerous to oth- ers, Michael Gillen, traffic engineer with thestate Department of Transportation, told law-makers. The number of stop light violations in some areas of the Twin Cities is alarming, Gillensaid. A recent motion imaging test project atSnelling and St. Anthony avenues in St. Paulyielded 5,300 violations in 700 hours of study\u2014 an average of 179 violations each day. Gillen told the House Crime Prevention Committee on Feb. 22 about the \"photocop \" program, where a camera placed on a poletakes a snapshot of cars that proceed througha stop light after the light has turned red. \"They are not photographed if they have passed through a yellow light, \" Gillen said. Forty other countries and several U.S. cit- ies are using the photographic tool to curbtraffic signal violations, Gillen said. Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring a bill (HF3322) that would allow three citiesto implement the program. The cities wouldbe allowed to dispense fines similar to park-ing tickets \u2014 the vehicle owner would be re- sponsible for paying the fine, regardless of whowas driving the car.\"Once these are out there, people will drive differently, \" Biernat said. Gillen said a study showed Minnesotans approve of using cameras at intersections bya four-to-one margin. He said the technologyis blind to color, race, sex, or age \u2014 it catches all violators. The camera is positioned purposely to catch the license plate and would not photographwho is inside the vehicle. Violators would bemailed a ticket. Because the fine is treated likea parking ticket, the violation would not af-fect a person 's insurance or driving record. The cities in the program would have the responsibility to determine the level of thefine, Gillen said. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) said she would like signs placed at intersec-tions where the cameras are installed. Biernatdismissed that idea. \"We don 't put up signs that say, 'Warning, speed trap ahead, '\" Biernat said. \"These people are breaking the law. \" Cities would be required to pay for the equipment, Biernat said. Minneapolis, St. Paul,and Bloomington have expressed interest inthe program. The committee took no action on the mat- ter, but the bill is expected to come up againthis session.Crime lab in bonding proposal The House Judiciary Finance Committee voted Feb. 24 to recommend $70 million inbonding funds for criminal justice projects. The proposal, which goes to the House Capital Investment Committee, includesfunding for five projects in the Departmentof Corrections, a grant program to fund pub-lic safety training facilities, and money to builda new lab for the Minnesota Bureau of Crimi-nal Apprehension (BCA). It calls for a study of regional jail facilities, but does not call for bond funds to build anysuch facilities. Full funding is provided in the proposal for sewer repair at the Faribault correctional fa-cility, a mental health unit at Red Wing, a spe-cial high-security unit at Oak Park Heights, aprison-yard wall repair project at Stillwater,and remodeling of a unit at Lino Lakes. The committee recommended $30 million for the BCA lab, which is estimated to cost $58million. Notable omissions from the proposal in- clude requests for new health facilities at theStillwater prison, a vocational building at theLino Lakes facility, and an activities buildingat Willow River. Scott Arneson, Aitkin County administra- tor, and Gary Waller, a jail consultant, gave alast minute plea to the committee to fund atleast some of the proposed regional jailprojects in the state that are ready to go. Arneson said 21 counties have agreements and plans in place to build regional facilities,which would replace outmoded county jails.He said for many of those counties, their ex-penses are too high for their tax base to sus-tain and they need help from the state. For example, Aitkin County 's tax base has increased by about 3 percent annually, he said.The county 's corrections costs have increased as much as 30 percent a year at the same time. He said to cover those costs without sub- stantially raising taxes, the county has takenmoney from human services benefits. He saidmany of those are prevention programs de-signed to keep people out of jail. Members of the committee said they sym- pathized with the plight of counties, but theywere too strapped by the governor 's recom- mendations for bonding for this year. \"I don 't think the issue is with the Judiciary Finance Committee. I think we all support theconcept, \" said Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul). \"The issue is that the fiscal parameters of this bonding bill are too small. This is in-adequate funding for corrections and the ju-dicial system. \" #CRIME Patrolman Jason Mork, Ortonville Police Department, holds his police dog Felonyduring Feb. 24 testimony before the HouseJudiciary Finance Committee in support ofa bill that would provide up to $150,000 ingrants to buy and train drug-sniffing dogs. KNOWING NOSESession Weekly 7There will be no State of the State address this year. Gov. Jesse Ventura's office put out a brief press release Feb. 22 citing the \"fast pace of thisoff-year session\" as the reason Ventura will notaddress the 2000 Legislature. Last year, Ventura addressed a joint session of the Legislature in early March, about twomonths after his inauguration. He used thatoccasion to lay out the philosophy of his ad-ministration, which included his widely noteddeclaration that \"the free ride is over.\" The Minnesota Constitution states, \"The gov- ernor shall communicate by message to eachsession of the Legislature information touchingthe state and country.\" That requirement can besatisfied by delivering a message in the firstyear of each two-year session, as Ventura didlast year. Since the Legislature began meetingGovernor decides to forgo speech to Legislature annually in 1973, the governor has delivered amessage at the beginning of each session, butnot always in the second year of the biennium,according to the Legislative Reference Library.In 1976, former Gov. Wendell Anderson sentonly a written message to the Legislature. In recent years, an annual State of the State has been commonplace. The only exceptionmay have been in 1986. There is no record thatformer Gov. Rudy Perpich gave a State of theState speech that year, but the library did findthat Perpich sent a message to the Legislaturein late January of that year about how to handlea $700 million shortfall. Former Gov. Arne Carlson used the off year as an opportunity to take the show on the road.He gave State of the State speeches away fromthe Capitol on three occasions, including his1996 speech at a Minnesota Chamber ofCommerce event held at a Bloomington hotel. Hennepin County Sheriff Pat McGowan testifies fora bill that would improve the criminal justice in-formation system throughout the state. McGowanspoke during a Feb. 22 hearing of the House CrimePrevention Committee.Murder case strains finances A bill to help Carlton County pay for the costs of a high-profile 1999 murder trial wasconsidered Feb. 22 by the House JudiciaryFinance Committee. The bill (HF 2112), sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), would provide anInformation on criminals Law enforcement officers need the tools to solve crimes and catch lawbreakers, said Rep.Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), but officialslack theyneed. Stanek is sponsoring a bill (HF3346) that would create an integrated statewide criminaljustice network. The bill was approved Feb. 22by the House Crime Prevention Committee. The system, estimated to cost between $15 million and $22 million, would link all statelaw enforcement records \u2014 such as sex of- fender registration, probation records, andcriminal records. \"I think people think this already goes on today, \" Stanek said. Minnesotans would be \"horrified \" to know law enforcement cannot access other systems,he said. Stanek said too many defendants are slip- ping through the system because law enforce-ment agencies have no vehicle for sharinginformation. He suggested the need for an integrated in- formation system is more important than theneed for a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion lab in St. Paul, a project backed by thegovernor in his bonding recommendations. Bob Vanasek, former House speaker who now lobbies for Citizens for a Safer Minne-sota, said the bill would cut costs elsewhere. \"We're currently spending millions ofdollars on the hodge-podge systems through the state, \" Vanasek said. Paul Aasen, assistant commissioner for the Department of Public Safety, spoke on behalfof the governor at the hearing. Aasen said Gov.Jesse V entura is not supporting any supple-mental funding this year. Stanek said the committee cannot wait for the governor 's support. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) said the system is needed now and legislators shouldnot wait for next session. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) cau- tioned Stanek to not create an \"either/or \" situ- ation where legislators are choosing betweenintegrated information system and the crimelab, estimated to cost $58 million. \"We have the support to start tracking these criminals, \" Mahoney said. \"These are both important issues. \" The bill would require cities to provide a por- tion of the funding, although the legislation doesnot cite what the match would be. The commit-tee rejected an amendment that sought to re-quire the state to pay for the entire system. The measure now goes to the House Gov- ernmental Operations and Veterans AffairsPolicy Committee.emergency appropriation to the county, which incurred nearly $80,000 in expenses to prosecutethe defendants in the Paul Antonich murder. Antonich, a 17-year-old Two Harbors boy, was beaten and shot after a minor traffic acci-dent in Duluth. Five men were ultimately con-victed of varying roles in the crime. The case became Carlton County 's respon- sibility because Antonich 's body was found in a ditch in the county, just inside the Fond duLac Indian Reservation. Pre-trial publicity for the trial of the triggerman, John Steven Martin, required thatit be moved to Dakota County. As a result, allthe prosecutors, court staff, and defendantshad to be lodged and fed in Hastings duringthe trial. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) asked whether this was a routine or unusual request.Murphy said it is unusual, especially in lightof the fact that Carlton County has investi-gated 13 murders in the past six years and onlyone of the defendants has been a resident ofthe county. County officials also claim the investigation of the Katie Poirier abduction and murder hasstrained the county 's resources, though the county is not yet requesting emergency fundsfrom the Legislature to cover those expenses. The committee also considered a deficiency request from the Public Safety Department 's Division of Emergency Management for $3.8million to cover disaster payments from se-vere weather in 1998 and 1999. Committee members will consider the re- quests for inclusion in the omnibus judiciaryfunding measure.8 February 25, 2000Crackdown on fake IDs Minors who use false identification to pur- chase alcohol or tobacco could lose theirdriver 's license and face increased penalties,Shifting defense expenses The state would pay for investigative work, expert witnesses, and other such costs incurredby public defenders, under a bill advancing inthe House. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) is spon- soring a measure (HF3361) that would shiftcertain costs from the state 's 87 counties to the state Board of Public Defense. \"I believe this type of fees should be con- trolled by the state, \" Stanek told the House Crime Prevention Committee on Feb. 18. Thecommittee approved the measure and sent itto the House Judiciary Finance Committee. Currently, counties pay for some of the costs generated by the public defender 's office, in- cluding expert witnesses. When a high-pro-file trial occurs in an area that is notaccustomed to such court cases, the county hasto pay the enormous costs, Stanek said. Counties cannot control or budget for these types of court cases because they are unex-pected, Stanek said. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) agreed with Stanek. \"County boards have been talking about this for years, wondering why they have to payfor prosecution and defense, \" Murphy said. Kevin Corbid, policy analyst for the Asso- ciation of Minnesota Counties, told the com-mittee that counties are irritated they pick upthe tab. \"It is always easier to spend money when you are not the one paying the bill, \" Corbid wrote to legislators. \"Moving this responsibil- ity to the Board of Public Defense increasesthe accountability on behalf of defenders whorequest funding. \" Rep. David Bishop (R-Rochester) said coun- ties must be fiscally responsible, and that in-cludes paying for court costs. He noted thatthe state does not pay for county attorneys. Stanek said removing the defense fees would free law enforcement and county attorneys toinvestigate crimes and not be concerned aboutcourt costs that could be incurred by thedefense. \"I want to de-politicize this process, \" Stanek said. \"I want the county attorney to enforce the laws in this state. \" Dick Schurman of the Board of Public De- fenders spoke against the bill. He said that leg-islators have provided deficiency funding tocounties in past years when the county hadhigh public defense costs.under a bill sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley). Leppik 's bill (HF2655) would allow clerks at liquor stores to confiscate what they believeto be false identification cards. The clerkwould then be required to turn the identifica-tion over to the police or return it to the card 's owner within 48 hours. \"My bill is intended to create a meaningful deterrent, \" Leppik told the House Crime Pre- vention Committee on Feb. 24. \"Currently, there are very few penalties for using fake IDs. \" However, there are heavy consequences for retailers, such as temporary loss of their liquorlicenses, if they sell alcohol to minors, Leppiksaid. Robert Pomplun of Loss Control Services has worked in the liquor business for 30 years.Because of the Internet, minors have easy ac-cess to obtaining false identification cards,Pomplun said. \"The amount of fake IDs used by kids is just huge, \" Pomplun said. \"Minnesota has a real problem with fake IDs that isn 't getting attention. \" The committee delayed a vote on the bill while awaiting additional language for tobaccosales. The bill will be discussed further at anupcoming hearing. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) said that if the identification was real, the card ownerwould probably stand at the counter and de-mand the police to come and authenticate it.If the card was false identification, the minorswould probably run away, Fuller said. Currently, people under age 21 who attempt to purchase alcohol with false identificationface a misdemeanor penalty. Leppik proposedto increase the penalty to a gross misde-meanor. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) said a gross misdemeanor on a first offense was too harsh. The committee agreed and amended the bill to make a second violation a gross misde-meanor. David Hall, co-owner of the Mermaid Supper Club in Mounds View, said the grossmisdemeanor language is needed. \"Nothing happens to these kids, \" Hall said. \"The police know it; the kids know it. It 's a joke. \" Hall stressed that these offenders are 19 or 20 years old and they are fully aware that theyare breaking the law when they attempt to buyalcohol. #EDUCATION Background checks for assistants A bill that would require unlicensed teach- ing assistants to undergo criminal backgroundFridley resident Connie Bernardy, a parent orga-nizer for Save Our Schools, testifies Feb. 22 insupport of a bill that would require criminal back-ground checks for unlicensed classroominstructors. checks before being hired was approved Feb.22 by the House Education Policy Commit-tee. The bill (HF3402), sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), would add educa-tional aides, assistants, and specialists to thelist of school employees required by law tosubmit to a check prior to employment. Entenza said he introduced the bill because he is concerned that current state law allowsfor a small percentage of instructors to enterclassrooms without having to undergo back-ground checks. \"Unfortunately, and may I add recently, we've discovered there are some who slip through the cracks, \" he said. As an example, Entenza said a background check on unlicensed foreign language instruc-tor Kristin Osterbauer, who was accused ofengaging in inappropriate conduct with a stu-dent last fall, would have revealed her pastproblems with alcohol that could have kepther from teaching junior high students. Osterbauer, who served as an instructor at Eagle River Junior High School in Savage, wascharged in November 1999 with first-degreecriminal sexual conduct and providing alco-hol to a minor shortly after accusations sur-faced that she had sex with a 13-year-oldstudent. Although Osterbauer wasn 't a licensed teacher, she taught two sections of Spanish inaddition to working as an assistant. She wasfired from her position in December. \"By making sure that everyone teaching in a classroom setting has undergone a criminalbackground check, we can avoid these typesof situations, \" Entenza said. Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan) asked whether an expanded scope of backgroundchecks would delay school districts ' hiring processes. \"Remember, you 're weighing the safety of students against the convenience of hiring, \" replied Bob Meeks, director of governmentalSession Weekly 9Sharing student information School officials would be allowed to share information with teachers and other schoolstaff about students who have a prior crimi-nal history, under a bill sponsored by Rep.Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine). The bill (HF2672) would allow the infor- mation to be distributed between school dis-tricts if it is shared in good faith. Districtswould be immune from criminal or civil ac-tions that might result from sharing the in-formation. The House Civil Law Committee considered the bill Feb. 21 and is expected to include themeasure in a larger data privacy bill. During his discussion, Westerberg men- tioned shootings at schools in Jonesboro, Ark.,and Littleton, Colo. While Westerberg ac-knowledged the bill would not eliminate con-cerns about violence, he said the legislationcould help teachers and staff be aware of prob-lems before they occur. The bill has the support of the Department of Public Safety, Westerberg said. Julia Corneil, a counselor at Centennial High School, told the committee that the in-formation would be helpful to teachers. \"We value confidentiality, \" Corneil said. \"But in some instances we 'd like to be able to share that data. Right now, we don 't feel we are legally able to do that. \" Don Helmstetter, superintendent of the Spring Lake Park School District, said a stu-dent could be expelled from one school andtransfer to another district. Then the seconddistrict would have no way of knowing whythat student had been expelled. \"This is not a theoretical situation, \" Helmstetter said. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) ex- pressed concern about the bill. He asked if theinformation could be limited to people whohave direct contact with the child. \"If this passes, it sounds like every adult in the school gets to hear this information, \" Mahoney said. Don Gemberling, director of information policy for the Department of Administration,said the bill is narrowly targeted to studentswith criminal history, and not other problems,such as chemical dependency or familytroubles.Westerberg said he would like to see teach- ers get even more information on theirstudents. \"I think we need to open the lines of infor- mation, \" Westerberg said. \"The more we know about our children the better we can helpthem. \" Five-year-old Kyle Petersburg of Kennedy visits with Rep. David Tomassoni during a Feb. 22 hearing of the House Education Policy Committee. Kyle, who is a neighbor of Rep. Jim Tunheim,was shadowing his legislator all day.LEARNING THE TRADECoaches as bus drivers In a school with only 365 students, it is com- mon to transport very small groups to ath-letic and academic events, said John Hornung,superintendent of Nicollet Public Schools. Hornung said his southern Minnesota school district often struggles to find driversfor such occasions. Rather than paying drivers to transport mostly empty buses to events within 60 milesof Nicollet, Hornung would like to allowcoaches to drive vans or minibuses carryingthe small groups of students. But the super-intendent doesn 't believe the coaches should be required to obtain commercial driver 's licenses. Hornung testified at a Feb. 22 hearing of the House Transportation Policy Committeein favor of a bill that would allow thatpractice. \"If you check across the state, finding a bus driver is almost impossible, \" Hornung said. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) is spon- soring a bill (HF3145) that would allow a per-son with a Class D license (the basic driver 's license in Minnesota) to drive a school bus ifthere were 15 or fewer passengers. That wouldallow coaches to drive a bus, minibus, or vanto events. The bill also calls for several other changes related to school bus drivers. Under the measure, a person could drive a school bus for up to 180 days without theproper license if the person meets qualifica-tions for license endorsement. That wouldallow drivers to begin training and workingbefore they take the test to get the endorse-ment. In addition, the bill would allow non-phy- sicians such as chiropractors and advancedpractice nurses to perform the required physi-cal examinations on bus drivers. Brad Lundell, lobbyist for Minnesota Asso- ciation for Pupil Transit, spoke against the bill.Lundell said Minnesotans recognize the colorand shape of Minnesota school buses, and theyexpect drivers to be qualified. \"The training has to be there, and the op- erators must be licensed, \" Lundell said. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) said she be- lieves schools would require coaches to com-plete bus driving training. \"I have a feeling that there isn 't a school dis- trict out there that doesn 't understand the li- ability involved, \" Molnau said. Insurance companies would almost certainly requiretraining, she added. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park)relations for the Minnesota School Boards Association.

Election law adjustments A bill that would make minor changes in state election laws was approved Feb. 18 by theHouse Governmental Operations and V eter-ans Affairs Policy Committee. The bill (HF2826), sponsored by Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), would specify that someprovisions related to general elections alsoapply to special elections, among other minorchanges. It would change the beginning date of the terms of office for soil and water conserva-tion district supervisors, school board mem-bers, town officers, and hospital districtofficers to conform with those of other electedoffices. Those terms would begin the firstMonday in January instead of Jan. 1. And voter registration forms that are sub- mitted with driver 's license applications would have to be sent within 10 business days to thecounty auditor, under the bill. Currently, there is no time limit for the pub- lic safety department to send the forms to thecounty auditor. Sometimes there has beensuch a long delay that people find that theyare not registered when they go to vote, saidSecretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer. Some committee members proposed amendments to the bill that would allow amajor political party to designate a differentdate for a the party 's caucus. Current law requires caucuses to be held the first Tuesday in March of a general electionyear. But the state DFL party has scheduled itscaucuses this year on the weekend of March11 to try to encourage more participation.That date has not been publicized by the sec-retary of state. Election information that theoffice has published this year has used thestatutory date, which is March 7. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said that tra- ditionally, when a law interferes with such achange by a political party, the law has beenthrown out. Kahn and Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL- Hopkins) each proposed amendments thatwould require the secretary of state to notifythe public in those types of situations. Butboth amendments were defeated. The bill now moves to the House floor.Penalties for safety violations In 1998, Patrick Randel, a college student from Buffalo, Minn., was on his ninth day ofwork for Buffalo Bituminous, a constructioncompany, when he died. Randel was sent downinto a manhole with no oxygen, and he suffo-cated. Randel 's mother Margaret said that accord- ing to an Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration report, the company deliber-ately ignored safety regulations. Yet, she said,the only compensation the family was able torecover were the costs of Patrick 's funeral. \"His death was a senseless tragedy that should never have happened, \" she said. The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Policy Committee approved a billFeb. 22 that would provide a minimum$50,000 penalty, paid to the state, against anemployer who commits a willful or repeatedOSHA violation that leads to the death of anemployee. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township), the bill 's sponsor, said that the measure offers a small step in addressing inadequacies in cur-rent state law. The committee also approved an amend- ment, offered by Rep. Dan McElroy(R-Burnsville), which would set the minimumpenalty for a serious violation at $25,000. Margaret Randel of Buffalo describes how her 19-year-old son died on the job as a result of unsafe workpractices. She spoke Feb. 22 before the House Jobs and Economic Development Policy Committee insupport of a bill that would penalize companies that violate safety regulations. McElroy 's amendment also would allow the next of kin of a deceased employee to partici-pate in the process of reviewing and challeng-ing citations issued to the employer. Roger McBride, safety director for Ames Construction in Burnsville, spoke against thebill. \"I'm concerned whenever we try to apply quick fix solutions to complex problems, \" McBride said. McBride said that OSHA 's definition of a \"serious \" violation differs from what many may regard as serious. He said that his com-pany was once cited for a serious violationwhen an employee was not wearing his safetygoggles but had them in his hand. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) offered an amendment that would allow workers in-jured on the job and descendents of workerskilled on the job to seek civil damages.Rukavina said the bill as written would do littleto address the problem. He said that fineswould go to the state, rather than the families.The amendment failed on a 12-9 roll call vote. Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin) offered a similar amendment designed to permit civilaction when a worker is killed on the job, theemployer knowingly violated a safety regula-tion, and the violation was substantial in con-tributing to the death. Leighton 's amendment also failed by a 12-9 roll call vote. The bill was sent to the Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee.Session Weekly 11The House voted Feb. 24 to formally set the committee deadlines for the 2000 session, and the first deadline is coming up fast. The first deadline will be Friday, March 3 . By that date, policy bills must pass out of necessary committees in the house of origin. The second committee deadline will be Friday, March 10 . By that date, committees must act favorably on bills, or companions ofbills, that met the first deadline in the other chamber. That means all bills other than those containing appropriations must pass out ofcommittee in the both the House and the Senate to remain alive for consideration. The third deadline will be Friday, March 17 . All omnibus finance bills, which are exempt from the first two deadlines, must pass out of committee by that date. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. The taxes committees and rules committees in both bodies are exempt. And abill can be heard after the deadlines if the rules committee in either body grants its permission.First committee deadline approaching#ENERGY Itemizing energy costs Electric utilities would have to itemize costs for generation, transmission, and distributionof electricity, under a bill approved Feb. 21 bythe Regulated Industries Subcommittee of theHouse Commerce Committee. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) is sponsoring a bill (HF2996) that would require industriesto separate billing costs and pass that infor-mation on to consumers. Each company would be required to de- velop its own system and guidelines on how itsplits costs. The bill would require utilities tosay the source of the power, be it nuclear, hy-dropower, coal, or wind. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) offered an amendment that would require the elec-tric utilities to disclose emissions from theplants, such as carbon dioxide, mercury orspent nuclear fuel. The emissions would be tracked under the standard guidelines already in place with theDepartment of Commerce. The committee approved the amendment.Linda Taylor, assistant commissioner of the Commerce Department 's Energy Division, spoke in favor of Jennings ' amendment, say- ing she wants to make sure consumers under-stand the information. \"If providing this information leads to people turning off lights, it will save manykilowatts of energy, \" Taylor said. The subcommittee approved another amendment that stated utilities would have toprovide the cost breakdown in customer 's util- ity bills at least twice a year. Originally, the leg-islation said the separation informationshould be in all monthly bills. The bill was sent to the full Commerce Committee. #ENVIRONMENT Energy loan program Officials from the Department of Com- merce told the House Jobs and Economic De-velopment Finance Committee on Feb. 21 ofthe need to continue a loan program gearedtowards energy conservation measures. Linda Taylor, an assistant commissioner of the department, said that the agency is re-questing $8 million for the Energy InvestmentLoan Program. The program extends loans toschools and local governments for projects tomake buildings more energy efficient. Thegovernor has recommended funding of $2.5million. Janet Streff, the manager of the department 's Energy Programs, Information and T echnolo-gies Division, said the program was created in1983 as the Public School Energy Loan Program.Concerns about fuel additive A ban on a gasoline additive that has caused severe water pollution in some states was de-bated Feb. 24 by the House Environment andNatural Resources Policy Committee. Gas that is blended with methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) has contaminated waterin some U.S. states. The committee approved a bill (HF3292), sponsored by Rep. Dan Dorman (R-AlbertLea), that would take a step toward banningMTBE in Minnesota by allowing gasoline tocontain only 0.1 percent of the compound. Currently, MTBE is not used in Minnesota 's gasoline supply, but it is used in nearly one-third of the gasoline in the United States,Dorman said. The compound is an alternative fuel addi- tive to ethanol.In 1987 the scope was expanded to include loans to cities and counties. Streff said the program is financed by the state selling general obligation bonds. Thebond proceeds are then issued as loans. The program has not operated since 1998 because bonding authority has been ex-hausted, Streff said. The department wouldlike to start issuing loans again. \"The program is 100 percent user-financed, \" she said. \"Money to repay the loans is gener- ated from the energy cost savings. \" She said most school districts, cities, and counties own large energy consuming build-ings that were built before concern over en-ergy use and cost was an issue. She said thatother budget needs prohibit governmentsfrom making energy conservation improve-ments high priorities, even though the im-provements often pay for themselves. Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) asked when the program would no longer be neededbecause energy efficiency goals have been met. Jeremy De Fiebre, the program 's grant spe- cialist, said new technology continues to be-come available, creating an ongoing need forenergy efficiency improvements. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) asked if the department would be opposed to chang-ing the structure of the program into a revolv-ing loan program. Taylor said the department would support that type of change so officials don 't need to continually come before the Legislature to re-quest bonding funds. The request may be considered for inclu- sion in the committee 's bonding recommen- dations, which will be passed along to theHouse Capital Investment Committee.As other states ban the chemical, Dorman said the glut of gasoline with MTBE could besent to Minnesota unless it is banned. \"This would be a pre-emptive strike, \" he said. But some state officials said it would be impossible to keep out trace amounts ofMTBE. Dorman 's bill had originally proposed ban- ning MTBE, but the committee moved to al-low 0.1 percent of the compound in gasoline,based on recommendations from the statePollution Control Agency and the Weights andMeasures Division of the Department of Pub-lic Service. Gasoline is moved through common pipe- lines throughout the country, so traces ofMTBE can be found in almost all gasoline. Ifthe state completely bans the chemical, someretailers fear that they would be forced to shutdown their gas pumps. The bill now moves to the House floor. Lighted fishing lures Minnesotans can manufacture and sell lighted fishing lures, but under state law, theycannot use them while fishing. A bill (HF3352) that would allow anglers to use those types of lures was approvedFeb. 22 by the House Environment and Natu-ral Resources Policy Committee. Rep. Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley), sponsor of the bill, said the lures are used in neighboring12 February 25, 2000 Dag Knudsen, who does presentation and sales training for technical professionals, usesa three-dimensional graph to compareconstruction costs, left, and maintenance andoperational costs, center, to fees collected byarchitects, engineers, surveyors, landscape ar-chitects, geoscientists, and interior designservices, right. His testimony came Feb. 23before the House Capital Investment Com-mittee, which was considering a bill thatwould provide exceptions in the bid solicita-tion process. No action was taken on themeasure.#FAMILYTHREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHAdding recycling at plants A proposal to build two recycling facilities was heard Feb. 21 by the House Environmentand Natural Resources Finance Committee. Both facilities would be built near waste- to-energy facilities, one of which serves Popeand Douglas counties and the other servesDodge and Olmsted counties. Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria), spon- sor of the bill (HF2765), said it would helpboth areas conserve landfill space. The facili-ties burn solid waste and convert it to energy.The leftover ash from the facilities is put inlandfills. Cassell said the landfill space is limited and the populations in those areas are growing.Building the recycling facilities would cut downon the items sent to the waste-to-energy facili-ties. That would in turn would reduce theamount of ash that is sent to the landfills. Neither proposal is included in Gov. Jesse Ventura 's capital investment plan. The bill would spend nearly $5 million for the two projects. The money would go to the Officeof Environmental Assistance, which would thenadminister grants for the two projects. The proposal could be included in the committee 's omnibus bonding bill. New DNR building proposed A proposal to build a new $5 million office building in Fergus Falls is among the top pri-orities of the Department of Natural Re-sources, but an alternative plan was discussedFeb. 21 by the House Environment and Natu-ral Resources Finance Committee. Gov. Jesse Ventura has included the $5 mil- lion request in his capital budget plan. Thealternative is proposed in a bill (HF2734)sponsored by Rep. Bob Westfall (R-Rothsay)that would allow the DNR to buy a PelicanRapids building for $1 million. Currently, the DNR employees in Fergusamount that is proposed for the new Fergus Falls facility. In addition, the facility would mainly house conservation agents, who would be doingmost of their work outside the office. But Morse said he and other DNR employ- ees looked at the Pelican Rapids building anddecided it would be more feasible to build anew building. The Pelican Rapids building is40 years old, and the costs of renovating it tomake it comply with Americans with Disabili-ties Act standards and other building code re-quirements would cost about $2 million. The major expenses would include adding an elevator, renovating bathrooms, and im-proving the insulation of the building to makeit more energy efficient. The committee will consider the matter again when committee members assembletheir bonding recommendations for this year. Church day care centers A bill that would permit a church or reli- gious organization to operate a day care pro-gram under the rules governing family daycare and group family day care was approvedFeb. 22 by the House Health and Human Ser-vices Policy Committee. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R- Excelsior), is an attempt to increase nonresi-dential childcare options for parents. \"What I like about this bill is that it gives churches a chance to step in and help both thefamilies and communities they serve, \" Sykora said. Under current law, a church or religious organization that provides nonresidentialchild care centers is required to operate un-der the rules for a child care center, which areconsiderably more strict. This bill would allow private day care orga- nizations greater flexibility to operate, whilelimiting the number of children served in achurch setting to 14. A church participatingin a partnership with a child care providerwould likely donate the space and use of utili-ties, Sykora said. Day care centers housed in churches would also still require a license. The bill was referred to the House Family and Early Childhood Finance Committee.states. The lures generally cost less than $5. Committee members questioned whether the bill would have an impact on the numberof fish people are allowed to catch. Lightedlures alone are not expected to dramaticallyincrease the number of fish caught in the state,said Ron Payer, chief of the fisheries sectionof the Department of Natural Resources. However, Payer said, the combined effects of the lures and other types of new technologycould lead to adjusting limits in the future. Some committee members were concerned that batteries that are swallowed by fish or lostin the water would create environmental prob-lems, but Gerlach said the surrounding stateshave not experienced such problems. The bill now moves to the House floor.Falls work in a renovated horse barn. The DNR leases space in the building for $31,000per year. Deputy Commissioner Steve Morse said the DNR has been seeking to build a new facilityfor about six years. The Legislature had ap-proved a plan for a new facility in 1996, but itwas vetoed by former Gov. Arne Carlson. The Pelican Rapids building is currently owned by the Lake Region Electrical Coop-erative. Dave Weaklend, general manager ofthe cooperative, said a new headquarters wasbuilt because the organization needed an ad-ditional 60,000 square feet of space. Weaklend said the offer to sell the old facil- ity includes furniture in the building, so theDNR could move in immediately. The amountof office and storage space in the building andits adjacent out-buildings is comparable to the Nursing mothers off juries Nursing mothers would be excluded from jury duty under a bill the House passed Feb.21. The vote was 128-0. The bill (HF1865), sponsored by Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), originally applied only towomen who are solely responsible for the dailySession Weekly 13#GOVERNMENT #GAME & FISH#HEALTH New revenue for resources A proposal to expand who pays for the man- agement of the state 's natural resources was considered Feb. 18 by the House Taxes Com-mittee. The bill (HF1092), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would transfer whatamounts to a sales tax on lottery tickets fromthe state 's general fund to the game and fish fund. The committee took no action on the mea- sure, which may be considered for inclusionin this year 's omnibus tax bill. Holsten 's plan is one alternative to add to the current revenue sources for the Depart-ment of Natural Resources, which officials sayfaces funding shortfalls in the coming years. There is no actual sales tax collected when a person buys a lottery ticket. In lieu of thesales tax, an amount equal to 6.5 percent ofthe gross receipts collected from the sale oflottery tickets is credited to the general fund. Forty percent of the remaining proceeds collected from ticket sales goes to the state 's environmental and natural resources trustfund. Other proceeds also go to the generalfund. The game and fish fund receives much of its funding from the sale of fishing and hunt-ing licenses. Holsten said that under the bill the game and fish fund would receive between $12 mil-lion and $25 million more each year. He saidthat the state 's philosophy toward managing its natural resources is shifting. \"There has been a change in management style from the fish to the water. We havestopped managing pheasants and started man-aging the habitat, \" Holsten said. And because of that change, Holsten said it is only fair that all Minnesotans, rather than just those who fish and hunt, should contribute toward man-aging natural resources. Bill Berhjelm, the director of the Depart- ment of Natural Resources Enforcement Di-vision, said the additional funds would helprestore staffing levels to 1993 standards. Hesaid that many of the department 'sNew rule for House prayer The House voted Feb. 24 to scrap require- ments that the prayer that precedes each floorsession be \"nondenominational \" and that it respect the \"religious diversity of the House. \" The Permanent Rules of the House now require only that there be \"a prayer by the chaplain. \" \"It is difficult, if not impossible, to construct an individual prayer that respects the diver-sity of the entire House, \" said Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan). \"If you 're going to have diversity, you 've got to allow it. \" The measure to change the rule came in the form of a report from the House Rules Com-mittee, which Pawlenty chairs. Two votes weretaken on the measure \u2014 one to strike the word \"nondenominational \" (passed 79-52) and one to strike the language related to \"religious di- versity \" (passed 71-60). The rules related to the prayer have been a source of controversy since they were alteredearly in the 1999 session. The issue was raisedafter a choir performing as part of openingday events last year sang a song that includedseveral references to Jesus Christ and thatstruck some as being uncomfortablysectarian. Critics of the 1999 change said that the at- tempt to be sensitive to diverse religious be-liefs resulted in a rule seeking \"homogenized \" prayer that would not allow that diversity tobe expressed. \"I want to be able to be exposed to every- thing, \" said Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL- Crosby). \"I'm voting for this rule because I 'm not afraid of other religious beliefs. \" But some lawmakers expressed doubts that the rule change will do anything to foster theexpression of diverse beliefs. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) said that the notion that the diversity is seen byconsidering all the prayers given throughoutthe course of the year, rather than focusing oneach day, doesn 't hold up. \"Over 10 years, I think I can count on one hand the number of times I have heard a rabbilead us in prayer, \" she said. \"I recall once that we had a Native American religious leader. \" This is the second time this year that law- makers have wrestled with the prayer rule. OnTobacco money for health care A proposal that would use tobacco settle- ment funds to offset health care costs and cuttaxes cleared its second hurdle Feb. 21. The House Health and Human Services Fi- nance Committee approved the bill (HF2716),sponsored by Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Roches-ter), and referred it to the House Taxes Com-mittee. The bill would transfer some of the one- time tobacco settlement money and the on-going payments into the state 's health care access fund and provide for a contingentelimination of both the 1 percent premiumtax and MinnesotaCare provider tax begin-ning Jan. 1, 2001. Bradley 's bill would attempt to provide some relief from rising health care coveragecosts. The bill has the potential to provide thegreatest amount of aid to low-income patientsand fixed-income senior citizens with substan-tial pharmaceutical costs, Bradley said. Information provided by the Minnesota Taxpayers Association notes the poorest 10percent of Minnesotans account for onlyabout 1 percent of income earned. However,that same group pays 2.6 percent of theMinnesotaCare tax, while the richest 10 per-cent pay a far less percentage of their total in-come to the tax. A 1999 law used one-time tobacco funds to establish three endowments \u2014 one to fund tobacco use prevention, one to finance medi-cal education programs, and one to pay forpublic health efforts. Bradley 's bill would not affect the endow- ments established last year. It would draw onseparate revenues owed to the state from to-bacco companies.conservation officers were hired in the late 1960s are now approaching retirement age. \"Our concern is that we 're in a demographic bubble, \" Berhjelm said. He said that the department already is short 30 to 40 officers and in the next three years.Fifteen to 20 are expected to retire each year.the first day back, Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.- Owatonna) made a motion to ditch thechanges made last year.

The bill was amended on the House floor, to include all nursing mothers, whether theyare employed outside their homes or not. According to the bill passed by the House, all nursing mothers would be exempted fromserving on a jury. The bill now moves to the Senate. Air quality in schools A bill that would set minimum air filtra- tion standards for new school buildings andrequire future school facilities to monitor thequality of indoor and outdoor airflow waspresented to the House K-12 Education Fi-nance Committee on Feb. 23. \"Indoor air quality is becoming a leading health concern in public schools and I believethat we need to take steps to assure that the14 February 25, 2000 #TAXES#RECREATION Supporters of a bill that would appropriate $14.7 million in bond proceeds to repair and remodelfacilities at Anoka-Hennepin Technical College lis-ten to Feb. 18 testimony on the bill before theHouse Higher Education Finance Committee.New terms for park permits Annual permits for state park visitors would be valid for one year after the date of purchase,under a bill that was approved Feb. 21 by theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesFinance Committee. Currently, annual park permits are only valid for the calendar year, which discouragespeople from buying them in the late summeror fall, said Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Val-ley), sponsor of the bill. She said the proposal would likely increase the number of annual permits that are soldand encourage more visits to state parks year-round. Bill Morrissey, director of the Department of Natural Resources Parks and RecreationDivision, said the department estimates itcould sell about 5,000 more permits per year,based on survey results. The change likely would make enforcement more difficult than the current system, wherean annual permit is distinctive and easy forpark employees to see. But Morrissey said itwould not be much more difficult underLeppik 's proposal because the sticker would be designed to clearly show the month andyear it expires. The bill (HF2505) now moves to the House floor. Cut in gambling taxes proposed A bill that would reduce taxes on lawful gambling for the third straight year wasconsidered Feb. 22 by the House TaxesCommittee. Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee), the spon- sor of the measure, said her proposal wouldkeep more charitable money in local commu-nities where it belongs. The committee took no action on the bill but will consider it later for inclusion in theomnibus tax package. The bill (HF2715) would reduce the tax on paddlewheels, raffles, and bingo from 9 per-cent of gross receipts after prizes to 7.5 per-cent. The tax on pull-tabs and tipboards wouldbe reduced from 1.8 percent of gross receiptsto 1.5 percent. Taxes on combined receipts or gross receipts from pull-tabs and tipboards for an organi-zation receives more than $500,000 annuallywould be reduced as little as 0.3 percent or asmuch as 0.9 percent. Under this provision, themore an organization takes in, the greater atax reduction it would receive.#HIGHER EDUCATION Effort to save college Anoka-Hennepin T echnical College would remain open, despite plans by the MinnesotaState Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) sys-tem to close it, under a bill considered Feb. 18by the House Higher Education Finance Com-mittee. The bill (HF2649), sponsored by Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), would allot $14.7 millionto replace and repair the school 's heating, ven- tilating, and air conditioning systems. Supporters of the bill argue that the MnSCU board acted hastily and without proper researchwhen they voted in January to close the facility. \"We intend to find a way to serve the stu- dents of MnSCU, \" Abeler said. \"This is not a partisan matter; this is a battle about mission.Our missions are similar. \" However, MnSCU officials said students would be best served at alternative institutions. Morrie Anderson, chancellor of the system, recommended a \"program realignment, \" which would involve a relocation of Anoka-Hennepin programs to the separate HennepinT echnical College and Anoka-Ramsey Com-munity College. He said the board decided to close theschool because of high building maintenance costs and low population projections. In fact,Anderson said, Abeler 's bill \"leaves future li- ability for work left undone. \" Nearly 2,900 students are enrolled in Anoka-Hennepin T echnical College this year. Health care training programs are a primary function for the school. Health care industryofficials expressed concern that the professionwould lose the graduates the school providesto the field each year. Cheryl Streit, director of corporate human resources at Fairview Hospitals, said Minne-sota will need thousands of new health careworkers next year. She said the field can 't af- ford to lose one school or even one student. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) asked how many graduates of Anoka-Hennepin T echnicalCollege enter health care professions each year. College officials estimated there will be 720 such graduates this year, well below the demand. \"We're not going to make it, \" Dehler said. Although the college might not be able to fuel the health care profession on its own, pro-ponents of the bill argue it is a quality institu-tion and should not be closed. \"There are not frills at AHTC; this is strictly education for employment, \" said Ed Schones, a lobbyist for Education Minnesota. \"The state may or may not save money by closing AHTC,but they would be giving up a valuable invest-ment. \"schools we build in the future are places that are safe and healthy for students to learn, \" said Rep. Kathy Tingelstad (R-Andover), sponsorof the bill. According to Tingelstad, 25 percent of Minnesota 's population spends nearly every day inside a public school. More needs to bedone to help prevent health problems causedby airborne particles, she said. Her bill (HF3097) would take a proactive approach toward regulating air quality inschool buildings, she said. School buildings constructed after July 1, 2002, would be affected by the bill. The billtargets monitoring indoor and outdoor air-flow in new schools every 10 years beginningin 2010. Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R-Hastings) asked if the bill were to later become law, what kind offiscal impact would it have on the school con-struction process. Norm Chaffer of the Department of Chil- dren, Families and Learning said the spend-ing increase for improved equipment wouldbe slight and that it would be offset in the formof cost savings down the road. \"In the long run, an improved system will be more efficient and cost effective, \" Chaffer said. The committee took no action on the bill, butwill consider it at a later date for inclusion inthe K-12 omnibus spending bill.Session Weekly 15King Wilson, the executive director of Al- lied Charities of Minnesota, a nonprofit or-ganization that lobbies for charitable gamblingcauses, said that in 1998 the gross receipts fromcharitable gambling were more than $1.4 bil-lion. Organizations paid out more than$1.1 billion in prizes, contributed more than$77 million to charity, and paid in excess of$63 million in taxes. Wilson said that gambling taxes in Minne- sota are among the highest in the nation. Forexample, he said, in 1987 a Columbia Heightssports booster group had charitable contribu-tions of $22,464 while paying $7,520 in stategambling taxes. But in 1999, the same organi-zation contributed $96,387 to charities whilepaying $123,270 in taxes. Mike Burress, president of the Dead Broke Saddle Club in Hugo, said the club contrib-utes to causes such as the Minnesota SpecialOlympics. But when approached last year bya volunteer fire department that neededequipment including the \"jaws of life, \" the club couldn 't help out. Burress said it takes the club six months to raise enough funds to pay fortaxes alone. #VETERANS Looking to tax billboards A proposal to change tax law related to bill- boards was debated Feb. 21 by the PropertyTax Division of the House Taxes Committee. Most personal property is exempt from property tax, and billboards are generally con-sidered personal property. The bill (HF2645), sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), would list outdooradvertising devices as personal property sub-ject to property taxes. Last year, St. Paul residents rejected a refer- endum question that would have banned bill-boards in the city. Trimble said the bill is notan attempt to pose any restrictions on bill-board advertising in the state. Rather, he said,the bill is an attempt to clarify and bring fair-ness to a property taxation issue. Until 1978, billboards were subject to prop- erty tax, but a ruling by a tax court that yearheld them to be exempt personal property.Trimble said currently some counties may beassessing billboards one way and other coun-ties a different way. Hennepin County Assessor Thomas May said that billboards are not subject to prop-erty tax but are considered in the overallproperty 's value when the assessment is made. T om Hauk, owner of Hauk Outdoor Adver- tising Company, opposed the measure. He saidthat during a time of a budget surplus, it isquestionable why there is a need for new taxes. He cited a Department of Revenuedocument that says the proposal would not add administrative costs for the departmentbut would create significant costs for local gov-ernment assessors who would be required toevaluate outdoor advertising devices bothwhen they go up and on a continuing basis. \"Billboards are already being taxed. This would amount to a double taxation, \" Hauk said. Reps. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) and James Clark (R-Springfield) questionedwhether the definition of outdoor advertisingin the bill is too broad and would open upother business signs to property taxation. Trimble said the intent of the bill was to pri- marily address freestanding billboards and thathe would agree to a more specific definition. The bill may be considered for inclusion in this year 's omnibus tax package. Homestead tax clarification Last year, the Legislature expanded the agricultural homestead tax classification sothat a person who farms the land but isn 't ac- tually living on the farm could qualify forhomestead status. The change provided unexpected difficul- ties for the Department of Revenue. \"It is far and away one of our most difficult programs to administer, \" Jennifer Engh, an assistant commissioner of the department,told the House Taxes Committee 's Property Tax Division on Feb. 18. The new law allowed at least 40 acres of farmland not adjacent to a residence to beconsidered a homestead if certain conditionswere met. Confusion arose over some of thenew law 's definitions. Engh said that the numerous combinations of agricultural partnerships that existthroughout the state are causing part of theproblem. From father-son run farms to aunt-and-niece partnerships, the change last yearleft many wondering whether the new lawapplied to them. Also what the term \"actively farming \" actually means is still unclear. Two bills attempt to clarify some of that confusion. HF2600, sponsored by Rep. JimTunheim (DFL-Kennedy), and HF2758, spon-sored by Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet),would extend the agricultural homestead clas-sification to certain shareholders of familyfarm corporations and partners who do notlive on the agricultural property. The bills are identical, and the committee may further consider each for inclusion in thisyear's omnibus tax bill. In order to qualify for full homestead status, both bills would require that the shareholdersare actively farming the agricultural property andthey are Minnesota residents. The shareholders also would not be allowed to claim another ag-ricultural homestead in the state, and they wouldhave to live within four townships or cities ofthe agricultural property. Rep. T ed Winter (DFL-Fulda) said he thought the intent of last year 's legislation was clear. \"It is simple. Y ou don 't have to live on the land to get homestead status as long as youare actively farming the land and you livewithin the four townships, \" Winter said. Merchant marine honors A proposal to recognize Minnesota 's mem- bers of the merchant marine who served inWorld War II was approved Feb. 18 by theHouse Governmental Operations and Veter-ans Affairs Policy Committee. The bill (HF3017), sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), would allow a memorialplaque to be placed in the court of honor onthe State Capitol grounds. Biernat said theplaque would be paid for through private do-nations, so there would be no cost to the state. Those who served in the merchant marine are not technically veterans, Biernat said, butthey worked on ships during the war andmany were killed at sea. None of the committee members opposed the idea, but Paul Mandell, a planner on theCapitol Area Architectural and PlanningBoard, said there is some concern about thenumber of places left in the court of honor. Mandell said he agrees that the merchant marine is worthy of being recognized, butthere are only 11 spots left in the court ofhonor, and many more organizations couldargue that they should be recognized. The bill now moves to the House Rules Committee. Howard Wilson, Minneapolis, testifies Feb. 18 infront of the House Governmental Operations andVeterans Affairs Policy Committee in favor of a billthat would place a plaque on Capitol grounds tohonor the Minnesota members of the World War IImerchant marine. 16 February 25, 2000BY DAVID MAEDA Historically, Minnesota 's economic devel- opment initiatives have focused on job cre-ation, in an effort to move unemployedresidents of the state into the workforce. As the state 's unemployment rate reaches record low levels at the same time technologyis changing the world in the blink of an eye,policy-makers are looking at whether thestate 's workforce programs are adequately meeting needs. T o get a clearer picture of these issues, last year the Legislature asked for a report exam-ining the way government supports workforcedevelopment. A governor 's \"mini-cabinet \" was established to examine employment and training programs.Its report, entitled World Competitor \u2014 The Governor's Workforce Development Plan , was re- leased last week. The document is an examina-tion of more than 80 state programs. It contains several recommendations as to how the state should redirect the focus of ex-isting programs, eliminate redundancy, anddevelop measurements to continually evalu-ate the effectiveness of programs. The plan also recommends steps to address workforce shortages while at the same timemoving people who are already employed intobetter paying jobs. \"This is a start, something we put on the table, \" Department of Economic Security Commissioner Earl Wilson told the HouseJobs and Economic Development Policy Com-mittee on Feb. 24. \"It is not a panacea, not the whole answer, but it is a start. \" According to the report, Minnesota 's unem- ployment rate in 1999 was 2.5 percent, muchlower than the 5.5 percent level that is con-sidered to be the full employment level bymany economists. T o increase the pool of available workers and to ensure that the workers of tomorroware trained in growing occupational areas, theplan recommends transferring the state 's por- tion of the Workers Development Fund toother areas. Wilson said the program, which has been used to assist dislocated workers, would con-Meeting the demand Low unemployment prompts lawmakers to focus on trainingskilled workers in developing industriesAT ISSUE: EMPLOYMENT # # # tinue with federal funding that amounts tobetween $8 million and $9 million a year. Under the proposal, $4 million of the funds would go to a new emerging worker program.The new program would provide specializedtraining for 11th and 12th grade students tomove into targeted industries. Some members met this recommendation with criticism. Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Vir-ginia) said that the current system already al-lows students to get adequate vocationaltraining. He said that the state 's dislocated workers program is the best in the nation andhe questioned the wisdom of changing some-thing that is working well. Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter) questioned a recommendation to move the state 's displaced homemakers program into the dislocatedworkers program. Storm said that homemak-ers who have been married for 25-30 years andare suddenly on their own with fewmartketable skills need the program. They also need to know the program exists, she said. Strengthening the connection between the state 's higher education system and the market- place is another component of the governor 's plan. The report also recognizes that because lo- cal economies differ, the state 's various regions have different needs. The employment issuesin the metropolitan area are much differentthan those in Greater Minnesota. This is one area where legislators seemed to agree. Already this session, several bills have been heard that address growing concern over howto keep young people in rural Minnesota andslow down the migration to the Twin Cities area. A bill (HF2820) sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) would make a one-time appropriation of $1 million for grants topromote Internet access in rural Minnesota. McElroy 's bill has been approved by the House Jobs and Economic DevelopmentPolicy and Economic Development Financecommittees, as well the House CommerceCommittee. It is now waiting for action by theHouse Ways and Means Committee. A separate bill (HF2604) sponsored by Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) would establish apublic-private corporation, Northern Tech-nology Initiative Inc., that would focus onencouraging growth among existing busi-nesses and attracting technology companiesto the northeast region of the state. Hilty 's bill was approved Feb. 22 by the Jobs and Economic Development Policy Committeeand was sent to the House Government Opera-tions and Veterans Affairs Policy Committee. Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) criti- cized the governor 's development plan 's rec- ommendation to eliminate agricultureimprovement grants. \"Agriculture is still the state 's largest indus- try. Businesses relating to agriculture are beg-ging for people, \" Kubly said. \"This is removing a small piece but it is a very vital piece. Agri-culture is a necessary component of the Min-nesota economy. \" Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) agreed that many of the issues raised in the report needfurther discussion. But he also agreed withWilson that the report is a necessary begin-ning to the discussion. \"It's not perfect but it is a giant step for- ward. It is the first time we have somethingon the table that will help the under-em-ployed, \" he said. Dr. Robert Musgrove, president of Pine Technical College in Pine City, testifies Feb. 22 before theHouse Jobs and Economic Development PolicyCommittee in support of a bill that would createan initiative to foster growth among existing busi-nesses and attract technology companies to thenortheast region of the state.Session Weekly 17BY JON FURE A plan to provide $195 million to enhance wildlife management and recreation areas,improve wastewater treatment facilities, andreduce water pollution was approved Feb. 18by the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Finance Committee. The proposal would spend $70 million more than Gov. Jesse Ventura 's capital budget plan for environment-related initiatives. But proponentsof the proposal say it covers only a fraction ofthe current state needs in those areas. The bill (HF2651), known as Legacy 2000, is sponsored by Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield). Tuma said the goal of the initia-tive is to leave a positive legacy for futuregenerations. \"If you talk to Minnesotans and ask them what they cherish most about the state, themajority of them would say something to dowith the outdoors, \" he said. \"Minnesotans place a high value on our natural resources. \" Most of the money for the initiative would come from the sale of bonds, but some couldcome from the state 's general fund. One program in Tuma 's bill would provide state funds to match donations from peopleor organizations that support improvementsto critical wildlife habitats, which is part ofthe Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM) program.Since 1986, the program has received $4.8million in cash donations and $16.7 millionin land donations. Also, revenue from thecritical habitat vehicle license plates brings inabout $615,000 per year for that program,which is administered by the Department ofNatural Resources (DNR). The Legacy 2000 initiative would spend $3 million for the critical habitat program, whilethe governor recommended spending only $1 million. The DNR ranked the critical habitat program 11th out of its 19 non-building programs. Rep.Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), chair of the com-mittee, said that he and other committee mem-bers would make that a much higher priorityand that the low ranking \"makes us question the direction of (the department). \"A green legacy Plan would provide millions to enhance and protect the environment Another high priority of the committee that is reflected in the Legacy 2000 initiative is aproposal to fund conservation easementsalong the Minnesota River, known as the Con-servation Reserve Enhancement Program. In some areas, surface water carries soil and chemicals from farm fields into the river. Theeasements require the landowners to stop cul-tivating the land, so that it can filter out soiland chemicals, help control flooding, and es-tablish wildlife habitat. Under the conservation program, each $1 in state funds is matched by $2.30 in federalfunds. So far the state has spent $10 millionthat has been matched by $23 million in fed-eral funds. The federal matching funds are only avail- able through September 2002. T o qualify forthe total $140 million of the remaining fed-eral funds, the state would have to pay $60million, which is the amount that is proposed in Tuma 's initiative. Of that $60 million, $20 million would be funded through bonds to besold after July 1, 2002, so those funds wouldnot be counted as part of the total spendingin the current biennium. Steve Hansen, executive director of the Min- nesota River Joint Powers Board, said theLegacy 2000 initiative would double theamount of land in the program. And he saidit is supported by all of the affected counties. The governor 's recommendation is to spend $25 million for that conservation program. Other programs that would be funded un- der the Legacy 2000 initiative include: $26 million to the Public Facilities Authority for grants to improve wastewa-ter systems in the state, which would bematched by an equal amount of federalfunds; $14 million in grants to local govern- ments to establish parks, trails, or scenicareas, which would require 50 percent inmatching local funds; $10 million to acquire land for metro greenways; $10 million for improvements to state parks; $10 million for grants to the Depart- ment of Agriculture for conservationeasements, which would require 50percent matching funds from counties; $9.5 million to help reduce flooding and restore natural areas in the Red RiverValley ; $5 million to protect the state 's remain- ing native prairies; and $5 million for a pilot grant program to protect lake shores and river banks fromcommercial development. Timing is critical to maximize the benefits of many of the programs, said Rep. T omOsthoff (DFL-St. Paul). The metro greenwaysprogram, for example, is designed to acquireremaining natural areas for parks, trails, andscenic areas, and the money will go farther theearlier it is used. \"Land prices are skyrocketing while we 're sitting here, \" he said. Osthoff added that the bill would spend only about $22 million in the metro area. The legacy bill now moves to the House Capital Investment Committee, where it willbe considered for inclusion in the committee 's omnibus bonding bill. AT ISSUE: ENVIRONMENT # # # Whitney Clark testifies Feb. 18 on the shorelineprotection portion of the Legacy 2000 bill ap-proved by the House Environment and NaturalResources Finance Committee. 18 February 25, 2000AT ISSUE: TRANSPORTATION # # # BY CHRIS VETTERAfter weeks of discussing Minnesota 's outdated transporta - tion infrastructure \u2014 from faltering bridges to out-of-shape roads \u2014 the House Transportation Finance Committee Feb. 23 approved a $382.6 million bonding proposal. The proposal calls for $55 million in general obligation bonds to be sold for transportation projects, primarily for bridge up-grades. The remaining costs would be paid by bonds paid off bythe Trunk Highway Fund.Building bridges Bonding plan would provide $300 million more fortransportation than the governor requested The plan now heads to the House Capital Investment Committee. The funding request is dramatically differ- ent from the governor 's proposal. Gov. Jesse Ventura recommended $27 million in TrunkHighway Fund bonds; the committee toppedthat number by $300 million. In fact, the governor 's total request, com- bining general obligation and trunk highwayfund bonding, was $67 million for transpor-tation. In a ranking of bonding priorities, Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), chair of the com-mittee, placed bridge replacement at the top.Bridges, unlike roads, can be funded throughgeneral obligation bonds. More than 600 bridges in Minnesota need to be replaced in the next two years at a costof $44 million, said Ed Cohoon, chief finan-cial officer for the Department of Transpor-tation. There are currently 2,558 deficientbridges in county, city, and township systems. Cohoon noted that Ventura, who vetoed bridge funding last year, submitted a generalobligation bond request of $30 million. Julie Skallman, metro division engineer with the Transportation Department, said ifthe full $44 million request is not met, thedepartment will select bridges based on whatprojects have federal matching funds. Molnau said that not providing funding for bridges would create hazardous conditions.\"The idea is we would actually close those bridges, \" Molnau said recently. \"They 'll probably be in Greater Minnesota, so it doesn 't matter anyway, \" she added sar- castically. \"That bridge would be closed if we thought it was unsafe, \" Cohoon told the committee. \"But I don 't think we 're at that point. \" Delaying repairs on a bridge can hurt a town financially if a bridge is closed, Molnau said.Towns that do not receive funding for a bridgethis year can expect to wait for repairs, Molnausaid. Because the governor vetoed bridge fundsa year ago, it is unlikely he would approve abonding request in 2001, she added. Transportation officials predict the total annual investment needed to replace bridgesfor the next 10 years is $68 million. The bridge replacement project was initi- ated in 1976 and has received an average of$8 million each year since 1990, according toa department report. Though bridges are critical needs, road re- pair is the key component of the trunk high-way fund bonding proposal. Approximately$200 million would be spent in the metropoli-tan area, with another $100 million foroutstate roads. \"The costs of doing projects in the metro is much greater than the outstate area, \" Molnau said. The committee approved funding for a new$10.4 million Department of Transportation facility in St. Cloud, along with an $8.7 mil-lion upgrade at its Detroit Lakes headquar-ters. The Regional TransportationManagement Center in Roseville would get$6.7 million for a new facility, but would beordered to sell its old facility within three years.The facilities are required by the MinnesotaConstitution to be financed through the TrunkHighway Fund. The committee also approved funding for rail projects. The Minnesota Rail Service In-vestment program, which initially sought$12 million for rail upgrades on short lines inthe state, was approved for $5 million in gen-eral obligation bonds. The Capital Investment Committee will consider a proposed $5 million for the plannedupgrades on the DM&E rail line crossing thesouthern part of the state from Winona toLake Benton. The railroad sought $50 million.The DM&E project was sent to the CapitalInvestment Committee without recommenda-tion to pass and is not included in the Trans-portation Finance Committee 's $382.6 million bonding request. Neither rail project was included in the governor 's request. Another $5 million in general obligation bonds would be appropriated for port devel-opment assistance grants, under thecommittee 's plan. One notable request that was not approved was $10 million to design a transitway in theTwin Cities. The money would have been usedto begin engineering and designs on one bus-only road. The governor has recommendedplanning and constructing three bus-onlytransitways at a cost of about $110 millioneach. Rep. Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington) was critical of the committee 's decision to not fund the transitways, saying the bus-only roads area better option than light rail. Molnau said the committee will hear a bill later this session that would transfer about$400 million of the state surplus from the gen-eral fund to the trunk highway fund for roadupgrades. Session Weekly 19HISTORY # # # The assistant governor African-American aide served 14 chief executives from 1904 to 1957 BY LECLAIR G. L AMBERTWhen Governor-elect John A. Johnson prepared to move into the new Capitolbuilding late in 1904, he sent a telegram to William F. \"Billy \" Williams, a young acquaintance and semi-pro baseball player. Johnson wanted himto handle the transfer of official documents, papers,and other details for the office. Billy Williams at work in the governor's office.The governor-elect felt that only a few men he knew could handle such important duties, and one was Billy Williams.The skill, daring, and determination Williams showed as a star onthe baseball field, and the wit and intelligence he displayed whenthe two first met on the baseball diamond, had impressed thenewly elected governor. Johnson 's offer to Williams created some indecision for the black athlete, who had justbeen offered a chance at abaseball career with a couple ofprofessional teams. But knowingthat discrimination would limithis chances in baseball and faced with the advice from one big-league scout that he deny hisethnicity and claim to be anAmerican Indian, Williamsturned down his chance topursue a life in baseball.The governor-elect convinced him that a job at the Capitolwould be more meaningful forhim as a bellwether for his race 's sparse population in the area. So Williams, who was a St.Paul waiter at the time, took Gov. Johnson 's offer, which allowed him to continue playingbaseball on weekends. A lifetime of service Johnson was sworn in on January 4, 1905, with Williams as his aide and confidant. WhenJohnson died in office in 1909,Williams was so respectedaround the Capitol that he didnot lose his job when Lt. Gov.Adolph O. Eberhart was swornin. And Williams didn 't leave the governor 's office until 1957, when he retired after 53 years ofpublic service. Williams served 14 governors of different political parties. Aspart of a tribute to 50 years ofservice, the 1955 LegislativeManual is dedicated to him andcontains his photograph andbiography. Pictured with Billy Williams, right , at his retirement in September 1957 are seven of the 14 governors he served. They are, from left , Govs. J.A.A. Burnquist (1915-1921), (1943-1947), Luther W.

Scott came to Fort Snelling in the late 1830s with hisowner, Dr. John Emerson, anArmy surgeon. When Scottwas there, Fort Snelling waspart of the Wisconsin T erri-tory. The area would later bepart of the Minnesota T erri-tory, established in 1849 andgranted statehood nine yearslater. At the fort, Scott did not live wholly as a slave. He mar-ried Harriet Robinson,servant and Emerson werefrom Missouri,then a slave state. In thecoming years, Scott would usehis residence at Fort Snellingto try to gain his own free-dom. Backed by abolitionists, Scott sued for freedom, sayingthat because he had beentaken to the free territories in-cluding Fort Snelling and hadlived as a free man, he shouldbe free when he returned tohis native Missouri. Precedent seemed to be on Scott 's side. Others had sued successfully on the samegrounds. For example, a 1836Missouri case involving an-other slave who had beentaken to Fort Snelling endedMinnesota forever linked to the Dred Scott case Williams was known to some as the \"assistant governor \" because of his vast knowledgeabout the office and hiscontinual closeness to all thechief executives he worked for.On many occasions he encour-aged legislators to promoteequal rights and other issues hebelieved were important for allMinnesotans. Born, raised in St. Paul Williams was born on a cool October evening in 1877, in his family 's home on West Ninth Street in St. Paul. He grew up inthe shadow of the second StateCapitol. The experience of being one of few African Americans in thestate 's capital city made him understand what a tremendousopportunity Johnson had givenhim. \"No other Negro in the state will be in theposition you 'll be in, \" Johnson told Williamswhen he accepted thejob. \"The people you 'll meet, the friendsyou'll make can be a tremendous asset forgood racial harmony. \" He felt very strongly that his position with thegovernor 's office gave him a chance to advocate for issuesimportant to members of hisrace. But he also got the benefit of welcoming national andinternational dignitaries, as wellas world-class athletes to theState Capitol. Williams was always the first person to greet visitors to thegovernor 's office. In fact, among the 350,000 people he greetedwere Woodrow Wilson (thengovernor of New Jersey),William Jennings Bryan, and sixsitting U.S. presidents. Harry S.Truman even attended a reception for him. On different occasions, boxers Joe Louis and Jack Johnsonvisited. Williams also met a group of four Sioux Indian chiefs whowanted to demand money forland along the Minnesota River.Williams diffused the situationbefore the potentially hostilesituation could go any further. Perhaps the most memorable visitor who met with Williamswas Haile Selassie, Emperor ofEthiopia. Honoring a legend When Williams died in 1963 at the age of 86, seven Minnesota governors werehonorary pallbearers for thelegendary public servant.Former Gov. Harold Stassenwanted to attend, but could not because he wasworking with theUnited Nations. Hundreds of people mourned the loss ofWilliam F. \"Billy \" Williams, and atribute to him wasread into the U.S.CongressionalRecord. Williams was replaced by Charles A. Graham, who died inJanuary of this year at the age of94. Graham also served as anexecutive aide in the governor 's office for many years. During histenure, he worked for sevengovernors. Graham 's son, Ralph, who died in January 1999 at the ageof 73, served as assistantsergeant in the Senate for 33years. Ralph Graham continuedthe high principles exhibited byWilliams and his father by neverfaltering in preserving thedignity and decorum of theSenate. Ralph Grahamwith the slave being freed. Scott would not succeed, but his case would be a turn-ing point that propelled thenation toward the Civil Warand, ultimately, the end of sla-very in all states. The U. S. Supreme Court, however, did not agree. Its fa-mous decision of 1857 ruledthat slaves taken to a free statewere still property. As such,the court said, Scott was not acitizen and did not even havethe right to sue. Three years later, in 1860, a slave named Eliza Winstonwould use the same argumentand be granted her freedom. She was the servant to the wife of a wealthy Mis- sissippi plantation family that had asummer cottage on Lake Harriet in Minne- apolis. Winston wanted her free- dom, so with the help of a free black family and as-sistance from an anti-slaverygroup, a writ of habeas corpus , or unlawful imprisonment,was submitted to a judge onher behalf. Though lawyers for Col. Ri- chard Christmas, the slaveowner, argued that the DredScott decision should have pre-cedence over the case, the judgeruled that Winston should befreed. The judge based his rul-ing on the Minnesota Consti-tution, which said slavery wasillegal in the state. He pro-claimed Winston \"free to go. \" (L.

TRANSPORTATION POLICY 5 State Office Building Chr. Rep. Tom Workman The Legislature is constantly in a state of flux. As new members get elected everytwo years, others may lose at the polls orretire from service. Change may also oc-cur when new laws are made or old andoutdated laws get replaced. Change is an ongoing process for the Legislature. Currently, the Legislature isdebating with a possible change in its verynature \u2014 one house or two. The same is- sue was introduced in the 1930s, but neverwent far. Other big changes possible this session could effect a new part of the GraduationStandards in schools and plans for light-rail transit. The memory of some event or the an- ticipation of the results of some futureproposal may also influence change. In theearly 1600s, Shakespeare noted that we of-ten \"...summon up remembrances of things past \" to deal maturely with the changes of things present. And the popular early 1960s songster Sam Cooke evoked the need by crooning,\"A Change is Gonna Come. \"Memories affect change because they remind us of something different thatevolved out of a former act or deed or setthe tone for future achievements. The ac-complishments of deceased lawmakersBarb Vickerman, Ken Otremba, JanetJohnson, Jim Rice, and Willard Mungerare remembered because their gooddeeds are positive results on issues eachone strongly believed in. Their achievements may or may not be remembered in time because memoriescan be vulnerable to new changes thaterase former deeds. Whether change is motivation to cre- ate good government, or whether it is anevery day method for improving the sta-tus quo, it controls how important eachdebate can be. And the certainties of change plus compromise become deciding factors forwhat issues become law in the Legislature. But to many people, the change we at the Legislature take for granted is jarring.Nowhere else is that more evident than in the world of the city of St. Paul 's late hero, \"Peanuts \" cartoonist Charles Schulz. There, change always seemed to be un- certain or unexpected. It 's possible that many diligent \"Peanuts \" fans recognized vulnerability in the cartoon and identifiedwith its characters. For sure, uncertainty has prevailed for the \"Peanuts \" family, more than any recent legislative action designed to change thestatus of important issues. Maybe if changes were the norm and had always been available for Linus,Schroeder, and Peppermint Patty, Lucywould have allowed the football to bekicked. Even so, she probably still wouldhave vocalized, \"Good Grief, Charlie Brown, \" as a surprise to a change she had not come to expect. Change is as certain as it is uncertain \u2014 for the Legislature and its constituency,and for \"Peanuts \" and the fans who avidly read it. \u2014L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERTAgenda: HF2564 (Workman) Public utility facilities relocated due to light rail constructionentitled to expense reimbursement from the state.HF3030 (Seagren) Truck traffic prohibited onHennepin County Road No. 1 between TrunkHighway No. 169 and Flying Cloud Drive.HF3573 (Knoblach) Minnesota Highway SafetyCenter at St. Cloud State University alcohol andhighway safety education in elementary andsecondary schools grants administrationtransferred to Commissioner of Public Safety. 10 a.m. CRIME PREVENTION Basement Hearing Room State Office BuildingChr.

Wheelock stressed that the forecast is based on current law. Any changes in law that are pro-posed, such as tax cuts, will need to be judgedon how they affect future biennia. T o determinewhether such a proposal is affordable, Wheelocksaid a key figure is the projected structural bal-ance \u2014 the difference between the state 's rev- enues and expenditures in a given year. For example, an income tax cut that would go into effect in 2001 would affect the amountof revenue in the 2002-03 biennium. The Finance Department would examine how such a tax cut would affect the projecteddifference in revenues and expenditures forfiscal year 2003, among other factors, to de-termine whether the proposal would beaffordable for a sustained period of time. The recent forecast projects a $549 million structural surplus for fiscal year 2003 \u2014 if current law remains in effect. Therefore, thisyear 's proposals to permanently change annual expenditures or revenue \u2014 either by spending more or collecting less \u2014 should only add up to that amount in order for thestate to maintain a balanced budget, accord-ing to Wheelock. \"In terms of permanent commitment, $549 million is the yardstick we will use to measureif (proposed changes) are affordable, \" Wheelock said. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) said it seems that the entire $549 million would betaken up by the governor 's proposals to cut vehicle license tab fees and to fund light-railtransit on the Hiawatha Corridor. Wheelock agreed and said any other pro- posal by the Legislature would probably meanthat V entura would have to be persuaded tochange his priorities. Many factors influenced the changes be- tween the November and February forecasts. For the 2000-01 biennium, net general fund revenues are projected to be $24.6 billion,which is $222 million (0.9 percent) more thanthe amount that was projected in the Novem-ber forecast. Projected spending has decreased by $12 million, partly due to reductions in health carespending. Declining costs of long-term healthcare and fewer people enrolled in the Depart-ment of Human Services ' Minnesota Family\"Folks, enough is enough in regard to the overtaxation, the overcollection of hardworkingfamilies ' and hardworking taxpayers ' dollars in Minnesota, \" said House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) during a press conference outsidethe office of Gov. Jesse Ventura. \"We need per- manent tax reduction. \" In response to the forecast, House Republi- cans re-emphasized their proposal from theto cut vehicle license tab fees and use some of the surplus to reform property taxes in 2001. The twice-yearly forecasts are based on infor- mation from the state 's national economic con- sultant, Data Resources Inc. The state FinanceDepartment and the Council of EconomicAdvisors study the information and make pro-jections based on current laws and historic rela-tionships between state and national data. The budget surplus for the 2000-2001 bi- ennium is projected to be more than $1.8 bil-lion, which is $229 million more than thedepartment had projected last November. Thelatest report was the 16th consecutive stateforecast to predict a budget surplus. The news prompted some lawmakers to call for permanent tax cuts to avoid consistent sur-pluses.beginning of the 2000 session to reduce the percentage of state income tax charged in eachbracket \u2014 by 0.75 percent in the middle bracket and 0.5 percent in the upper and lowerbrackets. Those figures would match the in-come tax cuts that were made last year. But Ventura said at a March 1 press confer- ence that the numbers are still only projectionsand he plans to stick to his previous proposals A swarm of media and legislators from the House and Senate surround House Speaker Steve Sviggumduring a Feb. 29 news conference outside Gov. Jesse Ventura's office. Sviggum called for income taxcuts that would be paid for with the state's forecast budget surplus.4 March 3, 2000IT'SAFACT The fast-talking, glad-handing mer- chants offering to sell Minnesotans swamp-land in Florida or the Brooklyn Bridge weredealt a blow during the tenure of formerGov. Karl Rolvaag. In 1960, Walter Mondale, then the state 's attorney general, appointed a 16-memberConsumer Protection Advisory Council toprotect consumers from fraudulent prac-tices. Composed of representatives from busi- ness and labor, the council was chargedwith the task of making recommendationsto the Legislature of how the state coulddo that. In a special message to the 1963 Legisla- ture, Rolvaag urged members to pass sev-eral consumer protection related bills. Inthe speech, Rolvaag said that afree market economy dependson fair competition among pro-ducers and sellers for the busi-ness of an informed buyingpublic. Rolvaag said consumer de- ception and fraud cost legiti-mate businesses millions ofdollars each year that were di-verted to undeserving \"unethi- cal, shabby, inefficient, andincompetent \" businesses. He asked lawmakers to sup- port legislation incorporatingthe ideas of the Consumer Pro-tection Advisory group. One of the bills proposed re- quired people selling subdividedreal estate located both insideand outside of the state to register with thecommissioner of securities. Rolvaag saidthe bill addressed a growing problem in thestate \u2014 naive consumers being swindled out of their retirement funds and endingup with worthless land. Up until that point the state had no laws regulating the sale of subdivided land, de-fined in the bill as \"land divided or pro- posed to be divided for the purpose of saleor lease, into five or more lots or parcels. \" The measure proposed adopting a spe-Too good to be true Legislation aimed to protect consumers from slippery salesmen cific plan of registration for land sales.First, those attempting to sell subdivisionswould go through the formal registrationprocess, which would require the seller tosubmit to an investigation, verifying thelegitimacy of the land sale. Then, when the commissioner had completed the investigation, he wouldissue a public report, which would act asa prospectus to potential buyers. The bill received unanimous support in both houses \u2014 passing the House on a 127-0 vote and the Senate by a 58-0 tally. Two other consumer protection initia- tives also were passed during the 1963 ses-sion. One expanded the powers of theattorney general to deal with fraud, de-ception, and misrepresentation in connec- tion with the sale ofmerchandise. The other had a little less obvious consumer spin to it.The measure imposed a $500limit on the amount of con-tracts a person could sign fordance lessons at any giventime. Rolvaag said the measure addressed a serious problemin the state, where \"glib- tongued, high-pressuredsalesmen for dance studios,who prey upon the lonely,the widowed, and the friend-less\" were inducing people to sign contracts for dance les-sons far in excess of theirneeds. Mondale described the problem, as fol- lows: \"Sums as high as $17,000 could be contracted for if a lonely widow is madeto think that her refusal will incur the dis-pleasure of her 'teacher. '\" Other consumer protection initiatives that failed to pass that session continuedto be debated throughout the decade andseveral later became part of the state 's laws protecting the buying public. (D. M AEDA )Investment Program (MFIP) are the two biggest factors of the reduction. Projected spending in those areas decreased by $42 million, but $30 million in projectedincreases in education and other areas makesthe net reduction $12 million. And interest earnings in the Property Tax Reform Account have increased by $5 millionsince the November forecast. (The reform ac-count serves as a quasi-reserve fund for thepurpose of reforming property taxes. It wasestablished in 1997.) That plus the $222million increase in revenue and $12 milliondecrease in expenditures adds up to the $229million increase in the surplus. State Economist Tom Stinson said the data provided by the consultant for the new fore-cast indicates only a slightly higher risk of arecession. A bigger concern is that theeconomy will \"underperform \" compared to its current rate of growth. Officials point to a 3 percent decrease in the projected corporate income tax revenue for2000-01 since the November forecast. Thatwas based on a reduction in the projected cor-porate profits through 2002. Stinson attrib-uted that to higher interest rates, higher energyprices, increasing wages for employees, andspending related to Y2K preparation. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) expressed concerns about the farm economy, which is bleakdespite the good outlook overall for Minnesota. According to the Finance Department 's report on the February forecast, the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture has projected that this yearsoybeans will sink to their lowest price since1973. In addition, corn, wheat, and milk priceswill be as low as they have been in about 10 years. \"If you are in agriculture, times are not going to be good in 2000, \" Stinson said. Unless crop yields this year are higher than normal for the second consecutive year andthe federal government sends more financialassistance to farmers, the projected low priceswill cause Minnesota 's farm income to de- crease significantly, Stinson said. Minnesota farmers received $314 million in federal disaster aid in 1999, according to thereport. Whether the projections in the forecast come true remains to be seen, but it providessome of the most up-to-date information thatlawmakers and the governor will use to nego-tiate the major spending proposals before theend of the session in April.

Karl Rolvaag andthen-U.S. Senator WalterMondale in 1967.Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 24 - ARCH 2 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #AGRICULTURE #CHILDRENFeedlot permit deadlines A bill that would set deadlines to assure timely review of feedlot permits was approvedMarch 1 by the House Agriculture PolicyCommittee. The bill (HF3271), sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), would require an authoritygranting permits to provide the applicant adetailed checklist of obligations and require-ments to obtain a permit within 30 days ofreceiving the permit application. An applicant would then have all the time necessary to satisfy conditions of permit ap-plication and report back to the authority atthe time all conditions are met, Ness said. After all items on the checklist were satis- fied, the bill would require that the authorityeither issue the permit or send a detailed or-der explaining why the permit was denied. \"The purpose of the bill is not to cause any trouble or to shake up the process, but ratherto help farmers, the (Minnesota PollutionControl Agency), and all individuals involvedin the process, \" Ness said. Under the bill, an applicant denied a per- mit would be allowed to petition the denial incourt. The permitting authority would thenbe required to pay 80 percent of the applicant 's petition costs, Ness explained. A Senate version of Ness 's bill awaits a vote on the Senate floor. It would require that adecision on a request for a feedlot permit bemade within 60 days of receipt of the permitapplication. HF3271 now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources PolicyCommittee. Funds for kids' programs Some lawmakers want the state to distrib- ute currently unused federal T emporary As-sistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds thatit's already getting. The House Family and Early Childhood and Education Finance Committee heard several billsMarch 1 that would invest the assistance fundsin projects aimed at children. The committee setall the bills aside for later consideration. None of the bills would create a new state appropriation. They all aim only to spend thefederal dollars sent to the state.Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) is sponsoring a bill (HF3865) that would trans-fer $35 million to the Department of Children,Families and Learning for the Basic Sliding Feechild care assistance program. There are between 3,700 and 4,000 families on waiting lists to receive child care assistance,Chaudhary told the committee. The bill per-tains to families with incomes below 200 per-cent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Poverty guidelines vary based on the size of a household and income levels. The 1999poverty level for a single person is $8,240.) Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) offered a bill (HF3722) that would appropriate $15 millionover the next three years for grants that wouldincrease participation of low-income familiesin early childhood programs. Another Mullerybill (HF3693) would spend $7.5 million overthe next three years on grants for local HeadStart programs. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) questioned the Head Start funding, wondering what spe-cific unmet needs would be solved with themoney. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) saidthat 40 percent of children in his district thatqualify for Head Start are not enrolled in thefederal program because of a lack of money. Minnesota spends more money on Head Start than any other state except Ohio, notedRep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior). The committee heard from several people who testified that having their children inHead Start has benefited the whole family be-cause it frees up more of the parents ' time to work. The state receives $267 million annually in TANF funds. Finance Department officialsestimate the state would have reserves total-ing $173 million by the end of fiscal year 2000if no laws are changed. The department pre-dicts the unspent revenue would climb to $223million for fiscal year 2003. #CRIME #CONSUMERS Drug discount cards Prescription drug discount cards are not always what they seem and they should be la-beled clearly so there is no confusion, said Rep.Larry Howes (R-Hackensack). Howes is sponsoring a bill (HF2883) that would require such labels. He told the HouseCivil Law Committee on Feb. 28 that manysenior citizens purchase the cards, believingthe discounts are good at all pharmacies. The cards usually pertain to a specific store. The committee approved the bill. It now heads to the House floor. William Bond, chief executive officer of the Minnesota Pharmacies Association, told thecommittee that some seniors buy the cards,usually for $8 a month, thinking the cards areaccepted everywhere. The cards may be accepted at all pharmacies in the Twin Cities, for example, but not acceptedanywhere in rural Minnesota, Howes said. Wording on the card should be printed in \"bold and prominent type, prominently placed \" so it is easily seen, the bill states. The bill also includes civil penalties for com- panies that don 't comply. The bill would re- quire that an action must be brought withintwo years of the time the offense was com-mitted or within two years of the time the of-fense was discovered. No criminal penalties are included in the bill. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) praised the measure, calling it a good consumer-protection bill. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) suggested adding language to the bill that would require aminimum type size for the words on the cardsso seniors can read them, but the committee didnot approve Mahoney 's proposal. Some seek cheaper BCA plan A proposal for a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) building is not part ofthe House State Government FinanceCommittee 's bonding recommendations. The committee 's bonding plan was pre- sented Feb. 29 to the House Capital InvestmentCommittee. Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview), chair of the state government panel, said the Depart-ment of Public Safety already has enoughmoney to plan and design a smaller projecton its current site that would satisfy its needfor expansion. The department has received $7.2 million in previous years to plan a new BCA building,Krinkie said, and $2.1 million of that has notbeen spent. Officials are most concerned about the bureau 's laboratory facilities, Krinkie said, and those problems could be resolved by6 March 3, 2000repairing the current building and using the $2.1 million to design an adjacent lab build-ing. The bureau has requested $58 million for the new building, which also has been recom-mended by Gov. Jesse V entura. The House Judiciary Finance Committee recommended $30 million for the project. Krinkie said the $58 million project seems to be the result of a \"self-fulfilling prophecy, \" because it has been pushed forward withoutan appropriate study of the other options. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Charlie Weaver stressed the need for a newbuilding, calling the bureau the \"nerve center of the entire criminal justice system. \" He listed severe problems with the existing building,including pipes that have recently burst andmold that is growing in the walls due to con-densation. Weaver said the current work environment is dangerous to employees and will eventuallylead to evidence being compromised, amongother problems. That prompted Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Roch- ester) to question how the problem ever gotso bad. \"We need to make sure that the BCA em- ployees \u2014 wherever they 're located \u2014 don 't have these kinds of problems, \" he said. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) said it would be a mistake to leave the projectunfunded. Most of the committee 's other recommen- dations fall in line with the governor 's plan. They include $23.6 million for maintenanceand repairs in state buildings, such as $4.3 mil-lion for the Department of Health buildingand $2.5 million to upgrade electrical systemsthroughout the Capitol complex. Another committee recommendation is $250,000 in grants to public television stationsto prepare for a federal mandate to switch toa digital broadcast signal. The governor vetoed$113,000 for that purpose in 1999.Progress Report BILL: HF2745 SUMMARY : Felony penalties for fourth DWI convictionwithin 10 years ACTION : Endorsed by Judi- ciary Finance Committeeafter earlier approval byCrime Prevention Com-mittee UP NEXT : Awaits hearing in State GovernmentFinance Committee SENA TE : Companion bill introduced and referredto Senate CrimePrevention Committee Felony for repeat DWI offenders In principle, a House proposal to create a felony penalty for multiple drunken drivingoffenses has received bipartisan support. But when it comes down to the significant financial impact the plan could have on bothstate and local resources, the plan is more dif-ficult to sell. The House Judiciary Finance Committee approved the bill (HF2745) that would makea person 's fourth conviction for drunken driv- ing within a 10-year period a felony. But members expressed concern that the state might not be able to afford all the fiscaleffects that could accompany the measure. \"I'll vote for the bill, but in some ways, Ithink this might be an exercise in futility, \" said Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul). Beyond making the fourth offense a felony, the bill, sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), also would require anyone con-victed of felony drunken driving to serve atleast five to seven years in prison and pay upto a $14,000 fine. The bill would allow a judge to stay a prison sentence and instead require the person toserve six months in jail, and after serving thattime, successfully complete a 10-year proba-tionary period with no drug or alcohol use orsubsequent offenses. Currently, the highest penalty in Minnesota for drunken driving is a gross misdemeanor,which calls for up to one year in prison and amaximum $3,000 fine. Initial fiscal analysis of the bill projects it will cost the state $3.3 million in fiscal year2001, $10.8 million in 2002, and $18.6 million in 2003. The analysis was based on the num-ber of people con-victed of a fourthDWI in 1998, or1,388 people. Sev-eral formulas to toprison, and howmany more ap-peals the statewould handle. State officials said that beyond the costs of incarceratingdrunken driving offenders in either state pris-ons or county jails, the new felony penaltywould create several new positions for proba-tion officers, lawyers, judges, and forensicscientists. Officials testified that some of their assump- tions have changed since the initial study andthe fiscal impact might be less than originallyanticipated. However, analysts said it will stillbe significant. Analysts have not determined the full im- pact of costs passed down to counties if judgeschoose to depart from prison sentences andsend offenders to jail. Jerry Soma, division manager for Anoka County Human Services, said he anticipatesthe felony designation could cost the countybetween $1 million and $2 million. Soma saidthe county would need 35 to 40 new jail beds,as well. The bill now goes to the House State Gov- ernment Finance Committee. #DEVELOPMENTPenalties for fake IDs A bill that would increase penalties for at- tempting to purchase alcohol with false iden-tification was approved March 2 by the HouseCrime Prevention Committee. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) is sponsoring a bill (HF2655) that would makea person 's second conviction for underage purchase alcohol a gross misdemeanor. The bill also would allow the alcohol dis- tributor \u2014 from a liquor store clerk to a bouncer at a nightclub \u2014 to confiscate iden- tification cards that appear to be phony. Leppik said the bill is needed to curb the widespread abuse of fake IDs. \"They can get it off the Internet, they can get it anywhere, \" she said. \"It becomes a game. \" The bill would require the ID to be turned over to the police or to the legitimate cardowner within 48 hours. Rep. Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine) offered an amendment that would allow the personwho confiscated the card to return it to theparent or guardian of the card owner. Thecommittee approved the amendment. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) opposed the bill, saying it gives bouncers too much lee-way to confiscate identification cards. \"It's quite a hardship for someone who is there legally, \" Skoglund said. \"There is going to be abuse. \" Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) opposed the gross misdemeanor charge for a secondoffense, saying it is too strict. He said he pre-ferred keeping the penalty as a misdemeanor. A gross misdemeanor conviction carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonmentand a $3,000 fine. A misdemeanor convictioncarries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jailand a $700 fine. Leppik said that removing the gross misde- meanor would strip much of the impact fromthe bill. The bill now heads to the House floor. Guthrie funding pitched The state would contribute $25 million to help the Guthrie Theater move to a newMississippi River site, under a proposal de-bated March 1 by the House Jobs and Eco-nomic Development Finance Committee. The bill (HF3900), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), would send bondproceeds for a grant to the Minneapolis Com-munity Development Agency to help the cityplan, design, construct, and furnish the newtheater. The request was one of nearly 70 bills total- ing over $312 million the committeeSession Weekly 7considered in its recommendation to the House Capital Investment Committee for thisyear's bonding bill. \"The Guthrie is part of what makes our quality of life what it is, \" Abrams said. \"It is an asset not only for Minneapolis, but for theTwin Cities, for the entire state, for the UnitedStates, and for the world. \" Stephen Sanger, president of General Mills, said the Guthrie Theater helps distinguish thecity from others and plays a vital part of at-tracting and keeping workers in the state. \"It's not a matter of competing with Pillsbury or 3M, it 's about competing with Amazon.com and Microsoft. It 's Minneapolis versus Seattle and all of Silicone Valley, \" Sanger said. Joe Dowling, the theater 's artistic director, said the total cost of the project is expected tobe $75 million. Dowling said the proposalwould expand the existing artistic programand provide three separate stages. In addition, education and community out- reach programs and the artist-training pro-gram would be expanded. The scheduledopening date for the new site would be 2004,he said. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) ques- tioned the bill 's site-specific provisions be- cause the location was not the GuthrieJoe Dowling, artistic director of the Guthrie The-ater, testifies March 1 before the House Jobs andEconomic Development Finance Committee insupport of a proposed $25 million in state fundsfor a new theater along the Mississippi River inMinneapolis. Theater 's first choice. And, he said, potential sites in St. Paul should have been considered. Abrams said the theater 's decision for the riverfront site reflected a loyalty to Minneapo-lis, where the theater has been located for 37years. Dowling said that the theater not only has metropolitan area appeal but that 40 percentof its customers come from outstate. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) agreed the theater is important for those in Greater Min-nesota. \"I'm just a poor old farm boy but I 'm be- hind this project 100 percent, \" Davids said. #EDUCATION Simone Haugen, a fifth-grade teacher at Turtle Lake Elementary School in Shoreview, describesher positive experiences with a teachermentorship program. Haugen spoke before theHouse K-12 Education Finance Committee onMarch 1 in support of a bill that would increasespending for such efforts. Teacher mentoring program Rep. John Dorn (DFL-Mankato) is sponsor- ing a bill that would appropriate $34 millionfrom the general fund in fiscal year 2001 tofund teacher mentoring programs in schooldistricts across Minnesota. Dorn 's bill (HF2754) would provide a source of funding for districts to increase op-portunities for interaction between new teach-ers and mentors, he said. The House K-12 Education Finance Com- mittee heard the bill March 1. It will be con-sidered for inclusion in the committee 's om- nibus spending measure. The money would be directed to the com- missioner of the Department of Children,Families and Learning, who would then dis-tribute it to school districts on a need basis,Dorn said. Under the bill, teacher mentoring revenue could be used by districts to hire mentors andcoordinators, create release time for newteachers to spend with mentors, and allow newteachers to observe other teachers at work. Money also could be spent to create after- hours, weekend, and summer programs fornew teachers to work with mentors, and toestablish mentoring programs for non-in-structional staff, Dorn said. Mentoring programs were identified by an interim subcommittee as a way to improveteacher training. Pushing student achievement Rep. Margaret Anderson Kelliher (DFL- Minneapolis) is sponsoring a bill that wouldauthorize additional general education rev-enue for school intervention programs to im-prove student achievement. The bill (HF2756), presented March 1 to the House K-12 Education Finance Committee,would appropriate an undetermined amountof general education aid in fiscal year 2001 tofund intervention programs targeting studentsat risk of performing poorly on third- andfifth-grade tests. The appropriation also could be used to aid students who have not yet passed the basicskills tests in reading, math, and writing,Kelliher said. Under the bill, money could be spent to cre- ate programs to train more teachers in appro-priate early intervention techniques, and toestablish reliable screening tools used to iden-tify children who are not able to read at grade-appropriate levels, said Kelliher. The bill would set a school district 's inter- vention revenue at $20 per pupil unit in kin-dergarten through grade six, and $20 in gradesnine through 12 per student for those whohave not yet passed the three required basicskills tests. Kelliher 's bill also would encourage schools to select a nationally established, research-based early intervention reading curriculumthat requires high parental involvement. The committee took no action on the bill, but may consider it for inclusion in thecommittee 's omnibus spending measure.8 March 3, 2000There is a new publication available from the nonpartisan House Public InformationOffice. Capitol Steps: How Six Bills Became Law is a 34-page booklet that explains the legis-lative process in a simple, straightforwardmanner. The booklet is an update of a popular pub- lication originally printed by Public Informa-tion in 1990. The 2000 edition includes allnew text and an updated design. Short, easy-to-read chapters tell the story of six state laws and how they came to be.The process is followed from the time an ideafor a new law comes up to the time a bill re-flecting that idea is passed by the Legislatureand signed into law. Capitol Steps was designed to be a resource for junior and senior high schoolstudents, but it would be of interest toanyone who wants to gain an understand-ing of the basics of how the Legislature works.

The bill (HF3414), sponsored by Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin), would increase finestenfold for violations of existing child laborlaws. Currently, fines range from $25 for employ- ing a minor without proof of age up to $500for employing a minor under age 18 who isinjured in hazardous employment. Under thebill, those fines would increase to $250 and$5,000. Jobs considered to be hazardous employ- ment include some construction work, work-ing with hazardous chemicals, and otheroccupations that are considered potentially lifethreatening. Beth Hartgarten, an attorney from the Min- nesota Department of Labor and Industry,said the increased fines would align the statecloser to federal fines. She said in an economyof low unemployment, violations of child la-bor laws are increasing. Hartgarten said that between July 1998 and June 1999, there were 36 complaints and threefines issued. The department issued 287 ex-emptions mostly for allowing individuals towork longer hours and denied 10 exemptionrequests primarily for hazardous employment. Between July 1999 and September 1999, there were 20 complaints and six fines. #ENVIRONMENT Beth Hartgarten of the Department of Labor andIndustry testifies Feb. 29 before the Jobs and Eco-nomic Development Policy Committee in supportof a bill that would increase penalties for child la-bor law violations.Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) cited a per- sonal experience as one of his reasons for op-posing the bill. Gunther said that the grocerystore he runs with his brother was fined aftertwo 15-year-olds \"who loved their work \" traded shifts with two 16-year-olds and endedup working past legal hours. \"I can guarantee you all we 're going to do is make sure employers never hire 15-year-oldsagain, \" he said. Leighton said that most people would agree that the state 's child labor laws are there for a good reason and the bill would not prevent15-year-olds from working reasonable jobs. \"They certainly can still work, \" he said. \"But if they have to work more than eight hours aday or 40 hours a week, there is somethingwrong in this state, in our society. \" The bill was sent to the House Jobs and Eco- nomic Development Finance Committee. River funds ranked high The House Environment and Natural Re- sources Finance Committee approved its listof bonding priorities Feb. 28. The list recommends spending $281 million on various projects, some of which are in Gov.Jesse V entura 's capital budget plan and others that have been proposed by House members.The governor recommended spending $125million on environment-related projects. The committee 's top priority is spending $60 million for the Conservation Reserve En-hancement Program (CREP), which wouldestablish conservation easements along theMinnesota River. The easements require land-owners to stop cultivating the land near theriver, so it can filter out soil and chemicals,help control flooding, and establish wildlifehabitat. The $60 million in state funds would be matched by $140 million in federal funds, butthat money is only available through Septem-ber 2002. The governor 's recommendation is to spend only $25 million for that program, whichwould be matched by about $58 million infederal funds. Also high on the priority list is $11.2 mil- lion for the Metropolitan Regional Parks Capi-tal Improvement Program, which would bematched by $18.1 million in federal and localfunds. The committee also gave high ranking to $3 million for the critical habitat matchingaccount, which is matched by privatedonations.A $6.5 million project would create a 5.1- acre public access area on Lake Minnetonka 's Grays Bay. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka)said the proposal is critical because it involvespurchasing property from a willing seller, anopportunity that is not going to last long con-sidering the high demand for lakeshoreproperty. The project would feature boat ramps, a dock with several boat slips and parking forcars and trailers. Some other projects the committee favored but are not included in the governor 's recom- mendations include $17.1 million for a ComoPark education resource center, $4.4 millionto improve wildlife management areas andfisheries, $4 million to acquire and develop arecreation area and campground near EastGrand Forks, and $13 million to control flood-ing in the Red River valley. The committee also favored spending $1 million to purchase an office building inPelican Rapids instead of building a new $5million building in Fergus Falls for the De-partment of Natural Resources, against thegovernor 's recommendations. The committee 's list of priorities now moves to the House Capital Investment Committee,where it will be considered for inclusion in theHouse bonding bill.Session Weekly 9#GAME & FISH #GOVERNMENTHunting on reservation A bill that would allow people to hunt on certain lands within the Red Lake Indian Res-ervation without a state hunting license wasapproved March 1 by the House Environmentand Natural Resources Finance Committee. The Red Lake Band of Chippewa owns about 85 percent of the land withinMinnesota 's Northwest Angle. The band has hunting licenses for its members and for otherarea residents, but there has been some con-fusion over whether those hunters also need astate license. The bill (HF304), sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would clarify thematter by making the Red Lake Band 's license sufficient, and it would specify that the bandhas jurisdiction to regulate hunting in thatarea. The Department of Natural Resources sup- ports the proposal. The bill now moves to the House floor. New plan for Public Service The Department of Public Service would be abolished with most of its functions trans-ferred to the Public Utilities Commission,under a bill the House Commerce Commit-tee approved Feb. 29. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF2496), which would undo thegovernor 's 1999 order to merge the Commerce and Public Service departments. \"If we do nothing, it stands as it is, \" said Davids, chair of the committee. \"My intent is that commerce should be commerce, and theother things should go somewhere else. \" Prior to Ventura 's reorganization, the Public Service Department consisted primarily of theEnergy Division, the Telecommunications Di-vision and the Weights and Measures Division. The Weights and Measures Division is re- sponsible for checking the accuracy of all com-mercial weighing and measuring equipment,including gas pumps and grocery scales. TheEnergy Division was given the mission of en-suring reliable and affordable energy suppliesare available in the state. The T elecommuni-cations Division was set up to represent resi-dential and business consumers in theregulatory process. Under Ventura 's action, the Energy Division and T elecommunications Division were thenshifted to the Department of Commerce, leav-ing the Weights and Measures Division by itself. Davids ' bill would send the Energy Division to the Office of Strategic and Long-RangePlanning. Linda Taylor, assistant commissioner of energy, told the committee the bill is not goodpolicy. Taylor said the Energy and Telecom-munications divisions should stay in the Com-merce Department, which has strongenforcement powers. Taylor said the enforcement powers would be lost if the Energy and T elecommunicationsdivisions were placed in the planning office. \"We would lose our effectiveness, \" Taylor said. \"We'd have monopolies out there doing what they want. That is not good publicpolicy. \"Increasing Capitol security The Capitol complex would have its own separate police force under a bill sponsoredby Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove). Stanek told the House Crime Prevention Committee on Feb. 29 that the Capitol secu-rity forces would add four additional licensedstate troopers to the current staff of threetroopers and 48 unlicensed security officersunder the measure. He said it is not his intention to displace the current security team. Capitol Security Lt. Alesia Metry looks on as the House Crime Prevention Committee passes a billFeb. 29 that would create a new Capitol police department.\"I'm not trying to match what we have right now, I 'm trying to augment what we have, \" Stanek said. The committee approved the bill (HF3376) and sent it to House Transportation FinanceCommittee. The bill also would provide four additional state troopers to guard Gov. Jesse Ventura,bringing the total troopers assigned to thegovernor to 15. A Capitol complex oversight committee, consisting of legislators from both houses andthe chief justice of the Supreme Court, wouldbe formed under the bill. The committeewould set guidelines, develop short- and long-term plans and make budget recommends tothe Legislature. A report released in January recommended the Capitol close some of the building 's 37 entrances and install metal detectors at theremaining open doors. The report also calledfor a card-access system. Stanek 's proposal does not feature any of those security measures. He said the oversightcommittee could make such specific recom-mendations in the future. Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) questioned whether a full-time police force is needed.Mullery noted that crowds gather at the Capi-tol during the legislative session, but there isless of a need during the interim. Mancel Mitchell, deputy commissioner of the Public Safety Department, said he prefersthat a Capitol force be comprised of statetroopers. The state spends about $100,000annually per trooper, including salary, vehicle,and other expenses, Mitchell said. Stanek said the Capitol has been left with only a few law enforcement officials in the pastwhen the governor has left the complex, taking state troopers with him. Stanek addedthat the bill does not require that Capitol lawenforcement be state troopers. In addition, only sworn troopers have the power to make arrests and that power extendsstatewide. Stanek also noted that the law enforcement agency would answer to the oversight com-mittee rather than the governor. The licensed Capitol police would have dis- tinct blue uniforms, while the non-licensedstaff would be in a different color, Stanek said.10 March 3, 2000Taylor recommended the committee set aside the bill and require the Legislative AuditCommission to study the situation. Davidsrejected the notion, saying a study should notbe performed during the second year of abiennium. Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina) proposed an amendment that would reverse the governor 's changes, and restore both departments to theiroriginal makeup before the merger. The com-mittee rejected the amendment. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) offered an amendment that would place all Weights andMeasures functions in the Department ofAgriculture except the functions related to pe-troleum. That amendment was adopted. The bill now goes to the House Governmen- tal Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee. Naming new state symbols Minnesota may be known as the \"Gopher State, \" but it actually doesn 't have an official state mammal. The timber wolf would have that distinc- tion under a bill (HF3508) that was approvedFeb. 25 by the House Governmental Opera-tions and V eterans Affairs Policy Committee.The committee alsoapproved a bill todesignate the mon-arch as the statebutterfly. The idea to desig- nate the timber wolfas the The 13 schools that returned the sur-veys overwhelmingly voted for the timber wolfto be the official state mammal. Hanna Nussbaum, a fourth grade student at OH Anderson Elementary School in Mahtomedi, asks law-makers to name the monarch as Minnesota's state butterfly. The girl testified Feb. 25 before the HouseGovernmental Operations and Veterans Affairs Policy Committee. Both boys were aware of the controversy surrounding wolves in the state. Lawmakersand other state officials are trying to developpolicies for controlling the wolf population,while balancing the interests of animal-rightsgroups with landowners who have lost live-stock due to wolf attacks. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) asked if the state-symbol designation would grant spe-cial protection to wolves. But Hemmingson said such treatment is not given to other state symbols. \"The walleye is the state fish, and you can go around catching them, \" he said. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City). The monarch butterfly would become a state symbol under a separate bill (HF2588)sponsored by Rep. Harry Mares (R-White BearLake). That idea came from fourth graders atOH Anderson Elementary School inMahtomedi. The monarch is found throughout the state, and like many Minnesotans, it migrates southfor the winter and returns in the spring. Both bills now move to the House floor. #HEALTHGovernmental Operations & Veterans Affairs Policy Chair: Rhodes (R-St. Vice Chair: Rostberg 23 (12 R, 10 DFL, 1 Ind.)

Sponsored by Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R- Faribault), the bill (HF178) would require thatany patient scheduled to undergo an abortion receive specified information either by tele-phone or by mail at least 24 hours prior to theoperation. It would also establish civil penalties for clinics failing to comply with informed con-sent requirements. The information provided to the patient would include the name of the doctor per-forming the procedure and other details. \"The purpose of this bill is to make sure that a woman is adequately informed about what willhappen during an abortion procedure, and is notmeant as an obstacle for a woman who choosesto have an abortion, \" Boudreau said. The bill would also require a referring phy- sician at the clinic where the operation will beperformed to tell the patient about informa-tion regarding alternatives to abortion and therisks and possible side effects associated withthe procedure. Information provided to the patient would also include facts about medical risks and otherfactors involved with carrying the child to term. \"Sometimes when a woman is in a crisis- type of a situation, she can feel pushed to makea tough decision without having all the infor-mation she 'd like available to her, \" said Boudreau. \"This bill would put, at her fingers, answers to both procedural and other typesof questions regarding abortion. \" The woman would then have to provide written consent at least 24 hours before theabortion showing that she has received therequired information. The financial impact of the bill was the fo- cus of the hearing before the Health and Hu-man Services Finance Committee.Session Weekly 11The bill would appropriate $167,000 to the commissioner of health in fiscal year 2001 toamass the information mentioned. The bulkof the expense, Boudreau said, would coverthe cost of producing numerous lists of spe-cific community resources and the process ofupdating old information. The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee for further consideration. #HIGHER EDUCATION #HOUSING#HUMAN SERVICES New art facility supported Some noteworthy projects shunned by the governor received high rankings from theHouse Higher Education Finance Committee. Chief among them is the proposal for a new facility to replace the troubled Art Buildingon the Minneapolis campus of the Universityof Minnesota. The U of M wants to tear down the existing Art Building and replace it with a new struc-ture considered the centerpiece of the \"arts quarter \" being developed on the West Bank. The new building would cost $44 million, butonly $21 million would come from the state. Gov. Jesse Ventura 's bonding proposal would fund three of the university 's top four bonding priorities. He left out the Art Build-ing, which the university ranked third. The Higher Education Finance Committee also ranked replacement of the Art Buildingthird among 10 proposed U of M projects. The committee voted March 1 to send a list of bonding priorities to the House CapitalInvestment Committee, which will compilethis year 's omnibus bonding bill. The bill assembled by the higher education panel does not include spending figures forall of the projects. It merely sets forth the pri-orities of the committee. In most cases, theCapital Investment Committee will rely on thedollar amounts requested by the campusesand the governor 's proposals. The Higher Education Finance Committee 's priorities closely reflect those of the U of Mand the Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU) system, but there are somesignificant differences. Sixth among the committee 's priorities for MnSCU is the $9.9 million plan to constructand remodel athletic facilities and academicspace at Minnesota State University, Mankato. The work, considered the second phase of a three-phase plan, would be part of a largerproject spurred by Mankato businessman andMinnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor 's $9.2 million gift to the university. The Mankato project was ranked just 17th by MnSCU, which listed 24 capital projects inits request. V entura recommended no funds for the Mankato proposal. The committee 's top priority for both the U of M and MnSCU is bond funding forbuilding maintenance and repair. The U of Mis seeking $16 million for such work, whileMnSCU wants $100 million for structures atits 36 institutions. Under the committee 's plan, funds would be provided to make needed improvements atAnoka-Hennepin T echnical College, which thesystem 's Board of Trustees voted to close rather than repair. The higher education bonding plan, a com- mittee bill yet to be assigned a house file num-ber, was referred to the House CapitalInvestment Committee. Homelessness prevention funds Angela Soulvar, a mother of three, found herself without a home after her abusive hus-band forced her out of their house. Soulvar told the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee Feb. 28 thather own family situation had been difficult.Her mother was an alcoholic and both herparents were abusive, she said. She testified that she was 18 years old when she met her husband, and because of his abuseshe tried to leave him four times in six years. \"He made me feel bad about who I was and what I was doing, \" she said. \"When my boys started getting mean, I knew I had to end it. \" Soulvar said that her experience with the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency 's Family Homeless Prevention and Assistance Programhelped her get her life back on track. \"I got lots of emotional support and the fi- nancial support was very helpful, \" she said. A bill (HF2679) sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) would provide an addi-tional $2 million in fiscal year 2001 to thehousing development fund for the homelessassistance program. The committee heard thebill and may consider it for inclusion in a pos-sible omnibus funding measure. The program provides grants to counties to assist families and individuals who are home-less or at imminent risk of becominghomeless. Since her experience with the program, Soulvar received a degree from Anoka-Hennepin T echnical College and works for aninsurance company. \"The only assistance I get is child care, \" she said. Preventing people from becoming home-less \u2014 rather than intervening after they do \u2014 is a more effective way to deal with the problem, said Michael Dahl from the Minne-sota Coalition for the Homeless. \"It is more humane, more cost effective, and better for the state in the long run, \" he said. Dahl said much of the program 's effective- ness is that it allows decisions to be made atthe regional level to best decide where thegrants should be used. Newborn drop-off program Six days after the January kickoff of a Dakota County pilot program for unwantednewborns, a baby only a few hours old wasfound dead inside a trash can in neighboringHennepin County. Lilly Riordan, co-founder of Dakota County 's Safe Place for Newborns initiative, appeared before the House Health andHuman Services Policy Committee on Feb. 29to ask that more be done to keep extreme casesof neglect from occurring, regardless of whatpart of the state they happen. \"There is great urgency associated with our cause, \" Riordan said. \"When a newborn child is left alone to die, it 's truly a situation where everyone loses. \" Riordan testified for a bill (HF2945) that Laura Plummer Zrust, human services licensingsupervisor from the Department of Human Ser-vices, speaks Feb. 29 before the House Health andHuman Services Committee in support of a billthat would allow a mother to leave her unharmednewborn baby at a hospital emergency roomwhile remaining anonymous and immune frombeing reported to social services or police. 12 March 3, 2000would allow a mother (or a person of her con- sent) to leave an unharmed newborn at a hos-pital emergency room without fear ofprosecution up to 72 hours following thechild 's birth. The committee approved the measure. It now moves to the House Civil LawCommittee. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) is sponsor- ing the bill, which would also provide ano-nymity by allowing the person bringing thechild to the hospital to leave without provid-ing identification. Under current Minnesota law, a mother who willfully neglects a newborn when she isreasonably able to care for the infant can becharged with a gross misdemeanor. Allowing a child to be left with a hospital would provide desperate mothers anotheroption and could save lives, Sykora told thecommittee. \"I think this bill makes sense, \" she said. As the bill reads, the hospital would be re- quired to accept the child, if it has no visibleinjuries or sickness, and to notify a local wel-fare agency following the mother 's departure from the premises. A numbered identification bracelet would be issued to aid in linking the mother to thenewborn at a later date if reunification wassought. However, according to the bill 's language, the newborn would technically be considered\"abandoned, \" and the bracelet would not al- low custody of the child on demand. Officials do not know how many babies hospitals could realistically expect to bedropped off if the bill becomes law. #INSURANCEPat Boldt of ABC Auto Glass in Cold Spring followsalong as the House Commerce Committee debatesa bill Feb. 29 that would place new regulations onauto glass companies. Boldt is opposed to the bill. Limiting windshield freebies Customers may no longer receive free steaks, frequent flier miles, or savings bondswhen they get a new auto windshield, under abill endorsed by a House panel. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) is sponsoring the bill (HF2656), which would cap free giftsfrom glass replacement companies at $35 invalue. The bill also would change current lawfrom requiring insurers to pay \"all reasonable costs \" in windshield replacement to an \"aver- age cost \" of repair. \"People understand windshield costs are too high, \" Wolf said. The House Commerce Committee ap- proved the bill Feb. 29 and sent it to the Housefloor. Wolf said he will ask that a vote on thebill be slightly delayed, pending more negoti- ating between glass installers and insurancecompanies. Jim Bernstein, acting commissioner of the Department of Commerce, said the legisla-tion is needed to stem the increase of glassreplacement costs. Consumers are awarethat glass shop giveaways are a problem,Bernstein said. \"They are unhappy because they feel the insurance rates are going up and they are get-ting ripped off, \" Bernstein said. In January, the state Court of Appeals ruled that free gifts are legitimate sales tools for glassservice companies because the law says that\"any cost necessary \" must be paid by insurers. Windshield replacement costs in Minnesota are 69 percent higher than the national aver-age and are the highest overall, according toan insurance company 's report released in December. Under Wolf 's legislation, insurance compa- nies would contact three glass replacementcompanies in the county where the replace-ment is occurring. The insurance companywould then be required to pay the average costof the three estimates. George Corporaal, owner of Glass Service Company in St. Paul, spoke against the bill.Corporaal began giving away a box of steakswith each job to draw customers to his busi-ness in 1991. Corporaal said insurance com-panies should not have final say in whichglass companies are called for estimates. Also, glass costs vary because of the quality of glass installed, Corporaal said. An insurancecompany could recommend low-quality glassthat is less expensive, he noted. \"This bill is chaotic, \" Corporaal said. \"It will cause nothing but trouble. \"#TAXES Permanent tax cut proposal A bill that would provide more than $818 million in permanent tax cuts was pitchedMarch 2 to the House Taxes Committee. The bill (HF2941), sponsored by Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee), would reducerates in all three income brackets and wouldallow individuals to subtract health insurancepremiums from Minnesota taxable income. The committee took no action on the mea- sure but will consider it for inclusion in thisyear's omnibus tax package. Daggett 's bill would reduce rates in the lower bracket from 5.5 percent to 5 percent,from 7.25 percent to 6.5 percent in the middlebracket, and from 8 percent to 7.5 percent inthe upper bracket. She said the current health insurance deduc- tion allowed for self-employed Minnesotanswould be expanded to include all taxpayers. The committee adopted an amendment of- fered by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka),committee chair, that would phase-out by2002 the three-factor system for determiningcorporate income taxes. Under present law most corporations are taxed according to a three-factor formulabased on sales, property, and payroll. Theamendment would increase the sales portionof the formula currently at 75 percent to 80percent for this year, to 90 percent in 2001,and to 100 percent beginning in 2002. Gerry Morris, the senior manager of the Gen- eral Mills tax department, said that because thecompany employs Minnesota workers and hasa facility in the state, the company pays more inMinnesota corporate franchise tax on similarsales than competitors based out of state. Duane Benson, the executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, said allow-ing the state 's taxpayers to keep more of their money ultimately makes the state more com-petitive in the global marketplace. Wayne Cox, the executive director of Min- nesota Citizens for Tax Justice, spoke againstthe bill. Cox said under the proposal, 60 per-cent of the state 's taxpayers would receive less tax cut dollars than taxpayers in the top1 percent in income.

Department of Finance Commissioner Pam Wheelock appeared before the House TaxesCommittee on Feb. 24 to answer questionssurrounding the decision not to increase thehealth care provider tax. The tax was to rise to cover a structural defi- cit in the health care access fund, which pro-vides revenue for MinnesotaCare, the state 's health plan for low-income residents. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the committee chair has been critical of theadministration 's decision, which he said did not follow the letter of the law. State law provides for an increase in health- care taxes paid by health care providers whenthere is a structural deficit in the health careaccess fund. Wheelock decided not to do so at the be- ginning of the current calendar year, when anincrease was expected. There is still money inthe health care access fund, but the fund isstructured such that if revenue doesn 't accrue from certain sources at specific time, addi-tional provider-based taxes are mandated. The 1999 Legislature approved a roughly $84 million transfer from the general fund intothe health care access fund. The goal of thatmove was to freeze the provider tax, oftencalled the \"sick tax. \" But Gov. Jesse V entura line-item vetoed that transfer. \"The governor wanted to take credit for the $80 million veto, but didn 't want to take re- sponsibility for what the statute clearly re-quired, \" Abrams said. Wheelock said the governor vetoed the ap- propriation because he did not think it wasappropriate to use general fund money for thehealth care access fund. And she said the ad-ministration was surprised by the Legislature 's general fund appropriation. But Wheelock also expressed understand- ing that her decision not to increase the taxmay have been equally surprising tolawmakers. \"The law directs the commissioner of fi- nance to make the decision. The responsibil-ity was left with me and I made the decision, \" Wheelock said. \"I understand that the deci- sion I made was contrary to what the Legisla-ture was expecting. \" She said that the administration has learned that it needs to improve some of its efforts tocommunicate with the Legislature. Abrams said that although he has been \"ex- traordinarily frustrated \" by communication breakdowns with the administration, inputSimplifying the sales tax Though they pay them nearly every day, most Minnesotans have probably never takenthe time to actually read the state 's many sales tax laws. And even if they did, they probably wouldn 't understand them. In 1997, the Legislature passed a provision, as part of the omnibus tax bill, to reorganizethe statutes pertaining to sales taxes so theywould be easier to understand. More than two years in the making, the fin- ished product is contained in a bill (HF3234),sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams(R-Minnetonka). The bill was discussedFeb. 25 in the House Taxes Committee, whichAbrams chairs. The bill reflects the efforts of the Office of the Revisor of Statutes, along with researchstaff from the House and Senate and theDepartment of Revenue. \"This hopefully will improve the readabil- ity of the statutes, \" Janet Rahm, from the FAMILY FARMERS#TRANSPORTATIONrevisor 's office, told the committee. She said the intent of the bill is not to rewrite or re-structure any substantive provisions. \"It uses simpler words and removes redun- dant language so that people can read the stat-utes, \" she said. Much of the bill is devoted to clarifying defi- nitions of terms used, and moving togetherthe many definitions scattered throughout thestatutes pertaining to sales taxes. The bill also would divide groups of sales tax exempt items together in an effort to al-low users to more easily find the provisionsthat might apply to them. According to the nonpartisan House Re- search Department, the many items exemptedfrom sales tax include some odd things. For example, there currently is a provision that allows some flatware and silverware to beconsidered clothing but not exempt from salestax. Under the proposed revision, that provision would be removed altogether. Abrams praised the efforts to make the stat- utes more clear and to keep the process openfor input and yet avoid any substantivechanges. He said the bill will be considered forinclusion in the omnibus tax bill but also maybe considered as a separate bill. Study of ramp meters Highway ramp meters would be shut down to allow for an independent study of their ef-fectiveness, under a bill sponsored by Rep.T om Workman (R-Chanhassen.) The House Transportation Policy Commit- tee approved the bill (HF3753) March 2 andsent it to the House Transportation FinanceCommittee. Workman said Minnesotans are frustrated by the long waits at entrance ramps and that astudy is needed to show the effectiveness ofthe meters. Officials have not yet determined how much the study would cost. The meter system is used to alleviate bottle- necks on the interstate, said Tim Wirke, di-rector of government relations for theDepartment of Transportation. The averagewait time is 4 to 6 minutes. T om Trecker, Minnesota chapter coordina- tor for the National Motorists Association,told the committee it should examine thesystem 's effectiveness. \"Twin Cities motorists have the most ag- gressive meter system and longest wait timein the nation, \" Trecker said. \"And the system has never been tested. \" Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) Judy and Ernest Anderson of Benson carry theirsigns to the \"March First\" rally in the Capitolrotunda March 1 in support of family farmers. from the governor and his staff is importantin the process. \"I like Jesse V entura. I respect him. I admire him and I want to work with him, \" Abrams said. \"I want to work with you for the better- ment of all Minnesotans. \"14 March 3, 2000disagreed. The Transportation Department gathers a large amount of data and conductsresearch before installing a light system tomake sure it works, Johnson said. Workman said his views on effectiveness might differ from the department 's opinion. \"It's not that we don 't believe them, \" Work- man said. \"It's that we have a different theory about the truth. \" Trecker said other states use ramp meters, but only to enter the freeway system. Minnesota,however, has meters on connecting freeways. \"Once the vehicle is on the freeway, it makes no sense to stop between freeways, \" Trecker said. Entrance ramps are too short to allow ve- hicles to accelerate and join traffic at the ap-propriate speed, Trecker said. Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters) offered a successful amendment that would require thestudy to be performed by a private consultingfirm instead of the department. An amendment from Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Cottage Grove) changed the time of theproposed study from October 2000 to a timedetermined by the consulting firm. \"I believe the department may well be right about the value of ramp meters, \" said Rep. Henry T odd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth). \"But I also see the value of a study. \" Slower traffic keep right Slower traffic on Minnesota interstates would be required to travel only in the right-hand lane, under a bill advancing in the House.

Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the bill 's sponsor, said his proposal would increase theMetropolitan Council 's bonding authority in the current biennium from $36 million to$52 million for transit expenditures. During last session, the Met Council asked for $52 million but the Legislature authorized$36 million. Abrams said the bill would allowthe council to sell bonds for the balance of thefunds. The bus system also receives federalmatching dollars. Abrams said the bill would have a slight property tax impact \u2014 an average increase of $1.20 on an $120,000 home. Art Leahy, general manager of Metro Tran- sit, said that the additional money is neededfor basic transit needs such as repairing andreplacing buses and bus facilities. The committee approved an amendment offered by Abrams that increased the bond-ing authority amount from $52 million to$55.4 million. The additional $3.4 millionwould be used specifically on the Eagan andBurnsville Transit Hubs and the SouthwestStation. The Met Council is the regional planning organization for the Twin Cities area. It oper-ates the metropolitan bus system, collects andtreats wastewater and manages water re-sources, guides development, plans regionalparks, and administers funds for affordablehousing. Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake) asked Abrams if the funds could be used for modesof transit other than buses. Abrams said thatthe bill specifically prohibits the use of thefunds for construction maintenance or opera-tion of light-rail transit. \"This is a Met Council initiative, \" Abrams said. \"It has nothing to do with light-rail tran- sit. These are bus funds. \" The bill (HF3530) was sent to the House Taxes Committee.

He said many drivers become angry when they arestuck behind vehicles, traveling side by side,and traveling at the same speed. The committee approved the measure and sent it to the Transportation Finance Com-mittee. Tomassoni said many European countries have similar laws. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) spoke against the bill, saying people wouldonly drive faster. \"I think this is a way to encourage speed- ing,\" Johnson said. \"We're now encouraging higher speed limits. \" Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Cottage Grove) also opposed the bill, arguing it would be im-possible to regulate in the Twin Cities metro-politan area. However, Rep. Henry Todd VanDellen (R-Plymouth) said he believes law en-forcement would use common sense andwould not enforce the measure during rushhour. The bill would require that signs be placed every 50 miles along interstate highways toremind drivers to move to the right lane afterthey have passed a car.

Along with officials from the Department of Revenue, Taff studied the effectiveness oflast year 's agricultural assistance program. The program allowed farmers to receive assistanceof $4 per cropland acre. The maximum pay-ment was $5,600. According to the study, the state paid out a total of $72.1 million to about 49,000 indi-viduals and businesses involved in agriculture.The average payment was $1,473. Nearly 25 percent of the checks exceeded $2,000 each. Close to 90 percent of the pay-ments went to people with annual incomes of$50,000 or less. While the majority of Minnesota farms re- main by most definitions small, Taff said thereis a growing need to increase the size of farmsto remain profitable. He said most family farms in the state now rely on off-farm income to supplement theirfarm revenues, and they would fail withoutgovernment assistance. On average Minnesota farms received $45,000 in various payments from the stateand federal government. \"Government has put farmers in the black, \" Taff said. He said the current Minnesota agricultural economy is no better than a year ago and littleFarm aid Lawmakers are considering proposals thatwould provide aid to farmers has improved in the last 20 years. He also saidthat traditionally the condition of the state 's agricultural economy is measured solely bycommodity prices, which is not always themost accurate measurement to use. Rep. T ed Winter (DFL-Fulda) said that while commodity prices are not the onlyindicator of a difficult farm economy, they area good example of what is wrong. Winter saidfarmers would much prefer fairer prices fortheir commodities rather than continue to relyon government subsidies. \"We need to figure out something. The do- mestic value of commodities is too low, \" Winter said.Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the Taxes Committee chair, agreed with thosesentiments. \"The farmers I know would much rather get $4 per bushel rather than $1.40 per bushelalong with a government check, \" he said. Abrams said that efforts last year to target the $70 million assistance to those who neededit most failed because, despite efforts from allinvolved, there was no fair way to develop anadequate \"means \" test. A current bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) would be a repeat of lastyear's plan, but it would limit eligibility to farmers in counties that have been declaredby the president as weather-related disasterareas. Those counties include Kittson,Marshall, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, andRoseau. The committee will consider the bill (HF2743) as part of this year 's omnibus tax measure. Ron Anderson, a Hallock farmer, said that last year 's program was helpful in paying off bills. He said he used his check to pay fuel billswithout having to draw on his line of credit. The committee is also considering bills for inclusion in the omnibus tax bill that wouldexpand the number of people receiving assis-tance from last year 's program. HF2786, sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL- Granite Falls), would allow farms with multipleoperators to receive up to $5,600 per farmer. The$5,600 cap approved last year was per farm re-gardless of the number of operators. Russ Bratsch, who operates a farm in Renville County with his three brothers and father, saidhis family was penalized because members reg-istered their operation as one farm. He said whenit comes to filing taxes or filling out other legaldocuments, each member of the family is re-quired to do so individually. Another bill (HF3166), sponsored by Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), would ex-tend the filing deadline for last year 's agricul- tural tax rebate until June 30, 2000. \"Many of those who contacted us about missing the deadline have circumstanceswhere the need is some the greatest, \" Ozment said. \"Those with a death in the family, illness, or are working several jobs. Not to cloud theissue because there is definitely the need outthere. \" Russ Bratsch, who farms 2,600 acres near Renville with his family, reads a statement in support of abill that would provide tax relief to those who joinforces to run one farm operation. His testimonycame Feb. 29 before the House Taxes Committee.16 March 3, 2000AT ISSUE: EDUCATION # # # BY MIKE DELARCO While the Senate wrestles with a House vote last month to place an indefinite moratoriumon the maligned Profile of Learning, severalHouse members from both parties have de-vised plans to repair the state 's show-what- you-know initiative. T en bills designed to revamp, and, in some cases, replace the controversial portion of thestate 's Graduation Standards were presented, discussed, and considered by the House Edu-cation Policy Committee Feb. 24 and Feb. 29. The committee will likely incorporate some of the desired changes into one bill. So far, themost likely vehicle seems to be a measuresponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel). Ness ' bill (HF3618) would significantly re- duce the number of content standards stu-dents in grades K-12 would be required tomeet under the Profile. The idea behind the Profile of Learning was hatched 12 years ago in response to criticismthat schools weren 't doing enough to prepare students for college and the workplace. Theaim in creating the Profile was to shift learn-ing away from textbooks, lectures, and drilland move it toward experiments, teamwork,research, and independent projects. Under the Profile, students are required to perform various tasks in many areas of study.An emphasis is placed on getting students outof their seats to do activities that force themReviewing the Profile House committee examines several measures to make theProfile of Learning more acceptable to teachers and students to think for themselves and have practical ap-plications for life beyond school. Shortly after the state 's teachers started in- corporating requirements of the Profile intolesson plans two years ago, however, com-plaints began to surface. While pleased with the hands-on knowledge the Profile provides students, a growing num-ber of teachers felt there was much to be im-proved before they could completely standbehind the measure. A survey released a month ago by Educa- tion Minnesota found that most teachers don 't care for the Profile of Learning. Slightly morethan half of the 608 randomly selected teach-ers surveyed by telephone last fall want tochange the state 's controversial graduation rule, 39 percent want it abolished, and only 9percent want to keep it as it is. The results of the survey show that teacher response has changed very little since theProfile 's implementation. In early February, Minnesota 's teachers union and state Department of Children,Families and Learning Commissioner Chris-tine Jax both called for a temporary morato-rium \u2014 likely two years \u2014 on enforcing the requirements of the Profile of Learning. But some want more. Cheryl Moen, a teacher at La Crescent High School, told committeemembers Feb. 29 she supports the indefinitemoratorium on the Profile until \"all the bugscould be worked out. \" In her district, Moen said, some students are opting to enroll in the post-secondary enrollment options program, whichallows them to take college courses, simply toavoid the hassle the Profile is causing. Education Minnesota co-presidents Judy Schaubach and Sandra Peterson have cautionedlegislators that teacher frustration with the setof standards had reached a boiling point. TheProfile, they said, could \"collapse under its own weight \" if changes are not made this year. On Feb. 17, House members attached the amendment calling for an indefinite morato-rium on the Profile of Learning to a bill relatedto basic standards testing. The bill was passedby a wide margin. (The Senate is not expectedto go along with the House amendment.) Brett Smith, an instructor in the Mahtomedi School District and Minnesota 's 1999 T eacher of the Y ear, pushed for change at the Feb. 29hearing, but advised legislators to take thingsgradually. \"Sometimes if we continually evaluate a process as it 's still evolving, such as tasting a souffl \u00e9 several times before pulling it out of the oven, our conclusion can be premature, \" Smith said. Perhaps the most repeated complaint teach- ers express when discussing the Profile ofLearning is that the amount of work requiredto have students complete all the standards istoo taxing on a school-year workload. Ness ' bill aims to establish a timeline that is grade-level appropriate for school districts toimplement six separate learning areas andwould require that students graduating in the2005-06 school year and beyond to complyfully with the Profile of Learning requirementsin order to graduate. Many teachers are also concerned about the amount of paperwork now required to trackstudents ' progress in completing the standard package. Richfield School District Superintendent Bar- bara Devlin pushed for a uniform system for stu-dent record keeping in testimony before thecommittee. According to Jax, state officials arealready trying to address that particular concernby providing computer software that can helpinstructors track progress. Other plans proposed make exceptions to the Profile for charter schools, impose either a two-year moratorium or indefinite moratorium socertain conditions can be met, and otherwiseaddress workload and paperwork issues. Four education professionals air their ideas about what to do with the Profile of Learning. Each testifiedFeb. 29 before the House Education Policy Committee. They are, from left to right , Barbara Devlin, super- intendent Richfield Public Schools, who asked to retain the Profile but make improvements, Cheryl Moen,a teacher from LeCresent, who suggested a moratorium on the Profile, Herbert Parker, former teacherfrom Anoka, who also backed a moratorium, and Mahtomedi's Brett Smith, Minnesota Teacher of theYear, who suggested improvements be made in the Profile.Session Weekly 17BY CHRIS VETTER License tab fees would be cut, motor vehicle sales tax revenue would be redirected, and anew multi-modal transportation fund wouldbe created, under plans supported by Gov.Jesse Ventura. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) is sponsor- ing two bills that contain the governor 's main initiatives. One bill (HF2891) features Ventura 's request to remove motor vehicle sales tax proceeds fromthe state 's general fund, sending 54 percent to the Highway User Tax Distribution Fund. The revenue transfer would cover the cost of capping license tab fees at $75 per vehicle\u2014 a proposal sought by Ventura. The remaining 46 percent of vehicle sales tax revenue would be used to create newmulti-modal transportation fund that wouldgo for public transit and highway projectsstatewide. The House Transportation Finance and Transportation Policy committees met jointlyMarch 1 to discuss the measures. The finance committee then voted to send a second Molnau bill (HF2005), containingthe $75 license tab cap, to the House T axesCommittee without a recommendation. Noaction was taken on the first bill. Last year, the state collected about $450 million in license tab fees. About 39 percentof Minnesotans pay the $35 minimum fee, butsome people pay more than $400 for tabs. Elwyn Tinklenberg, commissioner of trans- portation, explained that the governor believesit is wrong to charge more for one vehicle tabthan another vehicle just because one is neweror more expensive. Tinklenberg compared theproposed tab rate to the flat fees for fishing orhunting licenses, which cost the same regardlessof the type of equipment an outdoorsman uses. Rep. James Clark (R-Springfield) suggested the governor should truly create a flat fee,rather than having tabs fees set between $35and $75. The revenue goes into the Highway User Tax Distribution Fund, which means the proposedTab fees and tax shifts Governor's plans would cut tab fees for someand direct tax revenues for highways and mass transit $75 cap would create a hole in that fund, whichis used for county and municipal state-aidhighways. Under current law, all sales tax revenue from vehicle sales goes into the general fund, whereit pays for anything from schools to prisons.Ventura 's proposal would use some of the money to off-set his reduction in tab fees. The governor 's plan also calls for citizens to vote on an amendment this fall that wouldconstitutionally dedicate the 54 percent ofvehicle sales tax \u2014 about $291 million in 2002 \u2014 for the license tab reduction. HF2891 would make that dedication in statute, but theamendment would make it much more diffi-cult to reverse. The proposal to move vehicle sales tax to the highway fund is not new, said Fred Corrigan,executive vice president for the Minnesota Trans-portation Alliance. In fact, the Legislature passeda law in 1981 that sent 75 percent of revenue forhighways, with the remaining 25 percent usedfor transit systems, Corrigan said. The Legislature later repealed the lawbecause of budget constraints, Corrigan said. However, if the law had stayed in place, Min-nesotans would have generated about $2.96billion for highways and $988 million for tran-sit from 1990 to 2000, according to Minne-sota Transportation Alliance estimates. Tinklenberg told the committees about the wide array of projects that could be constructedfrom the proposed multi-modal fund. He argued that the interstate freeways in the Twin Cities should have at least three lanes,no matter what traffic or roads are mergingtogether or separating. He noted that someareas, such as the spot north of St. Paul whereSnelling Avenue meets Interstate 694, haveonly one through lane, causing backups anddelays around that intersection. During the past year, Tinklenberg has trav- eled to several cities, such as St. Louis andDenver, to examine their transportation sys-tems. He said some states that didn 't address transportation funding are struggling to comeup with funding now. \"They are all beginning to see what the fail- ure to invest in infrastructure improvementshas meant to their states, \" Tinklenberg said. Nacho Diaz, Metropolitan Council trans- portation planning director, said the multi-modal fund could be used to constructpark-and-ride sites and bus-only transitwaysor to purchase more buses and garages. Thefund also could be used for rural road im-provements, right of way preservation, orcommuter rail. The committee heard other proposals to redirect the motor vehicle sales tax. Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) proposed a bill (HF446) that would send 30 percent ofthe vehicle sales tax to the Highway User TaxDistribution Fund, with the remainder stay-ing in the general fund. Kuisle 's bill also calls for a constitutional amendment. The Trans-portation Finance Committee voted to sendKuisle 's bill without recommendation to the Taxes Committee. Another bill (HF3967) would modify the tab fee reductions differently than thegovernor 's plan. Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-For- est Lake) favors providing a 50 percent creditfor tab fees between $35 and $400.

AT ISSUE: TRANSPORTATION # # # Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenbergexplains the governor's plan to cut license tab feesand redirect revenue from the sales tax on motorvehicles.18 March 3, 2000HISTORY # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGERIn the midst of its heyday more than 75 years ago, iron mining in Minnesota suffered perhaps its greatest tragedy when theMilford Mine near Crosby flooded, killing 41 of the 48 men inside.An underground disaster Milford deaths prompted calls for lawmakers to aid miners In the maelstrom of innuendo, rumor, and public outrage at the time, Governor J.A.O.Preus appointed a commission of mining of-ficials to sort out the details. They determinedno one could have anticipated the accident,the mine owners were not at fault, and ben-efits were paid out to the families with unprec- edented speed, according to a January 1925report of the State Industrial Commission. However, the panel also called for a number of legislative reforms, including a suggestion thatdependent children should be paid workers ' compensation benefits at least until age 16. Atthe time, families of the miners killed would re-ceive weekly benefits for children up to a cap of$7,500 \u2014 only about 7 years of support. The proposed reforms also called for area mine inspectors to meet periodically with thetheir responsibilities. But a call to action doesn 't always receive a prompt response from the Legislature. Suchwas the case with the Milford mine disaster. \"The real cause of the disaster was the fact that imminence and danger from such a rushof mud was not recognized by anyone, \" the commission 's report said. The mine had recently been inspected, but the mine inspector found no obvious irregu-larities. The Milford Mine, owned by the Whitmarsh Mining Company, was located onthe Cuyuna Iron Range in the central part ofthe state. The youngest of the three activeranges at the time, the Cuyuna shipped its firstore in 1911. After the accident, the Milford Mine was shut down for nearly a year as the mine wasdrained and the bodies of victims wererecovered. Though business operations were slowed by the accident, payments to families were swift. According to the commission 's report, 24 widows and 63 dependent children were draw-ing compensation within 30 days of the acci-dent. Benefits ranged from $12.10 to $20 perweek. In addition, the paychecks of the 35 men who perished and left widows and childrenwere distributed to the families within 48hours of the accident. \"The dependents have all been assured of an independent livelihood at least until suchtime as older children of the families are ableto assist in their support, \" the commission concluded. A total of $300,000 was disbursed to fami- lies as a result of the accident, according tothe report. In total, nearly $1.8 million inworkers ' compensation benefits were paid during 1924. However, commission members feared that young children, especially newborn babies,would not be provided for down the road. \"When these (newborn) babies reach 8, they 'll still be dependents and benefits will cease, \" the report said. The Legislature, which has revised workers ' compensation laws several times since the1924 incident, has since made provision fordependents to receive payments until they areState Industrial Commission and with area miners to discuss safety. And the commission proposed that the Leg- islature appropriate $5,000 annually for safetyeducation and that county boards increase payfor mine inspectors to put it more in line with The February 1924 accident occurred when water and mud from nearby Foley Lake col-lapsed the earthen walls of the mine. Withinminutes, water had completely filled the mine,trapping nearly all of the miners inside. Immediately after the accident, public offi- cials tried to determine who was to blame andwhether anything could have been done toprevent the accident. They were also concerned that the families left behind would be able to survive on thecompensation benefits they received. Diagram taken from The Milford Mining Disaster: a Cuyuna Range Tragedy , written by Berger Aulie, published by W.A. Fisher Co., 1994.This diagram shows how the water from Foley Lake broke through sides of the Milford Mine and quickly filled its layers. In all, 41 men were killed in the mine collapse, the worst mining tragedy up to that time.

Indemnity and medical payments under Minnesota workers ' compensation equaled $732 million in 1998, according to the statedepartment of labor and industry. Those fig-ures do not include the special compensationfund or total system costs. As a result of the accident, mining officials began to examine the contemporary miningpractices. In the commission report, officialssaid mining in swampy land posed tremen-dous danger. They suggested that extra pre-cautions should be taken before miningoperations are conducted under any swamp.

A searchof law books for the sessions in the years im-mediately following the accident do not showany specific mining safety measures. In 1988, a law requiring that county boards pay for the safety expenses for mine inspec-tors went on the books. Safety standards are governed in large part by the federal government now. The Occupa-tional Safety and Health Act of 1970, whichcreated OSHA, requires various inspectionsfor the safety and welfare of both employeesand the public. In addition, a 1977 federal law creating the Mine Safety and Health Administration re-quires the individual mining companies toconduct safety training for new miners andprovide a refresher course for all other em- ployees each year. Minnesota industry leaders and mine in- spectors also conduct various kinds of publicinformation sessions about mines and minesafety whenever requested. T oday, only the Mesabi Range, which stretches through Itasca, St. Louis, and Lakecounties in northeastern Minnesota, has ac-tive iron ore mines. Both the V ermilion andCuyuna ranges were abandoned nearly 30years ago, and many of the old mines on thoseranges are state parks or recreation areastoday. The industry on the Iron Range is seeing some new growth. Last session, the Legisla-ture approved $20 million in funds for a steelmill project.

TAXES 5 State Office Building Chr. Rep. Ron AbramsAgenda: To be announced. When the 1999-2000 Humphrey Interna- tional Fellows repre- senting 15 countries spent a day at the Capi- tol, a revealing fact for some of them was how easy it is to gain access to state government. As they toured the Capitol, one of the fel- lows, Fernando Batistuzzo from Brazil remarked, \"Some of us cannot believe how open the state buildings are and how easy it is to talk to lawmakers. \" The visiting Brazilian scholar, Batistuzzo, and his internationalcolleagues from places such as Russia,Myanmar, Gaza, Eritrea, Peru, and Russiawere reminded that Minnesota continuesto be a true reflection of democracy. It is amodel government executed by the U.S.Constitution back in 1787. It is a government \"by the people and for the people, \" including the people 's right to assemble.Reflections On any given day when the Minnesota Legislature is in session, large numbers of groups and individuals fill the halls, mem- bers' offices, and conference rooms of the State Office Building and the Capitol. The Capitol serves as state government 's focal point and universal meeting place for the people of Minne- sota; therefore it 's natural for many people to come to the Capitol to demonstrate or to be heard. Likely, a reason for the major increase in numbers of people who visit is an awareness or education about their right to personally participate in the legislative process. In the first two months of this year alone, 10,400 people have taken tours through the Historical Society 's Capitol T our Program, no doubt thanks to courses of study for students and the likelihood they 'll see a high-profile governor. More and more people are participat- ing in state government, while others are making their cause known through their right to assemble. Since early January, groups like the 75 members of the Minnesota Firemen 's As- sociation, 100 representatives of the Min-nesota Farm Bureau, 700 members of AFSCME, 17 students from Valley Middle School in Apple Valley, and over 20 other special groups came to lobby. Others came to voice their concerns through demonstrations and protests. During February, 500 members of the Minnesota State College Students ' Associa- tion marched to the Capitol steps to pro- test tuition cuts, and support funds for building repairs. Also, some 1,300 people marched in support for the family farm. Last year, eight protesters chained them- selves to marble columns in the rotunda and to each other in opposition of the re- routing of Highway 55. Some demonstrations can be a cause for concern to Capitol Security, but most are peaceful. Such was the rally by 500 Eritreans for Worldwide Peace and one by 75 individuals that rallied as the Coalition for Battered Women and the Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Whether unruly or amicable, more and more Minnesotans are involved in lawmak- ing or having their voices heard through their right to assemble. Their presence is welcome. \u2014 L ECLAIR G.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), stalled March 9 in the House Judiciary Finance Committee, just days after having won ap-proval in the House Crime Prevention Committee.Should juvenile offendersface adult punishment? The future is uncertain for a bill that would require juvenilesaccused of certain violent crimes to be charged as adults Members of the Judiciary Finance Commit- tee expressed concern about the bill 's poten- tial fiscal impact, which is estimated to be$987,000 in fiscal year 2002 and $1.5 millionin fiscal year 2003. \"This is one of the bills that sound really good at first, \" said Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville). Holberg and other members of the Judiciary Finance Committee voted to table the bill, butthe measure is expected to resurface this ses-sion. The driving force behind the bill (HF2939) is concern among some legislators about atrend toward violence among teens, specifi-cally using firearms while committing crimes. Under Rhodes ' proposal, the teens would be treated as adults in state court if a firearm wasused in a violent crime. The crimes would in-clude offenses such as murder, manslaughter,and kidnapping. They would also includedrive-by shootings, aggravated robbery, arson,and harassment or stalking. \"The message is simple and straightfor- ward, \" said Bob Johnson, Anoka County at- torney, in March 3 testimony before the crimeprevention panel. \"It says if you are 16 or older, you will be tried as an adult. \" The bill is seen as a reaction to the prolif- eration of crimes committed by teens, Rhodessaid. Currently, a person must be 18 years oldto automatically be treated as an adult in court.\"We're sending a message that we won 't toler- ate this type of behavior, \" Rhodes said. \"Using a firearm at that age is not appropriate. \" Rhodes, who in the past has backed many school safety initiatives, said he was asked by at-torneys throughout the state to carry this bill. Johnson said county attorneys began dis- cussing the idea last year. \"What we 've been seeing, juveniles are be- coming increasingly sophisticated, increas-ingly violent, \" Johnson said. \"The things we 're seeing now we couldn 't have imagined seeing 20 or 30 years ago. \" In a recent case, a juvenile \u2014 16 years, 10 months old \u2014 fired a series of shots into a carwith several passengers, Johnson said. Amaz- ingly, no one was injured in the shooting. A judge placed the offender in Extended Juvenile Jurisdiction, rather than sending thecase to an adult court. But Johnson said thisoffender should be in an adult prison ratherthan a juvenile facility because of the danger-ous nature of the crime. Extended Juvenile Jurisdiction is a state pro- gram for teens who have committed seriouscrimes. They are placed in a center for juve-niles rather than being sent to prison. The pro-gram stresses teaching and rehabilitation.T eens can be placed in the program until theyare 21 years old. Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom spoke against the bill, saying it is vastly differ-ent from a proposal that county attorneysdrafted during the interim. Backstrom said hewould prefer that any decision to prosecute a16-year-old juvenile as an adult be left to theprosecuting attorney. Backstrom noted that county attorneys, too, are directly elected and they have a responsi-bility to the public to decide what is best forthe juvenile and the community. While Backstrom prefers the option of sending the case to adult court, the bill wouldautomatically send the teen-ager to adultcourt, regardless of circumstances in the caseor the juvenile 's prior history. As it is currently written, the bill would al- low no flexibility to prosecute teens accusedof these crimes in juvenile court. Susan Gaertner, Ramsey County attorney,4 March 10, 2000IT'SAFACT Gov. Floyd B. Olson is remembered for many things. Foremost among them, hewas the first member of the Farmer-La-bor Party elected governor and he was anenergetic leaderwho invigoratedDepression-eraMinnesota. A statue of Olson 's likeness stands on theCapitol grounds,but it 's far less fa- mous than an-other tiedforever to Olson. on theirshoulders a statuethat commemorates one of Olson 's acts \u2014 a 1935 wager involving a pig and the football rivalry between the University ofMinnesota and the University of Iowa. That 's right, sports fans, Floyd of Rosedale, the bronze trophy awarded tothe winner of the Minnesota-Iowa foot-ball game each fall, is named after the22nd governor of Minnesota. Sort of. Olson hailed from Minneapolis, not Rosedale or Roseville or anything of thesort. So how did that pig get his name? It all started in the fall of 1935. Fans in both Minnesota and Iowa were bracingthemselves for the annual gridiron con-test, and preparations were proving to bea little more tempestuous than normal. The year before, a halfback for Iowa named Ozzie Simmons had been roughedup in the contest. Fans were preparing forpotential payback in the 1935 game, whichtook place in Iowa City. Many thought Iowa Gov. Clyde L. Her- ring condoned unruly behavior when hewas quoted before the 1935 contest as say-ing, \"If the officials stand for any rough tactics like Minnesota used last year, I 'm sure the crowd won 't.\" Minnesota Attorney General H.H. Peterson wired Herring that his remarkswere unsportsmanlike and contrary to hisStill fighting for Floyd Gov. Olson's friendly wager started a tradition that continues today duties as governor. As tensions rose, offi-cials expected police protection would benecessary for the game. In light of this swirling controversy, Olson said pub-licly that hethought Herringhad againstone from Iowa onthe outcome ofthe game. The bet worked to diffuse thesituation. Her-ring accepted theoffer in good hu-mor, the game went off without a hitch, and subsequentcontests became friendly rivalries. And annual battles continue to be fought over a pig. Minnesota won the 1935 game 13-6. Herring delivered a pig to Olson at theState Capitol in St. Paul. The pig camefrom Rosedale Farms near Fort Dodge,Iowa, and the prize was named Floyd af-ter Olson. Thus the animal became \"Floyd of Rosedale. \" So what became of the living, breath- ing Floyd of Rosedale? According to thearchives at the University of Minnesota,he was sold shortly after the contest for$50 to J.B. Gjerdrum, a breeder who livedin Mabel, Minn., which is, appropriatelyenough, on the state 's border with Iowa. Gjerdrum had the pig about a year be- fore the animal met its death. Meanwhile, a bronze likeness of Floyd the pig was made for contests in 1936 andafter. And each year, the two teams stillbattle it out for possession of Floyd ofRosedale. The statue, which is 15-and-a-half inches high and 21 inches long, residestoday in a trophy case at the University ofMinnesota. The U of M beat Iowa last fall25-21. (M. K IBIGER ) Iowa Gov. Clyde Herring and Minnesota Gov. FloydOlson pose with the original Floyd of Rosedale,Olson's prize for winning a wager on the Minnesota-Iowa football game in 1935.said the bill is poor policy because it wouldnot allow judges and attorneys to make deci-sions they feel might be in the best interest ofthe children and families involved. The bill does not have the support of the Minnesota County Attorney Association,Gaertner said. \"We believe the flexibility should remain to keep them in juvenile jurisdiction, \" Gaertner said. \"It doesn 't take into account certain cir- cumstances. \" The attorneys who oppose the bill gave ex- amples about a variety of possible actions byteens that would send them to adult court. Take, for instance, a teen who has a gun in a public place while contemplating suicide, whowinds up having a standoff with police. Evenif the juvenile has no prior record, the childwould be treated as an adult under this bill. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) ques- tioned if attorneys would lose some of theirplea-bargaining power when these cases areautomatically sent to adult court. Prosecuting attorneys would not have to send juveniles to adult court if they did notwant to, argued Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls). Skoglund said county attorneys couldstill determine what charges are filed, andlesser charges could put the offenders in juve-nile court. And prosecutors would still havethe freedom to make sentencing recommen-dations to the judge. While county attorneys could intention- ally \"undercharge \" these juveniles before the court, Gaertner said, that would set a badprecedent. \"We have worked hard to not undercharge cases, and I don 't want to do that because of this bill, \" she said. Gaertner noted that all the crimes in the bill feature a minimum sentence of at leastthree years. Judges can depart from mini-mum sentences, Gaertner said, but they areoften criticized for such decisions. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) said legislators should not lose sight of the seri-ousness of these crimes. \"You may call them kids, \" Stanek said. \"But if they 're carrying a gun, they 'll prob- ably use it at some point. \" Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) suggested the Crime Prevention Committee changethe bill to make the use of a gun an auto-matic adult crime on the second offense, butthe proposal was rejected.

Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) wants to do something about videogames that teach children to be violent. Many games today teach children how to shoot and how to kill, she said in March 2 tes-timony before the House CommerceCommittee. McGuire is sponsoring a bill (HF3180) that would make it a misdemeanor for people tosell or rent restricted video games to childrenunder age 17. A restricted game would be agame that has an adults only (AO) or mature(M) rating according to the EntertainmentSoftware Rating Board. \"We regulate movies, cigarettes, and drink- ing,\" McGuire said. \"There are certain types of behavior that we think is bad for youths,and we regulate it. \" McGuire 's bill appears to have stalled for this year. The committee did not vote on themeasure and is not expected to take it up againthis year. McGuire said she hopes to have fur-ther discussions on the matter next year. The Senate version of the bill failed in com- mittee the same day. The House committee heard from Lt. Col.Staff troubles in day care Day care providers say they are struggling to retain staff and to pay decent wages. In re-sponse, several legislators are pushing bills tohelp these providers attract and keepemployees. The House Family and Early Childhood Education FinanceCommittee consid-ered several day carebills March 6. No ac-tion was super-vise children aportion formal trainingcannot monitorchildren without be-ing directly super-vised by a teacher. Under the bill, aides with 4,160hours of experiencewith children wouldbe allowed to di-rectly supervise 25 percent of a child 's day at the center. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) spoke in favor of the bill, saying aides with this level of Lt. Col. David Grossman, a military psychologistand author critical of media violence, speaks be-fore the House Commerce Committee on March 2in favor of a bill that would prohibit the sale of vio-lent video games to children under 17. The bill alsowould prohibit displaying those games in publicplaces.David Grossman, who wrote a book on videogame violence titled Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action Against TV , Movie andVideo Game Violence . Grossman wrote in his book that video games not only teach kids violence, they teachthem marksmanship. He contends thatMichael Carneal, a boy who fired shots on hisclassmates in Paducah, Ky., in 1997, learnedto shoot from playing video games. The bill would forbid store owners from show- ing, displaying, or exhibiting restricted games.McGuire said her bill focuses on stores and notgames available on the Internet because thosegames would be difficult to regulate.experience would likely be the kind of people parents are already trusting to be babysittersfor their kids. The committee added an amendment to the bill that would require the child care centersto submit an annual report to the state on howmany aides qualify under the bill. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) spoke against the bill, saying it doesnot address the main problem, which is lowwages. McGuire said the committee would not think of supporting a bill that would lowerstandards for elementary teachers. Sykora responded by saying she wants to expand the pool of child care services and herintention is not to reduce quality of care. McGuire is sponsoring a bill (HF3730) that would create a supplemental payment to childcare providers who meet certain criteria. \"We have some very dedicated people in this field who don 't stay in the business because of wages, \" McGuire said. The bill would require a person to have one year of experience at a child care center andearn an hourly wage less than the equivalentof elementary teachers in the district. McGuiresaid providers who meet the guidelines wouldreceive an annual supplement from the statebetween $750 and $3,500. McGuire 's bill does not say what the total cost to the state would be. #CRIMEFamily & Early Childhood Education Finance Chair: Sykora 12 (7 R, 5 DFL) Scope: Committee ac- counts are divided intothe broad topic of Children andFamily initiatives arechild care and adult basic education.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILE Farm chemical used in meth In an effort to curb the production of meth- amphetamine, the House Crime PreventionCommittee approved a bill March 3 thatwould make improper transportation or tam-pering with anhydrous ammonia a felony. Methamphetamine, also known as \"crystal meth \" or \"crank, \" is a powerful synthetic drug that is known to give long-lasting highs tousers. The drug is made with several commonhousehold and over-the-counter products.Anhydrous ammonia, a common fertilizerused on Minnesota farms, is used in the meth-making process. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison) is sponsoring a bill (HF3984) that aims to keepthe chemical out of the hands of illegal drugmanufacturers. The Crime Prevention Com-mittee approved the bill and sent it to theHouse Judiciary Finance Committee.6 March 10, 2000The chemical is valuable to farmers because of its nitrogen content. Thieves typically usesmall, makeshift containers to collect, storeand transport the ammonia once stolen fromfarmers ' tanks or other agricultural facilities, according to a report by the state Departmentof Agriculture. Anhydrous ammonia can beused both as a gas and a liquid. Peterson said the bill is written so that it would still be legal for farmers to obtain andstore the chemical. Under the bill, illegal tampering or trans- porting the chemical would result in a maxi-mum penalty of five years in prison and a$50,000 fine. Although the chemical is non-flammable, it can be extremely dangerous. Contact withthe chemical can dry the skin and contact withthe eye could cause blindness, according to theAgriculture Department. Because anhydrous ammonia is corrosive, it can weaken and destroy propane tanks thatwere not made to store the chemical. How-ever, thieves typically use improper storagetanks, which can lead to dangerous situations. Creating a new information system The House Judiciary Finance Committee considered a measure March 7 to create a sys-tem that would integrate criminal justice in-formation statewide. The bill (HF3346), sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), would first create apolicy group to determine a framework forbringing together all the criminal justice in-formation from the hundreds of law enforce-ment and social service agencies in the state. According to the bill, once the policy group has determined what the criminal justice in-formation system should do, what informa-tion it should include, who should maintainit and who should have access to it, the panelwould submit a report to the commissionerof public safety. Then, the commissioner would decide what technology to purchase in order to success-fully integrate all the criminal justice infor-mation. The bill prescribes appropriations for grants and direct spending in order to implement theprogram. Stanek said he deliberately left spe-cific dollar amounts out of the bill so that thepolicy group could determine how much willbe needed to implement their recommenda-tions. Of the money that the state ultimately spends on the project, the bill would distribute funds tothe Supreme Court to upgrade court informa-tion systems, to the Department of Public Safetyfor certain fingerprint technologies, to RamseyCounty and the Sentencing Guidelines Commis-sion to establish a pilot project, and to govern- ment agencies through grants that require a lo-cal match. The grants would allow counties and cities to integrate their probation and pre-trial re-lease information. Some of the funds may alsobe used to implement the plans for the over-all integration system, under the measure. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) introduced an amendment that would appropriate$15 million to implement the system. Theamendment failed, because members of thecommittee are concerned that there isn 't enough money available under Gov. JesseVentura 's spending limits for this session. The committee will consider including the measure in its omnibus spending bill. Directing juveniles to facility The House Judiciary Finance Committee voted March 7 to combine two bills dealingwith the costs of confining juvenile offendersat the Red Wing correctional facility. Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R-Hastings) is the sponsor of the bills (HF3422 and HF3029).Officials said both are intended to help in-crease the population at the Red Wing facilityand, as a result, effectively reduce the per diemcosts to operate it. The bills were combined by an amendment to HF3029. The Red Wing facility currently houses the most serious juvenile offenders in the state.According to the bill, a juvenile must be a\"chronic and serious offender \" with both edu- cational and treatment needs. In addition, thecounty where the juvenile committed his orher offense must have already exhausted theoptions available to them before sending theoffender to Red Wing. However, many counties are opting to send juvenile offenders to private or out-of-statefacilities because they are required to covermost of the bill and the other facilities are lessexpensive. Corrections officials say the costs of hous- ing juveniles at Red Wing is so high becausethey are operating at a low capacity. HF3029 would create a 50-50 split between the state and the counties for paying the costsof incarceration at Red Wing. In addition,there would be some money available to coun-ties through grants from the Department ofCorrections to offset the costs of residentialtreatment. The bill also would instruct judges that they must send offenders to Red Wing if they meetthe criteria specified. The only departure fromthis would be if Red Wing will not sufficientlymeet the needs of the juvenile or if an out-of-state facility is closer to the juvenile 's home.The last provision is specifically for cities along the borders with other states. The committee will consider the measure for inclusion in its omnibus spending bill. Raising fines for misdemeanors It's been more than 10 years since the Leg- islature raised fines for misdemeanor offenses.Meanwhile, costs in the criminal justice haveincreased more than 100 percent. But a proposal sponsored by Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) wouldhelp balance those matters. The bill (HF2503) would raise the maxi- mum fines for petty misdemeanors from $200to $300 and for misdemeanors from $700 to$800. The House Judiciary Finance Commit-tee heard the bill March 7 and will consider itfor inclusion in its omnibus bill. Carruthers testified that the bill would merely be asking defendants to pay part of thecosts for the large criminal justice system. Hesaid that law enforcement and correctionscosts have increased between 100 and 200 per-cent in the past 15 years. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) asked whether judges are currently imposing themaximum fines. Carruthers said they do whendealing with repeat offenders or particularlyegregious crimes. Either way, he said, the abil-ity to levy higher fines needs to be there. More time to report abuse Domestic abuse victims would have more time to consider filing civil charges against aperpetrator, under a measure bound for theHouse floor. The House Civil Law Committee approved a bill (HF47/SF11*) on March 8 that wouldextend the statute of limitations in domesticabuse cases from two years to six years. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), the bill sponsor, said the statute of limitations would Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) has returned to the State Office Building. Lastweek, he was assigned to Room 567 in thebuilding, after a short stay in a Capitol office. Reuter was moved to a room in the Capitol after he left the Republican caucusand declared himself an independentshortly after the close of the 1999 session. All other House members have offices in the State Office Building, and Reuterobjected to being moved across the street.Session Weekly 7begin at the point of the last incident. \"So many times domestic abuse is covered up,\" Bishop said. \"It doesn 't surface for a long time. \" Bishop successfully moved to replace the House version of the bill with the Senate lan-guage, which has already passed the otherchamber. The bills are not significantly differ-ent, he said. Protecting teens from pimps The number of teen-agers involved in pros- titution is growing, and that has legislatorsconcerned. Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) is sponsor- ing a bill that would expand a law that includespenalties for people who lure teens intoprostitution. Clark presented her bill (HF2830) to the House Crime Prevention Committee onMarch 7. The committee approved the mea-sure and sent it to the House Judiciary FinanceCommittee. Attorney General Mike Hatch said the bill is necessary because of recent cases in Minne-sota, including one family that reportedlytransported up to 150 Minnesota teens toother states to become prostitutes. The current law makes it a felony to engage a person under age16 in prostitution.The maximum pen-alty is 20 years inprison. The billwould raise the ageportion, making it a20-year felony tomake a prostitute ofanyone under age18. Al Hofstede, former mayor ofMinneapolis,chaired a task forcethat looked pros-titution issues. Hesaid there is a directcorrelation betweenhomelessness inteens and the rise ofteen prostitution. \"The longer they are on the street, themore likely they willbecome involved incriminal activity, \" Hofstede told the committee. Hofstede said there are about 1,000 Minne- sota teens who are prostitutes. The average age ateen enters prostitution is 14. Boys, as well as girls,are approached to become prostitutes.\"They are forced into prostitution because it is the only way they can survive, \" Hofstede said. \"Juvenile prostitution is a highly mobile underground crime. The targets are virtuallyanyone 's child. \" Bill Snyder, deputy with the Ramsey County Sheriff 's Department, said he has seen a rise in teen prostitution, especially among theSoutheast Asian community. The girls in-volved in the Asian prostitution range from11 to 17 years old, Snyder said. \"Half of them don 't even know what is hap- pening to them, \" he said. \"They call it 'getting naked for money ' or 'survival sex. '\" Snyder added, \"Gang members are involved because there are very little consequences andthe profits are high. \" Suzanne Peterson of Pride Family and Children Ser- vices urges support of a bill that would expand a lawthat penalizes those who lure minors into prostitu-tion. Peterson testified during a March 7 hearing ofthe House Crime Prevention Committee. #EDUCATIONCrime Prevention Chair: Stanek (R-Maple Skoglund (DFL-Mpls)Members: 17 (10 R, 7 DFL) Scope: Reviews to the adminis-tration sentencingpractices, ser-vices, probation services,and the operation of thecourts.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILE Discipline in schools House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) is sponsoring a bill designed to allow teachersand certain other school employees to use rea-sonable force to discipline a student. The bill (HF3674) would combine fourseparate but related corporal punishment pro- cedures and the legal defenses teachers anddistrict agents have against prosecution forusing force to discipline students. It states, in affirmative language, that teach- ers and agents of school districts would be ableto use force in a \"reasonable \" manner to cor- rect or restrain a student or to prevent bodilyharm or death to another. Furthermore, school districts would be re- quired under Sviggum 's bill to indicate in school discipline policy the circumstancesunder which teachers, school employees, andschool bus drivers could use force for disci-pline purposes. The House K-12 Education Finance Com- mittee heard the bill March 8. It will be con-sidered for inclusion in the committee 's omnibus spending measure. \"Y ou have to have discipline in a classroom or school setting to ensure any type of order, \" Sviggum said. Speaking in support of the bill, Bob Meeks, director of governmental relations for theMinnesota School Boards Association, said theproposal would cut down on the number ofteachers contacting the board with concernsabout student legal action following the useof reasonable force to handle a disciplinarysituation. #EMPLOYMENT Workers' compensation changes The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Policy Committee approved a billMarch 9 that would change several provisionsin the state 's workers ' compensation laws. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls), the spon- sor of the measure (HF3960), said it reflectsof the recommendations of the Workers ' Compensation Advisory Council, which iscomposed of representatives from businessand labor. Beth Hartgarten, an attorney from the Min- nesota Department of Labor and Industry,said the council 's proposal last session did not make it through the Legislature. She said thisyear's bill incorporates many of the provisions from last year 's bill. Among the bill 's provisions is an increase in the maximum weekly compensation an in-jured worker can receive for wage loss ben-efits. Currently that amount is capped at $615per week. The bill would increase the amountto $750. The bill also would increase the mini-mum amount per week from $104 to $130. The bill would require an employer to pro- vide employees a new informational sheetabout the workers ' compensation system.8 March 10, 2000THE STATES50 With a record 53 million students popu- lating the nation's K-12 classrooms, the prob-lem of finding enough qualified teachers isfacing school districts throughout the nation. While many states including Minnesota are looking for solutions, Maryland hasmoved ahead with a pair of new programs. To help address the state's acute teacher shortage, the Maryland General Assemblypassed a law in 1999 permitting local schoolsystems to rehire retired teachers, who canthen earn a full salary while still collectingtheir pensions. Maryland limits the retirees to teaching only in school systems identified as havinglow test scores and shortages of teachersin specific areas, such as math and science. According to the Washington Post , rising student enrollments combined with alarge number of teachers reaching retire-ment age over the next few years will re-quire Maryland to hire 9,000 to 11,000teachers in 2001.Bernard Brommer, the president of the AFL-CIO in Minnesota and a member of thecouncil, spoke in support of the measure. \"It represents progress for injured workers and for employers. It was arrived at in goodfaith, although it 's far from perfect, \" Brommer said. \"It's an agreement that represents a foun- dation we can build upon. \" David Olson, president of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and a member of thecouncil, also spoke in support of the measure.Olson said that members of the council haveagreed that the bill should be considered as awhole and that the sponsors of the legislationhave agreed to pull the bill if any amendmentsto the agreement are made. The bill now goes to the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance Committee. #ENVIRONMENT Limits on mosquito spraying Most Minnesotans would agree that mos- quitoes are annoying, but some lawmakers aresupporting limits on the efforts to control thepesky insects, especially in wildlife manage-ment areas or state parks. Under current law, a landowner can refuse to allow the Metropolitan Mosquito ControlDistrict to spray his or her land with insecti-cides, but that same courtesy is not alwaysgiven regarding publicly owned land. The Mosquito Control District would need the approval of the commissioner of naturalresources before spraying state lands, under abill approved March 7 by the House Environ-ment and Natural Resources PolicyCommittee. The bill (HF3134) also would extend that right to township boards and city councilsregarding land owned by those entities. Much of the debate on the bill focused on the Mosquito Control District 's spraying at Fort Snelling State Park in July 1999. The De-partment of Natural Resources (DNR) hadobjected to the spraying, partly because itwould disrupt the food chain of wildlife in thearea. One of the DNR 's responsibilities is to en- hance wildlife habitat, and Kathleen Wallace,director for the DNR 's metro region, said the chemicals that kill mosquitoes also kill midges,insects that are the main food source forducklings. Mosquito Control District employees sprayed at Fort Snelling after the DNR had saidnot to, Wallace said. Also, research done by theDNR disputes the assertions that Fort Snellingwas the breeding ground for mosquitoes thatled to complaints in the surrounding suburbs. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), chairof the committee and sponsor of the bill, said the DNR should have jurisdiction over thedecision to spray chemicals in wildlife man-agement areas, because the DNR has the ex-pertise in the chemicals ' effects on vegetation, water quality, wildlife habitat, and relatedissues. The bill now moves to the House Local Government and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee. Spending for the environment Several state agencies and departments would receive additional money for the cur-rent biennium under a deficiency spending billconsidered March 6 by the House Environ-ment and Natural Resources FinanceCommittee. The committee considered the environ- ment-related portions of the overall bill(HF3450), sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester). Other finance committees willconsider other parts of the bill, which will thenbe forwarded to the House Ways and MeansCommittee. The bill would spend $4 million for the Department of Natural Resources (DNR),$410,000 on the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency (MPCA), and $400,000 for the Boardof Water and Soil Resources. The money for the DNR would pay for costs related to a U.S. Supreme Court decision thatupheld the hunting and fishing rights of theMille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians andothers. The court found that an 1837 land-sale treaty allows those groups to hunt and fishwithout state regulation. Under the decision,the state must pay the plaintiffs ' legal fees and court costs. The $410,000 to the MPCA would cover costs of the Wastewater Treatment Fund grantprogram for small communities that do nothave sewer systems. Agency staff evaluate theenvironmental aspects of the wastewater in-frastructure systems that are to be builtthrough the grant program. The $400,000 to water and soil board would pay for professional and technical services re- Back in class Maryland brings back retired teachers to help solve shortage Traditionally, Maryland has been forced to seek a large supply of its newteachers from colleges in other states. In1997 and 1998, Maryland schoolsneeded a total of 6,033 new teachers, butthe state's teacher education programsproduced only 2,683 teachers. And only1,826 of those graduates became teach-ers in Maryland schools. Maryland also has established the Sharon Christa McAulliffe MemorialTeacher Education Awards, named afterthe Maryland teacher who was killed inthe 1986 space shuttle Challenger explo-sion. The program provides up to $10,000 annually toward tuition, fees, room, andboard for teaching students who agreeto teach one year in Maryland schools foreach year they earn an award. (D.

Costs are related toreporting, monitoring, and maintaining a da-tabase that keeps an inventory of wetlands inthe state. A cut in garbage taxes A bill that would modify the state 's Solid Waste Management Tax was approved March 3 by theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesPolicy Committee. The tax is levied on solid waste services that are purchased by households, businesses, andgovernment agencies. The tax applies to dis-posal of materials, so it is designed to give in-centives for recycling. A 1997 law established the tax with three basic rates \u2014 17 percent for commercial gar- bage service, 9.75 percent for residential gar-bage service, and 60 cents per cubic yard formedical, industrial, and demolition debris. The bill (HF2949), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would reduce those to15 percent, 8.5 percent, and 57 cents per cu-bic yard. Ultimately, those taxes are passed on to cus- tomers through hauling rates. The bill is in response to a one-time \"excess revenue adjustment \" provision in the 1997 law. The tax was intended to generate about $44.5 million per year, which pays for various pol- lution cleanup programs, block grants tocounties through the governor 's Select Com- mittee on Recycling and Environment(SCORE), and related administrative costs. Cathy Moeger, of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency 's policy and planning divi- sion, said the current rates have created anexcess fund balance and the bill would reducethe rates to comply with the original intent ofthe law. The bill was sent to the House Taxes Com- mittee and could be included in thecommittee 's omnibus tax bill. Complaint filed in Rostberg case Two House leaders filed a formal ethics complaint with House Speaker Steve Sviggum(R-Kenyon) March 6 in reference to the re-cent arrest of Rep. Jim Rostberg (R-Isanti). The letter, submitted by Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) and Assistant Minor-ity Leader Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), re-quests that the House Ethics Committeeconduct an investigation of Rostberg 's conduct. Rostberg was arrested March 2 at the State Capitol. He was charged March 3 with threecounts of felony criminal sexual conduct, in- volving a girl who was under 16 at the time ofthe alleged offenses, according to the crimi-nal complaint. The alleged illegal contact took place over the course of five years. The victim is a girlwho is now 14. According to the Permanent Rules of the House, a complaint may be brought regard-ing a member 's conduct \"that violates a rule or administrative policy of the House, thatviolates accepted norms of House behavior,that betrays the public trust, or that tends tobring the House into dishonor or disrepute. \" Such a complaint must present specific fac- tual evidence. It must be submitted in writingand signed by two or more members of theHouse. Within seven days of receiving the com- plaint, the speaker of the House must refer thecomplaint to the Ethics Committee forprocessing. The Ethics Committee consists of four members \u2014 two from each party \u2014 and two alternates. All proceedings of the ethics com-mittee are open to the public, unless a major-ity vote of the committee moves discussioninto executive session, in order to protectmedical or health records of the member orto otherwise protect a victim 's identity. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) is the chair of the Ethics Committee. Committee members recommend disci- plinary actions to the full House, and the ac-tion must be supported by clear andconvincing evidence. According to the Min-nesota Constitution, the House may expel a BOTTLED UPEthics law clarification As far as state ethics laws are concerned, Gov. Jesse Ventura and other constitutionalofficers would be treated just like other stateemployees under a bill approved March 3 bythe House Governmental Operations and Vet-erans Affairs Policy Committee. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), sponsor of the bill (HF3623), said it would clarify thetraditional interpretation of those laws. Former governors have considered them- selves to be subject to state ethics laws, Entenzasaid. In particular, he referred to a section thatspecifies guidelines for the use of state prop-erty or resources and lists several examples ofconflict of interest. \"Our state ethics law should be fair, and it should apply to everyone, \" Entenza said. The bill would not affect past allegations that Ventura has inappropriately used stateresources to boost his personal income,Entenza said. Also, it would not prevent thegovernor from writing books or doing any- Ruth Odegard of Coon Rapids wears earrings made from bottles used for drugs prescribed totreat her high blood pressure.

Rostberg 's is not the only pending com- plaint currently in the House. Four DFL housemembers, including Entenza, asked Feb. 28 foran Ethics Committee investigation of Rep.Arlon Lindner (R-Corcoran). During a debate about the opening prayer on the House floor Feb. 23, Lindner describedRep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) as hav-ing \"irreligious \" views. The Lindner complaint is at the stage where it is awaiting preliminary hearing.10 March 10, 2000#FAMILYthing else that would create personal income \u2014 unless it presents a conflict under state law. Entenza said the bill would make it clear that in the future when the governor couldpotentially be involved in a conflict of inter-est, he should try to resolve it by checking withthe Department of Employee Relations. \"My goal is not to be bashing the governor, or calling him names, and certainly not wres-tling with him, \" Entenza said. Entenza added that the reason for the bill is that Ventura has publicly stated that the lawsshould not apply to him and a related courtcase was thrown out on technical grounds. But just like any other bill, it must pass both the House and the Senate, and then be signedor vetoed by the governor before it becomeslaw. And based on V entura 's previous public opinions regarding the ethics laws, some sayhe is likely to veto such a measure. The bill now moves to the House floor. Marriage license discount The House Ways and Means Committee considered a bill March 8 that would reducemarriage license fees for couples who obtainpremarital education. The bill (HF2229/SF884*), sponsored by Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson), would reducemarriage license fees from $70 to $20 forcouples who complete 12 hours of premaritaleducation that includes discussion of the se-riousness of marriage, the teaching of conflictmanagement skills, and the desirability ofseeking marital counseling in times of mari-tal difficulties. The bill also would increase the fee for dis- solving a marriage from $122 to $172. Harder 's bill still awaits a vote in the Ways and Means Committee. William Doherty, a professor in the Univer- sity of Minnesota 's Family Social Sciences Department, said that the bill would raise thequality of premarital counseling, which in turnwould help reduce divorce rates in the state. Doherty said he estimates 50 percent of the couples would take advantage of the discountand receive the 12 hours of education. He saidthat 15 percent of those couples would decidenot to get married. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) said he was concerned about the state imposing stan-dards for what qualifies under the bill as ap-proved premarital education. He said the bill 's establishment of criteria such as the require-ment for the use of premarital inventory wassimilar to establishing criteria for the troubledProfile of Learning education initiative. \"This is prescribing something from the William Doherty of the University of Minnesota's Family Social Sciences Department urges supportof a bill that would offer a reduced marriage li-cense fee for couples who obtain premarital coun-seling. Doherty spoke March 8 before the HouseWays and Means Committee. state that many communities are already do-ing,\" Solberg said. Harder asked the committee to consider an amendment that would have incorporatedanother measure she is carrying enacting acovenant marriage option in the state. That bill (HF1571) was referred to the com- mittee by the House Judiciary Finance Com-mittee without recommendation. It includesthe premarital counseling provisions but notthe license and divorce fee changes. That fact and also the $36,000 the amend- ment would cost, prompted Rep. Dave Bishop(R-Rochester), the committee chair, to moveto lay the bill on the table until it is determinedhow the two measures should proceed. #GOVERNMENT Review of state agency rules All administrative rules would have to be reviewed by the Legislature, under a bill ap-proved March 7 by the House State Govern-ment Finance Committee. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), sponsor of the bill (HF3000), said the Legislature has beenderelict in its duties to oversee the adminis-trative rules promulgated by state agencies.The bill, he said, would increase theLegislature 's scrutiny of those rules. Seifert 's bill would establish a task force of legislators and governor 's appointees to study current rulemaking policies and recommendrelated policy changes to the governor. Also, the bill would establish a schedule thatwould cause administrative rules to expire unless a law is enacted to authorize specificrules to continue. The bill also would give House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over state gov-ernmental operations the same authority asthe Legislative Coordinating Commission invarious aspects of rulemaking. Under current law, the commission can for- mally object to an administrative rule and in-tervene in litigation arising from an agency 's action relating to rules. A formal objection toa rule by the commission forces the agency toestablish the validity of the rule in questionbefore an administrative law judge. The billwould give that authority to the related Houseand Senate committees. Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) said he sup- ports the concept but the volume of rules thatthe Legislature would have to review couldprove to be overwhelming. \"I wish you would find some way to do this without creating such chaos, \" he said. The bill now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. No sale of state data Minnesota government agencies would be barred from selling information about stateresidents, under a bill approved by a Housepanel. \"This bill prohibits individuals from com- ing to the government and buying informa-tion in bulk, then turning around and usingit for commercial purposes, \" said Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), the bill spon-sor, in March 3 testimony to the House CivilLaw Committee. \"This bill does not make (pri- vate) anything currently public. \" The committee approved the bill (HF3986) and sent it to the House State GovernmentFinance Committee. Pawlenty said Minnesotans are asking for this legislation, and he explained how peoplereceive mailings with information they believeis private and personal. Pawlenty said if thestate wants businesses to stop invadingpeople 's privacy, the government should lead the way. \"We have an opportunity with this bill to lead by example, \" Pawlenty said. \"Let's get our house in order. \" Don Gemberling, information and policy analysis with the Department of Administra-tion, gave an example of a woman who hadfailed to pay her property taxes. The womansoon received a letter from a credit card com-pany offering her help to pay her taxes. Thewoman was angry that this information wasavailable to the company, Gemberling said. In another instance, sporting goods storesSession Weekly 11buy lists of people who purchase hunting or fishing licenses. The sporting good stores thencontact those people to sell their merchandise. The committee removed language in the bill that would have barred the selling of publicinformation for political or election purposes.Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) said he fearedthat the way the bill read only a handful ofpeople would be able to access voterinformation. \"Only the police (would) get to look at voter registration lists, \" Skoglund said. \"That is a scary, scary thought. \" Currently, voter registration information is public and available free for political and elec-tion purposes. Kent Allin, assistant commissioner with the Department of Revenue, said the MinnesotaBookstore, which sells some state information,depends on those sales to make a profit. Allinsaid it would be bad public policy to makeinformation available for one use but notanother. \"This information would be open to every- one but the Minnesota business owners, whichis strange to me, \" Allin said. The loss of revenue to the state would be about $8 million, Allin said. DIABETES RESEARCH Sheila Schlangen wipes a tear from her eye March 3 while she listens to her son, Alex, as hereads a statement to the House Health and Human Services Policy Committee in support of abill that would provide funds to the University of Minnesota for research on diabetes.#HEALTHData practices bill advances After weeks of hammering out details, the House Civil Law Committee approved a datapractices bill March 8 and sent it to the Housefloor. The bill (HF3615) incorporates several other bills the committee has heard in the pastfive weeks. Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville) is sponsoring the bill, which opens some datato the U.S. Immigration Naturalization Ser-vice (INS) or the police, while making otherinformation, such as health status or finan-cial numbers, private. \"It's all the noncontroversial stuff, \" Holberg said. \"I don 't see it having any major changes. \" The Immigration and Naturalization Ser- vice sought the right to receive non-publicdata, such as wage information, from the De-partment of Economic Security to investigateemployers and employees. The bill would al-low the agents to obtain the information fromthe department without the consent of theemployee or company. Another portion of the bill would allow law enforcement to share juvenile records for po-lice purposes. The bill includes provisions of a separate proposal (HF2672) sponsored by Rep. AndrewWesterberg (R-Blaine). The measure wouldallow school districts to share information ingood faith about students. The districts wouldbe immune from liability if they acted in good faith, under the bill. The bill would clarify that financial infor- mation, such as credit reports, business plans,statements, customer lists, and incomeprojects, are private. A review team would be allowed to collect and analyze private information on domestic vio-lence, according to the bill. Members of the teamwould be forbidden to discuss the informationwith people outside of the group setting. The domestic review portion comes from a bill (HF2919) initially introduced by Rep. RichStanek (R-Maple Grove). Stanek said the taskforce could learn more about how and whydomestic homicides occurred. The bill wouldexclude information about ongoing cases. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter) offered a successful amendment thatwould make Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion records on all convicts open permanently.Currently, the BCA makes conviction recordsprivate information 15 years after aconviction. Murderers or pedophiles could slip through the cracks with the current law, said Rep. WesSkoglund (DFL-Mpls). Abortion bill heads to floor The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill March 8 that would require awoman to meet \"informed consent \" require- ments before having an abortion. The bill (HF178), sponsored by Rep. LyndaBoudreau (R-Faribault), was sent to the House floor. The bill would require that a woman receive specified information at least 24 hours beforethe procedure and be told of the availabilityof printed material on the subject. Consent would not be required in medical emergencies. The bill would establish civilpenalties against a woman, or the parents of aminor, when an abortion is performed with-out meeting the consent requirements. Boudreau said the measure is a women 's health issue and that it is important to pro-vide information to women before they makea decision that will \"affect them physically and emotionally for the rest of their lives. \" Pati Maier, assistant director of Division of Family Health in the state Department ofHealth, said that the cost of the bill would be$167,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $152,000each following year. The bill would require the department to distribute information and materials and todevelop licensing arrangements with the stateof South Dakota, which has a pamphlet thatwould meet information standards establishedin the bill. Members questioned the department 's in- clusion of $30,680 in its estimate for printinginformation in Spanish. Maier said that thereis a requirement that printed material be madeavailable in a language that is the primary lan-guage of two percent or more of the state 's population, which state demographers saySpanish nearly is. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), commit- tee chair, offered an unsuccessful amendmentto strike the $30,860 provision out of the bill.12 March 10, 2000Training for care providers Sharon Morrissey and husband Don Baierl of St. Paul know all too well the pain a personexperiences after losing a child. In May 1996, Morrissey gave birth to twin daughters, Lillie and Adrian. Both girls came intothe world with a medical condition referred toas Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, a blood-oxy-gen disease that requires intensive monitoring. The children required respite or temporary care during the day while the parents wereaway at work. About a year after the birth, Lilliedied. She had been left with two care provid-ers filling in for a weekend while the children 's regular care providers vacationed. Testifying before the House Health and Hu- man Services Policy Committee on March 7,Morrissey blamed the death on the substituteproviders limited knowledge of equipment usedto monitor Lillie 's heart rate and blood-oxygen saturation level. \"What has happened to our Lillie should never, ever happen to any other child or adult, \" Morrissey said. Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) agrees. He is sponsoring a bill (HF3342) that wouldrequire foster and respite care providers tohave training or experience with a child 's medical equipment before being allowed tocare for the child. The bill also would require that agencies placing children in homes, even if it 's only on a temporary basis, ensure that the care pro-vider has the necessary training before beingentrusted with the child 's care. Committee members expressed support for the bill and were quick to approve it. \"It's terrible that a situation like this would have to occur before we look at legislation toaddress the problem, \" said Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka). \"I hope we can all work as one to Sharon Morrissey and her husband Don Baierl speak in favor of a bill that would require foster and respite care providers to have training or experience with achild's medical equipment before caring for the child. Morrissey and Baierl ex-plained that their infant daughter Lillie died in May 1997 because her care pro-vider did not know how to use the special equipment the child needed. get this bill on its way so, hopefully, a situa-tion like this won 't happen again. \" The bill would require that the Department of Human Services create a training form forfoster care providers. Otherwise, Mariani said,there would be little fiscal impact to the de-partment. The bill was referred to the House floor. Improving long-term care A bill that aims to increase the level of care that nursing facilities can provide patients wasapproved March 7 by the House Health andHuman Services Policy Committee. Sponsored by Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls), the bill (HF3226) would allow nursingfacilities to employ resident attendants to as-sist residents with eating and drinking. Un-der the bill, resident attendants could not becounted in a nursing facility 's minimum staff- ing requirement. Concerned about the quality of care at cer- tain nursing facilities, children and spouses ofpatients testified before the committee out offear that loved ones are, at times, unable toproperly feed or replenish themselves. Aid topatients struggling to eat or drink, they said,is often unavailable due to staffing shortagesplaguing many facilities. \"I certainly sympathize with the nursing home industry 's dilemma of short resources and long demands, but rather than loweringstandards of care, I favor increasing the sup-port to the level necessary to treat our long-care residents right, \" said registered nurse Myra Starkenburg, daughter of a patient whospent four years in a nursing home before dy-ing in 1998. Nornes ' bill also would require the commis- sioner of the Department of Health to exam- ine state and federalregulations govern-ing nursing facilitycare and alsospoke in support ofthe bill. \"Y ou and I may be there (in a nurs-ing facility) one day, and I would thinkwe would want abetter quality of lifethan what is cur-rently provided atsome of these facilities, \" Oberpriller said. The commissioner of health would also be required under the bill to develop a proposalto decrease regulations that impede direct careof nursing facility residents. The committee referred the bill to the House floor. Janice Laulainen, whose father lives in a nursinghome, testifies March 7 before the House Healthand Human Services Committee in favor of a billthat would allow nursing facilities to employ resi-dent attendants to assist residents with eating anddrinking. Indigent care compensation A person who goes to a hospital emergency room has the right by federal law to be treated.While the law is essential for those who needtreatment but are unable to pay, it causes fi-nancial burdens for hospitals. A bill (HF3469) proposed by Rep. Henry T odd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) would con-tinue compensation for hospitals that provideunusually high levels of uncompensated care. Last year the Legislature provided a one- time appropriation of $10 million in 2000 tohelp pay the costs for providing medical careto individuals who are indigent and who donot reside in the county. Hennepin CountyMedical Center in Minneapolis and RegionsHospital in St. Paul provided most of that care. Van Dellen 's bill would make the aid pro- gram permanent with an annual appropria-tion of $10 million per year. Dr. Michael Belzer, medical director for Hennepin County Medical Center, said thehospital 's financial stability is threatened by undercompensated and uncompensated care. In 1999, Belzer said, the medical center pro- vided about $34 million in uncompensatedcare, an amount that has increased more than53 percent since 1997.Session Weekly 13#HIGHER EDUCATION#HOUSINGIn 1998, the medical center served more than 17,000 patients from the state 's other 86 counties. Many of those patients, Belzer said,were referred there because of the hospital 's trauma expertise. Jill Larson, from Regions Hospital, said that Regions provided approximately $16 millionin charity care in 1999. That level of care, shesaid, cannot be sustained without additionalfinancial assistance. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) expressed concern over whether the issue was a healthand human services or tax issue. Van Dellen said that the appropriation was included as part of last year 's omnibus tax law, and because the program has an impact onproperty taxes, he said it is a tax measure. The committee also discussed a potential amendment that would expand the programto include community clinics for indigent careand removed the $10 million cap for theprogram. No action was taken on either the amend- ment or the bill, but both will be consideredfor inclusion in the omnibus tax bill. Input on college buildings Representatives of higher education insti- tutions would have greater participation inselecting the designs for new buildings, undera bill approved March 3 by the House Gov-ernmental Operations and Veterans AffairsPolicy Committee. Currently, contracts for designing state buildings are awarded through the state De-signer Selection Board. The five board members are appointed by the commissioner of the Department of Ad-ministration. Three organizations nominatepeople to serve on the board \u2014 the Consult- ing Engineers Council of Minnesota (withinput from other professional engineeringsocieties in the state), the Minnesota Societyof Architects, and the Minnesota Board of theArts. Also, the agency that is going to use the new building has a non-voting member on theboard. But the bill (HF3195) would require the board to include two additional voting mem-bers when considering designs for higher edu-cation buildings \u2014 one would be from the University of Minnesota and the other wouldbe from the Minnesota State Colleges andUniversities (MnSCU) system. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), spon- sor of the bill, originally advocated exempt-ing the university and MnSCU from thedesigner selection process, so that each would have its own process regarding buildings ontheir campuses. But opponents of that proposal said those buildings use state funds and they should besubject to the same selection process as otherstate buildings. The bill was modified so that the university and MnSCU would each have a voting mem-ber on the board when it considers proposedbuilding projects for any higher educationinstitution in the state. The bill now moves to the House floor. Affordable housing funds The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Finance Committee heard a proposalthat would transfer $54.5 million from Tem-porary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)funds to the Minnesota Housing FinanceAgency to create more affordable housing. The committee took no action on the bill but will consider it later for inclusion in anomnibus funding measure. \"The access to affordable housing is a very important component of moving a welfare re-cipient towards self-sufficiency, \" said Tonya Orr, legislative liaison from the Housing Fi-nance Agency. The bill (HF3589), which is a governor 's initiative sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), the committee chair, would trans-fer the funds from the Department of HumanServices to the Housing Finance Agency. Atotal of $15 million would be used as a loan toHabitat for Humanity, which provides homeownership opportunities for low-incomefamilies. Orr said the funds would be allocated to the various Habitat chapters located around thestate according to the number of MinnesotaFamily Investment Program (MFIP) house-holds in a chapter 's service area. She said Habi- tat could build about 260 homes with themoney. The bill also would provide $39.5 million for the affordable rental investment fund pro-gram, which is the agency 's main program for the production of rental housing. Orr said that the units produced would carry average rents of $400 a month or lessand would be required to remain affordablefor 30 years. The units would go to familieswho currently receive MFIP aid or who haverecently lost their eligibility for that aid dueto increased employment income. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) said he was concerned about the length of time fami-lies could stay in the units. He said the funds may be better used to trainpeople to get better paying jobs. \"These apartments are so good a deal it 's almost worth losing a job to get one, \" Trimble said. Orr said the agency is continuing to work on guidelines for the program that would es-tablish criteria for continued eligibility. Housing built by at-risk youth The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Finance Committee considered a billMarch 2 that would use workers from an at-risk youth program to build and rehabilitateaffordable housing. The committee took no action on the mea- sure (HF2568), sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark(DFL-Mpls), but will consider it for inclusionin an omnibus finance bill. The workers would come from the state 's Y outhBuild Program, which provides special-ized training in construction and the build-ing trade fields for youth at risk of notcompleting high school. Clark said that the state has appropriated $1.5 million over the current biennium tofund the program. However, federal match-ing funds are no longer available. The bill would require the Department of Economic Security to develop and adminis-ter a demonstration project using theY outhBuild program to build or rehabilitate Farji Schaheer, a graduate of Summit Academywho now instructs rookies in the YouthBuild Pro-gram, asks the House Jobs and Economic Devel-opment Finance Committee for continued supportMarch 3. 14 March 10, 2000#HUMAN SERVICESaffordable housing in Minnesota. And the bill would require that the demonstration projecttarget deteriorated housing and blighted ar-eas in urban, suburban, and ruralcommunities. Latoya Banks, a student from the Y outhBuild Summit Academy, said the pro-gram has given students who have fallenthrough the cracks another opportunity. Joyce Eissinger, from the Carver Scott Edu- cation Co-op, also testified about the benefitsof the program. \"I can 't think of a program that has had more of an impact, \" she said. \"More and more students are getting into high school and los-ing their way. They have to feel they being con-nected to an adult, and they 're not getting that in high school. \" Marlon Fletcher, a student from Y outhBuild, agreed with Eissinger that the program helpsstudents find adult role models. Fletcher saidhe came here from T exas without his familyand the program has given him an alternativeto living on the streets. \"It's been my family, \" he said. Enforcing work requirements State welfare recipients could be forced to forfeit their entire welfare checks if they failto comply with work rules tied to MinnesotaFamily Investment Program (MFIP)eligibility. Before benefits would be cut off, however, parents would have to violate program re-quirements for a sixth time. Parents also wouldhave an opportunity to meet with a judge andcounty caseworkers before a decision to fullytake away aid could be made. The sanctions are in a bill (HF3128) that was discussed March 8 by the House Healthand Human Services Finance Committee. Theproposal, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno(R-Moorhead), will be considered for inclu-sion in the committee 's omnibus spending measure. Goodno reminded the committee that the first wave of parents participating in the pro-gram will soon be halfway to their five-yearlimit for welfare benefits. He said the stateshould get serious about helping people whoare wrongfully sanctioned and crack down onthose who disregard MFIP rules. The programis the state 's welfare reform initiative. Not all agree, however, that stiffer sanctions will clear up problems that seem to plaguingthe current sanction system. \"Sanctions are not helping people go to work, they are keeping people from working, \"said Chili George, a disabled welfare recipient who testified against the bill before the Healthand Human Services Policy Committee lastmonth. Brian Rusche, a lobbyist for the Joint Reli- gious Legislative Coalition, said tighteningsanctions is \"like calling a guillotine a health- care device. \" Others expressed concern that full sanctions are not fair for parents of children with dis-abilities, would leave children hungry, andwould lead to parents being evicted from theirhomes. Goodno 's bill, however, would allow parents of disabled children to qualify for an exemp-tion from work rules and require a greaterexamination of families being sanctioned. The bill also proposes spending a $160 mil- lion surplus in federal funds earmarked for anoverhaul of the state 's welfare system for pro- grams to prevent teen prostitution and to aidhard-to-employ parents. The measure also suggests tightening work rules for welfare recipients by shortening theamount of time parents can spend educatingthemselves. Verification of citizenship Minnesota may soon be among the many states that take part in a federal program toverify the citizenship status of people seekingpublic assistance. In the late 1980s, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service developed an auto-mated Systematic Alien Verification for En-titlements (SA VE) program to verify theimmigration status of applicants forassistance. Minnesota is one of five states that received a waiver from participating in the program. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is spon- soring a bill that would require the commis-sioner of the Department of Human Servicesto use the SA VE program to verify the immi-gration status of applicants for various formsof public assistance. The bill (HF2837) calls for the state to be- gin using the program by Jan. 1, 2001. The bill also would require that the com- missioner report to the chairs of the legisla-tive committees that deal with human servicespolicy issues about the usage and costs of theSAVE program during its first two years ofimplementation. The House Health and Human Services Fi- nance Committee heard the bill March 8. Itwill be considered for inclusion in thecommittee 's omnibus spending measure. States are required under the 1996 federal welfare reform law to verify the citizenship orimmigration status of all people who apply foran assistance program that delivers federal public funds. The verification requirement is intended to ensure that federally funded benefits are pro-vided only to citizens and qualifiednoncitizens. Under Boudreau 's bill, all cases of undocu- mented people identified through applicationverification procedures would be reported toimmigration agents. Newborn drop-off program A program that would allow mothers to leave unharmed newborns at hospitals with-out criminal consequences now heads to theHouse Crime Prevention Committee. The bill (HF2945), sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior), was approved March 8by the House Civil Law Committee. There already is a system in place at Twin Cities hospitals where mothers can drop offbabies, but the law still makes it a gross mis-demeanor to abandon the child. This billwould remove the criminal penalties, Sykorasaid. The mother or another person with the mother 's consent could leave a baby, no more than 72 hours old, at any hospital statewide.The bill would forbid the local welfare agencyfrom attempting to contact or investigate themother. The bill would require the hospital to in- form the welfare agency within 24 hours ofthe child 's arrival, but the call could not be made until the person leaving the newbornhas vacated the hospital. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) at- tempted to attach the Senate version to the bill,which already passed unanimously throughthat chamber. Dawkins said the Senate bill ismore simple. The committee rejected Dawkins ' amend- ment, with some arguing that the House billhas more family-friendly language. Homeless housing project Rep. Jim Seifert (R-Woodbury) is sponsor- ing a bill that would fund a housing and man-aged care pilot project for homeless people intwo separate counties in and outside the TwinCities metropolitan area. The bill (HF2553) would appropriate $3 million of federal Temporary Assistance forNeedy Families (TANF) funds for the projectand would also make a general fund appro-priation for project services that cannot bepaid for with TANF funds. \"We are expecting great things if this project is funded, \" Seifert said. The House Health and Human ServicesSession Weekly 15Finance Committee discussed the bill March 8. It will be considered for inclusion in thecommittee 's omnibus spending measure. The planning phase of the pilot project pre- viously received authorization, but no fundshave been allocated for implementation. Seifert 's bill calls for an annual report to evaluate the project with respect to certaingoals. The report would address whetherproject participants lead more productive andstable lives and whether system-wide costs andthe inappropriate use of emergency or crisis-oriented services have been reduced. The bill also clearly specifies who is eligible to participate in the pilot project. For instance,families or pregnant women who are receiv-ing or meet income guidelines for the Minne-sota Family Investment Program wouldqualify, as would employed families whosehousehold income falls below 150 percent offederal poverty guidelines. Liability for unsafe day care The House Civil Law Committee on March 8 scrapped a plan to give counties immunityfrom prosecution for licensing a child careoperation when there is reason to believe itcould be unsafe. The provision was included in a bill that would permanently prohibit some convictedfelons from working in day care centers. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF3103), which would perma-nently eliminate people with a felony childendangerment or a felony prostitution con-viction from positions that allow direct con-tact with children. Currently, those felons arebarred for 15 years after their conviction. Felony convictions for murder, assault, spousal abuse, criminal sexual conduct, anychild pornography offense, and incest are per-manently barred from working in a day careunder current law. While the committee had few objections to those proposed changes, there were severalquestions about a section of the bill designedto give counties immunity from lawsuits forlicensing day care facilities when there is a rea-son to believe the workers there are unquali-fied or unsafe. That section was deleted fromthe bill. Currently, if the county had some knowl- edge of a possible problem at the site, thecounty could be held liable. Rick and Mallery Loftus told the commit- tee about how their son, Calvin, was shakento death at a day care center in 1995. Calvinwas five months old. The woman, who wascaring for the boy, was convicted of murderand is currently incarcerated in the Shakopeewomen 's prison. HELPING HOMELESS KIDS #METRO AFFAIRSMembers of the House Jobs and Economic Development Finance and Family and Early Child- hood Education Finance committees stop by an Early Childhood Family Education class atthe People Serving People Shelter for homeless families in Minneapolis. The committeestoured several shelters in the Twin Cities area on March 6. The Loftuses have an ongoing lawsuit with Hennepin County. The family contends thecounty had a reason to believe the child carecenter was unsafe, but gave the woman a li-cense anyway. \"Y ou will be eliminating the last line of de- fense for defenseless children, \" said Mallery Loftus, as tears rolled down her face. She displayed a large photo of their deceased child during the hearing. The Loftuses said it is too late for their child, but they want to prevent an incident like theirsfrom ever happening again. \"I want you to think about the vulnerabil- ity of a child who is placed in a home withone other person, \" said Cindy Bartell, attor- ney for the Loftuses. \"There is no oversight. \" Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) said there should be a high standard for licensureand it should be followed. Sykora initially opposed deleting the sec- tion, saying there are too few day care centersalready and a backlog of families on waitinglists. The failure to provide immunity to coun-ties could slow the issuance of licenses andimpede qualified operators from being in thebusiness, she said. Airport noise mitigation When Bill and Audree Duffee moved into their Richfield house near the airport in 1965,around 50 planes a day would fly over theirhome. Now close to 1,500 flights fly every 24hours.Bill Duffee said that the noise from the in- creased traffic and larger-sized airplanes isforcing the couple to consider selling the onlyhouse they have ever owned \u2014 the house where they raised their children. The Duffees spoke in favor of a measure sponsored by Rep. Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington) that would provide some noiserelief for the cities surrounding theMinneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. \"We're not fighting the airport but they are encroaching on our quality of life, \" Audree Duffee told the House Local Government andMetropolitan Affairs Committee on March 8.\"Our neighbors, many who are senior citizens, are scared. They don 't know where to go. \" The committee referred the bill to the House Taxes Committee without recommen-dation. Larson said that in 1989 the Metropolitan Airports Commission and the MetropolitanCouncil began conducting dual studies to de-termine the airport 's capacity needs. In 1996, the Legislature stopped that process and madethe decision to expand the airport at its cur-rent location rather than relocate it. Last year, the governor developed an Air- port Community Stabilization Funding TaskForce to help identify and recommend fund-ing sources to implement noise mitigationmeasures from the expansion. Larson said thebill incorporates many of the task force 's suggestions. The bill (HF3258) would provide several funding mechanisms. It would dedicate sales taxcollections at the airport that exceed16 March 10, 2000#TAXES#RECREATION$12 million and would appropriate $20 million over the next 10 years from the general fund. The bill also would authorize the establish- ment of tax-increment financing districts andallow the Metropolitan Council to providegeneral obligation credit enhancement for citybonds issued to finance noise mitigation ac-tivities. Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville) said she opposes the bill because it fails to recog-nize the significant economic benefits the air-port has on the surrounding communities.Holberg said she is also concerned about dedi-cating all the sales tax revenue collected abovethe $12 million threshold. Minneapolis metal shredder Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) is spon- soring a bill that would require the city ofMinneapolis to issue all the necessary permitsfor the construction of a metal shredder onthe Mississippi River. The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee approved the mea-sure March 3. The bill (HF3708) now goes tothe House floor. The bill would require the city to issue the permits needed, if the project has been issueda special permit to conduct specific businessand an environmental assessment has beencompleted and it registers no negative impact. Jennings said the issue has come before the Legislature several times before. The metalshredder \u2014 known by its brand name, Kondirator \u2014 shreds, compacts, and separates scrap metal. In 1990, the city issued a permit to the American Iron and Supply Company but laterpulled the permit to further study the envi-ronmental impacts. The Legislature passed alaw in 1994 requiring the Minnesota Pollu-tion Control Agency to conduct further envi-ronmental studies of the Kondirator. John Isaacs, the president of American Iron and Supply, said that the company has con-tinued to meet all the requirements put infront of it. Similar metal recyclers exist in other areas in the state, he said, including one in Anoka Countynext to a municipal golf course, within view of aFerris wheel on the county fairgrounds. \"The city has never said they don 't want us, \" Isaacs said. \"They just say jump through the next hoop and the next. We have jumpedthrough every hoop, jumped over every bar,but they continue to put obstacles in our path. \" Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) said that in similar cases where a city issues a permitand then decides later to pull it, the Legisla-ture has always allowed disputes to be decidedby the courts.\"This is moving in and very powerfully tak- ing away a fundamental power of a city, \" Orfield said. \"Understand the principle you 're opening up. It 's a principle of local control. \" Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) disagreed and said that this particular dispute is unique.She said that the company has been at the sameindustrial site for 50 years and the city hasabused its powers by treating American Ironand Supply differently than other companies. New penalty for studs A bill that would add a civil penalty for us- ing metal traction devices, or studs, on snow-mobiles was approved March 7 by the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources PolicyCommittee. Rep. Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine), spon- sor of the bill (HF3555), said the civil penaltywas inadvertently left out of a law that waspassed last year, which required people to pur-chase a sticker for their snowmobiles if theyintend to use studs. That law contains criminal penalties for people who drive a snowmobile with studs onpaved state trails. Westerberg 's bill would es- tablish civil penalties for people who havesnowmobile studs but have not purchased thesticker. For the first offense, the penalty would not exceed $50. The penalty for a second offensewould not exceed $300, and for third and sub-sequent offenses the penalty would not exceed$600. The bill now moves to the House floor. Sales tax break for nonprofits The House Taxes Committee considered a bill March 7 that would exempt nonprofit or-ganizations from paying sales tax when theylease or purchase a motor vehicle. Under the measure (HF3087), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the non-profit would qualify for a sales tax exemptionwhen purchasing a vehicle only if it is orga-nized exclusively for charitable, religious, oreducational purposes. Nonprofit organiza-tions that limit their membership to seniorsor the physically disabled would also qualifyfor the exemption. John Pratt, the executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, said the billwould help organizations stretch their dona-tions further and allow more money to be usedfor the organizations ' intended purposes.John Barker, the chief executive officer of Merrick Companies in St. Paul, agreed withPlatt that the money saved under the proposalcould better be used for the charitable ven-tures. Merrick Companies is a nonprofit organi- zation that provides employment and voca-tional training to adults with developmentaldisabilities. Barker said the organization has about 45 vehicles that it uses to drive nearly 400 peopleto and from work. He said the organizationtries to turn over about 20 percent of thosevehicles every year. Last year, it bought 10 vehicles for approxi- mately $246,000 \u2014 paying over $16,000 in sales tax. Abrams said the Department of Revenue has estimated the cost of the bill to be between$3 million and $5 million a year. No action was taken on the bill, but it will be considered for inclusion in the omnibus taxbill. Vending sales tax exemption When you buy a banana out of a vending machine, part of the price you pay includessales tax. If you walk across the street and buya banana from a convenience store, you do notpay sales tax. The House Taxes Committee heard a bill March 2 that would address that discrepancy. The bill (HF2586),sponsored by Rep.Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), would ex-empt certainvending machinefood tax. No action was taken on the mea-sure, but it will beconsidered furtherfor inclusion in theomnibus tax bill. Erhardt said that all foodand drink itemspurchased throughvending machinesare subject to salestax. The bill wouldexempt milk, bever- ages containing 15 percent or more fruit juice,fresh and canned fruit, vegetables, granola andfruit-filled breakfast bars, yogurt, pudding,cheese, and cottage cheese.

There are some fine distinctions however between taxable andnontaxable food. For example, honey roastednuts are tax exempt but honey covered nutsare not. According to a Department of Revenue es- timate, the cost to the state in exempting theitems proposed in the bill would be about$1.1 million a year. Dennis Bjonfald, the owner of V endstar Company in St. Paul, said the bill is about eq-uity and leveling the playing field for vendingmachine operators. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) raised a concern over whether the savings incurred byvending machine owners would actually bepassed on to consumers. Rep. Tim Wilkin (R-Eagan) proposed an amendment that would exempt water pur-chased from vending machines from sales tax.Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul), whosebusiness distributes bottled water, said thatunder current law only water sold in indi-vidual containers of one-half gallon or moreis exempt. Milbert said the bill would not effect his own company, which only deals in largerbottles of water. But he said he agreed withWilkin 's amendment because people are buy- ing bottled water more and more as a neces-sity because of health concerns. Erhardt persuaded Wilkin to withhold his amendment until the fiscal impact of the mea-sure is determined. Stepping up seat belt enforcement Meghan Cooper, 15, was sitting in the back seat of a car last June when the vehicle col-lided with another car. Cooper, who was notwearing a seat belt, was thrown from the car.She died two days later from head injuries. Meghan 's mother, Kathy Cooper, told the House Transportation Policy CommitteeMarch 9 about her daughter 's death. Cooper is seeking a change in the law that would al-low law enforcement officers to stop a car ifthe passengers in the front seat are not wear-ing seat belts. The bill also would raise the agerequirement for seat belt use in the back seat. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) is sponsor- ing a bill containing such changes. Currently,officers can issue drivers for failure to wear aseat belt only if the car was stopped for a dif-ferent violation. The committee approved the bill (HF857) and sent it to the House Crime PreventionCommittee. Greenfield cited Department of PublicKathy Cooper, Kenyon, testifies March 9 before theHouse Transportation Policy Committee in sup-port of a bill that would require all back-seat pas-sengers under age 18 to buckle up. Current lawrequires only children up to age 11 to be buckledup when in the back seat. Cooper's 15-year-olddaughter, Meghan, wasn't wearing a seat belt inthe back seat when she was killed in a car crash inlast year. Safety statistics that show 2,477 died on Min-nesota roads in the past five years. About 1,200of those were not buckled up. \"There will be a 15 percent increase in use of seat belts, \" Greenfield said. \"That is what has happened in other states. That would save48 lives a year. \" Currently, 17 states have a primary offense law, Greenfield said. That means drivers canbe stopped for not buckling up. Dave Long, a paramedic in Minneapolis, told lawmakers a person can die from a crashwhen a vehicle is traveling just 30 mph.Airbags are designed to save people who wearseat belts and should not be considered an al-ternate to seat belts, he added. \"I've never unbuckled a dead person from a car, \" said Long, who has been a paramedic for 15 years. Greenfield said some legislators might be concerned that the bill would allow police toharass individuals. He refuted that claim,pointing out police can currently stop a carfor noisy mufflers, a cracked windshield, orsigns in the window. Besides the primary offense for people in the front seat, the bill would require all pas-sengers up to age 18 to wear a seat belt in theback seat. Currently, only children 3 to 11 yearsold are required to wear a seat belt in the backseat. Y ounger children must be strapped in achildren 's car seat.Voter approval for light rail The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee approved a billMarch 3 that would require Hennepin Countyvoters to approve the county 's $70 million portion of funding for light-rail transit. By a 15-3 vote, the measure was sent to the House floor. The bill (HF4000), sponsored by Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), would re-quire the county to include a question on itsNovember general election ballot asking vot-ers to approve levying or spending any publicfunds for the Hiawatha Corridor light-railtransit project. If the voters did not approve the county 's annual $4.7 million levy, all unspent state ap-propriations would be canceled as well. Pawlenty said that although it was \"some- what unusual \" to mandate a county referen- dum, the controversy surrounding thelight-rail project warrants such action. \"The governor 's battle cry is, 'Let the people decide. ' This particular issue is so clouded, so controversial that this is the only way to clearthe air, \" Pawlenty said. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) said that in order to keep politics out of transportationproject decisions the Legislature has histori-cally trusted the decision-making of transpor-tation experts. He said that there is no significant distinc- tion between the questions surrounding thelight-rail project and major road projects. \"This is nothing more than a highly politi- cal effort to kill the rail system with no prin-cipal basis, \" Orfield said. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) said that the difference between county road projectsand the light-rail transit project is that roadprojects don 't require the ongoing subsidy that will be required to operate the light-railsystem. Peter McLaughlin, chairman of the Hennepin County board, submitted writtentestimony stating that the county remainscommitted to the light-rail project. He saidthat the board approved its funding portionof the project on a 6-1 bipartisan vote. Demand for input on rail The Department of Transportation would need the Legislature 's permission to spend money on commuter rail projects, under a billsponsored by Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska.) Molnau told the House Transportation Fi- nance Committee on March 6 that her bill(HF3548) would leave decision-making to leg-islators. The committee may consider the billlater for inclusion in a larger transportationmeasure.18 March 10, 2000The state is exploring the possibility of us- ing three train lines for commuter or passen-ger lines. One line would link St. Cloud toMinneapolis, and another line would linkHastings to St. Paul. A third would linkLakeville and Minneapolis. The Transportation Finance Committee, which Molnau chairs, did not approve anyfunding for commuter rail lines in its bond-ing proposal to the House Capital InvestmentCommittee. Al Vogel, director of freights and waterwaysfor the department, told the committee that the department needs the authority to createa standard approach to the cities affected alongthe line. This function would include spending money for planning, design, and engineeringof the line, which would be forbidden by thebill unless the department got direct legisla-tive authorization. The committee rejected a proposed amend- ment that would have allowed the Transpor-tation Department to spend money onplanning and designs but would not have al- lowed spending for any project purchases orconstruction. Molnau said she favors having the local communities make the decisions because theywould be the ones affected by a commuter railline. \"I don 't see a problem if a local group fi- nances this and does it on their own, \" Molnau said. \"It doesn 't say you can 't do it, it says (money) must be appropriated through theLegislature. \" B Y JON FURE Gov. Jesse Ventura 's proposal to let voters decide if the Legislature should switch to a one-chamber, or unicameral, system failed to advance out ofthe House State Government Finance Committee March 9.House divided on one-house plan Unicameral proposal stalls despite efforts to revive it on House floor An attempt to revive the bill on the House floor later that day also failed. The committee voted 5-5 on a motion to send the bill to the House Ways andMeans Committee, which means the billremains in the State Government Fi-nance Committee. The bill (HF159), sponsored by House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), wassent to the committee mainly to considerthe direct costs associated with the leg-islation and the projected financial im-pact if the switch were made. Under the bill, the legislative body would consist of 135 districts. Currentlythere are 67 Senate districts, each ofwhich is divided to make 134 House dis-tricts. The proposed terms would be fouryears, and they would be staggered \u2014 half of the members ' terms would expire every two years. Those changes would take place in 2003, if the voters were to approve theconstitutional amendment. The projected fiscal effects of the bill were calculated using current informa-tion and many assumptions. For example, the House currently has about 270 employees, a two-to-one ra-tio of staff to elected members. Assuming that ratio would stay thesame in a unicameral legislature, and ad- justing for reduced costs in joint legisla-tive commissions and other areas, theswitch to a unicameral legislature is pro-jected to save about $5.9 million in fiscalyear 2003. But several lawmakers refuted those assumptions. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) said Nebraska has five staff per senator in itsunicameral Legislature. And he said theworkload for each lawmaker would in-crease under a unicameral system in Min-nesota, which would cause lawmakers tobecome full-time or to hire more staff. Sviggum responded to those concerns by saying that the politicians often gen-erate the work, which he said is apparentin that more than 4,000 bills have beenintroduced this session. And he argued that the unicameral sys- tem would make it easier for people toparticipate in the lawmaking process,which would especially benefit those whotravel from outside the metropolitan area. While the committee vote effectively stalled the bill 's progress, Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) later that daybrought the issue to the House floor. Kielkucki argued that every House member should have the right to vote onthe matter, and that they should vote to move the bill to the Ways and Means Com-mittee despite the earlier tie vote in theState Government Finance Committee. Of the 11 members on the state govern- ment finance panel, Rep. Bruce Anderson(R-Buffalo T ownship) was absent duringthe committee vote. But several House members pointed out that the bill is not dead, because it can stillbe reconsidered by the State GovernmentFinance Committee, and there are manyother ways to keep the bill alive until theend of the session. \"Why this issue today? \" asked Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), who chairs the HouseCommerce Committee. \"There 's plenty of time to go back to the State GovernmentFinance committee. It 's not about the is- sue, it 's about the process. \" Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview), who chairs the state government finance panel,said he was among the five who voted tomove the bill forward, but he was opposedto Kielkucki 's motion because it would overrule the committee 's earlier vote. Kielkucki responded that he was within his rights to make the motion, but he with-drew it due to the objections that it wouldcircumvent the committee process. Unless the bill is reconsidered, attached as an amendment to another bill, or other-wise revived, the unicameral constitutionalamendment question will not appear onthe 2000 election ballot. Session Weekly 19BY MIKE DELARCOOne of the more serious issues facing both urban and rural school districts in coming years is teacher shortages at elementary, middleschool, and high school levels. Over the next decade, a large number of teacher vacancies are expected to arise due to retirements, student enrollment growth, and policies requiringclass-size reduction.Incentives to teach Lawmakers mull several proposals to fend off projectedteacher shortages and draw qualified people into Minnesotaclassrooms Rep. Michelle Rifenberg (R-La Crescent) also wants to aid districts, especially rural ones,in recruiting and retaining quality teachers.She is sponsoring a bill (HF3206) that wouldestablish loan forgiveness programs for newlylicensed teachers who teach in a school dis-trict within an economic development regionthat serves 100 or fewer pupils per grade. Rifenberg 's bill would appropriate $1 mil- lion in fiscal year 2001 for loan forgivenesspayments to a maximum of 500 eligible ruralteachers.Both situations have made it difficult for many districts to locate money to bring inqualified teachers to plug the gaps. Furthermore, more than 60 percent of school districts with more than 5,000 studentsreported budget cuts this year, according tothe Office of the Legislative Auditor 's report on school district finances. Cuts often lead to a decline in classroom personnel, said Christine Jax, commissionerof the Department of Children, Families andLearning. \"It's perplexing to have the legislative au- ditor say that there is no financial crisis . . .then find out (districts) are making cuts andhaving to lay off teachers, \" Jax said. A bill sponsored by Rep. Philip Krinkie (R- Shoreview) focuses on placing qualified teach-ers who have gained experience outside ofMinnesota in state classrooms as soon aspossible. The bill (HF3840) would allow people who have completed a teacher preparation pro-gram in another state to take a Board of T each-ing exam to receive a one-year alternativeMinnesota teaching license. Similar language to Krinkie 's bill can be found in a bill (HF3231) advocated by thegovernor 's office and sponsored by Seagren that provides for general education, specialSome experts forecast as many as 2 million openings for teachers nationwide. Troubled by the forecasted shortages, many legislators are offering proposals this session tomake teaching an attractive option for gradu-ates and to assure that districts have enough staffto provide students a quality education. A University of Minnesota study conducted between February and July 1999 found thatschool districts that responded to a question-naire identified a total of 3,259 vacancies tobe filled for the 1999-2000 school year. Ofthese vacancies, 1,258 were elementary posi-tions, 1,459 were secondary positions, and 542were special education positions. Some experts attribute the shortages to re- duced respect for teachers, low pay, and littleroom for career advancement as deterrents tochoosing teaching as a profession. \"Because of the strong economy the nation is currently enjoying, workforce opportunitiesfor college graduates abound, \" said Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), chair of the HouseK-12 Education Finance Committee. \"If we don't try to entice them to teach, our schools are not going to have the level of quality inthe classroom they now enjoy. \" Seagren is sponsoring a bill that would es- tablish a loan forgiveness program to assistschool districts in recruiting and retainingexcellent teachers in science, math, industrialtech, and special education. Seagren 's bill (HF3698) would also estab- lish a program for rural areas and create a loanforgiveness account in the state treasury thatwould consist of money appropriated by theLegislature, repayments, and penalties. \"It's important to have incentives to help small, rural schools find teachers in critical subject areas.\" \u2014 Rep. Michelle Rifenberg \"It's important to have incentives to help small, rural schools find teachers in criticalsubject areas, \" Rifenberg said. Both bills were heard March 3 by the House K-12 Education Finance Committee and willbe considered for inclusion in the committee 's omnibus spending measure. Other factors contribute to the teacher shortage, as well. As an example, a special stateallowance for districts that have a high num-ber of veteran teachers, who command highersalaries, is being phased out. To complicate matters, an unexpectedly high number of teachers have chosen to retireover the past two years, taking with them abig chunk of allowance funding.programs, facilities and technology, and edu- cation policy. The measure would allow a teacher who 's been fully licensed to teach in another statebut does not meet all Minnesota requirementsfor a similar teaching license to be granted atemporary Minnesota teaching license for upto three years. That license would be valid toteach subjects and grade levels for which theteacher was licensed in the other state. HF3840 and HF3231 will also be considered for possible inclusion in a K-12 educationfinance omnibus bill. AT ISSUE: EDUCATION # # #20 March 10, 2000AT ISSUE: FAMILY # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGERExperts say that 90 percent of people here and elsewhere in America aspire to lifelong marriage. However, in the same breath they 'll tell you that between 45 and 50 percent of Minnesotans who get married this year will eventually divorce.Making marriage last Couples could choose an option demanding morepreparation going in and making it more difficult to get out difficult to escape in situations of abuse orcoercion. They also said the bill is unneces-sary because current law allows people to pur-sue similar legal actions to strengthen thebonds of marriage. The committee adopted an amendment that clarifies the requirements for pre-maritalcounseling and conditions under which sepa-rations and divorces would be allowed undera covenant marriage. According to the bill, the couple entering into a covenant marriage does so from day one\u2014 the couple must go together to apply for the marriage license, which is where they willdesignate specifically if the marriage will be acovenant marriage or a standard one.with that, the instructor would have to sign a statement verifying that the parties took therequired education classes. The pre-marital education program would have to include the following: a pre-maritalinventory, discussions of the serious nature ofmarriage and that marriage is a commitmentfor life, instruction on communication skillsand conflict management, and discussions ofthe obligation to seek marital counselingshould difficulties in the relationship arise. If counseling during the marriage did not work, the couple could pursue divorce afterliving separately without reconciliation fortwo years. Also, nothing would prohibit theparties from obtaining a legal separation. In addition, under the covenant marriage bill, parties could be granted a divorce with-out having to wait two years if either spousehas committed adultery, abuse, or abandon-ment or has been convicted of a felony. Doherty testified that in situations where these conditions do not exist, it 's important to give people time to think about the mar-riage and whatever problems exist. \"This gives people a cooling off period, \" he said. The bill also would specifically prescribe that a covenant marriage is a union enteredinto by one man and one woman, precludingany same-sex unions. Currently married couples could pay an extra fee to change their standard marriagestatus to a covenant marriage if they so de-sire. Married couples would only have to un-dergo six hours of \"pre-marital \" education. Among the critics of the bill was Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), who saidcouples are already free to obtain a pre-nup-tial agreement or otherwise safeguard them-selves legally. Furthermore, he said, the billwould force people to stay in situations theyought to escape. \"We are not binding them to this, they are choosing to bind themselves to this, \" Doherty said. \"The state is just asking them to make good on their promise. \" Kathleen Murphy from the National Orga- nization for Women said that because mar-riage is technically a legal agreement, attorneyscan draw up a number of other agreements todeal with the covenant marriage issues. \"A marital commitment between two people cannot be protected by the state, \" Murphy said. Marriage counselors report that most of their clients wish they had taken more time towork things out with their spouse when themarriage began to break apart. In fact, said William Doherty, director of marriage and family counseling at the Uni-versity of Minnesota, 66 percent of people whodivorce say they wish they had tried to workthings out. Doherty and other leaders, including Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson), think somethingneeds to be done to strengthen and add sta-bility to the institution of marriage. They saythat couples need to be more deliberate aboutmarriage and make sure they are prepared forthe commitment. \"It is a step in the direction of a cultural shift that I think the culture is ready for and that most Minnesotans will accept. Most people aspire to a permanent, lifelong union. This is a responsible thing for people to agree on in advance.\" \u2014 William Doherty, University of Minnesota Harder is sponsoring a measure that would encourage couples to opt into a \"covenant marriage \" in lieu of a standard marriage. The House Judiciary Finance Committee sent thebill (HF1571) without a recommendation tothe House Ways and Means Committee onMarch 7. \"It is a step in the direction of a cultural shift that I think the culture is ready for and that mostMinnesotans will accept, \" Doherty told mem- bers of the committee. \"Most people aspire to a permanent, lifelong union. This is a responsiblething for people to agree on in advance. \" However, critics of the bill said it would cre- ate ambiguities and would make marriage tooHarder emphasized that couples could choose a covenant marriage. It is not some-thing that would be mandatory. The filing fees, under the current version of the bill, would be the same for a standardor covenant marriage. Then, before the couple could be married, they would have to undergo at least 12 hours of pre-marital education from one of the following: alicensed or ordained minister, a person autho-rized to solemnize marriage under law, or a li-censed marriage and family therapist. The husband and wife would have to indi- vidually sign an official declaration that theyintend to enter a covenant marriage. AlongSession Weekly 21BY JON FUREHunting and fishing license fees would see across-the-board increases, under a bill approved March 6 by the House Environment and NaturalResources Finance Committee. Revenue from licenses, and from fines that are generated by enforcement of state laws, goes into the state 's game and fish fund. That fund also contains money from the federal government, which is allotted according to the size of the stateand the number of people who buy hunting and fishing licenses.Angling for a fee hike The need to protect and enhance resources is driving aneffort to increase prices for fishing and hunting licenses Fiscal analysts project that the game and fish fund will face a deficit in fiscal year 2003 be-cause revenues are not increasing at the samerate as expenses. The bill (HF3046), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), chair of the commit-tee, is one proposal that would help resolvethat problem. Holsten said he and other committee mem- bers are concerned about the state 's ability to take care of its natural resources on a long-term basis. \"We want to do what we can to make sure that the base needs in environment, parks,trails, and habitat are maintained at a level thatwe expect and demand, \" Holsten said. Without the proposed fee increases, revenue to the game and fish fund is projected to re-main constant, while costs of the relatedprojects are increasing. Those projects include improving water quality in lakes, rivers, and streams; stockingfish and enhancing aquatic vegetation; andincreasing public water access. Along with the license fee increases, Holsten 's proposal would include additional revenue from the state 's general fund. Holsten said that only makes sense because thoseprojects provide a general benefit to all stateresidents, not just to those who hunt and fish. The game and fish fund pays for some of the Department of Natural Resources ' admin- istrative costs. The bill would effectively re-place part of the game and fish fund 's allocation to the administrative costs with thegeneral fund appropriation. That would allowmore money from the game and fish fund tocrease said it would be hard to justify in light of the state 's budget surplus. That prompted Gov. Jesse V entura to veto nearly $1.6 million from the DNR 's budget. In his veto message, he wrote, \"My support for general fund increases in these activitieswas contingent upon passage of legislationincreasing the (license) fees. \" While the state 's economic growth has caused the general fund revenue to increasein recent years, that has not affected the gameand fish fund because of its reliance on rev-enue from licenses. Hunting and fishing license fees were in- creased in 1991, and fishing license fees wereagain increased in 1997. In 1998, game and fish fund revenues were about $56 million. The bill now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Holsten has proposed two other bills that would help divert more money to maintain-ing the state 's natural resources. One bill (HF1092) would allocate a portion of revenue from lottery ticket sales to the game and fish fund. That bill was heard Feb. 18 by the House Taxes Committee and could be in-cluded in this year 's omnibus tax bill. Another bill (HF3426) would put a consti-AT ISSUE: GAME & FISH # # # Proposed fee increases (current fees in parentheses)pay for projects that improve the state 's natu- ral resources. Under Holsten 's proposal, $2 of revenue from the fee increase would be matched by $1 fromthe general fund. The fee increases are projectedto raise about $3.1 million in revenue for the2002-03 biennium, and the general fund matchwould be slightly more than $1.5 million. The bill also would include a $500,000 gen- eral fund appropriation to pay for walleyestocking.

The same proposal had been part of the environment finance panel 's 1999 omnibus bill, but the House voted to remove the licensefee increases. When the proposal was debatedon the House floor, opponents of the fee in-tutional amendment before voters in the 2000 election. The amendment would divert a smallportion of sales tax revenue to pay for variousenvironmental improvements, including fishand wildlife resource enhancement and im-provement. That bill has not yet been heard in the House. 22 March 10, 2000HISTORY # # # BY DAVID MAEDAMinnesota faces frequent criticism for the taxes it imposes on its residents. And when each visit to a merchant 's counter requires a person to plop down six-and-a-half pennies for every dollar 's worth of goods, it 's not hard to imagine why the criticism exists.Tax was a hard sell Lawmakers battled for more than 30 years before makingMinnesota one of the last states to institute the sales tax But consider this: Minnesota was one of the last states to institute a sales tax, and the salestax did not become law until the late 1960s. Political conflict over economic and tax issues stood in the way of a statewide sales tax for morethan 30 years \u2014 from the early days of the Great Depression until the day it became law. The first states to consider implementing a sales tax did so during the Great Depression be-cause they were struggling to provide basicservices. As pressure grew from counties, cities, and towns to transfer property tax revenue to thelocal level, states looked for alternative fund-ing sources. In 1932, Mississippi became thefirst state to approve a sales tax, settling on a2 percent tax rate. The following year nine states followed suit, including California, Illinois, and Michigan.By the end of World War II, 23 states had someform of sales tax in place. Minnesota lawmak-ers discussed, debated, and rejected the newform of revenue repeatedly throughout thattime, as it seemed public sentiment wasstrongly against the new form of taxation. To help alleviate property tax rates, the 1935 Legislature passed a measure creating a state salestax but Gov. Floyd Olson vetoed the bill. Olson,like other critics of sales taxes, argued the tax wasregressive, meaning that all people regardless oftheir income paid the same percentage. There-fore those with lower incomes paid proportion-ately more than those with higher incomes. From 1935 to 1945, each legislative session provided some reduction in the state 's property tax rates along with discussion of a possible statesales tax. It was continually evident as govern-ment services continued to expand that alterna-tive sources of revenue were strongly needed.Then came the booming wartime and post-wareconomy, which temporarily alleviated the need to search for new sources of revenue. But by themid-1950s debate again focused on reforms tothe state 's tax system. In 1959, Gov. Orville Freeman, a DFLer, clashed with Republican lawmakers over thedirection Minnesota government should takein reforming its tax structure. To addressgrowing deficits, Freeman proposed increas-ing income taxes and establishing the state 's first automatic withholding of taxes. The latter proposal was made to reduce the number of people guilty of tax evasion, and itpromised the state additional revenue upfront. The federal government had begun au-tomatic withholding of federal income taxesin 1943 and had actually established themethod of automatic withholding with thecreation of the Social Security system in 1937. Many of the Republican legislators opposed both of Freeman 's proposals, instead favoringa creation of a sales tax. The session (and sub- sequent special session) lasted a record sixmonths with no resolution to the tax debate. In 1967, Minnesota was enjoying a relatively strong economy, including a $130 million sur-plus. The major tax issue of that year 's session again focused on finding a method to reduceproperty tax rates, which by that time pro-vided 48 percent of all state and local revenue. Several lawmakers said Minnesota 's high property taxes were driving businesses out ofthe state. As talk focused on the creation of asales tax, Gov. Harold LeVander said he wouldveto any bill that contained a sales tax provi-sion and did not also contain a clause for areferendum on the issue. But members of LeVander 's own Republican party, which had a majority in both the Houseand Senate, disregarded the governor 's warning and passed a measure creating a 3 percent salestax without a referendum provision. The 1967 Property Tax Reform and Relief Act reduced local real estate taxes by 35 percent. Thebill dedicated one-fourth of the revenue gener-ated by the sales tax to local units of governmentand school districts. It exempted food preparedat home, clothing, gasoline, prescription drugsand health aids, as well as most services, hoteland motel rooms, and utilities such as gas, elec-tricity, water, and local telephone calls from thenew sales tax. True to his word, the governor vetoed the bill. The House then voted to override thegovernor 's veto. But the Senate, despite a ma- jority vote, didn 't have the necessary two- thirds majority required for a veto override. LeVander called a special session during which both the House and Senate re-passed the tax billcontaining the 3 percent state sales tax. LeVanderagain vetoed the bill. But this time both theHouse and Senate voted to override the veto. It was the first time in state history that a governor 's own party voted twice to overturn his veto. Thus, Minnesota became the 44th stateto have a sales tax. Only five states currently donot have a state sales tax. They are Alaska, Dela-ware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. In 1971, the Minnesota sales tax rate was increased from 3 to 4 percent. In 1981, it wasraised to 5 percent, and two years later it in-creased to 6 percent. In 1991, the Legislature, facing a serious budget deficit, agreed to raise the rate to itscurrent 6.5 percent. Gov. Harold LeVander vetoed a 1967 bill calling fora 3 percent sales tax, but the Legislature, led bymembers of his own party, voted to override theveto.

ReflectionsU.S. presidential candidates have con- ducted some intensive national politicalcampaigning during the past year. So muchthis past week, one would think today thatcampaigning is now completed and weknow who will be the next president. But the political process is not that simple, especially in a race for public officeat the highest level. Rather, it is a complexsystem that begins, not so much in NewHampshire and Iowa, but in urban andrural areas like the neighborhoods andcommunities where Minnesotans live. Here is the first opportunity for state- wide citizens to get involved in the politi-cal process. This week, on \"Super Tuesday \" March 7, 16 states across the country held 11 prima-ries and five caucuses to elect delegates whowill nominate a presidential candidate orendorse individuals seeking state offices.Minnesota is one of the five states that helda precinct caucus on this date. The precinct caucus gives the average citizen an opportunity to meet with othersto elect political party delegates to serve atcounty and district conventions. Thesegrass roots participants also present issuesthey think will be significant in construct- ing a statewide party platform. If all of Minnesota 's eligible voters went to a caucus where a candidate is nominatedfor president or endorsed to run for stateor federal office, an average of 849 peoplewould show up for each precinct caucusacross the state. But only about 3 percentof the state 's eligible voters get involved this early in the process. Based on these figures, an average of 26 citizens would go to a caucus at one of4,068 election precincts across the state.But, in reality, caucus participant totalsrange from two to 300 individuals. Each political party will hold a separate caucus in a given precinct and site to electdelegates who will ultimately make final de-cisions and endorsements at the party 's state convention. Within state guidelines, political parties set their own rules for conducting business.By March 12 in the state, four political par-ties conducted precinct caucuses \u2014 the Constitution, Democratic-Farmer-Labor,Independence, and Republican parties. All elected delegates to serve at a state conven-tion to nominate their leaders. But caucuses conduct business in a very different manner. Some caucuses are en-trenched with single-issue participants whoare quite successful in getting their voicesheard over the requests of others. Theycome prepared with organized plans forelecting a majority of delegates. Others may go through an odd process called a \"walking sub-caucus. \" In order to have many delegates support their causes, walking sub-caucus partici-pants are given time to join together toform a united bloc of voters. Here theyshow strength in numbers to be assuredthat the delegates elected will support theirbeliefs. Where else but in America 's backyard can \"human rights for all \" individuals, anti-gay marriage groups, \"fill in the wetlands \" folks, and \"save the environment \" rank and file come together to elect delegates to ensurethat their voices will be heard? \u2014L ECLAIR G.

I 'm tired of hearing so many problems with our (Department of Natural Resources). \"Creating a new stream Plan would devote a share of sales-tax revenue to environmental projects Grant was one of about a dozen people who testified before the House Environment andNatural Resources Policy Committee March 14in favor of a bill that seeks a new stream of per-manent revenue for the environment. The bill (HF3426), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would place a consti-tutional amendment on the November ballotasking voters whether three-sixteenths of onepercent of the state 's 6.5 percent sales tax should be dedicated to various natural re-sources purposes. The bill specifically states that the funds could not be used as a substitute for any tra-ditional sources of funding. The committee approved the bill and re- ferred it to the House Rules Committee. The measure comes in the midst of criticism by members of the House environment com-mittees that the governor did not recommendadequate funding for environmental projects.Furthermore, some argue that there is notenough money to address all the infrastructureneeds in state parks. Many environment and natural resources programs are funded solely by hunting andfishing license fees and could face a shortfallin coming years. For example, improving water quality, stocking fish and enhancing aquatic vegeta-tion, and increasing public water access are allpaid for out of the game and fish fund. Thoughsome federal dollars (25 percent) support thefund, the rest comes from various fishing andhunting license fees. The Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committee approved a separate billto increase license fees March 6. However, of- ficials say the Legislature needs to develop amore long-term funding plan to handle needsas they evolve. Grant agreed. He said the Legislature shouldn 't wait for the governor to make natural resources a priority andthat the people of Min-nesota would stand be-hind that decision. \"With our lack of leadership at the top, wehave an opportunity totake control of this forthe people of Minne-sota, \" Grant said. \"We can't expect a lot of help (from the governor),but we can from you. \" Holsten 's constitu- tional amendment pro-posal would raise about$112 If the amend-ment passes, thatmoney would bedivided as follows: 45 percent of proceeds (about$50 million) wouldgo to the game andfish fund foractivities thatimprove, enhance, or protect game andfish resources; 25 percent ($28 million) would be dedi-cated to the natural resources fund for state parks and trails; 25 percent of the revenue would be deposited in the natural resources fundfor metropolitan parks and trail grants; 3 percent ($3.36 million) would go to the natural resources fund for local trailgrants; and 2 percent ($2.24 million) would be deposited in the natural resources fund for theMinnesota Zoo, the Como Park Zoo andConservatory, and the Duluth Zoo. Judy Erickson, government relations di- rector for the Parks and Trails Council, saidthere were 8.6 million visitors to state parksin 1999. Though it 's a well-used system that does generate revenue for the Department ofNatural Resources, a number of facilities areset to close statewide because there 's not enough money to keep them going. Holsten 's proposal would go a long way to improve resource management and park de-velopment, Erickson said. Nancy Jobe, from the Minnesota Outdoor Heritage Alliance, andher daughter AlyssaKerber, 12, both of EdenPrairie, testified that thebill is a good way to ad-dress the long-termfunding concerns fornatural resources. Kerber said the Legis- needs takecare of the problemnow to protect naturalresources for futuregenerations to enjoy. \"I think this bill is ab- solutely essential toprotect them, \" said Kerber. \"Otherwise, I'm going to have to come back here in 30years and fix it and Iwouldn 't enjoy that. \" Rep. T om Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) said hewas concerned that thenumber of environ-mental bills would di-minish support for the constitutional amendment proposal. He askedmany of the supporters if they would choosethe sales-tax proposal over major initiatives Bud Grant testifies March 14 in front of the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources Policy Com-mittee in support of a bill that would place a con-stitutional amendment on the November ballot todedicate a portion of sales tax receipts to naturalresources purposes.4 March 17, 2000IT'SAFACT such as the so-called \"Legacy 2000 \" environ- mental bill or a bill calling for increases in fish-ing and hunting license fees. He also said Holsten 's sales-tax proposal isn't the right solution to the funding crunch. \"We should be taking the surplus dollars and doing the right thing by the environment, \" Osthoff said. Earlier this session, the House Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committeerecommended spending $195 million in en-vironment-related capital projects, in a mea-sure known as \"Legacy 2000. \" V entura had suggested spending $125 million. Among criticisms of V entura 's bonding plan was the fact that it didn 't take advantage of federal funds available if matched with statefunds. For instance, the state will lose fundsfor the Conservation Resource EnhancementProgram, to restore land and habitat along theMinnesota River, if it doesn 't match them by September 2002. The environment bonding recommenda- tions await action by the House Capital In-vestment Committee. Several members of the environment policy committee said they wanted to keep Holsten 's measure alive, despite their concerns. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) said she was concerned about the wording ofthe actual question to be placed on the ballot.She also said she 's concerned that creating the dedicated revenue could cause future Legisla-tures to decrease traditional funding for natu-ral resources because those programs aregetting funds this way. She used the Environmental Trust Fund as an example. The fund, established in 1988, receives 40 percent of the state 's lottery proceeds for en- vironmental projects. Since the fund was established, general fund spending for the environment has remainedsteady or increased slightly. Nevertheless, both Jobe and Grant said Minnesotans would support the amendment. \"If we can get this constitutional amend- ment on the ballot, I guarantee it 'll pass, \" Grant said. If the amendment makes it onto the No- vember ballot, it would require a majority ofall the people voting in the election. Thosewho leave the question blank on the ballotwould be counted as \"no\" votes. At the root of the debate over whether a unicameral system is better than a bi-cameral system for Minnesota is the no-tion that reform is needed in the legislativeprocess. Proponents of a unicameral model say the current system is too difficult for theaverage citizen to understand. They alsoargue that the process allows conferencecommittees too much power. But those who support the current sys- tem say the complexity is necessary be-cause bills should be scrutinized frommany different points of view, and itshould not be easy to pass new laws. Such debates over reforming the legis- lative process are hardly new. Back in 1909 a man named Lynn Haines produced a scathing report on theactivities of that year 's House and Senate. Haines, who was described in the fore-word to the report as \"a distinguished American scholar, \" later became the edi- tor of \"Searchlight on Congress, \" a publi- cation of the National Voters ' League. In the report, Haines alleged that the major decisions made by the 1909 Legis-lature were consistently made in the bestinterests of the major corporations andnot the people of the state. \"It impressed me powerfully to witness how a Legislature could manifest so littleof statesmanship, so woeful a lack of pa-triotic plan and purpose, \" Haines wrote. He said one of the \"pernicious evils in Minnesota lawmaking \" was the influence of what was known as \"log-rolling. \" The term applied to the process of tradingvotes in order to get a measure passed. \"If a bill were introduced to bring Heaven to Minnesota and keep it here, themeasure could hardly pass our state Leg-No 'plan or purpose' 1909 report decried the troubles of the Legislature islature unless the author were willing tosecure votes through log-rolling, \" Haines wrote. \"He would have to support the pet measure of each of a majority of col-leagues before he could obtain their sup-port for his bill. \" T o alleviate the dependence on log-roll- ing, Haines proposed that the state con-sider adopting an initiative andreferendum system allowing voters to ini-tiate and pass legislation. \"With the power of veto vested in the people, individuals or interests wouldrarely take the trouble to bribe or coercea Legislature into the enactment of an in-iquitous law, \" he said. Proposed constitutional amendments to provide initiative and referendumfailed at the polls in 1914 and 1916. While the merits of initiative and ref- erendum are still being debated by today 's Legislature, there have been substantialrule changes in the process since 1909.One of the more significant is the require-ment that a public record be kept of eachcommittee hearing. Back in 1909 there was no such require- ment, and Haines wrote of the difficultyin ascertaining not only what went on inhearings but how members actually votedon the bills before the committee. T oday,minutes are kept and each hearing isaudio-taped. Both are available to thepublic. Despite Haines ' severe criticism of the 1909 Legislature, he didn 't see the entire membership as being corrupt. \"Let it be understood that the last Leg- islature contained some of the ablest andmost conscientious citizens of the state, \" he wrote. (D. M AEDA )Correction A story in the March 10 issue of Session Weekly incor- rectly stated that an abortion consent measure would es-tablish civil penalties against a woman when an abortionis performed without meeting the consent requirements. The bill (HF178) actually would provide that a woman or the parents of a minor could pursue a civil suit against adoctor who performed an abortion without meeting theconsent requirements. We regret the error.\"It impressed me powerfully to witness how a Legislature could manifest so little of statesmanship, so woeful a lack of patriotic plan and purpose.\" \u2014Lynn HainesSession Weekly 5MARCH 9 - 16, 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #AGRICULTURE#BONDING Omnibus spending bill The House Agriculture and Rural Develop- ment Finance Committee approved an omni-bus bill that would provide both supplementaland new funding for farm programs andresearch. The bill (HF3844), sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), would provide supplemen-tal funding for the state 's ethanol producer payment program, the Farm Advocates pro-gram, state meat inspection, and farm busi-ness planning activities. An increase in maximum state participation in beginning farmer, restructured loan, seller-sponsored loan, and agricultural improve-ment loan programs would also occur underNess ' bill, which emerged from the commit- tee March 14. Furthermore, changes to rules regarding eligibility in the restructured loan and live-stock expansion loan programs are addressedin the bill. New funding would be provided for an agro-forestry loan program and run-off pol-lution research. The agro-forestry loan pro-gram would help finance the production ofshort-rotation wood crops in Minnesota. The omnibus bill would increase general fund spending on agriculture by $4.9 millionin fiscal year 2001. That includes an appro-priation of $135,000 to the commissioner ofthe Department of Agriculture for a grant todevelop farm business software to comple-ment existing farm management tools. Eligibility caps for some Rural Finance Au- thority programs would be increased underthe bill, and an increase in Agriculture Chemi-cal Response and Reimbursement Accountfunding would be provided for farm siteswhere clean-up activities are particularly ex-pensive. The bill also includes a resolution asking the state of Iowa to accelerate its program of swinepseudorabies control and eradication. The House Ways and Means Committee later approved the bill and rolled it into a largerfunding measure, which now heads to theHouse floor.Bonding bill unveiled The House Capital Investment Committee is considering a bonding bill that would spendroughly the same amount as Gov. JesseVentura 's capital budget plan. But the two pro- posals have several differences in terms ofspending priorities. The committee discussed the bill (HF4078) March 16, and it was scheduled for a vote thatevening (after this edition of Session Weekly went to press). Overall, the bill would spend nearly $526 million, which in-cludes $32 million Ventura 's in user-fi-nanced bonds, and$27 million from the Trunk Highway Fund. One of the governor 's top priorities is to spend $58 million for a new building for theBureau of Criminal Apprehension. But the billwould spend only $28 million to build a labo-ratory facility. Knoblach, committee chair and sponsor ofCapital (12 DFL) and ap- proves capital appropria-tions for the state; setspolicy related to the sale ofbonds, debt management,and the and formin which capitalrequests are state bondproceeds for capitalprojects that meet a pub-lic purpose and for publicfacilities owned by publicentities, and monitors theconstruction of all publicimprovements.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILEthe bill, said the governor 's recommendation would nearly triple the size of the BCA facil-ity, on top of a recent project for a satelliteoffice in Bemidji. The lab facility is the great-est need, Knoblach said, and the House planwould accommodate that need. The two proposals also differ in projects for higher education. Both plans allocate $30 mil-lion for maintenance projects throughout theMinnesota State Colleges and Universitiessystem. Knoblach 's plan specifies that that money would pay for several projects that were ve-toed by V entura last year, including a boilersystem for Winona State University, demoli-tion of old homes on property owned byMoorehead State University, and the comple-tion of a heating and air conditioning projectat the Hutchinson campus of RidgewaterCollege. Overall spending for higher education would be $169.9 million under Knoblach 's bill and $118.3 million under the governor 's plan. Included in the House bill is $2 million forplanning costs to replace the Art Building atthe University of Minnesota, which receivedno funding under the governor 's plan. The House plan would not fund the St. Paul Mi-crobial and Plant Genomics building at theU of M. For K-12 spending, Knoblach 's bill would spend nearly $50 million compared to thegovernor 's $34.1 million. The bill would spend slightly less than the governor 's $125 million recommended for the Department of Natural Resources and otherenvironment provisions. But the bill wouldspend more for the Wastewater InfrastructureFund through the Department of Trade andEconomic Development, which improves theenvironment by helping communities up-grade failing sewer systems. The bill also would spend $44 million for bridges throughout the state. Knoblach urged his colleagues to ask whether the bill is good for the entire state,not necessarily for their specific districts. \"I would hope that we can get away from the philosophy that if you have a project fromyour district you 'll vote for the bill, but if there 's not a project from your district you won't vote for the bill, \" Knoblach said.6 March 17, 2000GOPHER CHECKOFF #CRIME #CHILDREN#BUSINESS Rep. Bob Milbert, left, explains his proposed \"gopher checkoff,\" which would allow tax- payers who file electronically to designate up to 5 percent of their total tax liability tobe spent on a program or a category of programs of their choice. He spoke during aMarch 15 news conference. Also attending the news conference were Reps. Henry Kalisand Kris Hasskamp.Regulating funeral solicitation A bill that would regulate solicitation and sale of funeral goods and services stalled incommittee because of financial concernsMarch 15, but a separate provision to satisfythose concerns may keep it alive. The bill (HF2713), sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would prohibit fu-neral providers from soliciting business at ahospital, grave site, or nursing home \u2014 par- ticularly when a person 's impending death is apparent \u2014 when there has been no specific request from the individual. The bill would allow certain solicitations if the person who is dying made a specific re-quest ahead of time. In addition, those solici-tations would require that providers follow setguidelines. The bill had been approved by the House Health and Human Services Policy Commit-tee, but late concerns about possible costs as-sociated with regulating the solicitation andsale of funeral goods and services had put itsfuture this session in doubt. The House Ways and Means Committee then included language to address the bill 's financial impact in the health and human ser-vices omnibus measure (HF2699) March 15.Though the Health and Human ServicesFinance Committee did not approve Rest 's bill, including the financial matter in the other billgives her proposal new life. The amendment to the health and human services omnibus bill would appropriate$90,000 in fiscal year 2001 for the purpose ofresponding to public complaints about funeralgoods and services solicitation. The amendment also would require that a report be made by Jan. 15, 2001, to the chairsof the Senate Health and Family Security Bud-get Division and the House Health and Hu-man Services Finance Committee regardingwhether there is a need for additionalfunding. The House Ways and Means Committee sent the funding plan to the House floor. Focussing on children Two former elected officials joined a busi- ness executive to discuss family and childrenissues before a House committee March 15. Former Republican state legislator Allen Quist along with former Democratic MinneapolisMayor Don Fraser and General Mills executiveDavid Nasby spoke to the House Family andEarly Childhood Education Finance Commit-tee about the need to invest in children.\"We must recognize Minnesota 's greatest natural resource, our children, \" Nasby said. Though the trio is an unlikely political mix, they stood together behind the principle thatpublic policy should promote strong, support-ive families and minimize trends and influ-ences leading to family break-ups. Nasby told the committee that General Mills corporate headquarters added a child day carecenter, and employees have reacted positively. \"A return will come through employee loy- alty and satisfaction, \" Nasby said. The federal Head Start program is helping children learn, but not enough children aregaining these early skills, he said. \"For too many of Minnesota 's new genera- tion, there has been no start, \" he said. Fraser agreed, saying many children are fall- ing behind. \"When kids come into school and don 't know their last name . . . you wonder how theyare going to catch up, \" Fraser said. Many chil- dren do not recognize letters nor can theycount to 10, he added. Quist said public policy on early child-care issues should promote strong families. \"We need to be about shaping policy for children that is mostly non-ideological andnon-political, \" Quist said. Not all education issues, such as child care wages, can be solved by market forces, thespeakers agreed. \"I do think there is a case for subsidized day care, \" Quist said. Quist cited several recent studies, saying that 40 percent of teen-age women become preg-nant by age 20, and current sex education pro-grams have been unsuccessful in stopping unwanted pregnancies. Quist said the onlyprograms that have curtailed teen-age preg-nancy are abstinence-only methods. \"The bottom line is we need something that is effective, something that will work, \" Quist said. He quoted another study that said a home without a father is the leading factor for teen-age pregnancy, suicide, crime, and poverty. Felony DWI heads to floor A bill that would make a fourth DWI con- viction in 10 years a felony is heading to theHouse floor. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) is spon- soring the bill (HF2745), which would pro-vide for felony charges on a fourth drunkendriving violation in a 10-year span. The House Ways and Means Committee on March 15 rolled it into a larger bill (HF2699). Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) offered an amendment to require the Department ofCorrections to study the use of private servicesto satisfy the mandatory incarceration sen-tences provided by the bill. The committeeadopted the amendment. Currently, the bill calls for a minimum sen- tence of five to seven years for a fourth DWIconviction in 10 years. The bill would allowjudges to depart from mandatory sentencesand impose jail time and other conditions. Stanek approved of the lone amendment to the bill.Session Weekly 7\"It fits with the language I already had be- fore, \" he said. However, the Senate version does not con- tain the minimum sentences in the House bill.The Senate version has no mandated mini-mum sentences, instead giving judges the dis-cretion to determine the sentence for multipleoffenders. Stanek said judges have alreadyshown they will not send repeat offenders toprison. \"History tells us that is not going to hap- pen,\" he said. \"Am I supposed to believe that a person who picks up a fourth DWI is going tojail?\" Father Andrew Cozzens, right , and Lilly Riordan who established the program for thedrop-off of unwanted newborns in DakotaCounty testified March 10 before the HouseCrime Prevention Committee for a bill thatwould create a statewide program. Under thebill, the mother would not face prosecutionif the unwanted newborn is dropped off at ahospital.NEWBORN DROP-OFFReady for release? A bill that would establish a task force to study the state 's policies for releasing people from prisons failed to advance out of theHouse Governmental Operations and V eter-ans Affairs Policy Committee March 10. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) said he and other lawmakers learned about a poten-tial problem with those policies during a re-cent tour of state prisons. When inmates have mental illness or are separated from the general prison populationdue to behavior problems, sometimes they arereleased at the end of their sentence with littleor no effort to reintegrate them to the generalpopulation, Paymar said. The bill (HF3984), sponsored by Paymar, would set up a task force to study and plan fora more gradual release program, so that in-mates would not be released into societystraight from solitary confinement. The proposed task force would include four legislators, three people with expertise in men-tal health issues, and representatives of theDepartment of Corrections and the ombuds-man for corrections. But several committee members said such a task force could be organized within theDepartment of Corrections. The motion to approve the bill failed on a 9-9 vote, so the bill remains in thatcommittee. Penalties for unsecured trailers Trailers would be included in criminal ve- hicular homicide provisions, under a billheading to the House floor. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is spon- soring a bill (HF2610) that would providecriminal charges for a person whose trailercauses a fatality. The House Crime PreventionCommittee approved the measure March 10and sent it to the floor. Nancy Sorgatz told the committee that her granddaughter died in an accident nearWaseca in 1997. A trailer broke free from an oncoming truck and struck hergranddaughter 's vehicle. Two people were killed. The driver of the truck had previouslybeen warned about the chains connecting histruck to the trailer, Sorgatz said. \"Don't anyone ever say this was an accident, \" Sorgatz said. \"It takes eight seconds to attach a safety chain, and it saves lives. \" The bill says a driver would be negligent if the driver knows or has reason to know thetrailer could cause injury or death. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) spoke in fa- vor of the bill. He offered an amendment thatclarified what qualifies as a trailer, saying hedoes not want any loopholes created in the bill.The committee approved the amendment. As a result, anything pulled behind a vehicle is considered a trailer, be it a trailer hauling aboat, a recreational vehicle, a flatbed trailer,or a larger cargo hauler. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) was con- cerned that the bill would make someone neg-ligent if the chain accidentally fell off. Thecommittee amended the bill to clarify that aperson is only negligent if he or she hadknowledge or a reason to believe the connec-tion between the trailer and vehicle would fail.Funding bill advances A measure that would appropriate more than $4 million for new programs and emer-gency funding was approved March 14 by theHouse Judiciary Finance Committee. T o make way for that spending and the spending in a separate crime package, thecommittee decided to cut funding for someprograms and transfer $5.7 million from aspecial revenue fund. \"We don 't have the money that the crimi- nal justice system needs and the criminal jus-tice system deserves, \" said Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), committee chair. The bill (HF3981), sponsored by Broecker, includes $3.8 million in funding for state di-saster payments resulting from floods and tor-nadoes in 1998 and 1999. It also includes $79,000 for extraordinary court costs for Carlton County, $26,000 for acrosswalk awareness and safety program, and$250,000 to establish a Ramsey County do-mestic abuse pilot project. But the real significance of the bill may be what it doesn 't fund. The bill includes a one-time cut of $234,000 in state civil legal services funding, a base cutof $25,000 from the Ombudsman for CrimeVictims, and a $5 million reduction in juve-nile treatment grants. The measure also would eliminate the of- fice of Ombudsman for Corrections, an inde-pendent agency established in 1972 toinvestigate complaints by staff, inmates, andothers against the Department of Corrections,correctional facilities, or the Board of Pardons. In addition, the committee voted to trans- fer a surplus in the special revenue fund fromthe money raised by the Auto Theft Preven-tion Board to the general fund so the com-mittee could hit its spending targets. For fiscal year 2001, there will be approxi- mately $5.7 million surplus from the theft pre-vention board. The board collects a surchargeon all auto insurance policies to distribute tolaw enforcement in the form of block grantsto implement auto theft prevention programs. State law limits the amount the board can spend each year. Several committee membersobjected to using the funds for other purposes,which are specifically collected for auto theftprevention. The House Ways and Means Committee later approved the measure and included it ina larger spending bill that now heads to theHouse floor.8 March 17, 2000#EDUCATION#DEVELOPMENT Omnibus measure advances Workforce development is a major focus of an omnibus finance package approved March13 by the House Jobs and Economic Devel-opment Finance Committee. The bill (HF4111), sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), would establish a taskforce responsible for reviewing recommenda-tions of the governor 's mini-cabinet on workforce development. The 20-member taskforce would develop and propose a cohesiveworkforce development strategy for the state andprepare recommendations for the 2001 session. Also included in the bill are a couple of one- time appropriations to address underemploy-ment and training issues. The Department of Trade and Economic Development would receive $750,000 forgrants to local or regional economic develop-ment agencies to identify geographic areaswhere the local workforce has skills or educa-tion that is not being used. The bill also would appropriate $50,000 to the Department of Administration for a studyto develop a 10-year plan to locate workforcecenters on the campuses in the MinnesotaState Colleges and Universities system. The growing technology economy is also addressed in the bill. It would appropriate $1.5million for grants to local governments to ex-pand Internet access in rural Minnesota. An-other $200,000 would go to MinnesotaT echnology, Inc. for the e-Business Institute,which would provide assistance to rural busi-nesses to expand their use of technology. T o provide funding for measures in the bill, the committee proposed a transfer of somemoney, elimination of and existing program,and the use of savings from the merger of theDepartment of Commerce and the Depart-ment of Public Service. The bill would transfer $1.8 million from the general fund to the workforce develop-ment fund to provide funding for the dis-placed homemaker 's program. In addition, $800,000 would be provided by canceling funds for the Pathways Program, agrant program for educational institutions topartner with businesses in developing projectsthat provide training, new jobs, and careerpaths for individuals making the transitionfrom public assistance to the workforce. The program is administered through the Department of Trade and EconomicDevelopment. McElroy, the committee chair, said that de- partment officials said the program has notbeen used. The bill moves to the House floor.Increased adult education funding Funding for adult basic education would be increased and employment tracking would beprovided, under the House Family and EarlyChildhood Education Finance Committee 's omnibus spending bill. The committee approved the bill (HF4107) March 13. The bill would add $6.5 million foradult education programs, but would limitfuture spending for an individual program to10 percent growth or five percent for all adultbasic education programs statewide. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R- Excelsior), also calls for spending an additional$24.8 million in federal Temporary Aid forNeedy Families (TANF) dollars over the nextthree years. The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. The 1999 Legislature appropriated $42.6 million to fund adult education programs forfiscal years 2000-01. The new bill would in-crease funding to $49.2 million. Adult basiceducation offers classes to people who do nothave high school diplomas. Many of the stu-dents are just beginning to learn English. The bill includes $900,000 for new pro- grams, most notably $700,000 for adult basiceducation supplemental service grants. Transitional housing projects would receive $2 million in federal assistance dollars over thenext three years. About $9.3 million in TANFfunds would be designated for child-careservices. The bill incorporates a measure that wouldrequire adult education teachers to request that students give their Social Security num-bers for economic tracking. Sykora introducedthe proposal, which would allow the Depart-ment of Economic Security to discern the paylevel of graduates to see if the people are earn-ing more after completing the program. Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) spoke against the tracking, saying it would set a badprecedent. He said he feared it would open thedoor for more programs where Social Secu-rity numbers are used. Sykora noted that people are not required to give their Social Security numbers; they areasked to voluntarily turn them over for thestudy. Mariani offered one amendment that out- lined an alternative tracking system. He alsooffered an amendment that would require theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing to develop its own alternative tracking sys-tem. The committee did not adopt eitheramendment. The committee did adopt a Mariani amend- ment that states that future adult basic edu-cation funding would not be determined bythe percent of students who provide their So-cial Security information. Selling surplus computers A bill that would allow school districts to dispose of surplus school computers withouthaving to auction the property was passedMarch 13 by the House. The vote was 133-0. Sponsored by Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), the bill (HF2598) would allow districts to SOCCER PITCH Soccer balls from all over Minnesota fill the rotunda March 15 carrying messages for Gov. JesseVentura to support bonding for additional soccer fields around the state. The Minnesota YouthSoccer Association sponsored the rally.Session Weekly 9K-12 Education Park)Members: 17 (10 R, 7 DFL) Scope: Provides policy direction and funding for the state's K-12 sys-tem, including all public school districts, the Department of Children,Families & Learning, public libraries, and the Permanent School Fund.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILE K-12 spending plan A $28 million omnibus education spend- ing bill that includes both permanent and one-time funding proposals was approved by boththe House K-12 Education Finance Commit-tee March 13 and the House Taxes Commit-tee March 15. The bill (HF3800), sponsored by Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), chair of the K-12committee, would call for $11 million in sec-ondary vocational spending for work train-ing programs, $10 million for technologyinitiatives, and $8.5 million in funding forsmall school districts. Seagren said the bill is lean compared withRules for teacher preparation A bill that would postpone the ability of the state Board of Teaching to adopt, amend, orrepeal rules on institution and teacher prepa-ration programs was passed March 13 by theHouse. The vote was 122-10. The bill (HF3436), sponsored Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), would postpone theboard 's ability to make changes until Sept. 1, 2002. Seifert 's bill also would require that the Board of T eaching ask faculty and adminis-trators from Minnesota post-secondary insti-tutions with teacher preparation programs forthe institutions ' opinions on the board 's pro- posed rules for those programs. The state Board of T eaching would then be required to report to the Legislature by Janu-ary 15, 2001, on institutions ' opinions regard- ing proposed rules on institution and teacherpreparation programs. The bill now goes to the Senate.dispose of a computer and related equipment if the school has used the computer for at leastthree years, has purchased the computer withstate or federal funds, and no longer has a needfor the property. Under the bill, districts would have the op- tion of conveying surplus equipment to anotherschool district, the state Department of Correc-tions, the Board of Trustees of the MinnesotaState Colleges and Universities, or the family ofa district student whose total family incomemeets the federal definition of poverty. Districts wishing to dispose of school com- puters would be required by the bill to main-tain an inventory of the property and reconcilethe results of its inventory with propertyrecords at least once every two years. The bill would grant the commissioner of the Department of Children, Families andLearning access to the records. Abeler 's bill now goes to the Senate.the Senate 's $244 million education bill, but it addresses some of the critical issues thatcame before her committee this session. While Gov. Jesse Ventura has said he doesn 't favor any new majorspending initiativesthis year, earlier saidshe to commonmeasures containedin both the Houseand Senate bills. The House bill also contains severalnotable policy mea-sures of note. Provi-sions to establish aminimum who meet cer-tain requirementsare included in themeasure. The alternative teaching license provision is an attempt,Seagren said, to address the problem of teachershortages due to retirements, student enroll-ment growth, and policies requiring class-sizereduction. Language introduced by House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) that would allowteachers and certain other school employeesto use \"reasonable force \" when disciplining a student is also contained in Seagren 's bill. The bill was sent to the House Ways and Means Committee. The Senate 's plan, backed by Sen. Larry Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls), would provide about$150 million in permanent funding and morethan $75 million in one-time funding. #ENVIRONMENT Mosquito spraying limited The House Local Government and Metro Affairs Committee approved a bill March 10that would give the Department of Natural Re-sources (DNR) more authority in mosquitocontrol on state-owned land. The bill (HF3134), sponsored by Rep. Den- nis Ozment (R-Rosemount), would repeal thestate law that requires the natural resourcescommissioner to allow the Metropolitan Mos-quito Control Commission to enter stateproperty for mosquito control purposes. Currently the commission is required to getSalaries saved, redistributed Unspent money from job vacancies in state agencies would help pay for shortfalls in otherareas, under a bill approved March 13 by theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesFinance Committee. The bill (HF4080), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would spend $11.4million for the current biennium. A shortfall of about $410,000 in fiscal year 2001 is projected in the Wastewater Infrastruc-ture Fund, a grant program for smallpermission from private landowners to spray for mosquito control on privately owned land. Officials from the DNR have testified that state land should receive similar treatment andthat attention should be paid on the impactof mosquito control on nature 's food chain. The chemicals used for mosquito control alsokill midges, the insects that are the main foodsource for ducklings. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland), the commit- tee chair, offered an amendment that wasadopted establishing a trial period until July1, 2002, allowing the natural resources com-missioner the ability to deny, modify, or re-voke any approval for the commission tooperate on state lands. The bill was sent to the House floor. Cook County Sheriff David Wirt, left, tells the House Environment and Natural ResourcesFinance Committee about the need for fundsto be ready for possible forest fires in theBoundary Waters Canoe Area after last year'sstorm that blew over thousands of acres oftrees. Also testifying for funding were LakeCounty Sheriff Steve Peterson, center, and St. Louis County Sheriff Rick Wahlberg.FIRE FUNDS10 March 17, 2000communities that do not have sewer systems or that have old systems in need of major re-pairs. The money pays for staff of the Minne-sota Pollution Control Agency to evaluate theenvironmental aspects of the wastewater sys-tems to be built through the grant program. The bill would spend $306,000 for that pro- gram and divert the remaining $104,000 fromthe agency 's current budget. Holsten said state agencies save money by leaving positions vacant after someone resigns,and some positions are vacant for severalmonths. The money that is saved can be di-verted to the $410,000 shortfall, he said. The bill also would require the Office of Environmental Assistance to reduce its 2001budget by $104,000 through savings from va-cancies, but that money would not be reallo-cated under the bill. Other spending provisions include $4 mil- lion for costs related to a U.S. Supreme Courtdecision that upheld the hunting and fishingrights of the Mille Lacs Band of ChippewaIndians and others, and $400,000 for theBoard of Water and Soil Resources for costsrelated to the replacement of wetlands. And $5 million would be spent for a new state program similar to the federal Crop Re-serve Program. Farmers would be eligible forgrants to set aside cropland for three years.Strips of trees would have to be planted on asmall percentage of the land that is set aside,which would provide various environmentalbenefits. Also, the bill would spend $1.5 million to pay for anticipated expenses for emergencyfirefighting in forests. A severe storm in July1999 knocked down thousands of acres oftrees in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area,which has increased the chances of a forest fire. The House Ways and Means Committee later approved the bill and included it in alarger funding measure, which now heads tothe floor. #GOVERNMENT #GAME & FISH Getting in the hunt The House passed a bill March 13 that would improve some people 's chances of getting a li- cense to hunt moose. The vote was 133-0. Under the (HF2838), sponsored by Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee), Minnesotans whohave applied for and failed to get a license atleast 10 times would be able to apply in a sepa-rate selection process. The separate process would make 20 per- cent of all moose-hunting licenses availableto those applicants who have repeatedly failedto win a license. The state issues a limited number of suchPermits for disabled hunters A special hunting permit would be avail- able to people who have a permanent disabil-ity, under a bill the House passed March 13.The vote was 129-2. The bill (HF2603/SF2346*), sponsored by Rep. T om Hackbarth (R-Cedar), would allowthe commissioner of natural resources to is-sue such permits to people who cannot stepfrom a vehicle without the aid of a wheelchair,crutches, braces, or other means of support.Permits would also be available to people whohave heart or lung conditions and requirebreathing assistance. The permit would allow people with those types of conditions to use a snowmobile orall-terrain vehicle while hunting in the state 's wildlife management areas. The bill now moves to the governor 's desk. New budget office proposed A proposal to resolve disagreements about the fiscal impacts of legislation was approvedMarch 10 by the House Governmental Opera-tions and V eterans Affairs Policy Committee. The bill (HF4073), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), would establish alegislative budget office. The office would pro-vide House members and senators with infor-mation regarding current and projected staterevenue, expenditures, and taxes. Currently, most of those duties are per- formed by the state Department of Finance.The bill would reduce that department 's bud- get to pay for the legislative budget office. The office would be part of the Legislative Coordinating Commission, a joint House-Senate organization. Abrams described the proposed office as a small operation that would act in concert withthe Finance Department. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) said people from school districts have complainedthat the state uses different sets of numbersrelated to education funding. \"They 're crying out for everyone to be on the same page, \" she said. Abrams agreed, and he said that one of the office 's main goals would be to achieve that kind of consistency.#HUMAN SERVICESlicenses every other year, through a lotterysystem that includes all applicants in one pool.In 1999, 189 licenses were issued to hunt innortheastern Minnesota. There will not be amoose hunt in 2000. The bill now moves to the Senate.\"The public is better served if we have one set of numbers, \" Abrams said. The bill now heads to the House Taxes Committee. Omnibus funding plan An omnibus spending bill that would in- crease penalties on welfare recipients whodon't comply with work requirements and broaden eligibility for the state 's senior pre- scription drug program awaits a vote on theHouse floor. The bill was approved by the House Health and Human Services Finance CommitteeMarch 14 and by the House Ways and MeansCommittee one day later. The bill (HF2699) would also impose a 24- hour \"informed-consent \" waiting period on women who want to have an abortion, andincrease state reimbursement rates for nurs-ing homes, mainly in rural Minnesota, that re-ceive lower reimbursement payments thanother homes. \"What this bill does is attempt to address the most drastic needs in our communities,and I believe it does that in a fiscally respon-sible manner, \" said Rep. Kevin Goodno (R- Moorhead), sponsor of the bill. A portion of new spending under the bill would go to measures that would fund theproposed expansion of the prescription drugprogram, provide local intervention aid tocounties for family employment, and increasethe wages of personal-care attendants by 5percent. But new funding is offset in part by a mea- sure in the bill that would shift a portion ofMinnesota 's federal T emporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) funds into the gen-eral fund, yielding the state a savings of ap-proximately $71 million. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) suggested that the committee should designate how thetransfer of TANF funds should be spent, whichthe committee did not do. Greenfield also strongly disagreed with a measure in the bill that would cut welfare ben-efits from recipients who repeatedly don 't fol- low the state 's rules on program participation. He reminded the committee of the potentialimpact that could have on children andfamilies. Concern also arose regarding the measure on abortion. An amendment by Rep. LyndaBoudreau (R-Faribault) that would require awoman to be given certain information andto provide written consent at least 24 hoursprior to a scheduled abortion was incorpo-rated into the bill. It 's considered by some toSession Weekly 11#INSURANCE #LOCAL GOVERNMENT#METRO AFFAIRSbe a tough sell with both the Senate and Gov. Jesse Ventura. The bill also would establish an office of unlicensed and alternative health care thatwould be housed at the Department of Health. A proposed amendment to the bill by Rep. Henry Todd Van Dellen (R-Bloomington) touse $10 million of the state 's general fund to pay for diabetes research resulted in a lengthydiscussion between members of the HouseWays and Means Committee. The committee eventually adopted the amendment after it was altered by HouseSpeaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) to takefunds from the state 's medical endowment fund instead. The bill now heads to the House floor. It has become the vehicle for several other fi-nance measures including state government,jobs and economic development, environmentand natural resources, judiciary andagriculture. Loaner vehicle liability The House passed a bill March 13 by a vote of 131-2 that would shift insurance liabilitycosts on vehicles loaned out by repair shopsfrom the shops to the drivers. The bill (HF2719), sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), would re-quire the costs of damages done to a repairshop rental vehicle to come first from thedriver 's liability insurance coverage. The re- pair shop 's insurance would only pay the amount in excess of what the driver 's insur- ance does not cover. Many repair shops provide loaner vehicles while servicing their customers ' vehicles. But some shops are discontinuing the service be-cause their insurance is responsible for cover-ing the costs if the loaner vehicle is involvedin an accident. Current state law requires that the driver 's insurance covers the cost of damages done torental cars involved in accidents. Consumersare given the option by many rental car com-panies of purchasing additional insurancecoverage in the event of an accident. The bill now goes to the Senate. Township name change A new state law will help the residents of the township of Lake Edwards in Crow WingCounty to drop the \"s\" from the town 's name. There has been confusion about whether or not the legal name of the township had the\"s\" at the end, and the confusion has led to delays when the town has had to file docu-ments with state and federal governments. T ownship officials discovered that to legally change the name to the township of Lake Ed-ward would ordinarily require a petitionsigned by at least 55 percent of the number ofresidents who voted in the last general elec-tion. For Lake Edwards, a rural township located in the central part of the state with a popula-tion of approximately 1,500 people, the costsassociated with that process seemed too high. The new law allows the county board to change the name of the township upon receiv-ing a resolution from the town board request-ing the change. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) sponsoredthe law is effective upon localaction. HF2521/SF2320*/CH253 Local Gov't & DFL, 1 Ind.) Scope: Examines issues related to all forms of lo- cal government \u2014townships, cities, coun-ties, metropolitan agen-cies, and regional devel-opment commissions.HOUSECOMMITTEE PROFILEChanging the Met Council In 1967, the Legislature established the Metropolitan Council, recognizing the needto coordinate and plan the development of theregion. Because the 16-member council is appointed by the governor and has property tax levyingauthority, there hasbeen continuing de-bate through theyears over the func-tion and scope ofthe agency. The council also provides transitand andtreatment House in thecouncil 's authority. The committee took no action oneither measure butRep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland), the committeechair, said that the discussion on the issuesraised by both bills will continue. One bill (HF532), sponsored by Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls), would change thecouncil from an appointed body to an elected body beginning in 2003. Orfield said that an elected council would be more responsive than an appointed coun-cil. He said his bill is the same as those pro-posed in the 1960s by Arlen Erdahl, formerlegislator, secretary of state, and congressman,and by former Gov. Arne Carlson in the 1980s,before he won election to the state 's top of- fice. (As governor, Carlson vetoed a similarmeasure in 1997.) Orfield said because of the levying author- ity of the council and because its authority fallssomewhere between a local unit of govern-ment and a state agency, it is important for itsmembers to be accountable. The council 's budget for 2000 exceeds $474 million with a property tax levy of more than$129 million. Orfield said he supports the current coun- cil and its chair, T ed Mondale, but that becauseof the appointed nature of the membership,there is no guarantee that the philosophy andquality of the current council will continue inthe future. The second bill (HF2697), sponsored by Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan), would takethe measure one step further. Buesgens ' bill proposes to abolish the council by July 1, 2001. Buesgens said it is time to take a serious look at whether the council is needed for the met-ropolitan area. He said the council 's author- ity has evolved over the years and he agreeswith Orfield that having an non-elected gov-erning authority is a concern. \"One of the fundamental principles of free- dom is no taxation without representation, \" Buesgens said. Cash or charge? Hennepin County taxpayers would be al- lowed to pay their property taxes by credit anddebit cards, under a measure the House passedMarch 13. The bill (HF3229), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), would give thatcounty 's taxpayers the option of using credit cards, debit cards, or electronic or wire fundstransfers to make tax payments. Abrams said the bill would permit the county to establish a service charge for pay-ments made by these methods. The bill also would authorize the county to use electronic approvals to authenticate andvalidate county administrative actions, andwould direct the county to establish policiesand procedures to ensure the validity of elec-tronic approvals. Under the measure, county officials would also be allowed to use county credit cards forcounty business.12 March 17, 2000Currently both the Minnesota Department of Revenue and the federal Internal RevenueService allow taxpayers to file electronically,and thus accept credit card payments. The bill was passed by a 133-0 vote and now moves to the Senate. #RECREATION New plan for park permits Annual permits for state park visitors would be valid for one year after the date of purchase,under a bill the House passed March 13. Thevote was 134-0. Currently, annual park permits are only valid for the calendar year, which discouragespeople from buying them in the late summeror fall, said Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-GoldenValley), sponsor of the bill. The bill would make the permits good for one year from the date of purchase. Leppik said the proposal would likely in- crease the number of annual permits that aresold and encourage more visits to state parksyear-round. The bill (HF2505) now moves to the Senate. #TAXES#TRANSPORTATION Dr. David Brown, an ophthalmologist from St. Paul,speaks March 9 in front of the House CommerceCommittee in support of a bill that would regu-late the sale, rental, discharge, and possession ofpaintball guns.Paintball gun restrictions Paintball guns may make for fun in the hands of a weekend warrior, but many peoplebelieve they can be dangerous in the hands ofchildren. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) is sponsoring a bill (HF3041) that would makeit a misdemeanor for store clerks to sellpaintball guns to children under the age of 18 without the written consent of a parent orguardian. \"They look and they sound like toys, \" Leppik told the House Crime PreventionCommittee on March 10. \"The problem is they can be very, very dangerous. \" The bill was approved and now heads to the House floor. Paintball guns shoot gas-powered pellets filled with paint. People playing with paintballguns should be wearing eye protection, Leppiksaid. \"Kids are not aware of the hazards, even though it is printed on the box, \" she said. Emergency rooms are seeing an increase of severe injuries from pellets striking people inthe eye, Leppik said. She told a story about a14-year-old boy who was struck near the eyeand has now had three eye surgeries. The boyexperiences excruciating pain and will likelylose his sight in that eye, she said. \"This is becoming more and more common because this is a popular game, \" she said. Leppik said the guns are visibly different from a real gun. \"I don 't think this could be mistaken for a real gun. They are big and colorful, \" she said. The bill also would ban the use of paintball guns on state property. License tab fee reductions The House Taxes Committee discussed two bills March 14 that would reduce license tabregistration fees. The committee took no action on either measure but both will be considered for in-clusion in the omnibus tax bill. Currently, the motor vehicle registration tax is $10 plus an additional tax of 1.25 percenton the base value adjusted on a depreciationscale. The minimum tax is $35. According to the nonpartisan House Re- search Department, Minnesota ranks 23rd inthe nation on average in license tab fees. Inaddition, about 38 percent of the motor ve-hicle owners in the state pay the minimum $35fee. One bill (HF446), sponsored by Rep. Will- iam Kuisle (R-Rochester), would change thedepreciation schedule to provide for a 10 per-cent annual depreciation over 10 years. Thecurrent depreciation schedule varies in thepercentage of depreciation over the 10-yearperiod. Under Kuisle 's proposal, the residents of the state would vote on a constitutional amend-ment to dedicate 30 percent of the revenuefrom the motor vehicle sales tax to the high- way user tax distribution fund. The remain-der would continue to go to the general fund. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) the com- mittee chair, said he doesn 't favor including bills that propose constitutional amendmentsin omnibus measures. Proposed amendmentsshould advance on their own, he said. Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake), the sponsor of the second bill (HF3967), said thatin his bill the license tab tax rate would notchange, but the state would pay for a portionof the tax. The bill provides for a credit of 50percent against license taxes to be applied tothe portion of the tax that is between $35 and$500. Vandeveer said that he agrees with the gov- ernor in that Minnesota 's license tab fee rates do not compare favorably to neighboringstates. He said the advantage of his bill is that there is no need for a referendum and roads wouldget the same amount of money as they cur-rently do. 'Busways' over light rail Rather than invest in a light-rail system that is confined to the designated track, Minnesotashould consider building a bus-only road inthe Hiawatha Corridor, said Rep. CarolMolnau (R-Chaska). The House Transportation Finance Com- mittee heard testimony on a bill (HF4071) thatwould replace the $100 million bonds alreadyappropriated for light rail with $50 million inbonds and $50 million in cash for a bus-onlyroad. Molnau, the sponsor of the bill, said the bus route, at a cost of $43 million (according to a1997 study) is far cheaper than the $548 lightrail line. \"We are proposing a more cost-effective proposal to light rail, \" Molnau said. The committee did not act on Molnau 's bill, and no vote is expected this year, according tocommittee staff. The 11-mile Hiawatha Corridor would con- nect the airport to downtown Minneapolis. Peter McLaughlin, chair of the Hennepin County Board, spoke against Molnau 's bill. McLaughlin said the state Department ofTransportation study that Molnau is referringto only examines a \"busway \" from the airport to the Metrodome, and does not complete thejourney down Fifth Street to Nicollet Avenuein Minneapolis. McLaughlin said the finalstretch in Minneapolis, featuring several pro-posed train stops, is where much of the finalcosts occur.Session Weekly 13\"Y our product will be cheaper, but it will be inferior, \" McLaughlin said. He said costs for the entire busway, from the airport to Nicollet Avenue, could reach ashigh as $100 million. Molnau said the busway would not cause the closure of through traffic on Fifth Street,but a light-rail line would. McLaughlin said people would use light rail, but would not take a bus. \"This isn 't only going to be less desirable, it's going to be slow, \" McLaughlin said. \"Yo u're going to be walking away from $274 millionin federal dollars. \" The federal money is avail- able for light-rail programs but not bus-onlyroads. Molnau countered, saying other U.S. cities have reported that express buses that do notstop at all stations are much quicker thantrains, which cannot skip stations. \"If you give them an express route to Min- neapolis, you will fill the bus, \" Molnau said.Changes in seat belt plan A plan to allow police more leeway to stop drivers for seat belt violations was significantlyaltered March 10 in the House Crime Preven-tion Committee. The bill (HF857), sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), initially would haveallowed police to stop any car if any person inthe front seat was not wearing a seat belt. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) offered an amendment that would make it a primary of-fense \u2014 something police can stop a car for \u2014 only for people under age 18 to ride in the front seat without a seat belt. However, therewould be no change to the law for people 18or older. The committee approved the amend-ment, then sent the bill to the House floor. Under the amended bill, an officer could issue a $25 ticket to the driver if the passengeris younger than age 15, or give the ticket tothe passenger if that person is 15 to 17 yearsold.The original proposal barely squeaked through the House Transportation PolicyCommittee on March 9 and does not havesupport from the governor. Greenfield said he would be happy with in- cremental change provided by the amend-ment, although he favors his original bill. \"It's a compromise that still improves the law,\" Greenfield said. Kathy Cooper, whose daughter died in a car accident last year, testified in favor of the pri-mary offense language. She said the amendedversion would change little. \"I'm very disappointed, \" Cooper said. \"I think they 've totally confused the issue. It should be straight mandatory. That is the safeway, that is the best way. \" The bill still would require all passengers in the back seat up to age 18 to wear a seat belt. Similar legislation has been discussed sev- eral times in recent years, including bills thatstalled in 1994 and 1997. The House passed an omnibus crime measure March 16 that woulddeal with sex offenders and criminal justice information. The votewas 134-0. The measure (HF2688), sponsored by Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), is a combination of five major crime initiatives introduced thissession.Funds to fight crime House approves omnibus judiciary finance bill It would provide for the integrated crimi- nal justice information systems and adomestic abuse pilot project in RamseyCounty. It also would deal with sex offenderpenalties and registration, community no-tification about sex offenders, and a reduc-tion in the number of sex offender caseshandled by probation officers. The sex offender measures would require some offenders to register for life, establisha Web site to post the names of all Level 3sex offenders statewide, and limit sex of-fenders ' ability to change their names. As passed, the bill would appropriate $16.5 million for all five provisions in fis-cal year 2001. That includes $7.5 million forthe criminal justice information systemplan.On the House floor, Broecker emphasized that the money for the criminal justice sys-tem is only to cover the costs for the upcom-ing year, not for the entire project. Also included in the bill is $6.5 million for electronic finger-printing technology toreplace the old-fashioned inking method. Some have estimated that the entire in- tegration project could cost as much as $100million to complete. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) at- tempted to amend appropriations in the billso that it would provide $15 million forcriminal justice information systems ratherthan $7.5 million. But the amendment wasblocked on a procedural motion. Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) intro- duced an amendment on the floor to re-quire that a risk assessment be conductedfor any information systems projects wherethe state has allocated more than $1 mil-lion. The study would need to be completedbefore the money is actually spent. It passedby an 89-44 vote.Some members were critical of the $7.5 million appropriation, which calls for lo-cal matching dollars, because they say it 's too low. However, House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said earlier that it 's important to get the program started even if it meansspending more money on it later as itprogresses. \"We're going to start this integrated sys- tem because we think it 's the right thing to do, \" Sviggum told the House Ways and Means Committee.

In a surprise move March 16, House members attached a majoramendment to a bill that was thought to provide a viable compromise to the Profile, a much-maligned part of the state 's Graduation Standards initiative.Profile is no star An unexpected move on the House floor aims to create a new alternative to the Profile of Learning The amendment, offered by Rep. T ony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) would create anew option for school accountability called theNorth Star Standard. The amendment passed narrowly on a 68- 66 vote. The result is a bill that would put theProfile on hold and allow districts to chooseif they want to use the North Star Standard. \"My amendment to House File 3618 serves to uphold high standards currently expectedof students. It will allow individual districtsto implement the North Star Standard or tai-lor teaching to the needs of their students, \" Kielkucki said. No final vote was taken on the amended bill, but one is expected to take place within days.The bill is sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness(R-Dassel). The North Star Standard, Kielkucki said, would steer away from the Profile 's practical skills focus. The amendment details rewrittenstandards in such basics as science, math, En-glish, and history. Under the North Star plan, students wouldhave to complete credits in up to 10 learning areas. T eachers would still be able to assignprojects designed to test a student 's ability to understand and apply subject matter, but suchhands-on demonstrations, which are at theheart of the Profile of Learning, would nolonger be standard requirements. Kielkucki told members of the House Edu- cation Policy Committee earlier this sessionthat the North Star Standard plan was createdin response to critics who chastised House Re-publicans for trying to scrap the Profile dur-ing session last year while offering no clearalternative. A part of the state 's Graduation Standards, the Profile of Learning was created to shiftlearning away from textbooks and lectures andmove it in the direction of experiments, team-work, research, and independent projects. Under the Profile, students are required to perform various tasks in core learning areasthat have practical applications for life beyondthe classroom. However, shortly after the state 's teachersstarted incorporating requirements of the Pro- file of Learning into lesson plans two years ago,complaints began to surface. Last year, the Legislature reached a stalemate over differences about how to fix the Profileand left the initiative intact. This year, talk ofretooling the program intensified almost im-mediately after the beginning of the session\u2014 as teachers, students, and parents scurried to offer legislators ideas on a solution. Not all agree, however, that the North Star Standard is the way to go. \"This bill (as amended) is a train wreck, \" said Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins). \"I do not believe in playing politics with our kids,and that 's what this bill does. \" Rep. Henry T odd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) supported the amended bill. \"The time is up, and the compromise is to scrap this failed experiment with our chil-dren, \" he said. Department of Children, Families and Learning Commissioner Christine Jax testifiedbefore the House Education Policy Commit- tee March 9 in favor of retaining the 24 stan- dards currently required of students. Jax saidshe would prefer to \"hold students harmless \" for a two-year period by delaying strict en-forcement of a minimum standard require-ment. \"But I don 't want to say we won 't be open- minded, \" Jax said. Before the Kielkucki amendment, the bill would have cut in half the number of Profiletasks \u2014 from 24 to 12 \u2014 that students in grades 9 to 12 would be required to completebefore graduating. The bill also would havereduced the number of core learning areasfrom 10 to six, and simplified the descriptionof those learning areas. Also on the House floor, lawmakers rejected an amendment from Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) related to a controversy aboutwriting tests given to all the state 's 10th grad- ers in January. The amendment would have required test booklets to be returned to students after scor-ing and would have forbidden the test ques-tion from being used again. The question asked students to write something about themselves they would liketo change, and it drew fire because of the per-sonal nature of the question. Session Weekly 15AT ISSUE: GOVERNMENT # # # BY JON FUREA bill that would give the governor a raise while cutting state spending by nearly $10 million for the 2000-01 biennium is advancing in theHouse.Streamlined spending State government spending measure would give thegovernor a raise but cut other costs Here are some other key provisions of the bill. Bleacher safety The bill would modify a 1999 law that es- tablished new safety requirements for allbleachers that are taller than 30 inches. Thebill would make those requirements applyonly to bleachers standing 55 inches (nearly 5feet) or higher. The law requires bleachers to include guard- rails or safety nets, and spaces between floor-boards, seats, and guardrails cannot exceedfour inches. Those requirements are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2001. But the bill would delay that ef-fective date to Aug. 1, 2001. Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed $100,000 from the provision in 1999 that would have helpedcommunities comply with the requirements. The bill would effectively exempt short sets of bleachers that are commonly placed inparks near sports fields, so that local commu-nities and school districts would not be forcedto replace them or equip them with safety nets. Design-build ban The Department of Transportation would be required to comply with current state law regard-ing bidding projects, under the measure. Krinkie said a provision in the 1999 omni- bus transportation finance law gave the de-partment an exemption to allow the light-railtransit project along the Hiawatha Corridorto use a design-build method. That method allows the state to use a single contractor for the design and construction ofthe project, instead of awarding separate bidsfor design and construction. The bill would prohibit using the design-build method for any state construction project, until specific policies and regulationscan be established for that method. Secretary of state funding A provision in the bill would allow the Office of the Secretary of State to keep revenue fromUniform Commercial Code transactions. Those transactions involve pledging per- sonal property for collateral. People who filethe transactions currently pay $15, plus addi-tional costs if the form exceeds nine pages.That money goes to the general fund. But Krinkie said the revenue was originally intended to pay for upgrades to the computersystem that is used for those transactions. Sec-retary of State Mary Kiffmeyer estimated thatthe transactions generate about $2.3 millionper year in revenue, while the office 's costs of administering the transactions are only abouttwo-thirds of that amount. The bill would allow the revenue to be spent on upgrading that system, and would reducethe secretary of state 's general fund support by $2.3 million per year. Office of Technology abolished The Office of Technology is one of three small departments that would be eliminatedunder the bill. Its projected budget is $2.7million for 2001 and $5.4 million for the fol-lowing biennium. Krinkie said the office 's ability to review tech- nology-related projects is limited. The office doesnot have jurisdiction over constitutional offices,the judicial branch, the University of Minnesota,the Minnesota State Colleges and Universitiessystem, or local units of government. Also, the office has not been able to prevent excessive spending by reviewing technology-related legislative proposals, he said. One cur-rent legislative proposal would establish astatewide criminal justice information system,but Krinkie said there is little information onhow it would work and how much it wouldcost. \"If you have a big enough truck, you can just blow through the check point, \" Krinkie said. Commissioner of Administration David Fisher disagreed. The office 's role is merely advisory, because nothing in state law gives itany regulatory authority, he said. But the of-fice has had success in its advisory role. \"T echnology budgets had no oversight un- til we got involved, \" he said. The bill (HF2500), sponsored by Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview), would eliminate theOffice of T echnology, the Board of Govern-ment Innovation and Cooperation, and theOffice of Citizenship and Volunteer Services. The bill was approved March 14 by the House State Government Finance Committee, whichKrinkie chairs, and won approval in the HouseWays and Means Committee one day later. Under the proposal, fiscal year 2001 spend- ing for Minnesota Planning, a state agency thatacts as a long-range planning arm of the ad-ministration, would be reduced from$4.4 million to $2.4 million. Those savings would pay for projected shortfalls in other areas, including $48,000 tothe Campaign Finance and Disclosure Boardfor costs related to an unsuccessful court caseand $90,000 to the Gambling Control Boardfor a workers ' compensation claim. The bill would increase the governor 's sal- ary from $120,303 to $150,000. That wouldallow proportional salary increases for com-missioners of state department or other ad-ministrators, which are based on a percentageof the governor 's salary. The state recently has allowed exemptions to those limits, such as salaries for school su-perintendents. Some other agencies and departments have requested exemptions, because the currentlimits on salaries for those positions havemade it hard to find qualified candidates. Thebill would raise the maximum salary for allsuch positions. The bill also would repeal the governor 's au- thority to abolish or merge departments in theexecutive branch. That issue gained notice whenGov. Jesse Ventura decided last year to merge thePublic Safety and Commerce departments.16 March 17, 2000AT ISSUE: TAXES # # # BY DAVID MAEDA Though much of the attention surround- ing tax discussions this session has focused onissues such as permanent income tax cuts andreductions in license tab fees, a significantproperty tax reform plan follows closelybehind. The governor 's tax plan proposes to carry over about $855 million from the current bud-get surplus into the next biennium for poten-tial reforms to the state 's complicated property tax system. Some lawmakers feel there is still room for property tax reform this year. The House Taxes Committee 's Property Tax Division discussed two bills this week thatwould continue property tax reform initiativesthat began in 1997. No action was taken on either bill but both will be considered for inclusion in the omni-bus tax package, along with nearly 50 otherproperty tax measures. One bill (HF4030), sponsored by Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), the division chair, would ex-empt residential homestead, agricultural, andseasonal recreation homestead property from thestate-determined general education levy. During a March 13 hearing on the bill, Erhardt said although he supports efforts tocut income tax rates, his proposal is an attemptto refocus some of the discussion on propertytax reform. Currently, county auditors determine the general education homestead credit for eachhomestead by calculating 83 percent of thegeneral education tax rate applied to net taxcapacity. The bill proposes providing the exemption by first determining each property 's tax in the present manner, then reducing that amountby an exemption amount equal to the generaleducation tax upon the property. Erhardt 's bill, which the Department of Revenue estimates would cost more than $775million over the next biennium, also wouldreduce class rates for nearly all classes of prop-erty except first-tier homes.A taxing dilemma Lawmakers debate whether it's more important toreduce property taxes or income taxes in the searchfor meaningful reform Some feel such property tax relief is cru- cial. Richard Nelson, a Burnsville clergymanwho owns a cabin in outstate Minnesota, saidthat the bill provides much needed \"mercy \" for Minnesota cabin owners. Nelson said that his family 's cabin was built in 1948 and cost about $3,000. He said lastyear he paid more than $3,000 in propertytaxes for the cabin that is now valued at around$113,000. Others like Glenn Dorfman of the Minne- sota Association of Realtors feel income taxcuts would provide greater benefit. Dorfman said that the state 's high home ownership rates prove that a strong economyis more important for home ownership thanlower property taxes are.Though he said he supports continued compression of property tax rates, Dorfmansaid discussion of cutting property taxesshould make it clear to taxpayers that toachieve such reform will inevitably requirehigher income and sales taxes. \"Income tax cuts give people money back to pay property taxes which will go up whetheryou cut them or not, \" he said. Another bill (HF4089), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), would com-press class rates for all property classes with arate over 1 percent. It also would reduce \u2014 from 8.5 percent to 7 percent \u2014 the limita- tion on the amount a property 's market value may grow from one year to the next. Abrams told the committee March 15 that the bill is the final piece of reform that beganin 1997. However, that doesn 't mean other property tax reform isn 't possible or necessary. The bill would reduce the rate for commer- cial/industrial properties valued over $150,000from 3.4 percent to 3 percent and for thoseproperties under $150,000 the rate would bereduced from 2.4 percent to 2 percent. The Department of Revenue estimates Abram 's bill would cost around $308 million over the next biennium. Kent Warden, the executive director of the Greater Minneapolis Building Owners andManagers Association, said past property taxrelief provided by the Legislature has helpedMinnesota businesses. But he said that thestate still has the third-highest property taxesin the nation. He said high tax rates mean higher rent rates for businesses and ultimately higher prices forconsumers. In 1999, an average tenant com-pany located in downtown Minneapolis paid$9.12 per square foot, compared to $3.35 persquare foot for a comparable office space inDes Moines, Iowa, and $1.93 per square footfor an office in Seattle, Washington, accord-ing to information provided by Warden. T om Casper, owner of Ciatti 's Restaurant in Woodbury, said the state 's high property tax rates place a great burden on \"mom and pop \" businesses like his own. \"My property tax bill for a 7,000 square foot building is $54,000 a year or $4,600 a month, \" Casper said. \"We all love spaghetti. I 'm con- cerned the day will come when I 'll have to charge $29.95 for a plate of spaghetti. \" Kent Warden, executive director of the Greater Minneapolis Building Owners and Managers As-sociation, testifies March 15 before the PropertyTax Division of the House Taxes Committee in sup-port of a measure that would reduce propertytaxes and ease the burden on commercialproperties.Session Weekly 17AT ISSUE: TRANSPORTATION # # # BY CHRIS VETTERState legislators are considering a plan to eliminate future funding for light-rail transit projects and request that any unspent money forthe line be returned to the state.Seeking a cure for congestion A $425 million transportation spending measurewould address metropolitan bottlenecks and reverselight-rail funding Larson said. \"The time has come to move on. \" Krinkie said his major concern is that fu- ture Trunk Highway Fund dollars will be usedon light-rail transit upgrades instead of onroads. He contends that people who would uselight rail are people who are already usingtransit systems. \"This is not going to move a significant amount of new riders, no matter what theytry to do, \" Krinkie said. David Strom, legislative director of the Tax- payers League of Minnesota, told the commit-tee that the Department of Transportationkeeps changing its cost estimate of the project.Last year, the project was estimated to cost$446 million; a recent study hiked the cost to$548 million. A long-term cost study says theproject could total more than $700 million. \"Light-rail proponents have been funda- mentally dishonest \" about the costs, Strom said. \"The light-rail system they are talking about now is not the system they presented tothe Legislature. \" Although project costs have climbed, Strom noted that the proposed length of the line wasshortened, stops were removed, and the num-ber of rail cars was reduced. Molnau said the size, scope, and cost of the project is largely different from last year, whichmakes it worth debating. Elwyn Tinklenberg, transportation com- missioner, said the department told legislatorsrepeatedly last year that its cost analysis wasbased on 1997 dollars, and inflation has causedthe cost estimates to climb. One of the main objectives of the omnibus bill is to resolve traffic congestion in otherways. The committee adopted an amendmentthat would split the general fund and TrunkHighway Fund money so $201 million wouldbe spent on Interstates 494 and 694 or con-gested roads linking those highways, while an-other $201 million would be used forinter-regional corridors across the state. Larson spoke against the amendment, say- ing the Twin Cities area could receive a ma-jority of the money if the TransportationDepartment chooses projects in the seven-county metro area that are not inside the 694/494 loop. A plan that would ban the department from planning commuter rail without legislative ap-proval was also rolled into the omnibus bill.Molnau, who offered that proposal, said sheprefers that local communities look at the up-grades and decide what is best for them. The committee approved an amendment offered by Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake)that would allocate $500,000 to the Univer-sity of Minnesota to study personal rapid tran-sit. The proposed system would place small,computer-controlled vehicles on elevatedguideways as an alternate means of transit. The omnibus bill also includes a proposal to study the effectiveness of ramp meters.Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen)proposed the study, arguing Minnesotansshould see if the system is needed. The proposal is included in the House Transportation Finance Committee 's omnibus bill (HF2891), which would spend $350 mil-lion in road improvements from the generalfund and another $75 million from the TrunkHighway Fund. The committee narrowly approved the om- nibus bill March 15 and sent it to the HouseWays and Means Committee. Rep. CarolMolnau (R-Chaska), sponsor of the bill, saidit would make a strong commitment to im-proving roads and eliminating \"bottlenecks \" in the metro area. \"It's been a long time since we 've had an emphasis on transportation, \" Molnau said. The omnibus bill is in addition to the $382million bonding recommendation the com-mittee approved earlier this session. A provision in the bill would require the Department of Transportation to return theunspent portions of the $100 million the Leg-islature previously approved for light-railtransit along the Hiawatha Corridor. Currentestimates show $90 million to $92 million hasnot been spent. Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview), who is su- ing the governor for not doing a proper cost-benefit analysis of the light-rail proposal,backed the plan, which would effectively stopthe current light-rail project. \"The governor and the commissioner (of transportation) would have you believe thisis a done deal, \" Krinkie said. However, it is not too late to reverse the bonding from the past two years, he said. Rep. Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington) said the decision to move forward on light rail wasmade last year and the committee should notbe debating a project that is already approved. \"I'm wondering why we are spending all this time, when the governor has promised a veto, \" Leslie Davis, president of Earth Protectors, testifies March 13 in opposition to a proposal to cancel theunspent remainder of the state funds for light-railtransit in the Hiawatha Corridor.18 March 17, 2000BY MIKE DELARCOCity Academy on St. Paul 's East Side has no plush classrooms or spacious auditoriums like other schools. Driving past the underused, city-operated recreational building, the world would never recognize the school as a place of learning.Education innovation Nearly a decade later, charter schools are a growing part ofMinnesota's K-12 landscape Y et every day for more than eight years, stu- dents have listened daily to lessons about al-gebra, the periodic table, grammar, andgovernment. Most who attend class are be-tween the ages of 18 and 21. All come to CityAcademy to learn in an environment that en-courages creativity while stepping beyond thebounds of \"traditional \" public schools. Over the past several years, many other communities have caught on, and as a result,charter schools like City Academy can be spot-ted with greater frequency both in Minnesota and in states across the nation. Founded in 1992 and recognized as the nation 's very first charter school, City Academy 's structure and the faculty 's commit- ment to young people continue to make theschool a place people near and far use as anexample. The charter school movement began in 1988 when Albert Shanker, president of theAmerican Federation of T eachers, called forthe reform of public schools by describingwhat he referred to as \"charter schools. \" The basic concept behind charter schools was simple: a group of teachers or otherwould-be educators would approach a par-ticular school district for permission to opena school. The school would then operate un-der a charter, or contract, with the local school board or the state. The schools would receive statefunding to operate,just like other pub-lic schools, butwould have to comeup with their ownstart-up capital andlocation. In char- learning pro-grams. The Minnesota Legislature passed its charter school law in1991. The law allowed for the formation ofeight results-oriented, student-centered char-ter schools and spelled out precisely how thoseschools should operate. Many at the forefront of education reform atthe time expressed excitement over the possi- bilities sure to result from passage of the charterschool legislation. Most legislators voting in fa-vor of the bill shared that excitement. \"What we should do is bust open the old norms and let the teachers and students engagein new ways in a totally new structure, governedmore by the learning opportunities than by thetraditions of the past, \" former Rep. Ken Nelson (DFL-Mpls) was quoted as saying. Over the past five years, the charter school movement has experienced significant growth.The state currently has 65 charter schools thatare approved to operate during calendar year2000. Among them are seven schools set toopen this fall. The Center for Educational Reform in Wash- ington, D.C., reports there are nearly 1,700 char-ter schools operating nationwide in 31 states,serving approximately 350,000 students. Of the schools that have been approved to operate since legislation on charter schools inthe state of Minnesota became law, only threehave closed for one reason or another, saidTraci LaFerriere, charter school coordinatorfor the state Department of Children, Fami-lies and Learning. Two additional schools \u2014 one being a school for the blind in St. Cloud \u2014 remain on the bubble, LaFerriere said. \"Yo u're going to find that the schools that fail are ones having management trouble, andoften the trouble can be traced to finances, \" she said. But by and large charter schools in Minne- sota have found a way to survive and in manycases thrive. Under state law, a charter school must be formed either as a cooperative or nonprofitcorporation. Once this is done, a governingbody for the new school must be established.In Minnesota, teachers must form a majorityof a school 's governing board. Until the bylaws of the charter school orga- nization indicate the procedure for electing apermanent Board of Directors, a provisionalboard may act in its absence. This temporaryboard can write the contract, hire teachers, andtake on other duties that are necessary to getthe school up and running. In addition, charter schools must be de- signed specifically to fulfill one or more of thefollowing purposes: improve pupil learningand increase learning opportunities, use dif-ferent and innovative teaching methods, use POLICY # # # Kindergarten students from Success Academy and their teacher visit with HouseMajority Leader Tim Pawlenty (at center in background) and other legislatorsMarch 14 to demonstrate how kindergartners are reading at and above the first-grade level. The visit was part of an effort to voice concern over funding needsfor charter schools.Session Weekly 19different and innovative tools to measure learning, establish new forms of accountabil-ity, and create new professional opportunitiesfor teachers. Many of these goals are currently priorities for the 2000 Legislature. In fact, the currentLegislature has been discussing ways to im-prove accountability systems in all publicschools. And faced with a significant potential teacher shortage in the coming years, legisla-tors are also looking into various incentiveplans, including increased teacher develop-ment. While a charter school is exempt from most state and local laws and regulations, the schoolmust show proof that students have acquiredthe educational skills specified in the initialcontract for the charter to be renewed. In Minnesota, charter school instructors are required to be licensed teachers, and they areentitled to retirement benefits under the let-ter of the school 's charter.difficulties with student transportation, inad- equate facilities, limited special education pro-gramming, and a difficult relationship withthe school 's sponsoring district. State government has attempted to address the problem of start-up costs by offering$50,000 start-up grants to qualifying schools.A limited amount of federal charter schoolfunding can also be applied to a school 's start- up cost. Since charter schools were first established in Minnesota, their numbers have increasedevery year and will likely continue to grow. Lt.Gov. Mae Schunk has voiced theadministration 's support for charter schools. Rural Minnesota is apparently ripe for growth in charter schools. Statistics show thatabout two-thirds of all existing charter schoolsare located in the Twin Cities metropolitanarea. Regarding curriculum, it 's true charter schools have flexibility in what lessons aretaught to students, but the state still sets mini-mum requirements for the subject matter thatmust be covered during the course of a year.Charter schools are also subject to the sameperiodic testing and public reporting as allpublic schools. A 1998 report by the Humphrey Institute 's Center for School Change titled Making a Dif- ference? Charter Schools, Evaluation and Stu-dent Performance found that 21 out of 31 charter schools studied reported gains in stu-dent achievement after administering thesame test at least twice. According to Minnesota Charter Schools: A Research Report , parents of children who at- tend charter schools list small class size, chal-lenging curriculum, good teachers, and greateropportunity for parental involvement as posi-tive aspects of charter schools. Some of the problems associated with char- ter schools have included the cost of start-up, THE STATES50 Calling for safety Some lawmakers want motorists to hang up and drive By the end of this year, more than 80 mil- lion people will be using cellular phones inthe United States, according to the CellularTelecommunications Industry Association. Though cellular phones are often consid- ered a staple of 21st century life, using themcan become a safety issue when people dial-up while behind the wheel. During 1999, legislators in 15 states con- sidered bills to limit or prohibit cell phoneuse by drivers. None of those measurespassed, but at least five states have such leg-islation pending this year. The proposals range from a complete ban of cell phone use in a moving vehicle toguidelines for use. No proposals regardingthis issue are currently before the MinnesotaLegislature.Proponents of regulating cell phone use say drivers are distracted and don'trespond as quickly to road conditions. Op-ponents say that cell phones are no moreof a distraction for drivers than the radio,eating food, or using vanity mirrors. And,they say, cell phones are often used toseek help during road emergencies. Currently no state has laws specifically regulating cell phone use in automobiles,but all states have laws addressing care-less or reckless driving. The city of Brooklyn, Ohio, became the first jurisdiction in the country to signifi-cantly restrict cell phone use inside ve-hicles by passing a hands-free ordinancein March 1999. The ordinance makes it a misdemeanorto use a cell phone while driving unless both hands are on the steering wheel. Though devices are available so drivers can keep their hands on the wheel, studiesshow they don't necessarily increase safety. A 1997 study by the New England Jour- nal of Medicine concluded that cell phoneusers were four times more likely to havecrashes than non-users. And the studyfound that cell phone units that allow thehands to be free offer no safety advantageover hand-held units. At least seven countries \u2014 England, Swit- zerland, Spain, Australia, Israel, Italy, and theRepublic of Singapore \u2014 restrict or prohibitcell phone use while driving a motor vehicle. (D.

FYI It's not easy to amend the Minnesota Constitution,but that wasn't always thecase. From 1857 to 1898,amendments required simple majority \u2014 more'yes' votes than 'no' votes \u2014at the polls. That changed by way of a constitutional amend-ment approved in 1898 re-quiring a majority of all vot-ers who went to the pollsfor that election. Thatmeans leaving the questionblank counts as a 'no' vote. The 1898 measure was known as the \"brewer'samendment\" because itwas intended to make itmore difficult for prohibi-tionists to ban liquor.Session Weekly 21When the House goes \"under call \" for all members to vote on a crucial bill, thespeaker directs the sergeant-at-arms tofind and escort all members back to thechamber. Often, House business does notproceed until all members are at theirdesks. Old stories prevail around the Capitol about the procedure. The one about the chiefsergeant who had to drive miles out of townto bring a member back is an example. Another is about the search to find Joe Rolette back in 1857 after he stole the billthat was to make St. Peter the state capital.So the story goes, the sergeant did findRolette, but was coerced to sit and play cardsuntil three days transpired for the bill to die. Not all bills come under the Call of the House rule, but one of note is an 1881 con-troversial tonnage tax on the value of oreup on the Iron Range. The bill hungaround in some form for 40 years as it waspassed, repealed, vetoed, passed again, andamended. In 1909 for example, Gov. JohnJohnson vetoed a bill that would put a levyon the gross value of ore. Then, during the 1921 session, a bill fora tonnage tax on iron ore resurfaced with an amendment that levied tax on the oc-cupation of ore mining. One lawmakerwho voted for the occupation tax was Rep.Henry H. Emmons from Emmons T own-ship on the Iowa State line. Worth noting is his father, H.G. Emmons, who served in the Legislaturefor two terms in 1877 and 1878. The el-der Emmons helped to pass a bill for leg-islative sessions to become biennial, andanother for funds to pay for the cost ofthe capture of the Northfield bank rob-bers, the Jesse James-Cole Y ounger Gang. H.H. Emmons ' time at the Capitol is also noteworthy in many aspects, butmostly because of how he kept a pledgeto his constituency in Freeborn Countyto vote for the tonnage or occupation tax.This was not as simple as it sounds. Emmons was very ill at the opening of the 1921 legislative session. So stronglywas he committed to his lawmaker role,he traveled back and forth between treat-ment at Rochester 's Mayo Clinic and St. Paul to execute his duties. Emmons was present in session off and on for only 22 days. He returned on the45th Day. On the morning of March 11\u2014 the 47th Day of session \u2014 he arose from his deathbed, dressed, and went tothe Capitol. Emmons rested on a couch in the chamber lobby until a Call of the Housewas requested for the tax bill. He madehis way to his desk, then voted when hisname was called. This was his last officialact. Henry H. Emmons died on March 31,1921. A week later, his colleagues read a reso- lution into the House Journal for \"his untiring energy, zeal and conscientiousapplication of his work in the Legislature. \" Emmons ' great granddaughter, Leah Cook, followed a Call to the House some70 years later as a high school page. Aftercollege, she served as a legislative assis-tant and lobbyist in Maryland. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERTReflectionsMARCH 20 - 24 , 2000COMMITTEE SCHEDULE # # # MONDAY, March 20 8 a.m. ETHICS 10 State Office Building Chr.

That legislator is the chief author whose name appears on the bill along with the bill's file number to identify it as it moves through the legislative process.There may be up to 34 co-authors from the House and four from the Senate. Their names also appear onthe bill.How a Bill Becomes Idea A bill is an idea for a newlaw or an idea to change an old law. Anyone can suggest an idea for a bill \u2014 anindividual, consumer group, professional association, govern- ment agency, or the governor.Most often, however, ideas come from legislators, the only ones who can begin to move an ideathrough the process. There are 134 House members and 67 senators.Legal form The Office of the Revisor of Statutes and staff fromother legislative offices work with legislators in putting the idea for a new law into proper legal form. The revisor's office is responsible for assuring that the proposal's formcomplies with the rules of both bodies before the bill can be introduced into the MinnesotaHouse of Representatives and the Minnesota Senate. General Register In the House, the General Register serves as a parking lot where bills await action by the full body. Bills chosen to appear on the Calendar for the Day or the Fiscal Calendar are drawn from the General Register. In the Senate, a different proce- dure is used. Bills are listed on the General Orders agenda. Senate members, acting as the \"commit-tee of the whole,\" have a chance to debate the issue and offer amendments on the bill. After-wards, they vote to recommend: passage of the bill, progress (delay action), or further commit-tee action. And sometimes they recommend that a bill not pass. From here, the bill is placed onthe Calendar.Calendar for the Day2 1 3 7In the Senate, bills approved by the \"committee of the whole\" are placed on the Calendar. At thispoint, the bill has its third reading , after which time the bill cannot be amended unless the entire bodyagrees to it. Toward the end of the session, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administrationdesignates bills from the General Orders calendar to receive priority consideration. These SpecialOrders bills are debated, amended, and passed in one day. A bill needs 68 votes to pass the House and 34 votes to pass the Senate. If the House and Senateeach pass the same version of the bill, it goes to the governor for a signature.In the House, the Calendar for the Day is a list of bills the House Rules and Legis- lative Administration Committee has designated for the full House to vote on. Members can vote to amend the bill, and after amendments aredispensed with, the bill is given its third reading before the vote of the full body is taken. The Housealso has a Fiscal Calendar, on which the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee orHouse Taxes Committee can call up for consideration any tax or finance bill that has had a secondreading. The bills are debated, amended, and passed in one day.8Session Weekly 23 Introduction The chief House author of the bill introduces it in the House; the chief Senate author introduces it in the Senate. Identical bills introduced in each body are called companion bills. The bill introduction is called the first reading . The presiding officer of the House then refers it to anappropriate House committee for discussion; the same thing hap- pens in the Senate.Committee The bill is discussed in one or more committees de- pending upon the subject matter. After discussion, committee members recom- mend action \u2014 approval or disapproval \u2014 to the full Houseand full Senate. The House committee then sends a report to the House about its action on thebill; the Senate committee does likewise in the Senate. Conference If the House and Senate versions of the bill aredifferent, they go to a conference committee. In the House, the speaker appoints three or five representa- tives, and in the Senate, the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration selects the samenumber of senators to form the committee. The committee meets to work out differences in the twobills and to reach a compromise.Governor Once the governor hasthe bill, he or she may:sign it, and the bill becomes law; veto it within three days; or allow it to become law by not signing it. During session, the House and Senate can override a governor's veto. This requires a two-thirds vote in the House(90 votes) and Senate (45 votes). The governor also may \"line-item veto\" parts of a money bill, or\"pocket veto \" a bill passed during the last three days of the session by not signing it within 14days after final adjournment.Floor The conference commit-tee's compromise billthen goes back to the House and the Senate for another vote. If both bodies pass the bill in this form, it is sent to the governor for his or her approval or disapproval. (If one or both bodies reject the report, it goes back to the confer-ence committee for further consideration.)4 5 9 11 10Floor After the full House or Senate accepts the committee report, the bill has its second reading and is placed on the House agenda called the General Register or the Senate agenda called General Orders. (A committee can recommendthat non-controversial bills bypass the General Register or General Orders and go onto the ConsentCalendar, where bills usually pass without debate.) After this point, House and Senate proceduresdiffer slightly.6a Law in MinnesotaMINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

Thevote was 78-48. The bill combines early childhood and fam- ily education finance proposals with highereducation and K-12 spending. But much ofthe money \u2014 $60.7 million \u2014 would go to K-12 spending. The omnibus bill includes a plan to suspend the state 's Profile of Learning initiative and provide local districts with other options toensure high standards for all students. Theplan also seeks to improve Internet access andaid districts in recruiting teachers. The measure also would shift $7.4 million in federal T emporary Assistance for NeedyFamilies (TANF) money in the current bien-nium for a variety of programs, including ef-forts to help provide child care for those onwelfare and those moving off welfare. The Senate has approved a much larger edu- cation spending plan that would provideabout $293 million. The spending bill 's fate will be negotiated by a House-Senate confer-ence committee. Here is a look at highlights of the House bill (HF3800), which is sponsored by Rep.Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington). Student accountability An amendment approved on the floor at- tached the House plan to deal with the Profileof Learning to the omnibus spending measure. Earlier this month, the House approved a separate bill (HF3618/SF3286*) that wouldput the much-criticized Profile on hold indefi-nitely, provide a new option called the NorthStar Standard, and allow districts more localcontrol in measuring student performance. By attaching the Profile revamp plan to the omnibus education funding bill, the Househas ensured that debate over the Profile ofLearning is now likely to occur on two fronts.Lawmakers are hoping not to repeat what hap-pened in 1999, when a conference committeeEducation spending Omnibus bill would supply additional funds forearly childhood, K-12, and higher education A House-approved education proposal would spend $60.7 million for K-12education, affecting students like the ones in this third-grade classroom at Jack-son Elementary School in St. Paul.could not agree on plans to alter the Profileand no changes were made. A part of the state 's Graduation Standards, the Profile was created to shift learning awayfrom textbooks and lectures and move it inthe direction of experiments, teamwork, re-search, and independent projects. Complaintsabout the Profile began to surface shortly af-ter its inception, however, prompting teach-ers, students and parents to call for change. Aid to recruit teachers A provision in the bill allowing for a special alternative teaching license for out-of-stateteachers would help districts fill teacher va-cancies caused byearly retirement,student enrollmentgrowth, and policiesrequiring class-sizereduction. The in classroomsoutside of Minne-sota a two-year are not unique tothis state, however.Some experts fore-cast as many as2 million openingsfor teachers nation-wide. Loan forgiveness programs included inthe education plan are viewed as a way Min-nesota can beat other states in capturing newgraduates with an eye toward teaching. The bill also includes loan forgiveness funds to help school districts, especially rural ones,recruit and retain qualified teachers in science,math and other areas. Vocational support The bill would add $11.3 million in second- ary vocational aid to the current appropriationfor fiscal year 2001. The money would help to preserve work training programs. Several high school students testified before the House K-12 Education Finance Commit-tee earlier this month in support of vocationalprogram preservation. When district fundingbecomes tight, they told members, work train-ing programs are often unfairly identified forcuts. The omnibus measure would also restore secondary vocational aid for fiscal year 2002.It would keep the aid at the lesser of $73 perpupil in grades 10 to 12, or 25 percent of theapproved program expenditures. Internet initiatives The House plan would provide $10 million in grants to fund high-speed Internet links inschools. House members, however, said they want to protect children from potentially harmfulimages that can be found on the Internet. The bill would require all public and char- ter school computers to be equipped withInternet filtering devices that would keep por-nographic and other obscene images out ofthe classroom. Most Internet providers can doso at a minimal charge, said Seagren. Library computers children have access to would also be covered under the plan. The bill would set aside funds for telecom- munications access grants to districts, and itwould establish a task force to examine andrecommend minimum technology standardsfor school districts.4 March 24, 2000IT'SAFACT Gov. Andrew R. McGill clearly knew it required delicacy to suggest that the Legis-lature end a corrupt practice without ac-cusing legislators of corruption. In his 1887 inaugural address, McGill called on lawmakers and other officials tostop taking free passes from railroad com-panies, but McGill did so carefully. Lawmakers in that era were accustomed to getting perks from the railroads. In fact,many state officials were unabashed aboutasking railroad companies forfree trips and for special ac-commodations aboard thetrains. The practice was so com- monplace that some officialsthought they were supposed toget free passes by virtue of theirposition in government. Andthe railroads were generallywilling to comply, althoughthey did it grudgingly in somecases. McGill sought to put an end to the situ- ation, but it seems the newly electedRepublican didn 't want to begin his term by offending the Legislature. Near the end of a long discussion of rail- road-related issues \u2014 from taxation of rail- road lands to grain storage by the railcompanies \u2014 McGill brought up the need for cheaper passenger fares. The size of the state and sparsity of the population demanded affordable transpor-tation to link people to the large cities andpublic institutions, McGill said. Yet he ac-knowledged that those same factors madeit impossible to have passenger rates as lowas in the \"thickly settled communities of the East. \" The governor noted the progress that had been made toward cheaper fares before hepointed out that more could be done. \"There is, I apprehend, one obstacle in the way which it is in your power to re-move, \" McGill said. \"I allude to among railroad companies ofissuing free passes. \" McGill built his argument around the idea that average citizens were paying morefor train tickets because the railroadA free ride Governor sought to end railroad freebies for public officials companies had to make up for all the free-bies they gave to politicians and others inpositions of power. And members of the public were aware that the amount they paid was in part dic-tated by the number of people who rodefor free, McGill said. In the book James J. Hill and the Opening of the West by Albro Martin, several anecdotes describe the situation thatprompted McGill 's actions. For example, the secretary of state in 1880 sent aletter to railroad owner JamesJ. Hill that plainly listed thenames of 21 state officials whowere to receive free tickets. And in 1884, a candidate asked for tickets and told Hillthat he would \"try to render some service in return. \" At some points, the governor 's polite and some- what indirect tone in his inau-gural address gave way to blunt criticism of the long-running practice. \"It is a custom which smacks of favorit- ism on one side and injustice on the other, \" he said. But McGill followed those words with an effort to assuage the egos of state officials. \"It may, however, be safely assumed that the influence of free passes on public men ismuch less than is generally supposed, \" he said. \"(T)he cases where it swerves them from duty are . . . too rare to merit consideration. \" The governor 's speech made a simple case for legislative action to end the prac-tice. The railroads could not be expectedto stop providing free tickets on their own,he argued, because the heavily regulatedcompanies could have met retaliation insome many ways. McGill concluded his remarks on the subject by calling the railroad giveaways\"a public evil \" and asking for \"suitable leg- islation to destroy it. \" The 1885 Legislature did not heed McGill 's suggestion, and some officials continued to request and receive free rail-road tickets for years to come. (N. H EAL Y) Gov. Andrew R. McGillHigher education spending The bill would provide about $11.6 million to the Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU) system to address unexpectedincreases in enrollment. The money \u2014 $5,792,000 in the current fis- cal year and $5,792,000 in fiscal year 2001 \u2014 would come from the state 's general fund. A separate portion of the bill would require MnSCU to establish and maintain a databasethat includes the location, description, andcondition of all facilities owned by the system.The same would be required of the Universityof Minnesota. The databases would have to be in place for the institutions to be eligible for bond fundingto repair existing buildings or construct newones. The U of M and MnSCU would have until2003 to assemble the information. Early childhood & adult programs Under the bill, additional funds would be devoted to Early Childhood Family Education.A total of $755,000 would be added to thefunding for the program in the second year ofthe current biennium. The bill also would revise the formula by which the state provides funds for Adult Ba-sic Education. The program offers academicinstruction necessary to earn a high schooldiploma or its equivalency for people age 16years and over. Classes are offered throughconsortia of school districts and public non-profit organizations. The current funding formula is based on the number of students served, which districtscomplain can be hard to predict from year toyear. The proposed new formula, to be effec-tive in the fiscal year that begins July 1, wouldconsider several factors, including the totalpopulation in the area served, the hours ofclassroom time, and the number of drop outsand people with limited English proficiencyin the area. Supporters say the new formula would pro- vide a more predictable base because it wouldbe tied to population, which is easier to pre-dict than enrollment. And the formula wouldbe tied to factors that indicate need for AdultBasic Education. The new formula would actually spend about $500,000 less this biennium than is fore-cast under the current formula. In addition, the bill would require Adult Basic Education providers to ask students fortheir Social Security numbers for economictracking and program evaluation purposes.The Department of Economic Security woulduse the numbers to see if graduates begin earn-ing more money after leaving the program. Continued on page 22Session Weekly 5MARCH 16 - 23 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #BUSINESS #CRIME #CONSUMERSElectronic pawn records Pawnbrokers who use computerized track- ing of items will be required to use a uniformelectronic format, under a new law signedMarch 23. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), who spon- sored the measure in the House, said about30 communities already ask pawnbrokers touse computerized tracking of items. Skoglundsaid his measure will make sure the electronicformats are all the same, enabling police ac-cess to a uniformed system for checking onpossible stolen goods. \"When you pawn an item, a ticket is written both for your protection and so the law enforce-ment can check records, \" Skoglund explained. There are approximately 300,000 transac- tions at pawn shops each year \u2014 far too many for police to check multiple systems or hand-written notes, Skoglund said. \"That 's just impossible to track, \" he said. \"It doesn 't work if the thief steals in one city and tries to sell in another city. \" The law will not require pawnbrokers to use electronic storage of information. However, ifelectronic tracking is used, it will have to beon the uniform system, under the law. While only a handful of cities require com- puterized tracking of pawn items now,Skoglund said he thinks more cities will fol-low, as they realize it is a better way to catchthieves and return stolen property to the right-ful owner. Finally, the computerized tracking of pawn items could lead to a reduction of thefts,Skoglund said. \"If people think the stuff they steal will get them convicted, they won 't steal it, \" he said. The measure is effective March 24. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) carried the legislation inthe Senate. HF3766*/SF3673/CH274 Limits on auto glass perks A bill that would limit auto glass rebates to $35 and redefine what costs insurance com-panies must pay for glass replacement passedthe House on March 22. The vote was 127-0. \"This is the peace treaty in the auto glass war,\" said Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville), spon- sor of the bill (HF2656).Wolf said glass companies, insurance com- panies, and the state Department of Com-merce all agree on the measure. According to an insurance company study last year, Minnesota 's auto glass replacement costs are 69 percent higher than the nationalaverage and are the highest in the nation.Many Minnesota auto glass dealers offer boxesof steaks, rebates of up to $200, or other in-centives to customers. Wolf offered a successful amendment that inserted Senate language which would estab-lish that insurance companies would pay themarket price for glass replacement, as deter-mined by a survey of costs charged in com-munities around the state, not just in the TwinCities metropolitan area. The House bill originally established the costs would be determined by averaging re-pair costs of three dealers in a county. Wolf said the most important part of the bill is it would no longer require insurancecompanies to pay for \"all reasonable costs \" for window replacement. The state Court of Ap-peals ruled earlier this year that \"reasonable costs \" included any freebies offered by glass companies. The new language in the bill would require insurance companies to pay the determinedmarket price based on the survey. Under the bill, insurance and glass compa- nies would voluntarily donate money to a sur-vey revolving fund. The Department ofCommerce would then coordinate the surveyof glass costs. There would be no cost to thestate for the survey, Wolf said. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) asked what would happen if the companies did notfund the survey. Wolf responded by saying theLegislature would immediately take the mea- sure up again, because the deal would havebeen broken. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) said he sup- ported the bill, but that it only takes care ofhalf of the problem. Currently, insurance com-panies steer consumers to certain glass com-panies, Tuma said, rather than telling themthey can go to local dealers who might installhigher quality glass. The House narrowly defeated an amend- ment by Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm) that would have required insurancecompanies to pass on any savings to custom-ers in the form of lower premiums. Theamendment failed on a 64-64 tie. \"It makes all the sense in the world, \" T omassoni said. Wolf said the amendment would have killed the bill. The measure now awaits the governor 's approval. Drug change delayed The prescription painkiller Carisoprodol will not be classified as a controlled substancefor at least one more year, under a law signedMarch 20 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. This is the third consecutive year the Legis- lature has delayed the effective date for classi-fying the painkiller and muscle relaxant.Under the law, Carisoprodol will become aschedule IV controlled substance on Aug. 1,2001. The previous law would have made thedrug a controlled substance on Aug. 1 of thisyear. Officials say they needed to delay the actionLobbyists, protesters, and other citizens voice concerns and mill about outside the door to the Housechamber March 22 before the session convened. 6 March 24, 2000#EDUCATIONanother year while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration examines the painkiller todetermine its effects. Under Minnesota law, a schedule IV con- trolled substance is a drug that has a low po-tential for abuse and it is currently acceptedfor medical treatment in the United States.However, abuse may lead to physical or psy-chological dependence. Doctors can prescribe drugs in schedule II to schedule V , but cannot prescribe drugs inschedule I. Classifying a drug like Carisopro-dol as a controlled substance would make itmore difficult for doctors to prescribe. The original law went into effect in 1997. The Legislature has already delayed imple-mentation of the schedule IV classificationtwice before this year. Scheduling is done on the state level, which is usually consistent with federal drug regula-tions. Carisoprodol is not a controlled sub-stance on the federal level. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul)sponsored the legislation. The law is effectiveAug. 1, 2000. HF2774/SF2485*/CH262 Profile revamp passes House The House passed a bill March 21 that would allow school districts frustrated with the prob-lems associated with the state 's Profile of Learn- ing initiative to implement a new option forschool accountability. The vote was 102-27. The bill would put the much-criticized Pro- file on hold indefinitely. The measure alsowould provide a new option called the NorthStar Standard and allow districts more localcontrol in measuring student performance. Districts would be able to use either the North Star Standard or tailor teaching to theneeds of their students, said Rep. T onyKielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), who was the chiefadvocate for the new initiative. The Profile was created to shift learning away from textbooks and lectures and moveit in the direction of experiments, teamwork,research, and independent projects. Under the Profile, students are required to perform various tasks in core learning areasthat have practical applications for life beyondthe classroom. While completion of Profile tasks would no longer be required for student graduationpurposes if the bill were to become law, teach-ers would still be allowed to use tasks foundin the Profile as a guide to gauging studentunderstanding, Kielkucki said. The bill (HF3618/SF3286*), sponsored by Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel) was significantlyaltered on the House floor March 16, when members voted to attach the North Star Stan-dard provisions to the legislation. After theKielkucki amendment went on, a vote on pas-sage of the bill was delayed until March 21. The North Star Standard, Kielkucki said, would ease the Profile 's practical skills orien- tation. It would provide rewritten standardsin such basics as science, math, English, andhistory. Under the plan, students would have to complete credits in up to 10 learning areas.Teachers would still be able to assign projectsdesigned to test a student 's ability to under- stand and apply subject matter, but suchhands-on demonstrations would no longer bea standard requirement. The House bill still must be reconciled with a Senate version of the legislation that doesnot include the North Star Standard initiative. The House later attached its Profile revamp plan to a separate education funding bill(HF3800), which means the debate over theProfile of Learning is now likely to occur ontwo fronts.

Currently farmers can qualify for the pro- gram once they have been unemployed as aresult of economic conditions or because ofnatural disasters. The bill would expand eligibility to farm- ers who have experienced a significant reduc-tion in income due to inadequate crop orlivestock prices, crop failures, or significantloss in crop yields due to pests, disease, ad-verse weather, or other natural phenomenon. Sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy), the bill was sent to the House RulesCommittee. Kay Hegge, the flood and farm recovery coordinator for the Northwest Regional De-velopment Commission, said that the processthrough which farmers become unemployeddiffers from other workers. She said farmersdon't receive a pink slip and that closing down a farm can take years, due to a variety of legalreasons including tax consequences. \"Last year 's state and federal assistance bought time but in some cases it bought falsehope, \" she said. Hegge said that over the past 14 months more than 200 farmers in her region, whichhas about 5,500 farmers, quit farming. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), thecommittee chair, said that the dislocated work- ers program is funded by employers and is setup so that those who lay off workers end uppaying for their training. He said there is aconcern that because farmers haven 't been paying into the program, it may not be fair toexpand eligibility. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) pointed out that displaced homemakers qualify underfederal definitions as dislocated workers andthus precedence has been established thatwould allow further expansion to the farmersaddressed in the bill. Hegge said Greater Minnesota needs to be- gin to come up with alternatives for thoseunable to make it in farming, other than mov-ing out of the area. \"We want to keep people there and people want to stay there, \" she said. Banning gasoline additives A bill that would ban gasoline additives that have caused severe water pollution in somestates was passed March 22 by the House. Thevote was 129-0. Kay Hegge, the flood and farm recovery coordina-tor for the Northwest Regional Development Com-mission, testifies for a bill that would expandeligibility and provide training grants for specifiedworking farmers and dislocated farmers. Heggespoke during a March 17 hearing of the HouseJobs and Economic Development FinanceCommittee.Session Weekly 7The bill (HF3292/SF2946*), sponsored by Rep. Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea), would al-low gasoline to contain only compoundsare alternative fuel additives to ethanol. Currently, those additives are not used in Minnesota 's gasoline supply. But as other states ban the chemicals, Dorman said gaso-line with those additives could be sent to Min-nesota unless it is banned here. The Senate version of the bill would allow gasoline in Minnesota to contain 0.5 percentof those additives, which can be monitored atgas pumps. Rep. Margaret Anderson Kelliher (DFL- Mpls) proposed to reduce that threshold sothat only 0.1 percent of the compound wouldbe allowed in gasoline in Minnesota. Heramendment was approved. Dorman supported that change, which had also been approved by the House Environmentand Natural Resources Policy Committee,based on recommendations from the Pollu-tion Control Agency and the Weights andMeasures Division of the Department ofPublic Service. Gasoline is moved through common pipe- lines throughout the country, so traces ofthose chemicals can be found in almost allgasoline. The bill now moves to the Senate.#ETHICS Underwater lumber recovery A bill that would allow people to salvage logs from lake and river bottoms was approvedMarch 21 by the House Ways and MeansCommittee. Under the bill (HF2559/SF2546*), a person or company that wants to salvage a log that isunderwater would apply for a lease throughthe state Department of Natural Resources.The fee for a lease would be $500 for Minne-sota residents and $2,500 for those who liveoutside the state. T erms of the lease would be negotiable.Logs could be salvaged only if they are sub- merged at depths of 20 feet or more. The leasewould require that precautions be taken toavoid disturbing the bottom of the lake orriver. Some of the proceeds from the leases would go to the state 's general fund, and some would go to the game and fish fund. If the lake orriver is on school trust fund lands, the moneywould go into the permanent school fund. The state also would receive 25 percent of the money from the sale of the logs, based onthe weighted average selling price. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), now moves to the House floor. Ethics complaint examined Members of the House Ethics Committee are considering whether there is probablecause to continue investigating an ethics com-plaint against Rep. Arlon Lindner(R-Corcoran). Four DFL House members filed a complaint against Lindner based on comments he madeto Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), dur-ing a floor debate Feb. 23 about the Houseprayer. In the complaint, Lindner is charged with violating the norms of House behavior, bring-ing the House into dishonor, and suggestingmembers of the House should be excludedfrom proceedings. Reps. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin), Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), and Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls)signed the complaint. The committee met March 20 and 21, tak- ing direct testimony and rebuttal to establishwhether there was probable cause that thecharges are \"more probably true than not. \" A decision has not yet been announced. If the committee finds there is probable cause, it will schedule another hearing wheremore testimony and evidence can be broughtforward. At that time the committee wouldthen make its recommendation to the fullHouse whether Lindner be reprimanded, cen-sured, or expelled. Entenza said that he and the other repre- sentatives who brought the complaint don 't want Lindner to be either censured or #GAME & FISH Rick Morgan, attorney for Rep. Arlon Lindner, tes-tifies March 20 in front of the House Ethics Com-mittee. The committee was holding a hearing todetermine if there is probable cause to supportcharges that Lindner violated House rules.expelled. He said that if Lindner had apolo-gized, they would have dropped the complaint. During debate Feb. 23, there was an ex- change between Paymar and Lindner regard-ing respect for all the religions represented inthe House and how the prayer delivered be-fore each floor session should represent a cer-tain level of religious diversity. At one point, Lindner responded to Paymar, who is Jewish, by saying, \"don't impose your irreligious left views on me. \" Those are the words the complaining parties objected to. Lindner 's attorney, Rick Morgan of Minne- apolis, said the representative meant the term\"irreligious left \" to be a political term in op- position to the words \"religious right. \" However, Entenza and others contended that the context of the debate \u2014 House prayer \u2014 suggested the terms could have been inter- preted as a religious attack. Lindner said he was shocked that a mem- ber was being called to answer for words heused in debate. He argued that a seldom-usedHouse rule suggests that a member can neverbe called to answer for debate unless mem-bers object right away. \"Here I am, before you, because I exercised my First Amendment rights in a debate on theHouse floor, \" Lindner said. \"Actually, I 'm charged for what someone thought I said in-stead of what I actually said. \" Lindner has not apologized publicly for his comments. Several committee members said they were offended by the words Lindner used. But Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) said that doesn 't mean he shouldn 't be allowed to say them. Davids said he feared that if the com-mittee votes to continue the investigation, thecommittee will be charged with designating a\"speech patrol \" for House debate. \"I think what he did was wrong, \" Davids said. \"The day we can 't allow ourselves a little leeway on the House floor to speak freely, isthe day we can no longer represent the peopleof Minnesota. \" Permits for disabled hunters A special hunting permit will be available to people who have a permanent disability,under a new law signed March 20 by Gov. JesseV entura. The permit will allow people with certain medical conditions to use a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle while hunting in the state 's wildlife management areas. The law will allow the commissioner of natural resources to issue such permits topeople who cannot step from a vehicle8 March 24, 2000#GOVERNMENT#HEALTH #HUMAN SERVICESwithout the aid of a wheelchair, crutches, braces, or other means of support. Permits will also be available to people who have heart or lung conditions and requirebreathing assistance. Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R-Cedar) and Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May T ownship) sponsoredthe legislation. The law is effective Jan. 1, 2001. HF2603/SF2346*/CH265 Clarifying access to data A bill that would clarify state policies for accommodating requests for public data wasapproved March 16 by the House State Gov-ernment Finance Committee. Under the bill (HF2481), sponsored by Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center), gov-ernment data that is stored on computerwould be included in state law that applies toother types of public documents. Current law allows people to inspect public data free of charge, but government entitiescan charge costs for making copies of publicdocuments. Carruthers said the bill would clarify that those laws, known collectively as the DataPractices Act, should apply to electronicallystored data. The bill also would set up an alternative dis- pute resolution process for situations where aperson has a conflict with a government en-tity, for example, a disagreement regardingwhether certain information is public. Itwould allow people in those situations to filea complaint with the state Department ofAdministration instead of going to court. Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) asked how the bill would affect one of his own requestsfor public information. He said he had askedthe Minnesota Department of Transportationfor public documents on the subject of lightrail, including e-mails. But the department responded that his re- quest would cost nearly $100,000, Krinkie said.He said those costs would include paying stafffor several weeks to scan, retrieve, and storethe information, plus hardware and softwarecosts of $51,000. Carruthers said current law seems to apply to that type of situation, and the bill wouldclarify that the department would not needto provide copies of the e-mails and otherdocuments, but that the inspection of the datashould be free. The bill now moves to the House Rules Committee.Nursing mother jury duty A judicial task force will suggest possible changes to jury rules for nursing mothers, un-der a law signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura onMarch 23. The Supreme Court Jury Reform Task Force has been instructed to study the issue and sug-gest recommendations to accommodate theneeds of nursing mothers who are selected forjury duty. The House approved the Senate language earlier this month. Previously, the House billwould have exempted all nursing mothersfrom jury duty. Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) and Sen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the new law. HF1865*/SF2094/CH269 Prescription drug discount cards The House passed a bill March 22 that would prohibit the sale, marketing, promo-tion, or distribution of cards offering dis-counts for prescription drugs that fail to meetcertain requirements. The vote was 129-0. The bill (HF2883/SF2579*), sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), would al-low an individual or the state attorney gen-eral to sue to stop any act and obtain damagesany deception may have caused. The measure is an attempt to protect con- sumers from promised discounts that are con-fusing or not backed by insurance policies. Discounts that are deceptive or that are not authorized by contract with the pharmacieslisted on the cards would be in violation if thebill were to become law. Also, discount cards would have to promi- nently state that the discounts are not con-nected to health insurance. Language in the bill would not apply, how- ever, to vision care, glasses, or contact lenses pro-vided by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Discounts promised under contract with the state of Minnesota or a consumer discountcard issued by a store for use at that particu-lar store would also be allowed. Furthermore, a card administered by a health insurer, nonprofit health service plancorporation, or HMO would be exempt un-der the bill. The bill was sent to the Senate. Safe haven for infants The House passed a bill March 21 that would provide a safe place for unwanted new-borns. The vote was 130-0.The bill (HF2945), sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior), would allow the motheror a person who has the mother 's permission to leave the child at a hospital. As long as the child is less than 72 hours old and is unharmed, the mother would notface penalties from police or social servicesagencies. \"Hopefully this bill will take away some of the desperation of that young mother, \" Sykora said. Sykora argued on behalf of the House bill over the Senate version. The House bill would allow hospitals a 24- hour window to report that they have receiveda newborn, which, Sykora said, would give themother adequate time to leave the area. The House bill also does a better job of clari- fying that it is not a crime to leave the child atthe hospital, Sykora said. The bill would call for hospitals to ask the mother about her medical history, althoughthey would not be required to answer anyquestions. Sykora 's bill would allow hospitals to pro- vide a numbered identification bracelet to themother, to help link the parent to the baby incase reunification is sought later. But posses-sion of such a bracelet would not allow themother to take custody of the baby on de-mand. The bill comes on the heels of some highly publicized cases where young mothers haveabandoned their newborn children, includinga case where a baby was found in a dumpster. Sykora said people in desperate circum- stances need a better option. \"Sadly enough, it seems like something we need to do today, \" she said. \"This provides that safe place. \" Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) expressed concern about the specifics of language thatwould require the newborn be unharmedwhen left at the hospital. She wonderedwhether the bill would make it possible for awoman to be charged with a crime if she useddrugs or alcohol during her pregnancy. Sykora said that would not be the case. She said it would be difficult to know at the timeof the drop off if the child suffered from anydrug-related problems. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Minnesota is among 23 states cur-rently considering legislation to provide drop-off places for unwanted newborns. In September 1999, Texas became the first state to enact such a measure after a rash ofabandonments took place in the Houston area,according to the paper.Session Weekly 9HEALTH CARE RALLY #TAXES #TRANSPORTATIONBloomington resident Bill Blom joins about 300 others in a March 22 rally in the Capitolrotunda seeking a cost of living adjustmentfor workers in programs that serve peoplewith disabilities. The event was organized bythe Minnesota Consortium for Citizens withDisabilities. Wadena County exemption A new law will provide a one-time exemp- tion to Wadena County from a truth-in-taxa-tion publishing requirement. Due to an oversight, the required public notice of the public hearing was not published,House sponsor Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee) said during a Feb. 22 hearing on thebill. She said the county 's auditor was new to the position. At the same time as preparing for thetruth-in-taxation process, the auditor was alsoinvolved in administering a special election. The county did meet its requirement of mailing notices to all taxpayers. The state Department of Revenue ruled that the county did not substantially comply withstate truth-in-taxation laws because of the fail-ure to advertise the public hearing. The rul-ing would have required the county to use itsprevious year 's levy. Under the law, the county will be able to use its payable 2000 levy that was adopted atthe public hearing. During a House Taxes Committee hearing of the bill, department officials expressed con-cern about setting precedence by exemptingthe county from meeting its requirements. Assistant Commissioner Jenny Engh said that the department supplies a checklist thatclearly lays out each requirement of the truth-in-taxation process. Daggett said that the mistake was not de- liberate, and since the county had met its othernotification requirements, the county 's tax- payers were sufficiently made aware of thepublic hearing. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The law becomes effective upon local approval. SF2554*/HF3039/CH258 Spending plan cuts light rail The House passed a $425 million transpor- tation spending bill March 21. The bill fea-tures $350 million in spending from thegeneral fund and another $75 million in TrunkHighway Funds, mostly for road upgrades.The vote was 81-46. The bill also would require that the state cancel appropriations previously approved forlight-rail transit and return the unspentmoney, estimated to be about $92 million. In the past two years, the Legislature has approved a total of $100 million for the 11-mile Hiawatha light-rail line. Elimination ofthe bonding money does not have clear sup- port in the Senate and is opposed by thegovernor. The bulk of the funding in the bill would be used for road upgrades. Those road up-grades would be split evenly between the TwinCities and Greater Minnesota, with $201 mil-lion spent on each area. The bill (HF2891) is sponsored by Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska). Besides the fund-ing items, the measure includes a study of thefreeway ramp meters in the Twin Cities. Themeters would be turned off to allow study ofthe impact on traffic. Molnau defended the $400,000 cost, saying her committee wants a thorough independentstudy that shows complete results of theexperiment. Another provision of the bill would require the Metropolitan Council to complete long-range plan for Metro Mobility, a program thatprovides transit for seniors and people withdisabilities. The study would put Metro Mo-bility on equal footing with Metro Transit, thecity bus system. The Met Council has alreadyprepared a long-range plan for Metro Transit. The bill also would provide $450,000 in as- sistance for outstate communities to establishtransit services.A handful of amendments were attached to the omnibus bill on the House floor, but thoseprovisions did not change the major fundingplans. Molnau offered an amendment that would allow the cities of Shorewood and Minnetonkato opt out of Metro Transit programs in favorof systems operated by the cities. Her amend-ment passed 70-58. \"Many of us have limited, almost no ser- vices, \" Molnau said. Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen), who chairs the House Transportation Policy Com-mittee, said that the tax dollars collected inShorewood would equate to a $70 one-wayride into Minneapolis because of the relativelyfew bus routes and riders in the city. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) spoke against the Molnau amendment, saying thatpoorer communities would not be able to optout. \"This continues to undermine our public transit system, \" Orfield said. An amendment offered by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) was also approved.Trimble 's amendment would eliminate the public safety motor vehicle surcharge. Trimblesaid the account now has $15 million unspentdollars. His amendment would turn themoney into grants for rural area ambulanceservices. Trimble said the surcharge, which was origi- nally supposed to be a one-time fee, is simplyno longer needed. The House rejected an amendment offered by Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) that wouldhave cut license tab fees and created a multi-modal transportation fund. The idea is simi-lar to a plan supported by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The proposal also would have placed a con- stitutional amendment on the November bal-lot to permanently devote revenue generatedfrom the motor vehicle sales tax into a fundthat could be used for light rail, busways, orroads. \"It goes a long way towards addressing the things we need to be looking at this year, \" said Correction The March 17 edition of Session Weekly contained an error related to committeetestimony by Leslie Davis, president ofEarth Protectors. A photo of Davis accom-panied a story on transportation funding,and the photo caption incorrectly de-scribed Davis ' testimony. It should be made clear that Davis spoke March 13 insupport of a proposal to cancel the un-spent remainder of the state funds forlight-rail transit in the Hiawatha Corridor.We regret the error.10 March 24, 2000Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Cottage Grove.) Marko found fault with the omnibus bill 's focus on highway construction. \"The House bill before us doesn 't treat tran- sit very well, \" Marko said. \"Where is transit in this bill? We are looking for a long-term fix. Ifnot now, when? \" Molnau opposed the Juhnke amendment, saying the plan did not clarify where roadimprovement money would be spent. \"There is nothing in this amendment that says Greater Minnesota gets a dime, \" Molnau said. Transit revenue debated The House Taxes Committee considered a bill March 17 that would abolish the propertytax levy by the Metropolitan Council for pub-lic transit in the Twin Cities area. The measure would appropriate money from the general fund to replace the levy. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), who is sponsoring the bill (HF4087), said that theTwin Cities ' reliance on property taxes to fund transit is unique. According to a 1998 Legislative Auditor 's re- port, property taxes provided 43 percent of theBlue lights for collector cars Collector vehicles would be able to display unique blue lights, under a bill the Housepassed 123-0 on March 22. Currently, blue lights are only allowed on road maintenance equipment, snow removalvehicles, emergency vehicles, and motorcycles. Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen) is sponsoring the bill (HF3053), which wouldallow a blue light of one inch in diameter aspart of the rear brake lights. Bill Strusinksi of the Minnesota Street Rod Association told the House TransportationPolicy Committee last month that many of thecollector cars have very tiny rear brake lightsand the lights are not as bright as modernbrake lights. Struskinski said collector cars would be safer because the brighter blue light wouldmake the rear brake light more visible. Dennis Lazenberry of the Minnesota State Patrol said he does not object to this modifi-cation, but cautioned that he doesn 't want to see more modifications in the future. The bill now goes to the Senate.Minneapolis-St. Paul area 's transit operating funds, compared with an average of 2 percent inMinnesota 's other metropolitan areas. McElroy said he wants to make sure the pro- vision would be included in the discussion ofthe governor 's proposal to transfer funds from the motor vehicle sales tax into a new multi-modal transportation fund. Under the bill, the Met Council 's authority to levy would end in 2001. The state wouldthen appropriate $118 million to the councilto provide transit services for that year. The bill would provide a permanent reduc- tion in each municipality 's homestead and agri- cultural credit aid equal to the Met Council 's transit levy. The bill also would require the MetCouncil to provide grants to municipalities thathave opted out of the transit system and pro-vide their own transit services. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), com- mittee chair and a co-sponsor of the measure,said the bill sets the stage for the next level ofdebate on transit funding. He said that debate on transit issues will be limited until the reliance on property taxes isresolved. McElroy 's measure is included in the om- nibus tax bill advancing in the House. THE STATES50 Hard time 35 states provide felony DWI penalties Felony convictions for multiple drinking and driving offenses are already practicedin 35 states, according to the National Sur-vey of State Laws. Another 13 states raise drinking and driv- ing offenses to felony-level crimes if a per-son is injured or killed, if the driving causesdamages, or a child is in the car. None of the states with felony DWI con- victions match the \"four violations in 10years\" proposal that is moving forward inthe Minnesota Legislature, according to thereport. Several states provide for a felony after a third DWI conviction. West Virginia, Illinois,Iowa, Vermont, Arizona, Nevada, and Kansascall for a felony charge for a third offense,regardless of the time lapsed between of- fenses. South Dakota, Alaska, Delaware, and Mis- souri bring felony charges for an offender'sthird drunken driving offense within fiveyears. Michigan, Louisiana, and Texas have afelony charge for a third offense in 10 years. Missouri law specifies that a felony DWI can be expunged after 10 years if no newalcohol-related offenses have occurred dur-ing that time. Oklahoma law calls for a felony on a sec- ond offense in a 10-year span. A convictioncalls for one to five years in jail and a $2,500maximum fine. New York, Idaho, and Indianaalso have felony DWI laws for second of-fenses.While some states, such as Arkansas and Illinois, send felony DWI convicts to prison,most states with felony DWI laws currentlyincarcerate the offender in local jails. Two states \u2014 Oregon and Tennessee \u2014 never raise drunken driving to a felony. Currently, Minnesota law provides for a gross misdemeanor conviction for the sec-ond and subsequent violations. A third violation calls for a minimum 30 days in jail or eight hours of community ser-vice for each day not served in jail. State law does provide for a felony when the offense causes substantial body harmor death. (C. V ETTER )Session Weekly 11AT ISSUE: BONDING # # # BY JON FURE The House passed a bonding bill March 23 that would spend about the same as Gov. JesseV entura 's capital investment proposal. The vote was 94-39. The bill (HF4078), sponsored by Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), would use slightly lessthan the governor 's recommendation of $400 million in general obligation bonding. The governor arrived at the $400 million figure by taking the average amount of bond-ing bills over the past 15 years. Some lawmak-ers have argued that the figure is too low, butKnoblach said that he and other committeemembers decided to accept the governor 's guidelines. \"We think the $400 million is reasonable, \" Knoblach said. \"Certainly there are many com- peting needs \u2014 there always are \u2014 but we 're trying to focus on projects where the state hasa clear mission and not as much on localprojects. \" A 1999 law established criteria for evaluat- ing requests for bonding projects. The projectswere ranked according to whether they woulduse state and non-state funding, help fulfill amission of regional or statewide importance,and be supported by all governing bodies im-mediately affected by the project. Projects earned negative marks if they would require additional state funding foroperation, expand the state 's role into a new policy area, create serious inequities amonglocal jurisdictions, or compete with other lo-cal facilities. Under the House bill, nearly $526 million would be spent from the sale of bonds for capi-tal investment projects statewide. Thatamount includes $32 million that has beencancelled from old bonding projects. The billwould use $2 million in cash directly from thegeneral fund, $68.6 million in user-financedbonds, and $20.6 million from the TrunkHighway Fund, in addition to $399.9 millionin general obligation bonds. The numbers are similar to the amounts proposed by Gov. Jesse V entura in his capitalbudget plan.Building plans House bonding plan lines up with governor'srecommendations only on the bottom line Ventura 's plan called for $499 million for capital projects, including $37 million in can-cellations. The governor asked for $400 mil-lion in general obligation bonding, $1 milliondirectly from the general fund, $34 million inuser-financed bonds, and $27 million from theTrunk Highway Fund. Here are some highlights of the House bill. U of M facilities Overall spending for higher education would be $169.9 million under the bill, compared to$118.3 million under the governor 's plan. For the University of Minnesota, the bill would spend $2 million to plan and design anew Art Building, which would not be fundedunder the governor 's plan.T otal bonding for the U of M in the House bill would be about $66.7 million. The gover-nor recommended $54 million in bonding forthe university. MnSCU construction Projects in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) system would receive$103.2 million under the bill, compared to$64.3 million in the governor 's plan. Anoka-Hennepin T echnical College would receive $12.5 million under the House bill forroof repairs; improvements to the heating,ventilating, and air conditioning system; andother necessary repairs. Initially, the MnSCU board decided to close the campus because it couldn 't afford to make the necessary repairs. Ventura 's plan did not recommend funding the repairs. The Houseproposal would keep the campus open. The bill would provide $6.9 million for con- struction of athletic and academic facilities atMinnesota State University, Mankato. Themoney would be part of the Taylor Centerproject, which benefited from a $9.2 million The Taylor Center athletic facility, now under construction on the campus of Minnesota StateUniversity, Mankato, would receive $6.9 million in the House bonding proposal. But the House bill would not fund the governor 's recommended $10 million for the Microbial and Plant Genomics building at theU of M campus in St. Paul. Other projects at U of M campuses in St. Paul, Crookston, and Morris would receivefunding under the bill. A total of $9 millionwould go to maintenance and repair projectson all U of M campuses, which is $7 millionless than the university requested.donation from Minnesota Timberwolves owner and Mankato businessman Glen Taylor. The House bill would match the governor 's proposed $30 million for maintenance andrepair projects throughout the MnSCU sys-tem. MnSCU requested $100 million formaintenance and repair, and officials said atleast $56 million would be needed to preventthe system 's $500 million maintenance back- log from growing even larger.12 March 24, 2000The House bill specifies that maintenance and repair money would pay for severalprojects that were line-item vetoed by Venturalast year, including a new boiler system forWinona State University, demolition of oldhomes on property owned by Moorhead StateUniversity, and the completion of a heatingand air conditioning project at the Hutchinsoncampus of Ridgewater College. The House bill would not fund an infor- mation technology center at MinneapolisCommunity and T echnical College, whichwould receive $11.7 million under thegovernor 's plan. Other MnSCU campuses that would receive funding under the House bill include North-west T echnical College in Bemidji, St. CloudState University, Northland Community T ech-nical College in Thief River Falls, Winona StateUniversity, and Rochester Community andT echnical College. K-12 and early childhood education The bill would spend $51.5 million for K-12 schools and early childhood educationfacilities. The governor 's plan would spend $34.1 million in those areas. The bill would spend about $1.8 million less than the governor 's plan for magnet schools in the metropolitan area. Other communitiesthat would receive funding for school projectsunder the House bill include Caledonia, LaPorte, Red Lake, and Cass Lake. State buildings The bill would spend a total of $48.5 mil- lion for building and maintenance projects forstate agency buildings that are used by stateagencies and departments. The governor 's plan would spend $93.4 million for thoseprojects. One of the governor 's top priorities is $58 million for a new building for the Bureauof Criminal Apprehension. But the House billwould spend only $28 million to build a labo-ratory facility. The bill also would not fund repairs to a building used by the Department of Healthon Delaware Street in Minneapolis. V enturasought $4.3 million for that project. A provision in the House bill would pro- vide additional money for maintenance tostate buildings or schools. It would allow anorganization, such as a state department or acollege, to retain money from bonding rev-enue if the project is completed for less thanthe expected cost. Currently, if a project costs less than the amount that is bid, the money is returned tothe state. The bill would allow the organiza-tion that uses the building to retain thatmoney for asset preservation.The bill includes $150,000 for a World War II memorial on Capitol grounds, a project thatwas line-item vetoed by Ventura in 1999. Corrections projects Spending for correctional facilities in the House bill is nearly the same as Ventura re-quested. The House bill would spend$16.7 million, compared to the governor 's pro- posed $19.5 million. The Stillwater prison would receive $1.5 million to make security repairs, includ-ing work to replace crumbling sections of thewall around the prison yard. The proposal also would fund projects for Faribault, Oak Park Heights, Lino Lakes, andRed Wing. The House plan would spend$3.1 million less than the governor 's plan for the Faribault project, which calls for sewerrepair at the facility. And the House bill in-cludes a $2.7 million storm sewer project atBayport that is not in the governor 's plan. Environment and agriculture The bill would spend about $21 million less than the governor 's plan for projects related to agriculture, environment, and natural re-sources. The governor 's plan would spend about $7.3 million more than the House bill forbuilding projects in state parks and offices forthe Department of Natural Resources. The House bill would include $7 million for grant programs to help cities clean upbrownfields, which is not in the governor 's plan. Brownfields are parcels of commercialland that are idle or under-used due to highcosts of cleaning up pollution problems.Wastewater system improvements would receive $32.6 million, under the House bill.The money would provide matching grants tocommunities through the Public FacilitiesAuthority, which is part of the Department ofTrade and Economic Development. The Board of Water and Soil Resources would receive $20 million for the Conserva-tion Reserve Enhancement Program under theHouse bill. The program is matched by fed-eral funds, and it establishes conservationeasements on agriculture land along the Min-nesota River, which reduces soil erosion intothe river, helps control flooding, and estab-lishes wildlife habitat. The bill would require the board to deter- mine if it would need additional funding foradministrative costs if the Legislature were toappropriate $20 million in 2001 and 2002,which would fully fund the program. A totalof $140 million in federal matching funds isavailable through September 2002. The governor 's plan would spend $25 mil- lion for that program, which would bematched by about $58 million in federal funds. Transportation improvements The bill would spend $44 million for repairs to bridges throughout the state, while thegovernor 's plan would spend $30 million. Rail Service Improvement Loans would not receive funding under the governor 's plan but would receive $5 million under the House bill. The House bill would not fund a proposed $6.7 million Regional Transportation Man-agement Center. The House bonding bill includes $28 million for construction of a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion lab, while continuing to use the existing facility, shown here. The governor had recommended $58million to replace the facility. Session Weekly 13AT ISSUE: GOVERNMENT # # # The House passed a far-reaching state government spending measure March 20 that would appropriate a net total of $83.9 million yet thisbiennium. However, that money would come from federal funds and designated state spending funds. The bill (HF2699), sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), also would produce a net savings of $27.7 million to the gen-eral fund over the course of the 2000-01 biennium.A tall order Welfare changes and other noteworthy measures areincluded in a thick omnibus bill that would fund a widearray of government programs The House debated the omnibus bill and about 60 proposed amendments for about 12hours before passing it on an 85-42 vote. The most significant portions of the bill, which also elicited the most debate, were thehealth and human services items, includingpenalties for failing to meet the state 's welfare- to-work requirements, a waiting period forabortions, and increased eligibility for a pre-scription drug program. The bill also includes spending for agricul- ture, judiciary, environment, state govern-ment, and economic development. Gov. Jesse Ventura did not submit a supple- mental budget for this session. He only madesuggestions for emergency and deficiencyspending, some of which were included in thebill. Health, human services spending The state would actually reduce general fund spending on health and human servicesfor the 2000-01 biennium by $47.1 million.However, the bill $90.5 millionin federal T emporary Assistance for NeedyFamilies funds over the biennium and $4.6million from the Health Care Access fund topay for provisions. The bill would devote $10 million from the general fund for diabetes research at the Uni-versity of Minnesota. The bill also would fundmeasures to prevent out-of-wedlock preg-nancy and youth at-risk to enter prostitution. Welfare reform Welfare recipients could face tougher sanc- tions if the state finds they have failed to com-ply with work requirements of the MinnesotaFamily Investment Program. All benefits would be cut off if the recipient was out of compliance for a sixth time. How-ever, a hearing and a re-view of the recipient 's case file would be re-quired before case clo-sure could occur. The House adopted an amendment to thebill that would require acounty agency to moni-tor children in house-holds where benefitshave been discontinued.Members were con-cerned about the well-being of those children. Prescription drugs Disabled people un- der age 65 who are onMedicare would benefitby a provision of the billaimed at expanding eli-gibility for enrollment in the state 's senior pre- scription drug program. The state program provides funds to help pay for prescriptions, which are not coveredby the federal Medicare system. The bill also would make more people eli- gible to receive help paying for drugs bydoubling the asset limit for inclusion in the program. Abortion provisions Women seeking an abortion would have to meet \"informed consent \" requirements before they could undergo the procedure. Whether in person or over the phone, the woman would have to receive certain infor-mation at least 24 hours before the abortioncould be performed, according to the bill. The measure would require a woman to be given certain information pertaining to theprocedure and other options. Nursing homes The bill would increase state reimbursement rates for nursing homes, mainly in rural Minnesota, that receive lower payments than other homes in the state. It also would appropriate $21 million in one-time grants to homes for staff enrichmentactivities such as retention, recruiting, devel-opment and training.Trishalla Bell of Minneapolis holds 1-year-old Rosemary Abdul-Salam, right , as her sister, 4-year-old Anna, waits while members of the Welfare RightsCommittee meet with House members outside the House chamber duringdebate on the state government appropriations bill.14 March 24, 2000Alternative health care The omnibus bill would establish an office of unlicensed complementary and alternativehealth care. Alternative health care practitioners include people who provide services such asacupressure, energetic healing, aromatherapy,herbalism, and meditation as a means to alle-viate sicknesses. The bill would eliminate criminal sanctions for practicing alternative health care. The planwould establish an office to regulate the in-dustry by investigating complaints againstunlicensed practitioners, dispensing disci-pline, and serving as a center for informationon complementary and alternative health carepractices. Streamlining committees A plan to establish joint House and Senate standing committees is included in the bill.The idea was proposed this year as an alterna-tive to a unicameral legislature. The plan, proposed by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), would allow a bill to be heardby a group of lawmakers from both chambers,as opposed to the current system where sepa-rate versions of a bill are heard by separatecommittees at different times in the House andSenate. Under the proposal, a joint committee would pass one bill that would advance in eachchamber. The bill would go back and forth between the House and Senate, and each chamber could amend the bill until one ver-sion is agreed upon. The plan would reduce the need for con- ference committees, McElroy said.A raise for the governor The governor 's salary would increase from $120,303 to $150,000 per year, and salaries ofconstitutional officers and other state officialsalso would be allowed to increase. Many officials ' salaries are based on a per- centage of the governor 's pay. Some agencies and departments have requested exemptionsto the limit, due to the difficulty of findingqualified candidates. The bill would raise themaximum salary for all such positions. A hold on telecommunications A program known as Connecting Minne- sota would temporarily be stopped under thebill. The program involves installing a fiber op- tic cable network and other telecommunica-tion infrastructure throughout the state. But a recent order from the Federal Com- munications Commission expressed concernsabout possible anti-competitive effects of theprogram. The bill would cause the program to cease until those concerns are resolved. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) said the provision could cause the state to breach acontract related to the program. The state hasa contract with Universal CommunicationNetworks Inc., and the company has indicatedthat it would sue for damages if the bill be-comes law, Entenza said. An analysis from the state Department of Finance and theOffice of the Attor-ney General esti-mates that the statecould fordamages million to$35 million if acourt were to ruleagainst the state. Abolishing offices The Office of T echnology, theBoard of Govern-ment reducestate spending by $4.2 million in the current biennium. The bill also would repeal the governor 's authority to abolish or merge departments inthe executive branch. That issue gained notice when Gov. Jesse Ventura decided last year to merge the PublicSafety and Commerce departments, without first consulting the Legislature. No design-build The bill would repeal a part of the 1999 omnibus transportation finance law that gavethe Department of Transportation an exemp-tion to bidding laws. That law allowed the light-rail transit project along the Hiawatha Corridor to use adesign-build method. The design-buildmethod employs a single contractor for boththe design and construction of the project,instead of awarding separate bids for designand construction. The bill would prohibit the state from us- ing the design-build method for any state con-struction project, until policies andregulations for that method can be established. Modifying bleacher laws The bill would modify a 1999 law that es- tablished new safety requirements for allbleachers that are taller than 30 inches. Thoserequirements would apply only to bleachersstanding 55 inches (nearly 5 feet) or higher. The law requires bleachers to include guard- rails or safety nets, and spaces between floor-boards, seats, and guardrails cannot exceedfour inches. New bleachers would have to meet those requirements by Aug. 1, 2001. Existing bleach-ers up to that date would be exempt if the gapsdo not exceed nine inches. The bill would effectively exempt short sets of bleachers that are commonly placed inparks near sports fields, so that local commu-nities and school districts would not be forcedto replace them or equip them with safety nets. Secretary of state funding The bill would allow the Office of the Sec- retary of State to keep money it takes in fromUniform Commercial Code transactions. People who file the transactions pay a sur- charge, and that money goes to the state 's gen- eral fund. The surcharge generates about $2.3million per year in revenue to the general fund,but the office receives only about two-thirdsof that amount for the related costs, accord-ing to Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer. Under the bill, the office would be allowed to keep revenue from those transactions, andits general fund budget would be reduced infuture biennia. Environmental spending A total of $11.4 million from the general fund would be spent on environment-relatedprovisions, under the bill. Of that amount, $5 million would create a new state program similar to the federal Crop Re- Thousands of acres of trees in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area were blowndown during a severe storm in July 1999. The state government appropria-tions bill includes funding for emergency firefighting in the area, wheredowned trees have created a fire risk. Photo courtesy of the University of Minnesota Department of Forest ResourcesSession Weekly 15serve Program. Farmers would be eligible for grants to set aside cropland for three years. Stripsof trees would have to be planted on a small per-centage of the land that is set aside, which wouldprovide various environmental benefits. The bill also would authorize the state to pay $4 million for costs related to a U.S.Supreme Court decision that upheld the hunt-ing and fishing rights of the Mille Lacs Bandof Chippewa Indians and others. Anticipated costs of $1.5 million for emer- gency firefighting expenses in the BoundaryWaters Canoe Area is also included in the bill.Thousands of acres of trees were blown downby a storm last summer and those trees nowcreate a fire hazard in the recreation area, of-ficials say. Appraising state lands The University of Minnesota, Duluth would conduct an inventory and appraisal of statelands within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area,under a provision that was added to the billMarch 20. The state owns about 100,000 acres of land, known as school trust land, in that area. Mostof the land was donated from the federal gov-ernment when Minnesota became a state. The state-owned land is located on various parcels and is surrounded by federal land.Revenue from the land, through leases and thesale of logging rights, goes to the state 's per- manent school fund. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said the inventory would determine exactly how manyacres of land belong to the state and provideother detailed information about the land. Rukavina said that information would al- low the state to negotiate a land exchange withthe federal government, so that the state-owned parcels would be separate from the fed-eral land. Opponents of the measure said the $200,000 cost of the inventory and appraisalwould reduce the amount of money that goesinto the permanent school fund. But Rukavinasaid the inventory would identify more state-owned land, which would increase the amountof money that goes into the school fund. Judiciary finance Several crime prevention and judiciary sys- tem measures are also included in the bill, butit also reflects more of a cost savings for theoverall measure. The bill includes $3.8 million for emergency disaster disbursement from damage relatingto storms in 1998 and 1999. The measure would eliminate the Office of the Ombudsman for Corrections as of fiscalyear 2001. It also would hike fees for petty and grossmisdemeanors and would require that juve- nile offenders who are turned over to theDepartment of Corrections must be placed inMinnesota facilities. Key judiciary spending measures are included in a separate bill (HF2688), known as \"Katie 's Law\" for Katie Poirier because it includes many measures designed to protect the public fromsex offenders. That bill, passed by the House ear-lier, would appropriate $13.9 in fiscal year 2001from the general fund and another $2.3 millionfrom the special revenue fund. Total spending for the two judiciary mea- sures is $20 million. DWI penalties Included in the bill is the felony DWI mea- sure, which would make a person 's fourth con- viction for drunken driving within a 10-yearspan a felony, including possible prison time. Currently, the maximum penalty for drunken driving is a gross misdemeanor. Endangering children Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) offered an amendment on the floor that would raisethe maximum penalty for people who endan-ger the health of children. The amendmentpassed 118-5. Wenzel referred to the amendment as the \"Jessica Swanson legislation, \" saying the mea- sure would ensure that people who are respon-sible for the death of a child get reasonableprison sentences. (Swanson, a Cannon Fallsgirl, was killed by her mother 's boyfriend, who got what many considered a light sentence af-ter pleading guilty to child endangerment aspart of a plea agreement.) The measure would raise the maximum penalty for child endangerment from 10 yearsin prison and a $10,000 fine to 20 years inprison and a $20,000 fine. The measure wouldincrease the sentencing guideline, as well, soanyone found guilty would serve at least 40months in prison. Auto theft program The bill would abolish the Auto Theft Pre- vention Board. The board, comprised of law enforcement and public safety officials, is required to de-velop and implement statewide strategies tocombat automobile theft. Currently, the program collects $1 per year on all auto insurance premiums. That moneyis then disbursed through grants to local lawenforcement agencies to fight auto theft,through more officers, \"bait cars, \" and other methods. About $5.7 million in surplus from the board 's account would be transferred to the general fund, and any remaining funds wouldalso go to the general fund. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) argued in favor of keeping the pro-gram, noting that car thefts have droppedsince its inception. \"For the mere price of a cup of coffee, we are seeing auto thefts going down, \" she said. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City), who of- fered the proposal as an amendment, said carthefts are likely down because there are morepolice or because more offenders are now injail. Osskopp said that if auto thefts climb nextyear, he would be willing to reinstate theboard. Juvenile offenders Juvenile offenders would be required to go to the state juvenile facility in Red Wing or aprivate facility within the state, unless thereare safety reasons to transfer the juvenile outof Minnesota. The bill would require a report stating the reasons for transferring juveniles elsewhere. Corrections officials say the state is losing revenue because so many juvenile offendersare not staying in state institutions. T o help counties pay for juvenile incarcera- tion and keep more of them instate, the billwould require the counties to pay only halfthe per diem costs, instead of the full amountcounties currently pay. The Department ofCorrections would be responsible for the re-maining half of the costs. Funds for agriculture The portion of the bill dealing with agri- culture would provide funding for farm pro-grams, activities, and research. The bill would appropriate $5.8 million through fiscal year 2001, including about $4.8million from the general fund. It also would appropriate $135,000 to the commissioner of the Department of Agricul-ture for a grant to develop farm business soft-ware to complement existing farmmanagement tools. The bill would provide new funding for re- search and demonstration on farm water qual-ity and quantity management. Work would bedone on contract sites in Lamberton andWaseca. Stopping pseudorabies The bill would provide $245,000 to the Board of Animal Control to continue vacci-nations against pseudorabies, a highly conta-gious disease that causes respiratory andreproductive problems in swine. The 1999 Legislature approved $1.25 mil- lion for the vaccination program. In addition, a resolution asking the state of Iowa to accelerate its program of swine pseu-16 March 24, 2000dorabies control and eradication was deemed unnecessary and was deleted from the billMarch 20 by the House. Ethanol funding The bill would provide supplemental fund- ing for the state 's ethanol producer payment program by increasing the maximum paymentto producers by $3 million. Producers that had payments capped at be- tween 12 million and 15 million gallons peryear would be given an eligibility of 15 mil-lion retroactive to July 1, 1999, under the bill. Changes to loan programs An increase in maximum state participation in several farming loan incentive programswould occur under the bill. Those programs include beginning farmer loans, restructured loans, seller-sponsoredloans, and agricultural improvement loans. The bill also would address changes to rules regarding eligibility in the restructured loanand livestock expansion loan programs. New funding would be provided by the bill for an agroforestry loan program. Theagroforestry loan program would help financethe production of short-rotation wood cropsin Minnesota. A stipulation would require that agroforestry program grants be matcheddollar-for-dollar by non-state money. Program caps expanded Eligibility caps for some Rural Finance Au- thority programs would be increased, and anincrease in Agriculture Chemical Responseand Reimbursement Account funding wouldbe provided for farm sites where clean-up ac-tivities are particularly expensive. The current cap of $200,000 for a correc- tive action would be expanded to $350,000. Meat inspection Approximately $500,000 in additional money would be appropriated by the bill tothe commissioner of agriculture for the state 's meat inspection program. Half of the additional money would be re- imbursed by the United States Department ofAgriculture. Economic development The bill would appropriate money for a number of economic development provisions,focussed on technology development and pro-grams to train workers. As rural areas struggle to keep workers in the area and develop alternatives to a struggling farmeconomy, the metropolitan area faces the chal-lenge of a developing technology economy andtraining workers to meet the changingneeds. McElroy, the chair of the House Jobs andEconomic Develop-ment Finance Com-mittee, said althoughthe committee didn 't have great deal offunding to work with,several different eco-nomic developmentissues are addressed. The bill would spend $283,000 fromthe general fund and$500,000 from federal T emporary Assistancefor Needy Families funds. Initiatives are alsofunded from a shift in money saved from theDepartment of Commerce taking over dutiesof the Department of Public Safety and thecancellation of a Department of Trade andEconomic Development program. Rural development initiatives Among the provisions that would assist Greater Minnesota is a $1.5 million appropria-tion for catalyst grants to local governmentsto expand Internet access in rural Minnesota. The communities eligible for the grants would not typically receive Internet accessthrough existing technology. The bill also would provide $750,000 for grants to economic development agencies forlabor force assessments that will identifyareas where the area 's workforce skills and education are being underused. Penalties for worker deaths The bill would also increase penalties in cases where a worker dies on the job due in part tocompany violations of workplace safety laws. The bill would provide new fines if a serious, willful, or repeated violation of an U.S. Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration stan-dard causes or contributes to an employee 's death. Penalties would range from $25,000 to$50,000, depending on the violation. McElroy said the provision aims to address an inequity in current law where the family of aworker killed on the job receives little compen-sation. He said even with the proposed increasein fines, those fines go to a state workers ' com- pensation fund and not to the families. Homeless assistance The problem of homelessness, identified by the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency as asignificant statewide issue, is also addressedin the bill.The bill would appropriate $500,000 to the state 's Family Homeless Prevention and As- sistance Program. The program providesgrants to recipients to assist families, youth,and individuals who are homeless or at theimminent risk of becoming homeless. No bust for Blackmun The House voted to remove a provision from the bill that would have commissioneda bust of former U.S. Supreme Court JusticeHarry A. Blackmun. The bust would have been installed on the second floor of the State Capitol opposite thebust of former U.S. Chief Justice WarrenBurger. Only three Minnesotans have served on the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 Blackmun, Burger, and Pierce Butler. Rep. T ony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), sponsor of the amendment, said that Butlerhas not been honored in the Capitol and thatbills proposing commemorative work are usu-ally heard by the House Governmental Op-erations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee, which had not heard this pro-posal. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) said the amendment had been added during the HouseWays and Means Committee 's hearing of the bill. He said that he offered the proposal be-cause of Blackmun 's historical contributions and because he was a St. Paul native. The location across from the Burger bust in the Capitol is currently unoccupied,Trimble said, and would seem to be the idealplace to honor Blackmun, who wrote thecourt 's opinion in the Roe v. Wade case. Trimble said that the Historical Society would not receive a state appropriation for thework but had agreed to complete the projectusing private funds. The House passed a bill that would provide additional funding for ethanolproduction at plants like this one in Claremont.Session Weekly 17AT ISSUE: TAXES # # # BY DAVID MAEDARebates, permanent tax reductions, and continued agricultural assistance are all part of the omnibus bill approved March 22 by the House TaxesCommittee. The bill (HF4127), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), was sent to the House Ways and Means Committee.Choice cuts House tax plan would reduce taxes and provide rebates More than $1.3 billion in tax relief during the current biennium and $1.7 billion in thenext biennium are included in the bill 's pro- visions. While there is little disagreement that with continuing budget surpluses the time is rightfor tax cuts, there is some disagreement overwhere the cuts should come from. Abrams, the committee 's chair, said the bill would provide income and property tax re-ductions for nearly all Minnesotans, as wellas relief for farmers and the state 's businesses. But Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) disagreed with the bill 's approach. \"I don 't think this bill provides the best way, or thefairest way, to provide taxrelief for citizens, \" Carruthers said. Matt Smith, commis- sioner of the state Depart-ment of Revenue, arguedthe bill as a whole is notstructurally balanced. Smith said that according to current forecast numbers,the administration believesthat spending and tax cut ini-tiatives for the next bienniumshould not exceed a com-bined total of $549 millionper year. \"It's inescapable that not everything in the bill will be able to be enacted, \" Smith said. \"In a word, the bill is too big. \" But Abrams countered by saying that the past 17 budget forecasts have been wrong andthat, using the administration 's own structural balance criteria, the tax bill the governorsigned into law last year was not balanced. The current bill would provide an indi-vidual income tax rate reduction in all three brackets. The middle bracket would receive thelargest cut from 7.25 percent to 6.5 percent. Wayne Cox, the executive director of Minne- sota Citizens for Tax Justice, said under the pro-posal, 60 percent of the state 's taxpayers, those with incomes under $45,000, would receive lessthan taxpayers in the top one percent in income. Duane Benson, the executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, said that theincome tax cuts are important for the state 's businesses to attract and retain qualityworkers. \"The notion of long-term competitiveness,The proposal differs from last year 's rebate in that it would allow those taxpayers with aqualified dependent to increase their rebateamount by either $20 per dependent or theamount the rebate would increase when thedependent 's income is added to the taxpayer 's income, whichever is greater. Abrams said another key component of this year's tax relief plan is a proposed increase in the percentage of earning used in calculatingthe working family credit. The earned income tax credit provides a wage supplement equal to a percentage of theearnings of low-income people. The state 's working family credit is also based on a per-centage of earnings. Abrams also pointed to the proposed ex- pansion of the levy basis of the educationhomestead credit and the education agricul-tural credit as another key portion of the bill. Further agricultural aid would be provided in an agricultural assistance program similarto one established last year. Farmers in coun-ties that have been declared by the presidentas weather-related disaster areas would qualifyfor assistance equal to $4 per acre. The maxi-mum payment would be $5,600. The eligiblecounties include Kittson, Marshall,Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, and Roseau. The bill also would provide for compression in class rates for all property classes with a rateover 1 percent. The largest reduction would befor regular or market-value apartments and forcommercial/industrial properties. The bill wouldreduce those rates by 0.4 percent. Jack Horner, from the Minnesota Multi- Housing Association, said the property taxrelief is badly needed and will help address thegrowing rental housing shortage in the state. Glenn Dorfman, from the Minnesota Asso- ciation of Realtors, said the tax relief providedin the bill is necessary and sustainable. Hecomplimented the bill as providing substantialrelief this year, saying when it comes to incomeand property taxes, taxpayers are always toldsomething will be done the next year. \"The revenue forecasts are always conser- vative, \" Dorfman said. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) reminded Dorfman that this year 's tax bill continues reductions from last year. \"Those who say 'next year will never come ' forget that last year ever happened, \" Rest said. the bill takes a grand step in that direction, \" Benson said. A sales tax rebate similar to last year 's is also included in the bill. The minimum rebateamount for married couples would be $129,with a maximum of $1,860. The minimum forsingle filers would be $73, with a maximumamount of $930.Matt Smith, commissioner of the state Department of Revenue, told theHouse Taxes Committee March 21 that its omnibus bill calls for tax cutsthat would be too large.18 March 24, 2000HISTORY # # # BY CHRIS VETTER Gov. Jesse V entura isn 't the only chief ex- ecutive of Minnesota to have his mug spreadacross the cover of a national magazine. Norwas he the first whose nationally noted inter-view sparked some political controversy. On the Aug. 13, 1973, issue of Time , Gov. Wendell Anderson sported a broad smile as heproudly displayed a northern pike he pulled froma Minnesota lake. Dominant on the cover wasthe headline, \"The Good Life in Minnesota. \" The 12-page spread in the magazine fea- tured 25 photos, showing Minnesota 's glisten- ing lakes, Minneapolis ' art centers, and the state 's prominent citizens. The issue, then sell- ing for 50 cents, sold out at most area storeswithin a few hours, according to news reports. Much of the article read like an advertise- ment or tourism pamphlet, tempting peopleto visit the state. \"If the American good life has anywhere survived in some intelligent equilibrium, itmay be in Minnesota, \" the article stated. \"Some of the nation 's more agreeable qualities are evident there: courtesy and fairness, honesty,a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellec-tual adventure and responsibility. \" The piece opened with a description of chil- dren at a lake, calling the scene \"a slice of America 's Norman Rockwell past. \" Several Minnesotans were interviewed, proclaimingthe state is the best place to live and raise afamily. Along with the praise, the article joked about mosquitoes \"half the size of dive bombers \" and mentioned the harsh Minnesota winters. The section concluded with a one-page fea- ture on Anderson, in which the writer suggestedthe governor could be a vice presidential candi-date in 1976. Several local newspaper reportsabout the Time article focused on the prospects of Anderson in Washington. Heaping praise upon Anderson, the article noted that he had a good camera-presencewhile campaigning. And it said Anderson pos-sessed \"athletic dash and youthful charm that make many of his constituents think of a Mid-western Kennedy. \"Political cover The current governor isn't the first to receive attention from the national media or to catch criticism for it Minnesota is known for its clean political process, its low high school dropout rate andlow crime rate, the article said. The variety ofactivities offered \u2014 from skiing, hunting, or theater productions \u2014 make the state an at- tractive place to live. Even though it was great press for Minne- sota and exposed its tourism industry toTime 's 4 million subscribers and 20 million readers in 1973, not all Minnesotans liked thestory, according to newspaper accounts. \"Women have con- demned the feature forignoring the state 's fe- male notables. Republi-cans have criticized thestory for mentioningonly Democrats, \" wrote the St. Paul Sun . \"And Democrats have accusedTime of writing a cam- paign piece for Andersonand his party associates. \" Among the nine poli- ticians mentioned in thearticle, only one was aRepublican \u2014 former Gov. Harold Stassen. The Minneapolis Tri- bune agreed, saying the ar- ticle focused on onlypeople close to Anderson. \"The article does not mention Attorney Gen-eral Warren Spannaus,Senate Majority Leader Nicholas Coleman orother DFLers who do not have close relationswith the governor, \" the Tribune article said. \"Nor does it make more than passing refer- ence to any state Republicans. \" The Minneapolis Tribune also said, \"The maga- zine cover story that boosted Gov. WendellAnderson to national prominence was shapedconsiderably by David Lebedoff, the governor 's close friend and political advisor. \" The newspaper contended Lebedoff supplied Time with a list of people, many of whom were interviewed in the story. One unnamed Demo-crat quoted in the Tribune story said, \"The way the governor 's people cultivated, fertilized and nurtured (the article) was masterful. \" The three \"average citizens \" quoted in the story all had direct ties to the Anderson administra-tion or to Lebedoff, the Tribune wrote. They were all young rising politicians who worked forAnderson during his 1970 campaign. The Time feature inaccurately credited Ander- son with creating a legal protection for the St.Croix River, said the Minneapolis Tribune . In- stead, the newspaper reported, the law actuallyoriginated at the federal level, where Sen. WalterMondale was responsible for the legislation. But criticism of the article went beyond political matters. Several members of the Af-rican-American community said the articleperpetuated a culture of racism in U.S. soci-ety during the early 1970s. Gleason Glover of the Minneapolis Urban League was quoted bythe Time article as hav- ing said the problems ofracism and unemploy-ment in the state at thattime were \"manageable. \" The article said 1 percentof the state 's population was black. Glover later said the Time story omitted part of his sentence, whichput some conditions onhis statements. \"In general, blacks seem to feel that Time Magazine's description of Minnesota was good forthe state 's national reputa- tion, but rather bad for itsblack residents, \" wrote the St. Paul Sun. A St. Paul woman told the Sun that the maga- zine gave the impression that, \"Minnesota is a good place if you want to get away from theblack folk and so forth. \" Anderson continued to be questioned about the feature weeks after it appeared. In aSept. 9 Minneapolis Tribune article that same year, Anderson defended his role in workingwith the weekly magazine. \"We cooperated 100 percent with Time ,\" he said. \"To fail to do so would have been unwise and not in the best interests of the people ofMinnesota. \" Gov. Wendell Anderson appeared on the cover of Time during the summer of 1973, but not without a swirl of controversy.

Jennings yield to a question? \" THE STATES50 Since the 1950s, states have been placing limits on driving an automobile under theinfluence of alcohol, but only in the past fewyears have lawmakers focused attention onthe dangers of drinking while boating. Most states have passed blood-alcohol concentration limits for boaters and havemoved to extend other provisions ofdrunken driving laws to boating. Forty-eight states have set a legal blood- alcohol concentration limit of 0.10 or lowerfor boating and drinking. Florida, Georgia,New York, and Wisconsin set limits at 0.02 orlower \u2014 essentially \"not a drop\" standards\u2014 for boaters under the legal drinking age. The U.S. Coast Guard advocates a 0.08 standard. The Coast Guard says a boat op-erator with a blood-alcohol concentrationabove 0.10 is ten times more likely to bekilled in a boating accident than a boaterwith no alcohol in his or her system. On average more than 800 people a year are killed in boating accidents. Alcohol playsWater safety States move to reduce drunken boating a major role in over 50 percent of recre-ational boating fatalities, according to theCoast Guard. Minnesota has seen its share of alcohol- related boating accidents, including a 1999tragedy on the St. Croix River that killed fivemen. Tests found that all of the men werelegally drunk when their two powerboatscollided in the middle of the night. However, the U.S. Foundation for Boating Safety reports that 75 percent of alcohol re-lated boating accidents and injuries do notinvolve actual collisions. Such things aspeople falling on deck or overboard andmissteps at the dock are a greater threat,according to the foundation. During 1998, Washington passed a law establishing the offenses of homicide orassault by watercraft. Several other state laws that year extended implied consent provi-sions in existing drunken driving laws toboating. Implied consent means that a per-son who accepts the privilege of operatinga vehicle, in this case a boat, automaticallygives consent for a test to determine his orher blood-alcohol level. A Minnesota law passed in 1997 applied the state's DWI laws to operators of boats,snowmobiles, and other off-road vehicles.The laws set the blood-alcohol concentrationlimit at 0.10 and include an implied consentprovision. The state's penalties for drunken opera- tion of an automobile, boat, or snowmobileare cumulative, meaning a person convictedof boating while drunk who is later pickedup for illegal operation of a snowmobile willface penalties associated with a second DWIoffense.Session Weekly 21HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking new laws, vetoes Once a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23). This information is also available on the governor's Web site (www.governor.state.mn.us).Select the \"It's a New *The legislative bill marked with an asterisk denotes the file submitted to the governor.FEBRUARY 1 - M ARCH 23 CHAPTERS 251 - 275 251 2980 2763* Fishing season modified. 2/16/00 252 2634 2411* Northern hospital board membership requirements modified. 3/1/00 253 2521 2320* Lake Edwards township name change. 3/1/00 254 76 86* K-12 education technical changes provided. modifications. 3/7/00 2535* 2291 Shorewood authorized to by wards. 3/13/00258 3039 2554* Wadena County truth in taxation process advertisement requirement penalty exemption. 3/13/00 259 3338* 2907 Scott County officials duties reorganized.

Federal funds for programs The bill would shift $7.4 million in federal TANF money for state programs during thecurrent biennium. A total of $3.2 million would establish a Minnesota Family Investment Program(MFIP) Social Services Child Care pool toprovide child care assistance for welfare par-ticipants who are receiving mental healthtreatment or chemical dependency treatmentas an approved activity in the participant 's employment plan or job search support plan.Currently, MFIP , which is the state 's welfare reform initiative, does not provide child carefor MFIP participants for the amount of timenecessary to participate in such treatment.Another sum of nearly $1.1 million wouldhelp to ensure people moving off welfare canget child care through the Basic Sliding Feeprogram. The bill calls for another $1 million in TANF funds for transitional housing and $1.8million for an English as a second language and citizenship grants. Finally, the omnibus measure would desig- nate TANF funding for male responsibilitygrants, which support programs to teach teensabout demands responsibilities of parent-hood. Last year, the Legislature allocated$250,000 in the fiscal year that begins July 1,but the bill would eliminate the general fundspending and pay for the grants through thefederal money.

Colorful depictions of Minnesota 's flora and fauna abound in the State Capitolbuilding, though the artwork of fishes,popular denizens of the state 's rivers and 15,000 lakes, is difficult to catch sight of. Maybe Capitol architect, Cass Gilbert, and decorator, Elmer Garnsey, were notavid fishermen like the 2.1 million anglerswho trek across the state each year to catchwhat 's biting. Since fishing in Minnesota is such a ma- jor phenomenon, it seems unlikely that anydesigns are not found on the building 's walls. Fishing is so popular that in past years, the Legislature would take a recess so asnot to miss the frenzy of the governor 's annual fishing opener in early spring. Insome years, even Mother 's Day had to take a back seat to the thrill of getting a nibblefrom some unsuspecting walleye or north-ern on opener weekend. Even when winters are harsh, true Min- nesota fishermen and fisherwomen are notdeterred. The hardy souls will check alake's ice depths until it is strong enough to hold a hut \u2014 a simple enclosure that may resemble an outhouse \u2014 and when it is time, they drag it out onto the ice byvehicle, or construct one over a favoritespot on the lake.Reflections Inside, they drill a hole in the ice to drop a line and continue their favorite pastime,undeterred by sub-zero weather. Depend-ing on how elaborate the house is, it maycontain all the comforts of home includ-ing cots and heaters, with four or moreice holes for visiting fishing buddies. Such an example was made recently for daytime television. Governor JesseV entura visited with ABC-TV 's \"The View \" co-host, Lisa Ling on a frozen lake, to pursue the art of ice fishing. Whetheror not a fish was actually caught, the \"gov\" pulled up one over a foot longer than hisguest 's catch. While ice-fishing is unique, in winter and summer, fishing lovers attend festi-vals and contests where they try to catchthe largest walleye, bass, trout, or any of156 fish species in competition that swimthe state 's lakes and streams. No contes- tants have recently topped the 17 pound,8 ounce walleye caught a few years ago. Y et, avid sportspeople are driven to spend $1.9 billion on sport fishing to visitthe 6,000 fishable lakes and 15,000 milesof stream each year. While few if any fishes are found in theCapitol building 's motif, a few renditions are seen in the State Office Building. Art-ist Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison)has many of his works in his office withothers on exhibit around the building. Rep. T om Bakk (DFL-Cook) has three large mounted lake trout he caught whileice fishing, while Rep.Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton) has amounted walleye withan otter in pursuit inher office. The most impressive fishes in the buildinghang in the basementcafeteria. They are an8-foot never be caught,but Minnesotans may still have difficultyfor some time in breaking the record forthe largest fish caught \u2014 a 94 pound, 4 ounce lake sturgeon from the Kettle River. Presently for them, this is the \"big one that got away. \" \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERT MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

The measure includes across-the-board in- come tax cuts, reductions in property class rates,farm relief, and a $489 million sales tax rebate. The bill (HF4127) passed by an 85-47 vote in the House and now goes to a House-Senateconference committee to reconcile differenceswith the Senate tax plan. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the bill 's sponsor and the House Taxes Committeechair, said the measure would \"permanently and significantly reduce the tax burden onevery Minnesotan. \" Noticeably absent from the proposal is Gov. Jesse V entura 's primary tax cut proposal this year, a reduction in motor vehicle license reg- istration fees. Abrams said that the state 's license tab fees rank between 21st and 23rd nationally andthat he and other House members are moreinterested in reducing the taxes where Min-nesota ranks in the top 10.Tax cuts passed The House plan would reduce income taxes, provide rebates,and make a long list of changes in tax laws House Minority Leader Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) said that because the billdoesn 't rely on the Department of Finance 's budget projections, it calls for cuts that are toolarge to maintain balance in the budget. AndPugh pointed out the governor has indicatedthat he will not sign the bill if it reaches hisdesk. Much of the six-hour floor debate centered on the proposed income tax rate reduction forthe upper bracket. Members offered severalunsuccessful amendments to delete that pro-vision and provide further agricultural assis-tance, property tax relief, license tab cuts, orretroactive sales tax rebates. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said the bill doesn 't provide enough relief for enough Minnesotans. \"Seventy-six per- cent of the peopleof this state underyour income taxcuts are going toget less than a bucka week, \" Rukavina said. Pugh said al- though he agreedwith some of thebill's provisions, it would provide toomuch relief for thestate 's highest in- come taxpayers. \"There is money for the lower taxbracket, and a littlerelief for ruralMinnesota, \" Pugh said. \"But that money is just spilled along the way in com-parison to what happens for the upper class,the elite earners, who get up to 50 times therelief as some of our working class inMinnesota. \" Majority Leader Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) said that the bill 's income tax cutsare important for the state 's economic devel- opment. He said that with an emerging tech-nological world economy, the state has to finda way to remain competitive and keep its busi-ness and workers in the state. \"We now live in an economy where with a click of a mouse you can take data, capital,money, information, and goods and electroni-cally whip them from Minneapolis toMoorhead to Montevideo to Malaysia toMilan, \" Pawlenty said. \"Y ou don 't need to be here in Minnesota in the year 2000 if you 're an entrepreneur in the new economy. \" Abrams said that most members could agree on what was at the base of the bill. \"We believe that not collecting the money in the first place or sending it all back is in thebest interest of all Minnesotans, \" he said. \"Gov- ernment ought to collect only the revenuenecessary to do the job that governmentshould be doing. \" Here are some of the bill 's major provisions. Cutting income taxes The bill would reduce individual income tax rates in all three brackets. The top rate, which is applied to income over $85,450 per year, would be reduced from8 percent to 7.5 percent, The middle rate, which is on income from $21,240 to $85,450 per year, would be reducedfrom 7.25 percent to 6.5 percent And the bottom rate, which is on income below $21,240, would be cut from 5.5 percentto 5 percent. Taxes for transit The Twin Cities ' transit funding would shift to the state, abolishing the property tax levyauthority of the Metropolitan Council fortransit in the metro area. Under the proposed change, the Legislature would appropriate money from the generalfund to replace the levy. The Met Council 's authority to levy would end beginning in 2001. As a result, $118 million would then be ap- propriated to the Met Council to provide tran-sit services for that year. The bill would providea permanent reduction in each municipality 's homestead and agricultural credit aid equalto the Met Council 's transit levy. The bill also would require the Met Coun- cil to provide grants to municipalities thathave opted out of the transit system and pro-vide their own transit services.House Speaker Steve Sviggum displays the lunchbox he brought to his deskduring debate of the omnibus tax bill, containing provisions the RepublicanCaucus has dubbed the \"Lunch Bucket Agenda for 2000.\"4 March 31, 2000IT'SAFACT Light-rail transit funding The bill would prohibit local units of gov- ernment in the metropolitan area from levy-ing a property tax for light rail. Officials from Hennepin County testified that they have agreed property taxes will notbe used for the proposed Hiawatha light-railproject 's operating costs. But they said they will need to levy for construction costs. A successful amendment offered by Pawlenty would require Hennepin Countyvoters to approve the county 's levy for the light-rail project as part of this fall 's general election. Pawlenty said that light rail represents a new direction for the state, and with the contro-versy and questions surrounding the project,a referendum would help clear up concerns. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) argued against the amendment, saying that countyroad projects too are often surrounded by con-cern and that the light-rail project was notunique in that regard. Corporate income taxes Under current law, most corporations are taxed according to a three-factor formula,based 70 percent on sales, 15 percent on prop-erty, and 15 percent on payroll. Because of this,corporations that have facilities and employ-ees in the state are often taxed more than out-of-state competitors who pay the state 's corporate taxes based on their sales, Abramssaid. The bill would change the formula to an 80 percent sales, 10 percent property, and 10 per-cent payroll tax ratio for 2000, and a 90 per-cent sales, 5 percent property, and 5 percentpayroll ratio thereafter. Solid waste tax rates In 1997, the solid waste management tax was enacted with the intent to raise about$44.5 million per year. However the amountraised since then has exceeded that amount.In 1999, the tax raised about $49 million. The tax is levied on solid waste services that are purchased by households, businesses, andgovernment agencies. It applies to the disposalof materials, so it is designed to give incen-tives for recycling. The bill would lower the tax rates propor- tionately to a level that is estimated to raisethe $44.5 million per year. Sales tax rebate The bill would provide a sales tax rebate similar to last year 's rebate. The minimum amount for married couples would be $129,with a maximum of $1,860. The minimum for Continued on page 17One criticism of the current legislative process is that too much power is in thehands of conference committees. Critics do not like the fact that small pan- els of lawmakers produce conference com-mittee reports that cannot be amended bythe full House or Senate. Each chambermust accept the entire conference commit-tee report or reject it. Controversy of that stipulation can be traced all the way back to the T erritorialLegislature 's constitutional convention of 1857. Residents of the territory voted for del- egates to the constitutional convention ina June 1, 1857 election. Due to allegationsof fraudulent voting, Democrats and Re-publicans organized separate conventions,and each drafted a state constitution. T o resolve conflicts between the two documents, a \"compromise committee \" \u2014 five members from each party \u2014 was ap- pointed to work out the differences.Whenthey finally reached a compromise in lateAugust and submitted the proposed stateConstitution to their respective parties,nobody was completely happy with the re-sults, according to the 1921 book A History of the Constitution of Minnesota by William Anderson. Thomas Galbraith, a Republican mem- ber of the compromise committee, pre-sented the Constitution to his fellowRepublican delegates, calling it \"as good a Constitution as we could get under the cir-cumstances. \" He also said that adopting one document was \"paramount to all other questions, in order to avoid a prospectivestate of anarchy. \" Some of his fellow party delegates voted against the Constitution,but no amendments were proposed. In the Democratic convention, delegates tried to amend the boundaries of the judicialdistricts and other items that were specifiedin the compromise committee 's document. But Willis A. Gorman, a Democratic member of the compromise committeewho was the territorial governor from 1853to 1856, strongly opposed allowing amend-ments to the report, especially consideringthe difficulty both sides experienced inreaching a compromise in the first place. \"If the report of the committee of confer- ence is to be amended by this convention, wemay safely calculate on sitting here for weeksbefore we can finish our labors, \" Gorman said. \"If we are to open the door by the adoption of a single amendment to this report, no onecan predict when we shall end. \" Some of his fellow delegates were unin- spired by his speech and continued propos-ing amendments. But a recess was called for\"private consultation \" regarding the report. When the Democratic convention re- sumed that afternoon, all of the amend-ments were voted down and thecompromise report was adopted. The votewas 38-13. Gorman 's speech was fitting, because he probably knew better than anyone howhard it had been to reach a compromise. The compromise committee had begun meeting Aug. 18, and by Aug. 25, the com-mittee members had virtually given uphope that they could reach a compromise. They began making plans to submit two constitutions to voters, when Gorman andRepublican Thomas Wilson came to blows,which observers later said was like \"a thun- derstorm in clearing the air. \" Suffrage was one of the major points of disagreement. At the time, only white maleswere allowed to vote, but Republican del-egates of Minnesota 's constitutional conven- tion wanted to give the right to vote to allmales. The issue was resolved by establishing an easy process of amending the Constitution.A simple majority in the Legislature couldsubmit a constitutional amendment to vot-ers. It could be adopted by a majority ofthose who voted on the question. It was the easiest amending process of any state in the nation, according to Ander-son. Republicans favored the compromise,because it would allow them to put the suf-frage question before voters as soon as theytook control of the Legislature. That theory proved correct, as the ques- tion was put before voters twice before itwas adopted in 1868. (J. F URE)A deal's a deal Drafters of a compromise on the Minnesota Constitution fought to keep their agreement intactSession Weekly 5MARCH 23 - 30 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #CRIME#BUSINESS Liquor license provisions Cities would have more control over issu- ing liquor licenses to local theaters, under abill the House passed March 24. The vote was98-31. Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie) is spon- soring the omnibus liquor bill (HF3974/SF3581*), which now heads to a conferencecommittee. The legislation would address ru-ral population issues for social clubs andwould cut red tape for local theaters that wantto obtain liquor licenses. The bill would reduce the number of mem- bers in social clubs \u2014 such as the Lions Club \u2014 needed to obtain a liquor license from 50 to 20. In addition, rather than coming to the Leg- islature, which meets only a few months of theyear, the bill would require the state to turnover the licensing authority for theater eventsto city councils, which meet throughout theyear. \"Cities should be free to make those deter- minations, \" Paulsen said. Rep. Greg Davids, (R-Preston), agreed it would be better to give cities the authority. \"Rather than every time running to the Leg- islature, they could run to their city council, \" Davids said. A theater event is defined as an activity held in an auditorium where live action, from mu-sic to dance, is presented to people who haveobtained tickets to the event. The bill also would allow a commercial es- tablishment to make wine on the premises foruse on the premises. Individuals under age 21could not help make wine, under the bill. Liquor stores would be allowed to offer wine-tasting events on their premises. The billdefines a wine-tasting event as an activity thatdoes not last beyond four hours and patronsdo not pay for each individual glass of wine. The bill also authorizes on-sale liquor li- censes to several small towns across the state,from Duluth and Anoka to Eveleth andSpringfield. The Legislature generally ap-proves a handful of similar licenses each year. The House version would allow the state agriculture society to sell alcohol at state fair-grounds events that are not held during thefair. The Senate bill does not include thisprovision.Raising requirements for CPAs Students would have to spend more time in the classroom before they become licensedcertified public accountants, under a bill theHouse passed March 30. The vote was102-26. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF2969/SF2803*), which wouldrequire all accountants seeking licensure tocomplete 150 hours, or credits, before certifi-cation. Currently, students must complete 120hours to become certified. The public expects certified public accoun- tants (CPAs) to have experience in the fieldand background knowledge, he said. Tuma said 46 states have already established a 150-hour requirement, and the three re-maining states are working on legislation toreach that mark. \"Our accountants are at a disadvantage in the national market, \" Tuma said. The bill would require all accountants who take the certified public accounting exam af-ter July 1, 2006, to have 150 semester hours.Accountants who passed the test prior toJuly 1, 2006, would be grandfathered in. \"If he 's already a CPA and he 's already licensed, he 's OK, \" Tuma said. Students who take the public accountant exam after July 1, 2006, would be required topossess a bachelor 's degree or higher with a major in accounting or business. Currently,students can take the test if they have com-pleted two years of study with a passing gradeaverage at a college or university. According to one study, most students have completed 143 hours by the time they take thetest, Tuma said. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) said the bill is needed so accountants would have reci-procity with other states, allowing them to taketheir degrees and use them across the UnitedStates. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) spoke against the bill, saying it would require stu-dents to spend more money on unnecessaryclasses. Dehler said students would have tospend thousands of additional dollars onclasses. The bill now returns to the Senate.Fugitive apprehension unit A formal fugitive apprehension unit in the state Department of Corrections will be cre-ated under a law signed March 28 by Gov. JesseVentura. The unit will have limited police powers to investigate and arrest Department of Correc-tions escapees and parole violators. \"These are all convicted felons, \" said Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), who sponsoredthe measure. \"We get to hunt these people down with people who know them best. \" There is currently an apprehension unit with 13 employees. However, that unit doesnot have police powers, and the workers can-not carry firearms. Under the law, those em-ployees will be trained by law enforcement tobecome officers. Stanek said there were three things he wanted to accomplish with this law. First, hewanted to give the workers the adequate toolsto do their job, which includes the right tocarry firearms. The law also allows the unit toattend deadly force training. Second, the law establishes the flow of in- formation between corrections officials work-ing inside a prison and police officers workingthe street. The information exchange is neededbecause inmates still have ties to illegalactivity, Stanek said. \"They 're still involved in all kinds of con- nections with gangs and drugs, \" he said. Finally, the police powers were limited to hunting the fugitives and parole violators, sothe unit could concentrate on its task. Under the law, the unit is required to in- form a city 's police force when they enter a town to conduct surveillance or to make ar-rests. Stanek said this portion of the law isanother step toward improving the flow ofinformation between law enforcement units. The law gives the fugitive apprehension unit initial processing power of the fugitive \u2014 such as taking the person 's fingerprints and photos \u2014 unless directed differently by the law en- forcement agency with primary jurisdiction. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF3003/SF3097*/CH2916 March 31, 2000#ELECTIONS #ENVIRONMENT#EMPLOYMENT Limiting election-day registration While Minnesota is one of the few states in the nation that allows people to register andvote on election day, the House passed a billMarch 29 that would modify the requirementsfor that same-day registration. The vote was70-60. The bill (HF2826), sponsored by Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), would repeal the state lawthat allows a person without identification toregister to vote on an election day if a regis-tered voter from the same precinct vouchesfor that person. Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) was among the opponents of that provision. \"I don 't think it 's appropriate to be restrict- ing people 's ability to vote, \" he said. Other House members said the bill would make voting more difficult for students,homeless people, or anyone who moves into anew precinct shortly before an election. But Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) said it is difficult for election judges to determine ifa person without identification is ineligible tovote. For example, election judges currently do not have the means to verify whether a per-son without proper identification is even acitizen of the United States, Krinkie said. Minnesota law allows people to present sev- eral forms of identification to register and voteon an election day. Those include a driver 's license, a student identification card, a pass-port, or a utility bill with the person 's name and current address. Those laws would notchange under the bill. \"It's easy to vote if you take any time or con- sideration, \" Krinkie said. The bill would make several other minor changes to state election laws. It would move the beginning date of the terms of office for soil and water conserva-tion district supervisors, school board mem-bers, town officers, and hospital districtofficers to the first Monday in January to con-form with other elected offices. And voter registration forms that are sub- mitted with driver 's license applications would have to be sent within 10 business days to thecounty auditor, under the bill. Currently, there is no time limit for the pub- lic safety department to send the forms to thecounty auditor. When the bill was discussedin committee earlier this session, Secretary ofState Mary Kiffmeyer said there have beenlong delays where people find that they are notregistered when they go to vote. The bill now moves to the Senate.Exposure to bloodborne diseases The House passed a bill March 24 aimed at reducing occupational exposures tobloodborne pathogens through sharps inju-ries. The vote was 129-0. The bill (HF2639/SF2397*), sponsored by Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), wouldrequire employers to comply with federal Oc-cupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) regulations on bloodborne patho-gens. It also would require that employers review written exposure control plans annually anddocument in the plan consideration of appro-priate methods they would use to eliminateor minimize exposure. \"This is a very important issue. It 's an issue that can cost people their lives, \" said Ozment. Sharps are needles and other medical de- vices used in testing. They are often used todraw blood and therefore carry the most riskfor exposure to diseases carried through theblood. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) spoke in sup- port of the bill. He told members that his wife,a nurse, was stuck by a needle while on thejob. She developed hepatitis, and because ofcomplications, she nearly died. \"This is a good bill, \" Abeler said, \"a bill we need to support. \" Under the bill, a company safety commit- tee would be required to make recommenda-tions for the use of effective engineeringcontrols to limit injury. Representatives ofemployees who may use or encounter a de-vice that could create exposure to bloodbornepathogens would be appointed to thecommittee. Finally, the bill would require that an em- ployer establish internal procedures to docu-ment how employees become exposed and thecircumstances surrounding an incident of ex-posure. The bill also lists information thatemployers would be required to document. The bill now moves to a House-Senate conference committee. Permission for mosquito spraying The Metropolitan Mosquito Control Dis- trict would need the approval of the commis-sioner of the Department of NaturalResources before spraying state lands, undera bill the House passed March 24. The votewas 121-7. Under current law, a landowner can refuseto allow Mosquito Control to spray his or her land with insecticides, but that same courtesyis not always given regarding publicly ownedland. In July 1999, Mosquito Control sprayed chemicals at Fort Snelling State Park, despiteobjections from the DNR. The DNR should have jurisdiction over the decision to spray chemicals in wildlife man-agement areas, because the DNR has the ex-pertise in the chemicals ' effects on vegetation, water quality, wildlife habitat, and related is-sues, said Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), chair of the House Environmentand Natural Resources Policy Committee andsponsor of the bill (HF3134). Ozment added that current law allows the Department of Health to authorize sprayingfor mosquitoes that are known to carrydiseases. The bill now moves to the Senate. Underwater lumber recovery A bill that would allow people to salvage logs from lake and river bottoms was passed March29 by the House. The vote was 129-3. Under the bill (HF2559/SF2546*), a person or company that wants to salvage a log that isunderwater would apply for a lease throughthe state Department of Natural Resources. The fee for a lease would be $500 for Min- nesota residents and $2,500 for those who liveoutside the state. Terms of the lease would benegotiable. Logs could be salvaged only if they are sub- merged at depths of 20 feet or more. The leasewould require that precautions be taken toavoid disturbing the bottom of the lake orriver. Also, the person or company with a lease would have to notify the Minnesota Histori-cal Society if they find a historical artifact, suchas a sled that was used to carry logs across afrozen lake. Some of the proceeds from the leases would go to the state 's general fund, and some would go to the game and fish fund. If the lake orriver were on school trust fund lands, themoney would go into the permanent schoolfund. The state also would receive 25 percent of the money from the sale of the logs, based onthe weighted average selling price. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R- Hackensack) and Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora),now moves to the governor 's desk.Session Weekly 7#ETHICS The Park Singers from St. Louis Park High School sing the invocation to open the March 24 floor session.

LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPANIMENT #FAMILYPanel halts Lindner matter There is not enough evidence to support claims that Rep. Arlon Lindner (R-Corcoran)violated House rules with his comments in aFeb. 23 debate, according to a March 24 rul-ing by the House Ethics Committee. The committee also recommended that rules regarding speech and debate on the floorbe studied and revised. Lindner was accused of violating House rules in three ways in the floor debate regard-ing the prayer that opens each House floorsession. Four DFL members \u2014 Reps. Matt Entenza (St. Paul), Rob Leighton (Austin), Ann H. Rest(New Hope), and Wes Skoglund (Mpls) \u2014 submitted a complaint to the committee thatLindner had violated the norms of House be-havior, brought the House into dishonor, andsuggested members should be excluded fromproceedings. During floor debate Feb. 23, Lindner, in re- sponse to Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul),used the term \"irreligious left \" in reference to Paymar 's views. Paymar is Jewish, and some interpreted Lindner 's remarks to be directed against people of the Jewish faith. The committee met on March 20 and 21 to hear testimony and rebuttal to determine ifthere was probable cause to pursue the mat-ter. During those two days, Entenza arguedthat the complainants did not want Lindnerto be censured or expelled, they merely wantedhim to apologize for his comments. Lindner declined to apologize. Both he and his attorney, Richard Morgan of Minneapo-lis, said he may not have expressed himself elo-quently, but he said what he meant. Committee members then met in executive session March 23 to discuss the testimony andreach a conclusion. In their ruling, which was unanimous, members noted that Lindner 's comments were regrettable, but that discipline would be in-appropriate and no further action should betaken. \"Matters like this are very difficult for ev- eryone, \" Entenza said after the committee is- sued its report. \"I think your recommendation is very good. \" The report also said that certain rules gov- erning speech must be revised because theycontradict one another. During his presentation, Morgan argued that House rule 2.31, which governs offensivewords in debate, says that a member must notbe called to answer for offensive speech un-less another member takes exception imme-diately after the words are uttered or beforethe House takes up other business.Entenza said the rule is archaic and pertains to obscenities used in debate. The committee suggested the rule is not clear. Lindner said he was pleased with the committee 's ruling. \"I think the Minnesota House of Represen- tatives tested its commitment to free speech,open debate, and tolerance to religious diver-sity,\" he said. \"We have passed the test. \" Rostberg investigation delayed An investigation into an ethics complaint against Rep. Jim Rostberg (R-Isanti) has beenput on hold until criminal proceedings arecomplete. The House Ethics Committee unanimously ruled March 24 that it would defer the inves-tigation. Rostberg is facing three charges ofcriminal sexual conduct in Isanti County. The ethics complaint against Rostberg, signed by House Majority Leader TimPawlenty (R-Eagan) and Rep. Matt Entenza(DFL-St. Paul), alleges that he brought dis-honor to the House as a result of his recentarrest. Rostberg was arrested March 2 in the Capi- tol and was charged in Isanti County the nextday. According to the criminal complaint, Rostberg is charged with engaging in crimi-nal sexual contact with a girl under 13 over aperiod of five years. The girl is now 14. Rostberg has said he is innocent of the charges against him.Help for mentally ill teens Parents would have more control in admit- ting mentally ill children to hospitals under abill the House passed March 27. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) is sponsoring the bill (HF3107/SF2634*), whichwould add mental illness to a law on involun-tary admission and treatment. State law currently allows parents to admit a child under age 18 to a hospital without thechild 's consent if the child is mentally retarded or chemically dependent. But the same doesnot go for children who are mentally ill. The law allows parents to admit children to hospitals for a mental illness up to age 16. Thebill would extend that to age 18. Even if the16- or 17-year-old child refused treatment, theparents would be able to admit the child to ahospital. \"It empowers the parents to get help for their teen-agers, \" Greiling said. The bill stems from a proposal by the Na- tional Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Greilingadded. The bill also has a provision that would re- quire hospital officials to inform a patientwhen a family member makes an inquiryabout the patient 's health. The patient would then have to authorize the release of anyinformation. \"It makes medical people more proactive in talking to families, \" Greiling said. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk.8 March 31, 2000#GAMBLING #GAME & FISHCrackdown on cheating Gamblers would be prohibited from using devices that could count cards or analyze strat-egy under a bill the House passed March 29.The vote was 92-38. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) is spon- soring the bill (HF3571/SF2828*), whichwould establish several new felonies involv-ing devices that change the outcome of a game. Attempting to remove money, chips, or tokens from a slot machine or such devicewould be a felony, as would using counterfeitchips or tokens. An employee of the gambling licensee who cheats, as defined by the bill, also would beguilty of a felony. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said the bill could be too harsh. \"I'm afraid that someone we didn 't intend to will be a felon under this law, \" Rukavina said. He offered an amendment to change the felony provisions to misdemeanors. Theamendment was rejected. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) questioned if a pen could be considered a \"device \" for counting cards and if a person using a pen ata card table could be convicted of a felony. Thebill states that a book, graph, periodical, chart,or pamphlet would not be considered aprobability-calculating device. Skoglund said a felony conviction should be reserved for people who prey on others, andnot people who adjust the odds of winning. The bill also would make it a felony to manufacture, sell, or distribute cards, tokens,or dice used to violate these gambling provi-sions. Another portion of the bill would makeit a felony to instruct someone else to violatethe bill. Legislators introduced the bill in light of the upcoming opening of a card club at Canter-bury Park in Shakopee. Rep. Mark Buesgens(R-Jordan) said it would be wise to have theprovisions of the bill in place. \"Let it open with honesty and integrity, \" Buesgens said. The House amended the bill to expand the list of legal recipients where charitable gam-bling organizations can make contributions.The amendment would allow organizations tocontribute to community arts groups. Currently, contributions can be made to public and private educational institutions,scholarships, churches, natural resourcesprojects, or recreational and communityfacilities. The bill now heads to the Senate.Expanding fraud provisions Tampering with gambling devices or claim- ing a gambling prize through fraud or use ofcounterfeited equipment would become afelony under a bill passed by the House onMarch 27. The vote was 128-0. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) is sponsoring the bill (HF3023/SF2701*), whichwould establish felonies if the dollar amountinvolved exceeds $2,500. The maximum pen-alty for such a felony would be three years inprison and a $6,000 fine. Fraud involving dollar amounts of $500 or less would constitute a misdemeanor, and in-cidents involving between $500 and $2,500would be gross misdemeanors. The bill would make it illegal to knowingly claim a gambling prize using altered or coun-terfeited equipment. It also would be illegalto claim a prize through fraud, deceit, ormisrepresentation. Tampering with gambling equipment in an attempt to influence the outcome of the gamealso would be illegal. During the House Crime Prevention Com- mittee discussion last month, Rep. Rich Stanek(R-Maple Grove) expressed concern about thetampering provision. Stanek wondered if itwould be tampering to draw a line through apulltab. He said he preferred the maximumpenalty be a gross misdemeanor instead of afelony. King Wilson, executive director for Allied Charities of Minnesota, testified at that hear-ing that the bill is needed to curb the growthof cheating in gambling. Norm Pint, director of gambling enforce- ment for the Department of Public Safety, saidhe is concerned that more people will attemptto tamper or cheat on games because peopleare getting away with it. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. Lifetime hunting, fishing licenses The House passed a bill March 30 that would establish lifetime licenses for huntingand fishing. The vote was 112-10. The bill (HF3510), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), initially aimed only tomake permanent a law that is set to be repealedthis year. That law allows people in five Minnesota counties to obtain two deer hunting licenses\u2014 one license to use a firearm and one to use a bow and arrow \u2014 and to take one deer with each license. The five counties are Kittson,Lake of the Woods, Marshall, Pennington, andRoseau. The Senate added the proposal for lifetimelicenses to the bill, and the House voted to accept that proposal. Under the bill, fees for lifetime licenses would be based on four groups: ages 3 andunder, ages 4 to 15, ages 16 to 50, and ages 51and older. Lifetime fishing licenses for Minnesota resi- dents in those age groups would cost $227,$300, $383, and $201 respectively. People whohave that license would still need to purchaseannual stamps if they want to fish for salmonor trout. For non-residents, the prices wouldbe higher. Lifetime small-game hunting licenses for residents would cost $217, $290, $363, and$213 for the same age groups. Those wouldalso be available to non-residents at a higherprice. Lifetime deer hunting licenses for residents would cost $337, $450, $573, and $383respectively. The bill also would allow lifetime sporting licenses for residents that would cover fishingand small-game hunting. Such licenses wouldcost $357, $480, $613, and $413 respectively. Non-residents could not get lifetime deer hunting or sporting licenses. Revenue from the licenses would establish a lifetime fish and wildlife trust fund. Moneyin that fund would be invested by the stateBoard of Investment, and it would pay forprojects that currently are funded by revenuefrom annual hunting and fishing licenses. The bill now goes to the governor 's desk. Lighted lures OK'd The House passed a bill March 23 that would allow anglers to use lighted fishinglures. The vote was 71-57. Rep. Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley), spon- sor of the bill (HF3352/SF3586*), said thelures are used in neighboring states. Currentstate law allows lighted lures to be manufac-tured and sold in Minnesota, but does not al-low anglers to use them. The House modified the bill to specify that the batteries used in lighted fishing lures can-not contain mercury. That change was madedue to concerns the batteries could be swal-lowed by fish or lost in the water. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) said that mercury has been eliminated from most bat-teries because of pollution problems relatedto element. She said that even small amountsof mercury can cause serious problems inwater. Mercury pollution has caused some Min- nesota lakes and rivers to be subject to fishadvisories that warn people against eating fishcaught in those areas, Wagenius said. The bill awaits the governor 's signature.Session Weekly 9#GOVERNMENT Confirmation bill vetoed Gov. Jesse V entura delivered his first veto of the 2000 Legislative Session March 24 on abill that would have limited the term of anacting or temporary commissioner of a statedepartment. Under current law, commissioners are ap- pointed by the governor, subject to the Senate 's confirmation of the appointment. The billwould have limited the term of an acting ortemporary commissioner to 18 months. In his veto message, V entura said the bill would have punished a commissioner for theSenate 's failure to \"fulfill its obligation to act \" within the time limit. \"The confirmation of commissioners is an important role for the Senate, \" the governor wrote. \"It is imperative to maintain a certain level of accountability and a clear expectationfor all parties involved. \" Ventura, who earlier this session had the Senate reject one of his appointees, acknowl-edged that there is a need for change. \"I look forward to working with the Legis- lature to create a comprehensive piece of leg-islation that addresses the concerns of boththe legislative and executive branches of gov-ernment on this matter, \" he wrote. Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton) and Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora) sponsored the bill. HF118*/SF160/CH277 Monarch as state butterfly The House passed a bill March 24 that would make the monarch the state butterfly.The vote was 107-25. Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), sponsor of the bill (HF2588/SF2326*), saidstate symbols represent things that are greatabout Minnesota. The idea came from fourth graders at OH Anderson Elementary School in Mahtomedi,Mares said. Those students and many othersstudy the monarch 's unique migration habits and other distinctive qualities, he said. The students wanted to participate in the lawmaking process, he said, and they proposedthe bill as a way to get involved. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) proposed adding a clause that would cancel the legisla-tion after four years, so that the issue could berevisited at that time. That would allow an-other group of students to get involved by pro-posing to keep the monarch as the statebutterfly or to propose another kind of but-terfly for that distinction, he said. But theHouse rejected that proposal. The bill has been sent to the governor.Turning over state property A piece of state property that previously housed a juvenile correctional facility wouldbe turned over to the city of Sauk Centre un-der a bill the House passed March 28. The votewas 116-13. Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria), spon- sor of the bill (HF2819/SF2444*), said theMinnesota Correctional Facility-Sauk Centrewas closed in July 1999 and has been vacantsince then. It was established in 1911 as a facility for delinquent girls, but became coeducational in1967. Under state law, when an agency vacates a piece of property, the state Department of Ad-ministration offers the property to other stateagencies or departments that might want touse the property. But in this case, no otheragency expressed interest, Cassell said. When the correctional facility closed, it eliminated many jobs in the city, Cassell said.By transferring the land to the city, local offi-cials can use the property for economic de-velopment or for city or county governmentpurposes, he said. Cassell added that the land originally was purchased by the city and given to the state inthe early 1900s to be used as a correctionalfacility. The city also extended water and sewerlines to the buildings and has continued tomaintain that system. The bill now goes to the governor 's desk. #HEALTH Resident assistant regulations A bill that would regulate how nursing homes train and employ resident assistants toaid patients with eating and drinking waspassed March 27 by the House. The vote was107-23. Under the bill (HF3226/SF2896*), spon- sored by Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls),resident attendants could not be counted in anursing facility 's minimum staffing require- ment. Resident assistants also would need to un- dergo a criminal background check beforebeing allowed to attend to patient needs,Nornes said. The bill is an attempt to ease concerns ex- pressed by the children and spouses of nurs-ing facility patients who, at times, are unableto properly feed or replenish themselves. Aid to patients struggling to eat or drink is often unavailable, according to testimony be-fore the House Health and Human ServicesPolicy Committee, due to staffing shortagesplaguing many nursing facilities in the state. Rules are currently in place governing thefrequency of staff visits, Nornes said, but some nursing home residents need to be checkedmore or less frequently, he said. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), speaking in support of the bill, agreed. \"Whenever you have a one-size-fits-all situ- ation, it doesn 't work well for our senior citi- zens, \" Bradley said. The bill would allow the resident or a guard- ian to request in writing a variation of the timeinterval for monitoring. It also would require the commissioner of the Department of Health to examine stateand federal regulations governing nursing fa-cility care and to develop and implement al-ternative procedures for the nursing homesurvey process. The commissioner of the Department of Health would be required under the bill todevelop a proposal to decrease regulations thatimpede direct care of nursing facility residents. The bill now goes to the governor. Disqualified health professionals A bill that would redirect the authority to determine whether a licensed health profes-sional is disqualified from direct patient con-tact was passed March 27 by the House. Thevote was 127-0. The bill (HF3365/SF2941*), sponsored by Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), would shift au-thority away from the Department of HumanServices while making changes to related defi-nitions of maltreatment and neglect. Under current law, if a background check reveals a potentially disqualifying history, thedepartment determines whether the profes-sional in question fits the statutory criteriaprohibiting direct patient contact. The bill would require health-related licens- ing boards, not the department, to determinewhether someone should be disqualified fromproviding contact. The measure also would provide that a de- termination may be made as part of the exist-ing health-related licensing board complaint,investigation, or hearing process. Further-more, it would require that the determinationbe made within 90 days of notification. The licensing board would be instructed, if the bill were to become law, to consider thenature and extent of any injury or harm re-sulting from conduct, the seriousness of themisconduct, and the extent that disqualifica-tion from patient contact is necessary to pro-tect people receiving services. The bill would allow the board to determine the duration of any disqualification or to es-tablish conditions under which a health pro-fessional may hold a position allowing directcontact with patients.10 March 31, 2000Licensing boards, under the bill, would have jurisdiction over previously disqualified non-licensed individuals who later seek to belicensed. Furthermore, the bill would permit health professionals previously disqualified becauseof \"substantiated maltreatment of a vulner- able adult \" after October 1, 1995, to petition for review, and would require the commis-sioner of the department to notify eligible in-dividuals of that right. The bill now goes to the Senate. Training care providers The House passed a bill March 29 aimed at protecting the health and well-being of chil-dren dependent upon certain medical devicesto live. The vote was 132-0. The bill (HF3342/SF3025*), sponsored by Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul), wouldattempt to decrease the chance that a child leftwith a foster or respite care provider couldsuffer harm due to a provider 's inexperience or lack of training with the special equipmentneeded to care for the child. Care providers, under the bill, would be re- quired to have training or experience with achild 's medical equipment before being al- lowed to care for the child. Sharon Morrissey and husband Don Baierl of St. Paul testified earlier this month beforethe House Health and Human Services PolicyCommittee in favor of the bill. The couple lostan infant daughter in 1997 because a care pro-vider didn 't know precisely how to operate the child 's equipment. T o help prevent a situation like that from occurring again, Mariani told House ARTS DAY members, legislation needs to be put in placeto ensure safety when children in need of spe-cial care are left with foster or respite careproviders. Agencies that place children in homes, even if it's only on a temporary basis, would be re- quired by the bill to ensure that the care pro-vider has the necessary training before beingentrusted with the child. While the Department of Health and Hu- man Services would be called upon to createa training system under the bill, Mariani saidhe expects there would be little, if any, fiscalimpact incurred by the department. The bill now returns to the Senate. #HOUSINGContract stacking regulated A bill that would expand the scope of health provisions regulating network shadow con-tracting by including physicians and otheroccupations regulated by the Board of Medi-cal Practice and Dentists in the definition of a\"health care provider \" was passed March 28 by the House. The vote was 124-7. Network shadow contracting refers to the practice of health insurance companies requir-ing care providers to participate in a networkunder a category of coverage different fromthe categories to which the existing contractbetween the company and provider applies,without the consent of the provider. The measure would require that parties be notified of a change and offer their consent. The bill (HF3310/SF3055*), sponsored by Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), would includehospitals, licensed dentists, chiropractors, andindividuals licensed, registered, or regulatedby the board in the definition of a health careprovider.It also would eliminate an exemption for nonprofit health service plan corporations(such as Blue Cross Blue Shield and DeltaDental) from the state 's definition of a \"net- work organization. \" Furthermore, the bill would require that the commissioner of the Department of Healthstudy whether state laws have increased pre-mium costs for health-related coverage and,if so, by how much. A study of whether current statutes have limited the ability of employers to purchasemanaged care plans would also be in required.The commissioner would then have to reportthe findings by Jan. 15, 2002. The measure now awaits the governor 's approval. #HUMAN SERVICESInterest on security deposits A new law effective Aug. 1, 2000, will delay a scheduled increase in the interest rate paid byproperty owners on tenant security deposits. Current law sets the rate at 3 percent until 2001, and after that time the rate was to beincreased to 4 percent. The new law willchange the date of the increase to 4 percentfrom May 1, 2001, to May 1, 2004. State law related to the interest rate on se- curity deposits has been adjusted several timesin recent years. The 1992 Legislature changedthe rate from 5.5 percent to 4 percent untilMay 1, 1997, but the rate was to return to 5.5percent thereafter. In 1996, the rate was cut to3 percent until May 1, 1999, with an increaseto 4 percent thereafter. The 1998 Legislature extended the 3 percent rate until 2001, and the new law will give itthree more years. Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter) and Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) sponsored thelegislation, which was signed by the governorMarch 24. HF3132*/SF2890/CH282 No licenses for offenders The House passed a bill March 28 that would extend foster care licensure privilegesto certain providers while tightening periodsof licensure disqualification for individualsfound guilty of certain criminal offenses. Thevote was 130-0. Sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excel- sior), the bill (HF3103/SF3005*) would makeseveral technical and substantive changes tolaws relating to Department of Human Ser-vices licensing. As part of the 18th annual Arts Education Day at the Capitol March 29, second- and third-graders from Whittier Community School for the Arts demonstrate how they learn maththrough music and dance.Session Weekly 11It would allow certain adult foster care pro- viders not required to be licensed by the de-partment to seek licensure in order to avoidpotential losses of funding. The bill would add gross misdemeanor of- fenses related to prostitution to the list ofcrimes that require at least a 10-year disquali-fication for family day care or foster care li-censes. A gross misdemeanor offense relatedto neglect or endangerment of a child wouldalso be included in the 10-year disqualifica-tion list, under the bill. Furthermore, the bill would require a life- time disqualification of day care or foster carelicensure for a felony-level offense pertainingto neglect or endangerment. Also, the bill would allow tribal organiza- tions performing licensing functions to havethe same access to criminal history data ascounties. Counties performing licensing func-tions delegated by the state, however, wouldhave the same tort liability as the state if thebill were to become law. The bill now goes to the governor 's desk. #INSURANCE#LAW #MILITARYInsurance for vicarious liability A bill awaiting the governor 's signature would allow insurance companies to sell vi-carious liability insurance to cover the costsof punitive or exemplary damages. Vicarious liability insurance covers in- stances where a defendant is liable not for whathe or she did, but rather for that defendant 's responsibility for or relationship to anotherdefendant. The insurance will thus be avail-able to an employer who must pay damagesfor an act committed by an employee eventhough the employer may not have done any-thing wrong. For example, the bill (HF2675/SF2569*) would allow an employer to purchase insur-ance to cover sexual harassment claims, wherean employee is accused of the wrongdoing butthe employer is responsible, even though heor she might not have had anything to do withthe harassment directly. The insurance covers the costs of punitive and exemplary damages that are awarded bycourts in addition to compensatory damages.Punitive damages are meant to punish defen-dants while exemplary damages are meant toset an example to deter the defendant or oth-ers from repeating the behavior. The House passed the measure March 24. It is sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin). The bill moves to the governor 's desk.Liability for providing alcohol People over age 21 could face civil penalties for supplying alcohol to those under 21 un-der a bill the House passed March 28. The votewas 92-39. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter), who is sponsoring the measure, said thebill (HF2555/SF1733*) would curb partieswhere adults serve liquor to juveniles. Adultswould be less likely to supply alcohol to juve-niles at a party if they know they could be heldliable in a civil suit for the juveniles ' actions when they leave the premises, Carruthers said. \"When adults go and give booze to kids, you know what happens? Kids get killed. That 's the reality, \" Carruthers said during floor debate. The bill would apply to people who do not have liquor licenses, covering events such associal parties. The 1999 Legislature passed a measure that established felony penalties for people whoprovide alcohol to minors if a minor proceedsto cause death or great bodily harm. Carruthers ' current bill is the second major initiative to come in response to accidents likethe one that killed St. Paul teen-ager KevinBrockway, who died in a New Y ear 's Eve 1997 car accident after leaving a party where a par-ent provided liquor. The bill would make the adult liable if he or she supplied alcohol, had control over thepremises, and was in a reasonable position tostop the juvenile from drinking, or if he or sheknowingly and recklessly permitted the con-sumption of alcohol. The Senate bill includes a provision that would prohibit coverage for liability on ahomeowner 's insurance policy. That language is not in the House bill. Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) op- posed the bill, saying the measure would placefiscal consequences on people that are toogreat. \"Accidents are going to happen, and kids are going to be kids, \" Rukavina said. \"There are going to be a lot of innocent people hurt bythis bill. \" Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said the bill should also included liability for people whoare under age 21 who provide alcohol. The bill moves to the Senate. POW resolution A bill that would urge the federal government to take action to free Americans who might beheld as prisoners of war was passed by the Houseon March 27. The vote was 128-1.The bill (HF4060/SF2348*), sponsored by Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul),would send a resolution to the president ofthe United States and to leaders in Congress. The resolution would state that photo- graphs from satellites and planes have shownnames and rescue codes of missing service-men written on the ground in Vietnam andLaos. Also, other reports have indicatedAmerican prisoners of war are still being heldin North Korea, China, Russia, and Vietnam. The resolution also states that a U.S. Senate committee has made a recommendation foraction that the executive branch has not actedon, and that the U.S. government has \"rebuffed overtures from Vietnam and North Korea re-garding the release of live American POWs. \" The bill now moves to the governor 's desk. #RECREATION New plan for park permits Annual permits for state parks will be valid for a full year after the date of purchase, un-der a new law signed March 24 by Gov. JesseV entura. Currently, annual park permits are valid only for the calendar year. Proponents of the new law, which is effec- tive Aug. 1, 2000, said that it likely will increasethe number of annual permits that are soldand encourage more visits to state parks year-round. Earlier this year, an official from the Parks and Recreation Division of the Departmentof Natural Resources said survey results showthe state could sell about 5,000 more permitsper year. The change could make enforcement more difficult than the current system, where anannual permit is distinctive and easy for parkemployees to see. But the official told lawmak-ers the change will be manageable because thesticker will be designed to clearly show themonth and year it expires. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Martha Robertson (R-Minnetonka)sponsored the legislation. HF2505*/SF2289/CH278 New fine for studs A bill that would add a civil penalty for us- ing metal traction devices, or studs, on snow-mobiles was passed March 28 by the House.The vote was 131-0. Rep. Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine), spon- sor of the bill (HF3555/SF3283*), said the civilpenalty was inadvertently left out of a law thatwas passed last year that required people to12 March 31, 2000purchase a sticker for their snowmobiles if they intend to use studs. That law contains criminal penalties for people who drive a snowmobile with studs onpaved state trails. Westerberg 's bill would es- tablish civil penalties for people who havesnowmobile studs but have not purchased thesticker. For the first offense, the penalty would not exceed $50. The fine for a second offensewould not exceed $300, and for third and sub-sequent offenses the fine would not exceed$600. The bill now moves to the governor 's desk. #SAFETY Radio system source code Bidders on the state 's 800-megahertz pub- lic safety radio system would be allowed ac-cess to the source code of the system under abill approved March 29 by the House TaxesCommittee. The measure was included in part of a pub- lic finance bill (SF3730) that makes a numberof changes in the authority of local govern-ments to issue bonds and incur debt. The 800-megahertz radio system would al- low public safety officials to communicate ona universal system. An amendment offered by Rep. Henry Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) would require thestate Department of Administration to dis-close and provide access to the source code tobidders on the radio system 's contract. Laura Bishop, who is director of legislative affairs for the state Department of Adminis-tration and is overseeing the contracting ofthe project, said that the department is closeto reaching an agreement with the vendorsthat would make the amendment obsolete. She said the dispute centers around the modification by Motorola of standards estab-lished by the Association of Public SafetyCommunication Officials, known as APCOProject 25. That standard agreement allowsdifferent vendors to offer equipment that would work within the system. Motorola holds the state 's contract for the system 's architecture. She said Motorola has indicated potential additions to the standards that other vendorscontend will give that company an unfair ad-vantage of offering radio equipment thatworks better within the system 's architecture. Bishop said that the state 's attorney general told her that requiring the disclosure of onevendor 's source code to other vendors is uncon- stitutional because it is proprietary information. State technology contracts often require vendors to submit the source code, which isthe programming language that executes aprogram, in escrow. This protects the state inthe event that the vendor goes out of businessor otherwise stops supporting the product. The bill was sent to the House Ways and Means Committee. #TRANSPORTATIONTHE ELITE SIX One plate for collector cars Cars manufactured prior to 1972 and clas- sic or model cars will only be required to haveone license plate, under a law signed March24 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) sponsored the measure, which will allow cars with a pioneer,classic car, collector, or street rod license toonly display one plate. If the car owner chooses to display just one plate, that plate must be located on the rear ofthe car, the law states. Previously, the law allowed cars manufac- tured prior to 1968 to display just one plate. \"This covers muscle cars made in 1971 or 1972, \" Haas said. The reason for the change came from con- stituents who believed that two plates on theirDemonstrating their opposition to the House tax bill, a group calling themselves the \"Elite 6Percent\" jokingly celebrate as DFL amendments are defeated during March 27 debate on thefloor of the House.

The stretch of freeway will be re-named the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division Highway.Private money must be used to purchase andplace signs. The designation will extend fromthe Iowa border to the Twin Cities. The Red Bull Division, comprised of Na- tional Guard members from Minnesota, Iowa,and South Dakota, was the first division de-ployed overseas during World War II, accord-ing to the Minnesota National Guard.

HF3156*/SF2709/CH281 Several states are taking on the telemarketing industry by passing legisla-tion that addresses consumers' ability toblock sales calls from coming into theirhomes. According to the Direct Marketing Asso- ciation, the telemarketing industry gener-ated $482 billion in sales and employedover 9.1 million people during 1998. Caller identification technology became readily available in the mid-1990s, andmany consumers thought it would be thesolution to keeping pesky telemarketersfrom interrupting their dinner. But just as soon as consumers had theOff the telemarket Laws allow consumers to prevent telemarketers from reaching them there allows residents to be placed on a\"no-call\" list, for a $5 fee. For eachtelemarketing call made to a person onthat list, a telemarketer can be fined $2,000. Tennessee has a similar law although residents there are not charged a fee to geton the no-call list. Florida has had a no-call list law since 1990. During those 10 years, the list hasgrown to about 120,000 names and thestate has assessed more than $300,000 infines to about 50 companies. Minnesota's only major regulations on the telemarketing industry involve crimi-nal penalties for fraud.ability to see who was calling, users on the other end could block their phone num-bers from appearing on the display of thecaller ID box. Then, phone companies began offering consumers the ability to have a line that re-jects blocked calls. Several new laws have been enacted to halt attempts by telemarketers to maneu-ver around these technologies. An Illinois law that took effect Jan. 1 pro- hibits telemarketers from blocking theiridentities from caller ID users in the state. Georgia also recently initiated tougher regulations on telemarketers. A new lawHighway named after contractor A southern Minnesota highway will be named after a noted contractor and transpor-tation advocate, under a law signed March 28by Gov. Jesse V entura. The stretch of Highway 4 from Sleepy Eye to St. James will be named the Richard J.Mathiowetz Memorial Highway. Mathiowetz,a Sleepy Eye native, was dubbed a \"legendary contractor \" in the December issue of Con- struction Bulletin. He died Oct. 31, 1999, atage 64. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) spon- sored the law. Swenson said that Mathiowetzwas always traveling to the State Capitol, seek-ing funding for roads and highways. \"He had been an energetic advocate for good roads and highways, \" Swenson said. Mathiowetz began working at his father 's construction company when he turned 18, andhe was involved in contracting throughout hislife. Swenson said Mathiowetz deserves to havea highway named after him due to his long-standing reputation as a contractor in the area. Funds for the purchase and placement of signs marking the highway must comethrough non-public sources. Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored the law in the Senate. The law takeseffect Aug.1, 2000. HF3142*/SF2844/CH288C. Elmer Anderson highway A Minnesota road will be named in honor of a former governor, under a law signedMarch 24 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The portion of Highway 371 from Baxter to Barrows in Crow Wing County, which isknown as the Brainerd bypass, will be namedthe C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway. Anderson, who died in January 1998, served as Minnesota governor from 1951 to 1955. Healso served as lieutenant governor for 11 non-consecutive years. When he was first electedlieutenant governor in 1938, Anderson wasonly 26 years old. Anderson, a Republican and a native of Brainerd, became governor in 1951 when Gov.Luther Y oungdahl resigned to accept an ap-pointment to the federal bench. Andersondefeated Orville Freeman in 1952 but lost tothe same man in 1954. (Governors served onlytwo-year terms at the time.) After leaving the statehouse, Anderson re- turned to Brainerd, where he was a businessmanstreet rods were not necessary, Haas said. The new law also states that only one plate is needed for cars built prior to 1972 that areused for general transportation purposes. \"Some people do use them for driving around, \" Haas said. \"Y ou don 't see many of these cars in the winter. \" Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the Senate bill. The law takes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF2824*/SF2578/CH280and, for 10 years, served as the town 's mayor. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) was quoted at Anderson 's funeral as saying he was always proud of Brainerd and stayed active inthe issues important to the area. Signs designating the road must be funded from non-public money, according to the newlaw, which is effective Aug. 1, 2000. Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd)sponsored the measure. HF2502*/SF3207/CH27914 March 31, 2000AT ISSUE: CRIME # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGER The House and Senate have come to an agreement on start-up funding for a statewide integrated criminal justice information system that will helplaw enforcement keep track of registered sex offenders and other criminals around the state.Protection from predators A bill awaiting the governor's signature would provide avariety of new methods to track sex offenders The House voted March 27 to concur with Senate amendments to a bill (HF2688) that isbeing called \"Katie 's Law \" and gave the bill fi- nal passage on a 129-2 vote. Now it 's up to the governor whether the provision will become law. The two main backers of the House bill, Reps. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and RichStanek (R-Maple Grove), said this week theyexpect Gov. Jesse Ventura to sign the bill, despiteearlier admonitions that he would not supportnew spending \u2014 such as that for the new police information system \u2014 in a non-budget year. \"I feel this bill is one of the most important of the year, \" Broecker said during debate on the House floor. The final version of the bill would spend $12 million to implement the statewide informationsystem, which is a compromise between the $7.5million in the original House bill and the $15million originally pledged by the Senate. Some lawmakers are concerned that the overall project could cost as much as $100 mil-lion before completion. In addition, the bill would spend $5 mil- lion to increase the number of probation of-ficers handling sex offenders and therebydecrease the number of clients each officer has. A probation officer is one of the checkpoints along the way for many sex offenders. Legislators created the bill because of con- cerns that the state is not adequately trackingsex offenders and other criminals, since thereis no statewide system that law enforcementagents can access on a traffic stop or otherroutine activity. Early in the 2000 session, Pam Poirier, whose 19-year-old daughter, Katie, was abducted froma Moose Lake convenience store and presumedmurdered last May, spoke in favor of laws thattoughen guidelines on sex offenders.Donald Blom, a six-time convicted sex of- fender, will stand trial next month for Poirier 's abduction and apparent murder. The bill would expand certain requirements for sex offender registration. Under the bill, any-one who moves to Minnesota to work or go toschool would be required to register if he or shefalls under the definitions of sexual psychopathor sexual predator. Lifetime registration would be required for Pam and Steve Poirier listen to House debate earlier this session on a bill designed to protect peoplefrom sex offenders. The measure, known as \"Katie's Law,\" won final passage March 27. The Poiriers' daugh-ter, Katie, was abducted and presumed murdered in May 1999. The alleged killer has a long record ofsex crimes. registered offenders who have been convictedmore than once, for those who commit aggra-vated sex offenses (involving force or threat or ifthe victim is younger than 12), and for anyonerequired to register as a sexual psychopath orsexual predator in Minnesota or any other state. Twenty-year registration would be required for any level 2 or level 3 offenders, unless alonger registration applies. In addition, the bill would require the Bu- reau of Criminal Apprehension to verify theaddress of each offender at least four times ayear. Each offender would still report his orher address annually or if it changes. If the offender does not follow through with verification requirements, the state could takeinformation about them and make it publicthrough electronic means. Sex offenders would be required to provide all primary and secondary addresses, includ-ing those for recreational purposes, and all theaddresses of property they lease, own, or rent.They would also have to list where they workor where they attend school. And offenderswould have to provide the makes and modelsof all their vehicles. Violators of the predatory offender regis- tration requirements would face felony pen-alties instead of misdemeanors, under the bill. In addition, the bill would require the state to create and maintain a Web site where all information about Level 3 sex offenders, themost serious, would be posted and accessibleby the public. Continued on page 21Session Weekly 15BY JON FUREAlleged conflicts of interest regarding the Hiawatha Corridor light-rail project have led to a proposal that would clarify the state 's procedures for avoiding such conflicts. The bill (HF4133), sponsored by Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview), was approved March 28 by the House State Government Finance Committee.Conflict avoidance In response to light-rail transit troubles, a bill attempts toeliminate potential conflicts of interest in awarding contractsfor state projects The bill would add some requirements to the state 's policies in seeking bids and award- ing contracts. Each of the requirements in the bill relates to conflict of interest claims during the bid-ding process for the Hiawatha project. The state has awarded bids for engineering and project management services for theHiawatha project at various times since Sep-tember 1998. One of the conflict of interest claims is that the engineering firm Parsons Brinkerhoff hadan unfair advantage over other firms that werecompeting for the contract as project man-ager. The Parsons Brinkerhoff firm wasawarded the bid to manage the project after ithad served as the interim project manager. The Department of Transportation made the firm interim project manager through anamendment to the preliminary engineeringcontract. Another firm that was competing for the project manager contract, Booz, Allen &Hamilton, contacted the department and ex-pressed concern related to the how the con-tract was awarded. That led to a decision by the Federal Transit Administration, which is providing grant moneyto the Hiawatha project, that the interim direc-tor, William Stead of the Parsons Brinkerhofffirm, could not serve as the project manager. Stead responded to questions at the March 28 committee meeting, and he said he agreed to bereassigned March 17, along with another Par-sons Brinkerhoff employee, but he did not agreethat their actions were a conflict of interest. Rep. Mark Gleason (DFL-Richfield) said he doesn 't agree with the conflict of interestcharge. Gleason said he has been in such a situ- ation in his work as an auditor, where his fa-miliarity and long-standing workingrelationship with clients gave him an advan-tage in obtaining contracts over others whowould also want to do that work. But he doesnot consider that to be a conflict. Stead agreed, but said the transit authority 's judgment was that it was a \"perceived conflict, \" which he said is difficult to disprove in anysituation. The bill would address that concern. Under the bill, if a vendor is providing goods or ser-vices under a contract to the state and is seek- AT ISSUE: GOVERNMENT # # # Brian Crowtleau of Minneapolis holds a sign as he signs a petition in support of light-rail transit.Crowtleau was among the crowd at a March 27 rally in the Capitol rotunda.ing to obtain another state contract, that ven-dor would be prohibited from participatingin the decision on awarding the contract. The transit administration had determined that Stead was not sufficiently \"walled off \" from that process in his capacity as interimproject manager. Two other provisions of the bill relate to changes that have been made in the Hiawathaproject during the bidding process, which alsoled to complaints from companies that werecompeting for the bids. Under the bill, people or companies that respond to a \"request for proposal \" or other solicitation document would need to be noti-fied if the request is substantially changed orif the response due date is changed. Another provision in the bill would prevent a contract from being amended to authorizework that is outside the scope of the work de-scribed in the original request for proposal orother solicitation document. Instead, the state would have to disclose plans for additional work to the other firmswho submitted proposals so they are awareand have a chance to do the work. Krinkie cited three amendments in the Hiawatha project that increased the scope ofthe project without using the standard bid-ding process. Continued on page 2116 March 31, 2000STEPPING DOWNPEOPLE # # # BY CHRIS VETTERRep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna) has al ways given his work \u2014 any work \u2014 his full attention and effort. \"I'm all the way into it. All or nothing, \" he said. An entrepreneur and inventor of theboard game Sequence, Reuter, 51, has been in-trigued by politics since he served in the Navyduring the Vietnam era, and that feeling onlyincreased when he later was a member of thestudent senate in college. That interest in politics \u2014 his views on lim- iting government intrusion and protectingsmall businesses \u2014 has culminated in a four-year stint at the House. \"My philosophical approach is capitalismand promoting the en-trepreneurial spirit, \" he said. His colleagues in the House will rememberhim for those things.Rep. Greg Davids(R-Preston), chair of the House CommerceCommittee, of which Reuter is a member, saidhe has served small business during his tenure. \"I think he 's been a stalwart for small busi- ness issues and free markets, \" Davids said. \"He's a great free-markets legislator. \" What some describe as his \"independent spirit \" prompted Reuter to leave the Republican Caucus in the House last summer and announcethat he would not run for re-election. He is nowthe only independent member of the House. After making the change, Reuter was assigned to an office in the Capitol, while all other Housemembers have their offices in the State OfficeBuilding. The only staff assigned to the newlyindependent lawmaker was a part-time aide. Reuter later filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) to obtainthe same working conditions and level of staffother members get. That suit remains unre-solved, although Reuter did get his way on thelocation of his office.No ordinary term House's lone independent garnered attention by leaving theRepublican Caucus, while continuing to fight on emotionalissues Now back in the State Office Building, Reuter 's office features a variety of editions of theSequence board game, which he created in themid-1970s and has been in production since1981. Reuter was first elected to the House in 1996. He had lived in Owatonna for only abouta year before he won the seat. Previously, hehad run for the Legislature in 1994 as a resi-dent of Eden Prairie. While he acknowledges his conflict with the Republican Caucus in the House contributedto his decision to not seek re-election, Reuter also said he believesstrongly that a legisla-tor should be able torecognize when it 's time to leave the Legis-lature. \"If I was going to be in my last term and wasno longer worriedabout re-election, Imight as well leave thecaucus and be free to vote my conscience, \" Reuter said. The Owatonna legislator is still a member of the Republican Party; he recently served asa state delegate to a party convention. \"The Republican Party did not abandon my views and beliefs, \" he said. \"The Republican Caucus didn 't stand any longer for the things I stood for. \" Reuter said the Republican Caucus gave up too much in order to cut taxes last year. On the first day of this session, Reuter tried to amend the House rules so House prayerswould not be required to be nondenomina-tional. He later sought to throw out highschool writing test results because of a ques-tion he believed to be offensive. Reuter and former Rep. Charlie Weaver, now commissioner of public safety, sponsoreda bill in 1997 that would have blocked Internetpornography in classrooms. Reuter points tothat as a good example of how lawmakers canbe effective by working together and not wor-rying about who gets credit for legislation. But he is most proud of his 1999 actions that forced the state to re-examine its agree-ment to buy 6,500 800-megahertz policeradios from Motorola. Reuter contends theagreement was reached without an open andfair bidding process. \"We now will have competitive bids and we will have more than one provider, \" he said. \"We turned around the whole system. \" Reuter plans to retire in Austin, T exas, where he is building a home. When the session ad-journs, he will keep in contact with constitu-ents via e-mail, telephone, and several visitsto his district until his term expires. He said he likes the fact that his new state doesn 't have an income tax. Reuter and his wife, Nancy, have family in Texas and also pre-fer the climate there. His 14-year-old son willjoin them in the move; his two older daugh-ters will be attending college. Reuter said he has no regrets during his four years, though he said he wishes his move outof the Republican Caucus could have gonesmoother and he hadn 't had to sue the speaker to get equal funding for staff. While Reuter will not personally benefit if he wins the lawsuit, he does believe it could changethe way legislators caucus in the future. For in-stance, if he wins, a dozen legislators could forma \"conservative caucus \" and obtain funding for their own staff, Reuter contends. Reuter is still unsure what job he will pursue next. But he said it will likely be in human re-sources consulting or lobbying \u2014 a job he per- formed before being elected as a legislator. \"I don 't see myself going to work for a com- pany 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, \" he said. \"I will also be working diligently to turn Se- quence into an interactive Internet game andgetting it marketed. Rep. Doug ReuterIndependentDistrict 28A - OwatonnaTerms: 2 Career notes: A sometimes outspoken member who has worked to increase ac-countability in government and to sup-port small businesses, Reuter left theRepublican Caucus in 1999 tobecome the only independent memberof the House. Rep. Doug ReuterSession Weekly 17single filers would be $73, with a maximum amount of $930. Individuals would be eligible if they had in- come tax liability in 1998 or filed a claim forthe 1998 property tax rebate. Unlike last year, this year 's rebate would in- clude individuals with social security incomein 1998. This year 's rebate also differs from last year in that it would allow those taxpayers witha qualified dependent to increase their rebateamount by either $20 per dependent or theamount the rebate would increase when thedependent 's income is added to the taxpayer 's income, whichever is greater. Working family credit The federal earned income credit provides a wage supplement equal to a percentage ofthe earnings of low-income individuals. Simi-larly the state 's working family credit is also based on a percentage of earnings. The bill would increase the percentage of earnings used in calculating the working fam-ily credit so that for all claimants the creditwould equal at least 25 percent of the federalearned income tax credit. Insurance premium deduction The bill would expand the current health insurance deduction for self-employed Min-nesotans to include all taxpayers. The provision would allow taxpayers to de- duct health insurance premiums eligible forthe itemized deduction for medical expensesbut not eligible in determining federal taxableincome or used for the long-term care insur-ance credit. Health care access fund The bill would extend through 2002 the Legislature 's action of reducing the health care provider tax by 1.5 percent. Under current law,the rate is scheduled to increase to 2 percent nextyear. The measure also would provide an addi- tional year exemption for health maintenanceorganizations and nonprofit health servicecorporations. Abrams said the provision in the bill is a \"place holder \" until a long-term solution can be nego- tiated. Last year, the House proposed to dedi-cate the ongoing tobacco settlement funds toreplace the provider tax, but that plan did notbecome law. The 1999 Legislature wound uppassing an $84.5 million transfer from the gen-eral fund into the health care access fund, butthe governor vetoed that transfer.K-12 education credit An increased credit and expanded eligibil- ity would be given for the K-12 education taxcredit. Currently families with an income un-der $37,500 are allowed to claim a credit upto $2,000, depending on the number of chil-dren. The bill would allow a $1,000 per childcredit for an unlimited number of children. Tax help for ski hills Mild winters have caused poor ski seasons for area ski operators. The bill would providerelief to those operators by exempting machin-ery, equipment, fuel, electricity, and water ad-ditives used for snowmaking and snowgrooming operations from the sales tax. Cemetery maintenance expenses The bill would exempt lawn care and related services used in cemetery maintenance fromsales tax. The measure 's sponsor Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters) quipped that the billwould ensure that people won 't continue to face tax obligations when they are dead. Motor vehicles as gifts Motor vehicles given as gifts are currently exempt from sales tax only when the transferis between spouses or between a parent and achild. The bill would expand the gift exemp-tion for all individuals. A further exemption would be given to non- profit organizations for the purchase of trucksand vans that are used to transport goods orindividuals.Agricultural assistance Aid would be provided in an agricultural assistance program similar to one establishedlast year. Farmers in counties that have been declared by the president as weather-related disasterareas would qualify for assistance equal to $4per acre. The maximum payment would be$5,600. The eligible counties include Kittson, Marshall, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, andRoseau. Property taxes The bill would compress class rates for all property classes with a rate over 1 percent. Thelargest reductions would be 0.4 percent cutsfor commercial/industrial properties and mar-ket rate apartments. The bill also would reduce the limitation on the amount a property 's market value may grow from one year to the next from 8.5 per-cent to 7 percent. An increase in the rates forthe education homestead and education agri-cultural credits would also be provided. Abrams said that the bill would reduce ag- ricultural homestead property tax rates by18 percent and non-homestead agriculturalland would receive a 14 percent reduction. Lawful gambling tax The bill would reduce the tax on paddlewheels, raffles, and bingo from 9 per-cent of gross profit to 8.25 percent. Abramssaid even with the reduction Minnesota wouldstill have the second highest lawful gamblingtax rate in the country.

At the beginning of a legislative session, the pace of floor sessions is generally slow as newbills are assigned to committees and non-con-troversial items are discussed. At about thesession 's midpoint, however, the legislative pace quickens. The House usually meets at 2:30 p.m. Mon- days and Thursdays, and the Senate meets at11:30 a.m. Mondays and at 9 a.m. Thursdaysduring the first few weeks. House floor sessionsare scheduled for the afternoon because com-mittees meet in the morning and early after-noon. As the session nears the end, however,both bodies may meet several times a day,often into the night. All House and Senate floor sessions are open to the public. Visitors interested in observingthese sessions may call the House Chief Clerk 's Office, (651) 296-2314, or Senate Information,(651) 296-0504, with questions.

Printed agendas forthe week also appear in each issue of the Session Weekly and the Senate Briefly . Committee meetings are open to the public. When a public hearing is scheduled, the com-mittee may listen to comments from the audi-ence (when time permits) in addition to thescheduled speakers. Committees have differ-ent policies on hearing testimony dependingupon their size and workload. Informationalhandouts that committee members receive dur-ing meetings or hearings are considered publicinformation and are available to the audienceon a first-come, first-served basis. Major proposals often have several publichearings so committee members may listen to all arguments for and against a bill. Each committee has a chair, vice chair, administrator, and legislative assistant. A list ofcommittees and members is available in theHouse Public Information Office in Room175, State Office Building, or the Senate Infor-mation Office in Room 231, State Capitol. Groups and individuals wishing to testify before a committee should call the appropriatecommittee 's legislative assistant well in ad- vance of the meeting and ask to be placed onthe agenda. Committees prefer requests oneweek in advance but will accept later notifica-tion when unexpected issues appear on thecommittee schedule. A brochure containingtips on testifying at legislative committee hear-ings is available from the House Public Infor-mation Office.

The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

The data would be private,but would be available to law enforcement and corrections agents. The bill would allow people convicted of felony sex offenses to change their names, but would make the procedure much more complicatedand would require many different people to be notified of the change. The sex offender piece is just one aspect of the criminal justice in- formation system proposed by the bill. It would also establish a policygroup to determine the infrastructure for the overall system. For example, the bill requires the group to assess state and local law enforcement capability to collect fingerprints and photos electroni-cally, so that data can be placed in a central database. The group wouldalso be required to decide where such technology should be placedaround the state. The bill would provide $1 million for some local government needs with a requirement for a local match up to 50 percent, as determinedby the policy group. Continued from page 14 Between July and August, the contract was amended three times, authorizing additional work and making Parsons Brinkerhoff the in-terim project manager. The additions increased the contract by $3.4million, bringing the total contract to $6.7 million. Richard Stehr, division engineer for the Department of Transporta- tion, said the Legislature and two governors have told the departmentto build the light-rail project and have established a tight schedule tocomplete it. At the time that Parsons Brinkerhoff was awarded the in-terim project manager contract, Stehr said a search process would havetaken too long. \"A six-month search for a consultant would have killed the project, \" he said. Stehr also said that the longer the project takes, the more money it will cost because of inflation. The project is currently estimated tocost $548 million. Krinkie said he was \"extremely disappointed \" with the department because of the difficulty he has had in getting answers to his ques-tions. \"This committee is charged with the oversight of taxpayers ' money, \" he said. \"Full and open disclosure is only absolutely fair and necessary. If this project can stand up to scrutiny, we will have a better project. \" The bill now moves to the House Rules Committee.

Cities and countries today continueto improve the process by bridging a gapfor speedier transit or for transportinggoods in a short period of time. In Minnesota, the Legislature has gotten involved. Though today 's hot topic is light- rail transit, more than 100 years ago, law-makers helped public utilities with fundingfor bridges and other structures as they be-gan to compete with each other. Elsewhere, at the design and construction level, competition seemed to drive thebuilding of bigger and longer bridges. New York 's George Washington Bridge, for example, had the longest suspensionspan in the world \u2014 3,500 feet \u2014 in 1931. But San Francisco 's 4,200-foot long Golden Gate Bridge took over from 1937 until 1964when New York 's V errazano Narrows Bridge outdid it by 60 feet. The new record lasted until 1981, but the Humber River Bridge in England spanned animpressive space of 4,626 feet. England thenlost the longest bridge span title to Denmark 's 5,328 feet Great Belt East Bridge in 1997. The competition did not end there. In 1998, Japan 's bridge builders outdid themReflections all by erecting the Akaski-Kaikyo Bridge with an incredible expansive space of 6,532feet between its two towers. Worldwide bridge building today seems to promote an ongoing competitive spirit.Y et, closer to home, the long-time contestfor \"Best City \" between Minneapolis and St. Paul began about 150 years ago. Andbridges were involved in the ongoing matchwhen the challenges all started. During the 1840 's the city of St. Anthony 's trade and population grew. So did its competition with St. Paul. Whensome ambitious leaders from across theriver tried to move the territorial capital,for example, they had to be placated withland to the west to build the University ofMinnesota.As the community of Minneapolis grew on the west side of the river, St. Anthonyconnected it to Nicollet Island in 1855 witha single arch bridge to increase trade. ButMinneapolis grew faster, then annexed St.Anthony, as it became St. Paul 's newest and more aggressive competition. In 1857, St. Paul compensated by build- ing the St. Paul Bridge (Wabasha StreetBridge) \u2014 the first bridge to completely span the Mississippi. Later, Smith Avenuewas constructed about a mile to the west ofthe bridge as a more direct route to the river. In 1889, the route was connected by a new 2,270 foot-long High Bridge, to joinSt. Paul 's business center across the Missis- sippi. The bridge was built expressly forboosting St. Paul 's economy, but not with- out much debate. Funding was securedthrough the legislative influence of Sena-tor Robert A. Smith, a former St. Paul mayorand House member. St. Paul 's competitors cried foul. Other incidents were often worse. Later, the two cities even accused each other ofpadding the 1890 census (both did). Now, over 100 years later, the cities con- tinue to be separate on most public issues,but maybe over the bridge of time, they willsolve their differences. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERT Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical SocietyA 1891 photo showing development occuringon the upper west side around the end of theHigh Bridge.

But the court 's action is also significant be- cause the court ruled that only the single pro-vision in question was unconstitutional, ratherthan striking down the entire law. That action has raised questions that the judicial branch could be crossing the carefullydrawn boundaries between the three branchesof state government. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Alan Page expresses fears the court is putting itself in theposition of a \"super legislature, \" approving or rejecting small slices of larger pieces oflegislation. The March 31 ruling struck down a provi- sion in wide-reaching tax legislation passed in1997. The portion of the law in question es-tablished new prevailing-wage requirementson school construction projects. The measure was challenged on grounds that it did not meet the MinnesotaConstitution 's requirement that \"no law shall embrace more than one subject, which shallbe expressed in its title. \" While it 's not clear what exactly the ramifi- cations of the ruling will be, it seems the courthas taken a significant step in its long historyof dealing with the scope and character of billspassed by the Legislature. In his majority opinion, Justice Edward Stringer traces the issue to the days beforestatehood. \"Early in Minnesota history the potential for mischief in bundling together into one billdisparate legislative provisions was wellknown, \" Stringer writes. Delegates to the Democratic constitutional convention in 1857 first considered a proposalthat called for the title to indicate the contentsof the bill, but that provision was expandedCourt seeks single subject Taking up an issue that has nagged it since statehood, theSupreme Court issues a ruling that could change the waythe Legislature does business to forbid the grouping of unrelated subjectsinto one bill, a practice known as \"logrolling. \" The Minnesota Supreme Court first weighed in on the issue in 1858, the year thestate was established. A measure passed by the First Legislature was challenged on grounds that it containedmore than one subject, but the court allowedthe law to stand. \"We concluded that the single subject re- quirement was not offended because there was'no attempt at fraud or the interpolation of matter foreign to the subject expressed in thetitle, '\" Stringer 's opinion says. Thus began a long line of cases that have drawn and redrawn the limits on what is ac-ceptable when it comes to the single-subjecttest and the bill title requirements. In 1891, the court issued a major ruling that attempted to clarify the purpose of the \"single- subject and title clause \" to prevent logrolling. \"We explained, however, that despite these constitutional restrictions, the single subjectprovision should be interpreted liberally andthe restriction would be met if the bill weregermane to one general subject, \" Stringer writes. The 1891 ruling declared that the single- subject requirement should not prevent theLegislature from \"embracing in one act all matters properly connected with one generalsubject. \" And the ruling stated that the term \"subject \" has \"broad and extended meaning \" in the constitution. That ruling also explained that the bill title provision is meant to \"prevent fraud or sur- prise upon the Legislature and the public byprohibiting the inclusion of 'provisions in a bill whose title gives no intimation of the na-ture of the proposed legislation, '\" Stringer says in his description of the 1891 decision. In 1939, the court issued a ruling that fur- ther clarified the requirement that the bill titleaccurately describe the measure 's contents. The court decided that the \"generality of the title\" was not grounds to invalidate a law and that \"the title was never intended to be an in- dex of the law. \" While those earlier rulings seemed to pro- vide leeway for the Legislature, more recentcases have moved in another direction. Stringer 's opinion describes a series of rul- ings in the last two decades that have servedto \"sound an alarm that we would not hesi- tate to strike down oversweeping legislationthat violates the single-subject and title clause,regardless of the consequences. \" In those cases, former Justice Lawrence Y etka emerged as a harsh critic of legislativepractices, and he expressed concern that thecourt had been too lax over the years. \"Now all bounds of reason and restraint seem to have been abandoned, \" Y etka stated in a concurring opinion on a 1986 case. \". . . The worm that was merely vexatious in the19th century has become a monster eating theconstitution in the 20th. \" 'We fully recognize that it is the Legislature's prerogative to establish our state's public policy in the area of pre- vailing wages and that the legislative process is not bound by rigid textbook rules. Nonetheless, lawmaking must occur within the framework of the constitution.' \u2014Justice Edward Stringer 'Declaring only the offending provision unconstitu- tional does nothing to discourage the Legislature from engaging in the conduct.' \u2014Justice Alan Page4 April 7, 2000IT'SAFACT As for the current case, Stringer 's opinion seems to argue that the Legislature had beenwarned by the court but legislative practiceswere not changed. The 1997 tax law, which Stringer calls \"a prodigious work of legislation, \" included a provision requiring that the prevailing wagebe paid in the construction or remodeling ofall educational facilities where project costsexceed $100,000. The provision was challenged by a school district, a builders ' association, and an elec- trical contractor on grounds that the law vio-lated both the title requirements and thesingle-subject clause. Lower courts found fault with the law be- cause the 800-word title had no clear refer-ence to the wage provision \u2014 words like \"labor, \" \"wages, \" and \"construction \" were no- where to be found \u2014 and because the provi- sion was not \"remotely related \" to the broad subject of tax reform and tax relief. In the Supreme Court ruling, Stringer af- firms the assessment of the problems with the1997 bill 's title. \"The failure . . . to give even a hint that the prevailing wage amendment was part of thebill leads us to the conclusion that the title didnot provide sufficient notice of the amend-ment to legislators and school districts to meetthe constitutional requirement, \" he writes. As for the single-subject clause, Stringer lists a series of problems with the prevailing-wageprovision. He argues that prevailing-wage lawshave historically been considered in laborcommittees, not tax committees. He also com-plains that the prevailing-wage provision camefrom the House, had no Senate companionbill, and was \"inserted into a much broader and popular bill with an entirely different leg-islative theme. \" Summing up the court 's position on the matter, the ruling says that while the prevail-ing-wage section \"may have a tax impact by affecting construction costs, clearly that is notits purpose and nowhere is consideration oftax relief and reform mentioned in its veryshort text. \" The ruling includes another important as- pect that may have far-reaching effects in thefuture. The court decided that the prevailing-wage provision could be stricken down whilethe rest of the 1997 law is left in place. The state had argued that the invalidation of the provision would throw out the entiretax law, but the court rejected that argument.It's unclear what the impact of that decision will be, but it could invite more challenges toportions of omnibus bills. In his dissent, Page expresses serious Sixteen times Ernest Lundeen 's name was on the ballot for state or federal office.Sixteen election nights he waited to learnhis fate. Such is the life of a perennial can- didate. But Lundeen was not a lifelong also-ran. His political career was a string of failurespunctuated by successes of the kindmost politicians will never see. The final tally shows 10 losses and six victories. He ran in every regular andspecial election for whichhe was eligible from 1910to 1936, according to the1947 book The Story of Minnesota Politics by Charles B. Cheney. Cheney spent half a cen- tury writing about politics inMinnesota for newspapers in-cluding the Minneapolis Journal and the Minneapolis Tribune , and he watched Lundeen 's unusual career from its relatively inauspicious beginning to itstragic end. In 1910, Lundeen was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives from a Minneapolis district, and he won re-elec- tion two years later. With two victories to his credit, Lundeen looked to move up to the U.S. Congress in1914, but he suffered the first of his manydefeats. He rebounded by winning a seat in the U.S. House two years later. His term in the House was marked by his unpopular 1917 vote against U.S. in-volvement in World War I. After the votedrew outrage at home, Lundeen stayed inWashington, D.C., for weeks, hoping the situation would cool. According to Cheney 's book, the congressman 's eventual return to Minne- sota was not announced, and the local re-porters found out about it only after a tipfrom an associate in Washington, D.C. When Cheney tracked down Lundeen back home, the reporter wryly suggestedthat it was too bad the congressman didTen-time loser Perennial candidate's career saw many highs and lows not publicize his homecoming becausethere might have been a crowd to meethim at the train station. What Cheneymeant was that Lundeen may have been received by a less-than-friendly mob. Lundeen acted as though his quiet re- turn was simply a product of his modesty. \"Oh, I don 't care much for that sort of thing, \" he told Cheney. The successes of Lundeen 's early career soon gave way to a series of losses. He was dumped from Congress in 1918, losing in the pri-mary. He lost in the pri- mary again when he tried to recover his seat two years later. He ran for the U.S. Sen- ate in 1922 and in a 1923 spe- cial election. He shifted gears and ran for the Minnesota Su- preme Court in 1924. Then he lost another U.S. House campaign in 1926. Lundeen was the Farmer-Labor candi- date for governor in 1928, but he lost in athree-way race won by incumbent Gov.Theodore Christianson, a Republican. Two more losses followed, coming in a 1929 special election for a U.S. House seatand a 1930 race for the U.S. Senate. After more than a decade of defeat af- ter defeat, Lundeen managed to win a1932 campaign for an at-large seat in the U.S. House. A Farmer-Labor ticket headed by gubernatorial candidate Floyd B. Olsonwas credited with helping Lundeen getback to Congress after a 14-year absence. The professional candidate 's greatest success came four years later. He was se- lected to be the Farmer-Labor candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1936, and he won. That meant six years of job security, something Lundeen had never enjoyed.But he would never see the end of thatterm. Lundeen died in a 1940 plane crash. (N. H EAL Y)Ernest Lundeen Continued on page 21Session Weekly 5MARCH 30 - A PRIL 6 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #CRIME#BUSINESS Economic doctrine clarified The House passed a bill April 4 that would repeal the state 's existing economic loss doc- trine and replace it with a new provision thatproponents say is easier to understand. The economic loss doctrine sets the boundary for claims, limiting what compa-nies can sue for under contract law and whatcompanies can sue for under traditional tortlaw. Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF1267/SF1126*), which wouldlimit commercial parties to legal solutionsunder the Uniform Commercial Code(UCC). The code provides a shorter statuteof limitations time frame than tort law. \"This bill clarifies the law on who can sue and when they can sue, \" Pawlenty said. The legislation would apply only to claims by a buyer against a seller. The measurewould not apply to claims for injury. The bill stems from an agreement between several interest groups who met during thepast year. During a House Civil Law Com-mittee hearing last month, several legisla-tors were critical of the agreement becausethey were not invited to take part in thediscussions. \"I don 't know if that is the way the Legisla- ture is supposed to work, \" said Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center). Carruthers spoke against a provision that says a buyer may not bring a common lawmisrepresentation claim against a sellerunless the misrepresentation was made in-tentionally or recklessly. \"The buyer depends on that representa- tion, \" Carruthers said. \"I don 't think anyone should profit from misrepresentation; Idon't care if it is intentional or not. \" Despite Carruthers ' concerns, he urged legislators to vote for the bill. \"This bill is an improvement in readabil- ity and understandability, \" Carruthers said. Daniel Kleinberger, law professor at the William Mitchell College of Law, told thecommittee that every state has an economicloss doctrine, with Minnesota 's doctrine be- ginning in 1981. If a customer is unsatisfied with the prod- uct or service, the person can sue in tort, hesaid.\"As a consumer advocate, (the bill) is at least as good, if not better, \" Kleinberger said. The bill is not retroactive and would have no effect on pending litigation, Kleinbergersaid. The statute repealed under the bill hadbeen passed in a special session in 1998, af-ter concerns arose over a case involvingMarvin Windows, a Warroad-basedcompany. Secretary of state bill The House passed a bill April 5 that would make slight changes to the state 's corporate registration requirements. The vote was133-1. Rep. Jim Seifert (R-Woodbury), the spon- sor of the measure (HF3066/SF2783*), saidthe bill is the Minnesota secretary of state 's annual housekeeping bill, clarifying andcleaning up laws relating to the state 's cor- porate registration records. Currently, Minnesota corporations are required to file a registration annually thatlists the legal corporate name and address,as well as the name and address of the chiefexecutive officer. There is no fee for filing the registration as long as the form is filed annually. If a cor-poration misses filing the form, it loses itsgood standing with the state. T o reinstate cor-porate good standing requires a $25 fee. If acorporation fails to file the form for threeconsecutive years, the state statutorily dis-solves the corporation. The bill would require the secretary of state to mail the form directly to thecorporation 's registered office address rather than having the Department of Revenuemail out the form in the corporate tax in-formation. If the corporation does not file theform by December 31 of each year, the statewould statutorily dissolve the corporationafter one missed year rather than three. The bill also would change registration requirements for non-Minnesota corpora-tions that do business in the state. Currently,those corporations file a registration with afee based on the taxable income in the state.The minimum filing fee is $60. The billwould establish a flat filing fee of $115 forall non-Minnesota corporations filing theirannual registrations with the state. Seifert said the bill would help standard- ize the registration requirements for thedifferent types of entities that file with the sec- retary of state including for-profit, nonprofit,and non-Minnesota corporations, as well aslimited liability companies. The registrationrequirement helps the secretary of state keepits corporate records up to date. The bill also would provide that the digi- tal signatures of public and local officials ongovernment records are sufficient to meetlegal signature requirements. The bill now goes to the governor. Katie's Law signed Gov. Jesse V entura signed a measure known as Katie 's Law on April 3. The measure stiff- ens laws regulating sex offenders and providesstart-up money for new criminal justice in-formation systems. The law will provide $12 million to imple- ment a statewide criminal justice informationsystem, which officials estimate could cost asmuch as $100 million before completion. One goal of the information system is bet- ter tracking of registered sex offenders in thestate. It also would integrate probation andarrest information from local law enforcementagencies, so law enforcement officers aroundthe state have access to the most up-to-dateinformation about offenders. The law will also spend $5 million to in- crease the number of probation officers han-dling sex offender cases. The intent is to reducethe number of cases each officer must handleso they can keep better track of their sex of-fenders. Further provisions change who is required to register, adding certain penalties to that list.In addition, it extends the period of registra-tion for many offenses, including a require-ment that some offenders register for life. The law will also authorize the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to establish a Web sitewhere it will post all the names of level 3 reg-istered sex offenders in the state. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored thelegislation. Many of its provisions were in-cluded as a result of the lobbying efforts ofPam Poirier. Poirier 's 19-year-old daughter Katie was abducted from a Moose Lake convenience6 April 7, 2000store last May. She is presumed to have been murdered. Donald Blom, a six-time convicted sex of- fender, is scheduled to stand trial for the crimethis month. In his statement upon signing the law, Ventura said it takes another step to improvepublic safety for Minnesota. He also said he favors spending for the in- tegrated criminal justice system. However, healso noted that there are important facets ofthe plan still unfinished. V entura said the Legislature needs to clarify the role of local governments in the system.He also said the system will not be as effectivewithout a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion building. (The House approved $28 mil-lion in bonding for the project, and the Senateapproved the full $58 million requested.) He also raised concerns about two provi- sions of the law \u2014 increasing the penalty for failing to register as a sex offender to a felonyand doubling the sentences for first-time rapeconvictions. While he supports those provisions, he said he does not like the fact that the Legislatureprovided no funding for them. Most of the provisions in the law are effec- tive Aug. 1, 2000, and apply to crimes com-mitted after that date. Appropriations in thelaw are effective July 1, 2000. Remaining pro-visions, including those for the criminal in-formation system, are effective the dayfollowing enactment, or April 4, 2000. HF2688*/SF2769/CH311 Vehicular homicide bill fails The House rejected a bill April 4 that would have expanded the definition of criminal ve-hicular homicide. The vote was 72-61 againstthe measure. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) is the sponsor of the bill (HF2610), which wouldhave made a driver criminally liable if thecrash is caused by a trailer that was improp-erly secured. The bill stipulated that the driverhad to know or have reason to know the at-tachment was faulty. \"I'm simply trying to assure that if they know the equipment is faulty, they are heldaccountable, \" she said. \"It's blatant disregard and a high standard. \" Under the bill, the driver could have been charged with a crime only if someone waskilled or suffered great bodily harm due to thetrailer and if the driver knew the possible dan-ger existed. Boudreau said she introduced the bill after a car accident killed three people in her dis-trict. She said the driver of the vehicle with atrailer had previously been warned that the PREVENTION RALLY Margaret Johnson, right , sits with her 6-month-old daughter Iyanna Woodson asher 6-year-old son Anthony Johnson standswith his grandmother Toni Johnson during arally on the Capitol steps to raise awarenessfor Child Abuse and Neglect PreventionMonth April 4.trailer hook-up was faulty. The trailer cameloose from the vehicle, hitting another car andkilling three people. Boudreau said the driverwas charged only with careless driving, whichis a misdemeanor. Several rural legislators objected to the bill, saying they feared a farmer could be found li-able for not using safety chains on farmequipment. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) said the bill should have gone through the House trans-portation committees for more examinationof the farm equipment issues. Many farmers do not use chains, although they are recommended, because older equip-ment is not equipped with chains. The billcould have had the effect of making chainsrequired, Juhnke said. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) said he feared that well-meaning people would becharged under the bill. \"Are we going to make a whole bunch of criminals out of people who aren 't criminals? \" Jennings said.Statute of limitations extended Domestic abuse victims would have more time to consider filing civil charges against theperpetrator, under a bill the House passedApril 5. The vote was 132-0. The bill (HF47/SF11*) would extend the statute of limitations in domestic abuse casesfrom two years to six years. Rep. David Bishop (R-Rochester), who is sponsoring the legislation, said the statute oflimitations would begin at the point of the lastincident. \"So many times, these domestic abuse wrongs are covered up or delayed, \" Bishop said. \"It doesn 't surface for a long time. \" Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) of- fered an amendment that would establish apilot project domestic abuse unit in theRamsey County attorney 's office. The unit would be able to prosecute cases, recognizeinterests of children in abuse cases, and reducethe exposure of domestic abuse for victims. The bill now heads back to the Senate. Sales tax evasion People who collect motor vehicle sales tax and then fail to send the tax to the state wouldbe guilty of a felony, under a bill the Housepassed April 4. The vote was 134-0. Sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the bill (HF3303/SF3566*) would cre-ate a felony for not submitting vehicle salestax to the state. The bill states that the personcollecting the tax must \"willfully \" fail to send in the tax. \"This is one of the most important tools we have in stopping fraudulent car sales, \" Entenza said. While the House bill creates a felony regard- less of the dollar amount involved, the Senateversion only creates a felony when the tax in-volved exceeds $500. If the tax amount wereless than $500, the crime would be a gross mis-demeanor, under the Senate bill. Entenza said the bill stems from a February state Supreme Court decision, when the courtthrew out the convictions of Frank Larson,who owns Southwest Leasing, a Mankato com-pany. Larson was convicted in 1997 of collect-ing $12,000 in vehicle sales tax that he failedto send to the state. The state Supreme Court ruled the wrong statute was used in charging Larson with acrime. The court ruling no longer makes it afelony to not send in the vehicle sales tax.Entenza explained that his legislation wouldsimply revert the law to where it was prior tothe court decision. The state will collect about $526 million in vehicle sales tax in 2001, according to the non-partisan House Research Department. It isSession Weekly 7unknown what amount of sales tax is not collected. The bill now heads back to the Senate. Serving court orders A bill that aims to ease the process of serv- ing court orders passed the House on April 4.The vote was 131-2. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF1067/SF551*), which wouldallow police officers more leeway to serve courtorders to people. The bill creates a short formnotification, which officers could serve topeople at any time. For instance, if an officer pulls over a car for speeding, and the officer learns that a courtis trying to contact that person to serve courtorders, the officer could serve notification thenand there, under the bill. \"T o me, it made perfect sense, \" Fuller said. \"If there is something to be served to them, (the law enforcement officer) can serve it. \" An officer could serve paperwork at any time, including Sundays or legal holidays, thebill states. Though the bill pertains to any court or- der, it was specifically written to deal with pro-tection orders. The notification form would include the respondent 's and petitioner 's name, the county that served the order, the name of thejudge, and the date of a hearing. The short order form would direct the re- cipient to report to the sheriff 's office or court- house to pick up the full copy of service. In addition, the short form would have the same weight as the full service, in case the re-cipient did not go to the courthouse and pickup the full service. The officer could detain the person as long as necessary in order to fill out and serve theperson with the short form, the bill states. \"It gives law enforcement the better tools they need to perform their duties, \" Fuller said. The bill goes to the Senate.#EDUCATION Threatening school officials Any person who threatens to inflict bodily harm on a school official would be guilty of amisdemeanor, under a bill the House passedApril 5. The vote was 127-3. A second offense would lead to a gross mis- demeanor. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF3465), which would amend thecurrent terroristic threat statute. If a person makes threats to a school offi- cial and knows the words or actions cause ter-ror, the person would be guilty. \"It doesn 't just protect teachers, \" Larsensaid. \"I'm doing this a lot for prevention. I 'm trying to help these kids when their anger isshown. \" Larsen said the bill came from a commu- nity justice coordinator in her district, whogave an example of a 14-year-old boy whothreatened to beat up his teacher. The threatdid not fall under current fifth-degree assaultor terroristic threat statutes, Larsen explained.She believes this bill will fill the hole in thelaw where there is no protection for teachers. The bill includes all teachers, administra- tors, or employees at a school, including pub-lic and private institutions. The bill now heads to the Senate. Domestic violence prevention The House passed a bill April 3 that would establish an office of domestic violence andsexual assault prevention. The vote was133-0. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack) is spon- soring a bill (HF3331) that creates the officeand establishes an interagency task force ondomestic abuse and sexual assault prevention. The bill is a \"road map \" for putting together the task force, Howes said. The task forcewould be required to include representativesfrom the departments of Corrections, Health,Human Services, Economic Security, andChildren, Families and Learning. The taskforce also would include a county attorney, cityattorney, and a judge. The director of domestic violence would serve as chair of the task force. The bill outlines the duties of the director of the new office, which include advocatingvictims ' rights, increasing education and awareness, supporting litigation, initiatingpolicy changes, and building partnerships withlaw enforcement and the courts. The bill now heads to the Senate. Check fraud cases There would be new penalties for crimes involving check fraud, under a bill the Housepassed April 4. The vote was 134-0. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) is spon- soring the bill (HF2751/SF3455*), whichwould create a misdemeanor offense whensomeone falsely tells their bank or other fi-nancial institution the items are missing orstolen. \"This is not going after people who mistak- enly overdraft their accounts, \" Stanek said. \"This is for people who intentionally and criminally defraud banks and businesses bywriting out a number of bad checks. \" The bill also would provide that a person could be charged for possessing, receiving, ortransferring a bad check if he or she knows or has reason to know the check being passed orreceived is stolen or counterfeit. Bob Johnson, Anoka County attorney, told the House Civil Law Committee last monththat the bill is geared to stop \"the tremendous growth in bad checks. \" The bill was proposed by a coalition of law enforcement officials,county attorneys, and private businesses,Stanek said. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. #ENVIRONMENTSharing student information The House passed a bill April 5 that would authorize schools and juvenile justice officialsto share information about a student on pro-bation. The vote was 127-6. The bill 's sponsor, Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), said the measurewould amend the provision of the MinnesotaGovernment Data Practices Act by allowingcertain data about a student to be disclosed tothe system in order to serve the student orprotect staff or fellow students. The bill (HF2833) would allow a juvenile court disposition order to be shared with cer-tain school officials, law enforcement, andspecified others when a juvenile has beenfound to be delinquent for certain violationsof criminal law. It would require that the order be sent to a district 's superintendent and then transmit- ted to the student 's principal for placement in the student 's education record. Data that could be disclosed about students on probation would include any informationabout controlled substance use, possession ofweapons, assaults or threatening behavior, orthefts, vandalisms or other property damage. A student 's principal, under the bill, would be permitted to notify an employee in directcontact with the student if that individualneeds the data to work with the student ap-propriately, to avoid being vulnerable, or toprotect others from vulnerability. The bill now moves to the Senate. Environment funding amendment A proposed constitutional amendment to dedicate three-sixteenths of one percent of thestate sales tax to fund natural resource needsin the state would go before the voters in a billforwarded by the House Taxes CommitteeMarch 31. The committee sent the bill (HF3426) to the8 April 7, 2000 House Ways and Means Committee without recommendation. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), the bill 's sponsor, said that under the bill, voters wouldconsider the amendment on the 2000 generalelection ballot. If approved it would dedicate45 percent of the proceeds to a newly createdaccount in the state game and fish fund, andthe other 55 percent would fund various pur-poses including spending on state parks, trailgrants, and support of various zoos in thestate. Holsten said the new funds would enhance revenues already appropriated by the Legisla-ture. The Department of Revenue estimatesthat the measure would generate around $62million in 2001 and more than $228 millionin the next biennium. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) asked Holsten why dedicating funds for natural re-sources was more important than dedicatingfunds for education, property tax or incometax relief, or other worthy state-funded causes. Holsten replied that the state 's commitment in areas such as education would remain inplace even if the voters approved the new fund.He said that a long-term solution to fund thestate 's natural resources has to be addressed. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) said she agreed with Holsten, although she said she wasnot sure the bill was the best way to addressthe problem. She said that the state 's tourism industry depends on the reputation and well-being of the state 's natural resources. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the committee chair, said that the bill 's financial implications suggest it should have been heardby the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Finance Committee. He said that com-mittee determines the amount and priority forfunding the state 's natural resources.NATIONAL CHAMPIONS #FAMILY#GAMBLING Marriage license discount Couples could reduce the fee for a marriage license if they obtain premarital educationunder a bill passed by the House April 5. Thevote was 97-35. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson), would provide a reduced fee formarriage licenses for couples who receive atleast 12 hours of premarital education from aqualified person. A qualified person would include a clergy member, a person authorized by law to per-form marriages, or a marriage and familytherapist. The education would include teaching about the seriousness of marriage, conflictmanagement skills, and the desirability ofobtaining counseling if the marriage falls into difficulty later on. The marriage license fee for those who com- pleted premarital education would be loweredto $25 under the bill (HF2229/SF884*). Inaddition, the bill would raise all other mar-riage license fees from $70 to $75. The bill also changes distribution of the money from marriage license fees. Current lawallocates $50 to the state general fund, whileleaving $15 in the county where the license isobtained and giving $5 to other projects. Thebill increases the amount to the general fundfrom $50 to $55. The measure now goes to the Senate. Involuntary commitment Parents will have more control in admitting mentally ill children to hospitals under a lawGov. Jesse Ventura signed April 3. The law will add mental illness to current law on involuntary admission and treatment.The law currently allows parents to admit achild age 16 or 17 to a hospital if the child ismentally retarded or chemically dependent. The previous law allowed parents to admit children to hospitals for a mental illness up toage 16. The law will now extend that provi-sion to age 18. Even if the 16- or 17-year-oldchild refuses treatment, the parents will be ableto admit the child to a hospital. The law also will require hospital officials to inform the patient that a family memberhas made an inquiry about the patient 's health. The patient would then have to authorize therelease of any information. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) and Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsoredthe legislation. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF3107/SF2634*/CH316 Gambling fraud penalties Tampering with gambling devices or claim- ing a gambling prize through fraud or use ofcounterfeited equipment will now be a felony,under a law Gov. Jesse Ventura signed April 3. The law will establish felonies if the dollar amount involved in the gambling fraud ex-ceeds $2,500. The maximum penalty for afelony will be three years in prison and a$6,000 fine. A person could be charged with a misde- meanor when the dollar amount involved is$500 or less or a gross misdemeanor when thevalue is between $500 and $2,500. The law will make it illegal to knowingly claim a gambling prize using altered or coun-terfeited equipment. It will also make it ille-gal to claim a prize through fraud, deceit ormisrepresentation. Tampering with gambling equipment in an attempt to influence the outcome of the gamealso will be illegal under the law.Members of the University of Minnesota Women's Gopher Hockey Team receive a standingovation from members in the House chamber April 6, after lawmakers passed a resolutionhonoring the team. The team became the national champions of women's college hockeyMarch 25 by winning the American Women's College Hockey Alliance tournament. It was thefirst ever national championship for women's athletics at the U of M.Session Weekly 9Sporting a Minnesota Twins jersey and cap April 3, Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm) looked ready for the season tobegin. Though it was still only 10:30 a.m.,T omassoni 's thoughts were on the Twins season opener at the Metrodome later inthe evening. T omassoni offered a resolution to honor the Minnesota Twins and the team 's 40- year history in the state, including WorldSeries titles in 1987 and 1991. The teamwon the American League pennant in1965 and won division titles in 1969 and1970. \"This resolution is about the great memories the Minnesota Twins have givenus,\" T omassoni said. \"It's America 's game. Baseball is our beloved national pastime. \" The resolution passed on a 132-0 vote.Hall-of-Famer Harmon Killebrew and former all-star as the House passed the resolution.Play ball Legislators break from regular duties to honor Minnesota's boys of summer They also received a rousing ovation fromHouse members. T omassoni told a story about meeting Killebrew as a child, when the legendaryhome run hitter emerged from the Twinsdugout and signed autographs and shookhands with several children. T omassonispoke warmly about that memory, andthanked Killebrew for his friendliness to-ward fans. The resolution dubs baseball as \"a game woven so deeply into our lives that it pro-vides common ground for people of allages. \" The resolution also recognizes base- ball as \"wholesome, family entertain- ment. \" Discussion of the resolution concluded with Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby)singing \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame. \" About 43,000 people attended the Twins opener. The Twins lost 7-0. (C.

Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe bill. The law takes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF3023/SF2701*/CH318 Law allows lighted lures A new law signed April 3 will allow anglers to use lighted fishing lures. While the lures are used in neighboring states, current state law allows the manufac-ture and sale of lighted lures but does not al-low anglers to use them in Minnesota waters. The new law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, contains a provision mandating that batteries used inlighted fishing lures cannot contain mercury.That portion was added due to concerns thebatteries could be swallowed by fish or lost inthe water. Rep. Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley) and Sen. Pat Pariseau (R-Farmington) sponsoredthe legislation. HF3352/SF3586*/CH308 Turning over state property Ownership of a piece of state property that previously housed a juvenile correctional fa-cility was turned over to the city of Sauk Cen-tre under a new law signed April 4 by Gov.Jesse Ventura. Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria), House sponsor of the measure, said the MinnesotaCorrectional Facility-Sauk Centre was closedin July 1999 and has been vacant since then. Effective April 5, 2000, the local officials can use the property for economic developmentor for city or county government purposes,which Cassell said will be a vehicle to createjobs. If the state had not turned the land over to the city, the state Department of Administra-tion estimated that it would have spent$200,000 per year in minimal maintenance tothe vacant facility. It was established in 1911 as a facility for delinquent girls, but became coeducational in1967. Under state law, when an agency vacates a piece of property, the state Department ofAdministration offers the property to otherstate agencies or departments that might wantto use the property. But in this case, no otheragency expressed interest, Cassell said. Cassell added that the land originally was purchased by the city and given to the state inthe early 1900s to be used as a correctional facility. The city also extended water and sewerlines to the buildings and has continued tomaintain that system. Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) was the Senate sponsor of the measure. HF2819/SF2444*/CH326 Abortion consent revisited The House revisited \"right-to-know \" abor- tion legislation April 5 and passed a less-re-strictive version of a bill intended totemporarily delay a doctor 's procedure. The vote was 89-44. The bill (HF3652/SF3387*) would require a woman considering an abortion to wait atleast 24 hours before undergoing the proce-dure. And the measure would require that thewoman be given information about risks andalternatives at least 24 hours before the pro-cedure is scheduled. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), is similar to earlierlanguage proposed by Rep. Lynda Boudreau(R-Faribault) calling for a woman to give herinformed consent prior to an abortion. That provision was included in the larger10 April 7, 2000state government appropriations bill (HF2699), currently in conference committee. That spending bill was passed by the House in March. During recent conference commit-tee discussions, House members suggestedpossibly taking policy items out of the bill toavoid constitutional challenges. There are several differences between the Boudreau \"right-to-know \" bill and the Goodno version the House passed most re-cently. The Goodno bill would waive the 24-hour waiting period for cases when a woman 's life or health may put in danger by delaying theprocedure. It also would modify language pertaining to a woman 's right to sue if an abortion were performed without following the consent pro-cedures, and would strike the requirement thatthe name of the doctor performing the pro-cedure be included with the information givento the patient. Under the bill, a woman would need to re- ceive by mail, phone, Internet, or in personinformation about prenatal care, child sup-port, adoption, and other material about preg-nancy and community support services. The bill goes to the Senate. Deregulating hotdish The House passed a bill April 4 that would ease health regulations regarding food servedat community potluck events. The vote was131-0. The idea behind the bill originated when Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), attending aDFL bean feed at the American Legion Hallin Willmar, was told health regulations pre-vented outsiders from bringing prepared foodinto community potlucks. According to Aggie Leitheiser, assistant commissioner of the state 's Health Protection Bureau, such restrictions exist to prevent out-breaks of food-borne disease. Over the pastfour years, Leitheiser said, 16 percent of theconfirmed food-borne disease outbreaks inthe state were traced to privately preparedfood. So, following health regulations to the let- ter, organizers of the event in Willmar politelyrejected Juhnke 's beans, asking him to return them to his car. After the experience, Juhnke said he felt all people should be allowed to attend commu-nity potlucks and share their food withoutbeing subject to health inspection. His bill (HF2707/SF3348*) would allow any person attending a potluck event, not justmembers of the organization sponsoring theevent, to bring individually prepared food forconsumption. It also would allow an organi-zation sponsoring potluck events to advertise the events and permit people who are notmembers of the organization to attend theevent and eat the food. A successful amendment to the bill deleted language that would have required signs at apotluck event stating that the food was notprepared in a licensed kitchen and is not sub-ject to health department regulation. The bill now returns to the Senate. Prompt claim payment The House approved a bill April 3 that would establish prompt payment require-ments applicable to health plan companies forclean claims for services rendered by healthcare providers and care facilities. The vote was131-0. Sponsored by Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL- Brooklyn Park), the bill (HF2643/SF2767*)also would apply to third-party administra-tors, but would not pertain to services pro-vided by pharmacists. A \"clean claim \" is defined as a claim that has no defect or impropriety, including anylack of required documentation or any cir-cumstance that prevents timely payment. The bill would require that health plan com- panies and third-party administrators pay ordeny a clean claim within 30 days of receiptof the claim. Claims not paid in that timewould be subject to an interest payment of 1.5percent of the claim per month, under the bill. The company providing the health plan or the third-party administrator would be re-sponsible for paying the interest under the bill\u2014 not the insured party. In addition, late claim payments would not be subject to an interest payment if the pay-ment were delayed to review potentiallyfraudulent or abusive billing practices,however. Furthermore, the commissioner of the De- partment of Health would be prohibited fromassessing a financial administrative penaltyagainst a health plan company that violates thelanguage contained in the bill. The bill now moves to the governor 's desk. Registration for therapists The House passed a bill April 4 that would codify in statute the rules governing occupa-tional therapists and therapists ' assistants. The vote was 130-3. Occupational therapists are currently li- censed through the state Department ofHealth. The bill would merely place into statelaw the rules employed by the department togovern those therapists and assistants. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), who is sponsoring the measure (HF947/SF1038*),said the bill would add the option of registra- tion for therapists but would not prohibit in-dividuals who are not registered frompracticing as an occupational therapist orassistant. The bill also would specify educational and examination requirements for registration asan occupational therapist. The sections of the bill governing registra- tion would apply only to applicants for regis-tration, therapists who are registered, peoplewho use protected titles, and therapists whosay they are registered, Howes said. The bill also makes provisions for renew- ing registration, as well as temporary andequivalent registration for occupationaltherapists. The bill now moves to the governor 's desk. Organ donation checkoff Motorists would have the option to give money to an organization that increases publicawareness of organ donations, under a bill theHouse passed April 5. The vote was 121-11. Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) said she wants to disseminate more informa-tion about organ donations. Luther, who hadan emergency liver transplant in February1998, is sponsoring the bill (HF2635/SF2737*)to raise money for public awareness ofdonations. The bill would create a $1 checkoff on driver 's license applications. Money raised from the checkoff would go to an organ pro-curement organization, which would makepamphlets and purchase equipment, such asa mobile unit, to increase awareness of thedonation program. \"It's an innovative approach to solve this crisis, \" Luther said earlier this session. Approximately 1,160 Minnesotans are cur- rently on an organ donor waiting list, accord-ing to Susan Gunderson, executive director forLifeSource. Luther wants the checkoff placed on driver 's license forms because people are alreadychoosing whether they want to be an organdonor at that time. During floor discussion, Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) offered an amendmentthat would make it illegal to sell, purchase, orperform research on human fetal tissue thatwas obtained after an abortion. The amend-ment passed 96-35. Luther said she would be happy if the bill could generate $250,000 a year. The bill wouldrequire the organization that is awarded themoney to make a report to the Legislature in2002 on receipts and expenditures. The bill now goes to a House-Senate con- ference committee.Session Weekly 11PRAYING FOR A WINNER John Gordon, Minnesota Twins radio broad- caster, asks members to join hands as he givesthe invocation on April 3, opening day for the2000 Twins season. #HIGHER EDUCATIONPrescription drug cards People will be prohibited from selling, mar- keting, promoting, and distributing any cardoffering discounts for prescription drugs thatfails to meet certain requirements, under a lawsigned March 31 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The measure will allow an individual or the state attorney general to sue to stop any suchact and obtain damages any deception mayhave caused. The measure will protect consumers from promised discounts that are either confusingor not backed by insurance policies. Discounts that are deceptive or that are not authorized by contract with the pharmacieslisted on the card, will be in violation of thenew law, and people issuing or distributing thecards will be subject to prosecution. Also, discount cards will have to promi- nently state that discounts offered are not be-ing offered through any insurance policy. The new law will not apply, however, to vi- sion care, glasses, or contact lenses providedby an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Discounts promised under contract with the state of Minnesota, or a consumer discountcard issued by a store for use at that particu-lar store will also be allowed. Furthermore, a card administered by a health insurer, nonprofit health service plancorporation, or health maintenance organiza-tion (HMO) will be exempt from complyingwith card requirements put forth by the law.

HF2883/SF2579*/CH303 #HUMAN SERVICESDesigning state buildings The House passed a bill April 4 that would allow representatives of colleges, universities,and state agencies to vote on the design of statebuildings. The vote was 120-10. Contracts for designing state buildings are awarded through the state Designer SelectionBoard. Under current law, the agency or school that will be using a new building appoints a non-voting member to the board, which consistsof five voting members. The board looks atdesign plans from competing firms and de-cides which firm will receive the contract. The members of the current board repre- sent the state Department of Administration,the Consulting Engineers Council of Minne-sota (with input from other professional en-gineering societies in the state), the MinnesotaSociety of Architects, and the MinnesotaBoard of the Arts.The bill (HF3195/SF3701*) would increase the board to seven voting members, whichwould include a voting member from the or-ganization that will be using the building. If,for example, a building were being designedfor the University of Minnesota, the univer-sity would have a vote on the final design ofthe building. \"This gives the user agency a real voice and real responsibility (on the board), \" said Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), sponsor ofthe bill. The bill also would make one of the board members represent the American Institute ofArchitects, instead of the Minnesota Societyof Architects. Also, the board would include arepresentative of the Associated General Con-tractors and two citizen members. The bill now goes to the Senate. House votes to overrride The House voted April 4 to override a governor 's veto of a bill that would assure the continued operation of the Ah-Gwah-Chingcenter, a nursing facility in Walker. The Ah-Gwah-Ching center serves residents whose aggressive or difficult-to-manage be-havioral needs cannot be met in their homecommunity. The vote to override was 125-5. Gov. Jesse Ventura had vetoed the measure a day earlier, citing that the bill was \"unneces- sary\" because law currently exists prohibitingthe commissioner of the Department of Hu- man Services from closing the facility with-out the Legislature 's approval. The bill (HF2809), sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), was passed by theHouse March 15 and sent to the Senate, whereit was passed and forwarded to the governorto sign. In addition to language in the bill calling for the center to remain open, the bill wouldclarify the admissions criteria of the facilityand require that the center promote emer-gency admittance and geriatric rapid assess-ment stabilization programs. The Senate has not yet reconsidered the bill. T o complete the override of the governor 's veto, the Senate would need to re-pass the billby a two-thirds majority. The 1999 Legislature successfully overrode a veto, the first time that had happened in 17years. Nursing home closure The House passed a bill April 4 that would establish a process for closing nursing facili-ties. The bill would also allow savings from aclosed facility to be reallocated through spe-cial rate adjustments and interim payments.The vote was 131-4. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), sponsor of the measure (HF3537/SF3198*), said thebill would allow one or more nursing facili-ties owned or operated by any nonprofit cor-poration controlling more than 22 nursingfacilities in the state to submit closure plansto the commissioner of the Department ofHuman Services. Under the bill, a closure plan would need to include the projected costs and savings ofclosure, a timetable for closure, and a proposedrelocation plan for residents. A facility 's plan would also need to include information on the facilities in line to receivea special rate adjustment as a result of the clo-sure and documentation that such facilitieshave accepted liability for recovering overpay-ments to facilities designated to be closed. If the bill were to become law, the commis- sioner would first need to obtain certificationfrom the commissioner of the Department ofHealth that each plan satisfies requirementsrelated to notice of closure and relocation ofresidents before being allowed to approve theplan. The bill would require that a determination of the plan itself be made within 60 days of itssubmittal. The bill now moves to the governor 's desk.12 April 7, 2000#INSURANCE #LAW#LOCAL GOVERNMENT#RECREATION #TRANSPORTATIONAssisting Holocaust survivors The House passed a bill April 4 that would assist Holocaust survivors and their heirs incollecting insurance claims. The vote was133-1. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), spon- sor of the bill (HF3756/SF3423*), said thatsimilar to today, many families that lived priorto World War II planned for the future by pur-chasing life insurance. But many of thosepeople have had difficulty in settling insuranceclaims. Abrams said that often life insurance claims require a death certificate, which for Holocaustvictims is not available. Under the bill, theDepartment of Commerce would be permittedto establish a registry of records of Holocaust-related insurance policies and claims. Currently there is an international commis- sion working to establish a registry and recoverinsurance proceeds from policies issued dur-ing the 1930s and 1940s. Abrams said that there are over 200 Holocaust survivors in the state. The bill also would require insurance com- panies to provide the data necessary to assistHolocaust victims and their beneficiaries. Abrams said the data in the registry that would be established by the bill would be co-operatively exchanged with the registry thatserves other states. He said the measure would encourage in- surance companies that do business in thestate and that did business in Europe beforeWorld War II to settle the insurance claims.The bill would permit the Department ofCommerce to suspend an insurer 's authority to do business in Minnesota if they fail tocomply. The bill now goes to the governor. Disqualifying a judge A bill that outlines the procedure to dis- qualify a judge from sitting on a case passedthe House on April 4. The vote was 99-33. Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring a bill (HF3517/SF2742*) that explains how ajudge would be removed from a particularcase. \"It prevents disqualification of a magis- trate, \" Biernat said. \"It streamlines the process so there is not a lot of motions by attorneys. \" Under the bill, when a person involved in a court case is notified of a court date and thename of the judge, the person would have upto 10 days to reject the judge for any reason.The person would have one free\"disqualification \" of a judge. To disqualify a second judge, the person must prove the judgehas bias in the case. However, once the first hearing has taken place, even if it is within the 10-day period,the person cannot ask for the judge to be re-moved from the case. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) spoke against the bill, saying he is worried that thebacklog of cases judges have will only becomeworse. The bill goes to the Senate. Lake improvement districts Property owners would have a greater say in the establishment and management of lakeimprovement districts, under a measure theHouse passed April 5 on a 70-60 vote. Lake improvement districts are established as a unit of government to provide a methodto address issues and concerns on a more lo-cal level. Rep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake), sponsor of the bill (HF3260/SF2968*), said that currentlythere are 14 such districts in the state. Under current law, lake improvement dis- tricts can conduct projects for water conser-vation and improvement, regulate watersurface use, and provide and finance services.Districts also are allowed to acquire, construct,and operate dams or other water level controlstructures. A county board, or county boards acting jointly, may initiate the establishment of a dis-trict. A petition to the county board signed byat least 26 percent of the proposed district 's property owners may also initiate the process. Olson said his bill would allow property owners to petition their county board, nomatter how the proposed district is initiated,for a referendum before the district is estab-lished. That petition would also require sig-natures from at least 26 percent of the propertyowners within the proposed district. Under the bill, after the initial appointment of district board members by the countyboard, all subsequent district board memberswould be elected by the property owners ofthe district at the district 's annual meeting. The bill also calls for the county board to seek other sources of funding for improve-ment district projects before imposing servicecharges, special assessments, or property taxlevies on property owners. Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) ex- pressed concern with the election portion ofthe bill. He said the bill would establish a pre-cedent of allowing property owners, ratherthan residents, to vote in an election. The bill now goes to the governor.Law sets fine for studs The governor signed a measure April 4 that adds a civil penalty for using metal tractiondevices, or studs, on snowmobiles. The new law was necessary because a civil penalty was inadvertently left out of a 1999law that required people to purchase a stickerfor their snowmobiles if they intend to usestuds. The 1999 measure contains criminal pen- alties for people who drive a snowmobile withstuds on paved state trails. The new law, effective April 5, 2000, estab- lishes civil penalties for people who use snow-mobile studs but do not purchase a sticker. For the first offense, the penalty is capped at $50. The fine for a second offense is up to$300, and for third and subsequent offensesthe fine is up to $600. Rep. Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine) and Sen. Linda Runbeck (R-Circle Pines) spon-sored the legislation. HF3555/SF3283*/CH324 Left lane driving restricted Drivers in the left lane on state highways would be directed to move to the right lanewhen they are not passing, under a bill theHouse passed April 5. The vote was 80-50. The bill (HF3091/SF2484*), sponsored by Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm),would allow the placement of signs alonghighways reminding drivers to move to theright lane after passing. \"This bill is aimed at people who park in the left-hand lane and never move over, \" T omassoni said. \"We're just trying to get people to be more courteous. \" The bill would require the placement of signs every 50 miles along interstate highways,reminding drivers to move to the right laneafter they have passed a car. The signs wouldsay, \"Move to the right after passing. \" T omassoni said the signs are the key part ofthe bill he wants. The left lane should be reserved for pass- ing, avoiding accidents, entering or exiting theinterstate, or when a person is directed by lawenforcement or construction sites, T omassonicontends. Current law provides for a petty misde- meanor for drivers who travel in the left lanebelow the rate of speed of other vehicles onthe road. The bill also would carry the pettymisdemeanor charge. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) spoke against the bill, saying it is unnecessary.Session Weekly 13\"This is going to be a primary offense, \" Dehler said. \"We don 't need laws to tell us to drive with common sense. \" Tomassoni said he does not think police would use this measure for primary offenses. \"I'm confident that our officers won 't be stopping people who are driving in the left-hand lane when there is no one in the right-hand lane, \" he said. Sen. Dick Day (R-Owatonna) is sponsoring the Senate version, which includes a 25 mphmaximum speed in school zones. That provi-sion is not in the House bill. The differences will likely be resolved in a conference committee. Weight restrictions relaxed Heavier vehicles such as public utility or electric cooperative trucks would be exemptfrom springtime weight restrictions under abill the House passed April 4. The vote was115-15. Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen) is sponsoring the bill (HF3274/SF2785*), whichwould allow the vehicles to travel on roads thatusually have weight restrictions for eight weeksin the spring. Public utility vehicles need to be able to travel on side roads when emergencies occur,Workman said. \"For them to come onto your street and re- store your power, they are technically break-ing the law, \" Workman said during a House Transportation Policy Committee meeting inFebruary. \"That 's ridiculous. \" This bill provides for emergency use of the road, and not general transportation for largervehicles, Workman said. Exempted vehiclesunder this bill must not exceed 20,000 poundsper axle. The bill also would allow recycling trucks to travel on the restricted roads. Workman saidthe way the law is written now, recycling com-panies would be required to buy two smallertrucks and employ twice as many workers topick up recycling during the eight-weekstretch to avoid breaking road restrictions. \"It is a complete impossibility to do that, \" Workman said. He noted that school buses, which are heavier than recycling trucks, travel on restricted roads10 times a week, while a recycling truck makesthat route once a week at most. Reps. T om Bakk (DFL-Cook) and Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) then offered suc-cessful amendments to exempt trucks contain-ing raw sewage or milk. The Senate version, sponsored by Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing), does not includethose exemptions. Glen Engstrom, manager of MinnesotaRoad Research for the state Department of Transportation, explained that the eight-weekrestriction is enforced when the ice thaws androads become particularly soft. Transportationofficials decide the beginning date of the re-striction based on several weather factors. Thestarting date changes each year. Road restric-tions are generally placed on state and countyhighways or city streets. By starting the weight restrictions on time, the department saves $10 million annually inroad replacement costs, Engstrom said. The bill now heads to a House-Senate con- ference committee. State immunity from liability A bill that would make the state immune from civil lawsuits involving recreational mo-tor vehicle accidents that occur in a highwayright-of-way passed the House on April 5. Thevote was 79-53. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), would exempt the statefrom liability when accidents or injuries oc-cur involving snowmobiles or other off-roadrecreational vehicles. \"This bill would require a warning, \" Holberg said. \"The warnings would have to be reasonable. \" The sports vehicles \u2014 such as snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles \u2014 are supposed to drive on the side of the ditch opposite theroadway, not at the bottom or the side closestto the highway. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) spoke in fa- vor of the bill, saying the immunity protec-tion would be the same language under thelaw as for state parks. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) spoke against the bill, saying the state shouldbe responsible for the land it owns. \"This is poor public policy, \" Johnson said. \"We have made our ditches public trails. \" Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) also had concerns about the measure. \"Snowmobilers better know this before they hit the trail next season, \" Hasskamp said. The bill (HF3613/SF3307*) now heads to the governor 's desk. Newspaper's stance questioned A Star Tribune official appeared before the House Transportation Finance Committee onMarch 30 to defend the newspaper 's editorial stance on the proposed Hiawatha Corridorlight-rail transit project. Critics of the light-rail project have pointed out that the newspaper has changed its edito-rial position from criticism of the project tosupport in recent months.Frank Parisi, senior vice president at the Star Tribune , said the newspaper 's view toward light rail has evolved over the past couple ofyears. However, the paper 's switch to support light rail is not based on possible gains thecompany could receive from a station locatednear its downtown Minneapolis headquarters,Parisi said. \"We have never made an editorial decision based on the company 's bottom line, \" Parisi told the committee. \"The Star Tribune edito- rial page is not for sale. \" The current light-rail proposal in the Hiawatha Corridor would include tracks alongFifth Street in Minneapolis. The tracks wouldcross one of the Star Tribune's parking lots, requiring the newspaper to be compensated.A preliminary survey places the value of thelot at $10 million. Parisi said the newspaper has not verified how much the property is actually worth. However, Parisi said the paper would not benefit from selling the block to make way forthe light-rail project. The 249 parking spotson the block are a necessity for Star Tribune employees, Parisi said. \"Anyone who claims that loss of this block will benefit the Star Tribune Company is com-pletely out of touch with reality, \" Parisi said. Two legislators, Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) and Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington)left the meeting shortly after it began, sayingthey refused to question a newspaper on themerits of its editorials. \"The very fact that we are diving into a newspaper 's views and judgments . . . not only is it unprecedented, I think it is an outrage, \" Larson said. Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake) said the paper is entitled to its opinion. He questionedthe proposed location of the line when sev-eral reports indicated that Fifth Street wouldbe a poor route. \"What concerns me is the implication that proponents of the light-rail project placed thestation near the Star Tribune to garner politi- cal support, \" Vandeveer said. David Strom, legislative director for the Taxpayers League of Minnesota, testified thatthe newspaper supports the project becauseof possible benefits to the company. \"The Star Tribune not only supported the plan, but pushed for subsidies along the line, \" Strom said. \"It questions the journalistic eth- ics for not revealing (land ownership) on theeditorial page. \"14 April 7, 2000AT ISSUE: AGRICULTURE # # # BY MIKE DE LARCO The House passed a bill March 30 that would ease a set of new feedlot rules proposedin December by the Minnesota Pollution Con-trol Agency (MPCA). The vote was 80-49. The bill 's passage followed weeks of public testimony opposing new rules for the permitprocess for animal feedlots. The agency 's rules are now before an administrative law judgeand an opinion on proposed changes is ex-pected later this month. The measure the House passed addresses changes to the plan that farmers requested tohappen before any support could be given toa revision of the agency 's 20-year-old feedlot guidelines. If it becomes law, the measure would settle the matter, making the judge 's ruling unnec- essary.Action on feedlot rules Bill would settle dispute between Pollution Control Agencyand farmers regarding changes to rules governing feedlots \"Something needed to be done to address the concerns brought forward by farmers in my dis-trict and producers all over the state. \" Farmers are concerned that new require- ments will drive small feedlots out of business.In addition, cattle producers oppose havingtheir pastures regulated under feedlot rules,Kuisle said. Furthermore, counties would see a greater responsibility for enforcement shifted in theirdirection under new agency rules, a task manycounties consider to be overly time consum-ing and burdensome. Last month, the Pollution Control Agency took some of the concerns expressed by farm-ers to heart and suggested it would considermaking amendments to the most controver-sial sections of the proposed feedlot rules. Kuisle said his bill (HF3692) would give spe-in Minnesota would be exempt from making lot upgrades viewed as necessary by the agency toprotect the environment under Kuisle 's bill. Gary Pulford, feedlot manager for the agency, said approximately half of the state 's 40,000 feedlots are in compliance with theagency 's current rules. Of the other half, about 8,000 are reported to have waste run-off prob-lems. The status of the remaining lots, Pulfordsaid, is unknown. The agency has proposed a 10-year window for small farmers to cut down on environmen-tal problems. The most prevalent violation theagency is focusing on involves the flow of ani-mal waste from lots into rivers and streams.Another is air pollution. Pollution problems caused by livestock odor was a concern of many who voted againstKuisle 's bill. HF3692 would exempt animal feedlots from state ambient air quality stan-dards for up to seven days after animal ma-nure is removed from lot storage facilities. Andby allowing feedlots to grow in size, air pollu-tion could potentially increase, said Rep. T edWinter (DFL-Fulda). \"This bill expands the numbers of animals and decreases the oversight without considering theproblems that that 's going to cause, \" Winter said. Kuisle responded to concerns by saying that while livestock odor is a problem at some sites,limiting feedlot expansion isn 't the answer. In the meantime, the agency 's new plan would put limits on hydrogen sulfide gas found in ma-nure and require that manure spills on roads betreated as serious problems. Sloppy handling ofmanure could result in fines if revised rules, asthey stand now, go into effect. The agency 's new rules would not apply, however, to feedlots with fewer than 400 ani-mal units if HF3692 were to become law. Inaddition, a feedlot operator with fewer than500 animal units could not be forced to dishout more than $3,000 to address agency re-quests for lot upgrades unless offered a sig-nificant cost match under the bill. There are some similarities in the bill to modifications the agency considered makingin March. Some provisions, however, differgreatly. Language in the bill and the proposedagency changes are far apart on a turn-aroundtime for permits to be issued and an exemp-tion of rules for smaller producers. \"Both sides may have to give a little, \" Kuisle said. The bill now moves to the Senate. In January and February, hundreds of farm- ers in Minnesota expressed frustration that therules drafted by the MPCA were too strict andcould hurt small producers. \"The proposed rule changes coming out of the MPCA were far too restrictive, \" said the bill sponsor, Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester).cific instruction to the agency on how the rules should be amended before their final adoption. Under the bill, state livestock operations would be allowed to grow, and regulations bythe MPCA would be reduced. More timewould be given to producers to make changes. Officials estimate that eight out of 10 feedlotsAir pollution from manure pools, like this one in Isanti County, would be regulated under provisions ofa feedlot bill passed March 30 by the House.Session Weekly 15AT ISSUE: BONDING # # # BY JON FUREA House and Senate conference committee is working to reach a com promise on a bonding bill, which would pay for repairs to statebuildings and new construction projects, mainly through the sale of state bonds.A compromise to build House and Senate bonding bills differ by $232 million, withmajor divides related to higher education, environment, andstate building projects Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) added that Minnesota is one of only a few states that hasa AAA bond rating, which delivers bonds atthe most attractive interest rates, due to its fis-cal policies in previous years. The state haslimited the amount of money it spends oninterest payments on bonds, or debt service,to a maximum of 3 percent of the total rev-enue in a biennium.year and still be on solid financial ground. The conference committee has had some preliminary meetings, but so far no majorcompromise has been reached regarding theamounts of money that should be spent orborrowed. Here are some highlights of the projects in the House and Senate proposals. U of M facilities Overall spending for higher education would be $169.9 million under the House bill and$296.9 million under the Senate bill, comparedto $118.3 million under the governor 's plan. All three proposals would spend $35 mil- lion on a Molecular Cellular Biology buildingat the University of Minnesota. The Senate bill would spend $21 million for a new Art Building, which would receive$2 million for design costs under the House bill. But the House bill would not fund a $10 million Microbial and Plant Genomics build-ing at the U of M campus in St. Paul, whichwould be funded under the Senate bill and thegovernor 's plan. Also, Bishop said the state 's payments are amortized so that 40 percent of the overall costis paid within five years and 70 percent is paidwithin 10 years, which helps reduce theamount of money that the state spends oninterest. Under those guidelines, Bishop said the state could authorize $970 million in bonds thisThe House and Senate would fund other projects at U of M campuses in St. Paul,Crookston, and Morris that would not receivefunding under the governor 's plan. The Senate bill would fully fund the $16 million request for maintenance and repair Continued on page 23The House and Senate versions of the bill (HF4078*/SF3811) each would spend morethan the $499.7 million that is proposed un-der Gov. Jesse Ventura 's capital budget plan. That figure includes money that would bespent by canceling appropriations to capitalprojects from previous years. Under the House and Senate bills, bonding would total $532 million and $763.6 millionrespectively. The House bill would use more revenue from user-financed bonds than the governor 's plan \u2014 $76.9 million compared to the governor 's proposed $33.9 million. The Senate bill would use $82.8 million from user-financed bonds, and it would spendmore money than the other proposals in gen-eral obligation bonding and direct spendingfrom the general fund. Also, the Senate billwould cancel smaller amounts of money fromold projects than the other two proposals. In general obligation bonding, the House bill and the governor 's plan each would use about $400 million, but the Senate bill woulduse about $665.6 million. Some lawmakers have been critical of pro- posals to borrow money by selling bonds dueto the $1.8 billion projected budget surplus.When the bill was debated on the House floor,Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) saidborrowing money and paying interest on thebonds would be like a person using a creditcard instead of cash. But Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), spon- sor of the House bill, said that the capitalprojects such as state buildings are used formany years, so it is appropriate to spread thecosts over a period of time, instead of usingtax dollars that were paid by people and orga-nizations in the current biennium. The Art Building on the University of Minnesota's West Bank would be replaced by a $21 millionfacility under the Senate bonding bill. The House bill would provide only $2 million for design of anew building.16 April 7, 2000AT ISSUE: FAMILY # # # BY CHRIS VETTERA bill that would allow divorced parents to create parenting agreements passed the House March 30. The measure received approval by a 116-12 vote. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), would allow divorced couples to make agreements on splitting parenting time.Currently, parenting agreements are neither specifically forbidden nor al-A plan for parenting Bill would give divorcing parents the option to work out theirown custody agreements rather than fighting it out in court lowed in state law. \"This bill would allow parents to reinsert their own plan, \" he said. \"Why choose one parent over another parent when you have twogood parents? \" Parenting plans could specify anything from where a child lives during the day to whichparent can teach religious philosophy or whichparent picks up the child from soccer prac-tice. Child support would be a separate issuenot included in parenting plans, he added. Dawkins, a family lawyer, said he has worked on the issue for several years. He introduced asimilar bill in 1997, which did not pass eitherthe House or Senate. However, a Parental Co-operation T ask Force to study parenting agree-ments was established as part of the omnibusjudiciary law in 1998. He said his current bill (HF3311/SF3169*) incorporates many of the task force 's recom- mendations. Parenting plans would encourage mediation and reduce lengthy custody battles and fur-ther litigation, Dawkins said. \"Our current law has a winner-take-all mentality to it, \" Dawkins said. \"And I think that has a wrong angle to it. \" Under both the Senate and House bills, a parenting plan could be formed if both par-ents agree to it. However, the House bill wouldallow the court to require mediation if onlyone parent agrees. That provision is not in theSenate bill. During the mediation, each parent would work with the mediator to negotiate the termsof the parenting plan. Both parents would bebound by the decision reached at mediation. Dawkins said the judge should have the au-thority to require parenting plans to get the two sides talking. Without the judge 's author- ity, \"we're back to the current law, \" he said. The House bill would not allow judges to require a parenting plan if there are previousallegations of domestic abuse. William Howard, judge with the Fourth Ju- dicial District, supports the Senate bill becauseit applies only to couples that submit toparenting plans. \"It gives them the option to do it, \" Howard said. \"But don 't force people to do it. (The Sen- ate version) is a permissive bill. \" Howard said parenting plans would allow a whole spectrumof relationships. \"This clears up the murki-ness of the courtto submit toparent plans, \" he said. A Minnesota Supreme Court ruling from September 1999, Frauenshuh vs. Giese , made some parent agreements invalid, Dawkins said. In the case, the couple was allowed to es- tablish a custody agreement based on a dif-ferent standard from the one typically appliedby the court to such cases. The Supreme Courtruled that the couple should not have beenallowed, by the lower court, to use a differentstandard, and thereby ruled their agreementinvalid. Dawkins contends that couples should be given the freedom, with proper legal represen-tation, to reach any custody agreement theyprefer, subject to approval of the court, pre-suming it is in the best interest of the child.\"That threw out all these cases where two good lawyers and two good parents decidedwhat is best for children, \" he said. The House bill has a retroactive effective date of Sept. 1, 1999, to re-instate parentingplans invalidated by the court 's decision. Suzanne Born, family lawyer and member of the task force, disagreed. Born said the rul-ing threw out a specific parenting plan, butdid not eliminate all previous agreements. According to the task force summary, at least 20 states currently allow parenting planagreements. Washington County has developed a written plan format, which could become a model forother counties, said Mindy Mitnick, a child psy-chologist at the Uptown Mental Health Center.The packet asks parents to decide which adult isresponsible for doctor visits, physical custody ofthe child, or dividing holidays. \"What we have now is specific forms, so counties don 't have to keep starting over from scratch, \" Mitnick said. All references to \"visitation \" in statute would be eliminated under the bill. Visitation wouldbe replaced by the phrase \"parenting time, \" which is defined as the time a parent spendswith a child regardless of the custodial desig-nation of the child. \"It always bothered me, the word 'visitor, '\" Dawkins said. \"Y ou both have parenting time. \" Born agreed, saying she ishappy withthe wordchange. \"Visitation is a very offen-sive word toparents who have been involved with their kids their wholelife,\" Born said. The bill also would allow the non-custodial parent to object when the custodial parentchooses to move out of Minnesota. The billwould require a hearing be held to discuss theissue. If the court determines the move is notin the best interest of the child, the court mustforbid the move from occurring, according tothe bill. The bill now moves to a House-Senate con- ference committee. \"Why choose one parent over another parent when you have two good parents?\" \u2014Rep. Andy DawkinsSession Weekly 17AT ISSUE: GOVERNMENT # # # BY JON FUREIt all started as a school project about monarch butterflies. But when Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake) visited OH AndersonElementary School in Mahtomedi to explain how a bill becomes a law to fourth-graders there, the students had a brilliant idea \u2014 why not put the two projects together?A legislative lesson Fourth-grade students combine school projects into real-lifecivics lesson and successfully campaign for 13th state symbol Classroom, \" which Mares said is the among the largest education programs in the coun-try. The program is administered through theUniversity of Minnesota, and more than20,000 students participate statewide. Mares said those students learn about sci- ence, conservation, and the ecosystem bystudying the monarch 's life cycle and migra- tory flight to and from Minnesota each year.They use computer technology to follow themonarch 's flight to central Mexico, so they also learn about geography.What they ended up with is a new law, mak- ing the monarch the official state butterfly. Gov. Jesse Ventura signed the law March 31, making the state butterfly the 13th statesymbol. The students brought the idea to Mares, who sponsored the bill. Mares had been askedto visit the school last November, and he saidthe students wanted to participate in the law-making process. They were studying the monarch butterfly through a program called \"Monarchs in theWhile establishing a new state symbol may not seem as important as some other types oflegislation, Mares said the monarch is an ap-propriate choice for the state butterfly for sev-eral reasons. \"A lot of people have an early introduction to the magical world of nature through themonarch, and as we get older it becomes athread that takes us through science to beautyand aesthetics, \" Mares said. Birchwood resident Randy LaFoy, whose daughter attends the school, said it helped thestudents \u2014 and their parents \u2014 learn first- hand about how a bill becomes law. He saidabout 60 students attended House and Senatecommittees and wrote letters to various law-makers, and several students made public pre-sentations. The students also met the governorand several lawmakers. \"It was a great lesson in civics, and what a great country that allows fourth graders to getinvolved and make a difference, \" LaFoy said. LaFoy added that many people tend to be more familiar with other aspects of law, suchas police officers or the court system. The stu-dents enjoyed the experience at the Legisla-ture because it brought that part of thelawmaking process to life, LaFoy said. A similar bill (HF3508) that was proposed this year would make the timber wolf the of-ficial state mammal, but that bill has not ad-vanced through the committee process ineither the House or Senate. The last state symbol to be established was the blueberry muffin in 1988, which was pro-posed by third-grade students from Carlton,a small town near Duluth. The students feltthat the choice was appropriate because blue-berries are plentiful in northern Minnesota,and farmers throughout the state produceother ingredients needed to make the muffins. Other state symbols are the state flag and state seal, state tree (red or Norway pine), statesong ( \"Hail! Minnesota \"), state bird (loon), state fish (walleye), state mushroom (morel),state drink (milk), state grain (wild rice), stateflower (lady slipper), and state gemstone (LakeSuperior agate). Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The lawis effective Aug. 1, 2000. HF2588/SF2326*/CH306 Rep. Harry Mares, center , along with fourth-grade students and teachers from OH Anderson Elementary School in Mahtomedi testify in front of the House Governmental Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee earlier this session in support of a bill that would designate the Monarch butterfly as theofficial state butterfly. Gov. Jesse Ventura signed the bill into law March 31. 18 April 7, 2000PEOPLE # # # BY MICHELLE KIBIGER When Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) came to the Legislature in 1986, hebrought his criminal justice background in aneffort to change the system. \"I felt that the criminal justice system needed more accountability, especially con-cerning drunk driving and violent crime, \" Carruthers said. \"I feel we 've made some good progress. \" Now, 14 years later, the former speaker of the House will take that knowledge back into thejustice system as he leaves the Legislature for ajob with the Ramsey County Attorney 's Office. \"I won 't have to stay up until three in the morning debating on the floor, \" he said with a smile. Carruthers said being a member of the House has been very rewarding for him, espe-cially his work with individual constituents topromote legislation. He said he decided during his last term, when he was speaker and the DFL Caucus hada majority, that he would not seek an 8th term. When he looks up from his desk, pictures of his sons \u2014 11-year-old Alex and 8-year- old Rory \u2014 greet his eyes. They often accom- pany him to the Capitol. Family played a big role in his decision to leave the House. Carruthers said he is readyfor a more regular, normal life. \"It's a very intense job, \" he said. \"It's excit- ing and satisfying. I have young kids. I 'd like to have a little bit more sane lifestyle, a littlemore predictable. \" Carruthers grew up in St. Anthony and at- tended the University of Minnesota, where heobtained a degree in political science and laterattended law school. He received his law de-gree in 1979 and worked for a number of dif-ferent firms. In 1983, Carruthers was appointed to the Metropolitan Council. He served there forthree-and-a-half years, until his election to theHouse of Representatives. His two goals as a legislator were to change the criminal justice system and institute moreopenness in government.A challenge ahead A former speaker of the House is leaving to take atop post with the Ramsey County attorney During his first few years in the House, Carruthers served on committees dealing withjudiciary, taxes, and financial institutions. In1990, he sponsored a law clarifying the provi-sions of the state 's no-fault insurance law. And by 1992, he had sponsored the omnibusdrunken-driving and data practices laws. He also sponsored laws providing due pro- cess for police officers in dispute situations andfurther clarifying the implied consent provi-sions for drunken driving arrests. In 1993, he sponsored legislation restrict- ing violent criminals ' ability to be licensed foster parents. He also supported the provi-sion that instituted zero-tolerance alcohol pro-visions for people younger than 21. Later that year, Carruthers was elected as House Majority Leader, after Rep. Irv Anderson(DFL-Int 'l Falls) became speaker of the House. Carruthers served in that role for three years, until he was selected to replace Ander-son in the speakership. At the time, Carruthers ' supporters said he would bring more openness to the House andwould strive for more cooperation between the DFL and Republican caucuses. The DFL lost control of the House after the 1998 election, and Rep. Steve Sviggum(R-Kenyon), assumed the role of speaker. Looking back now, Carruthers said the most important lesson he learned was to get alongwith people and work with them. He said theHouse is not about partisanship, but it 's about making the best decisions for constituents. \"It doesn 't matter what party you are or what part of the state you 're from, \" Carruthers said. \"Everyone has something to contribute. \"It's easier and quicker for a few people to make the decision. But I don 't think it makes for better laws. \" Carruthers said it 's important to get as many people and points of view involved as possible.He said he worries that the Legislature is be-coming too partisan at the expense of the av-erage citizen and his or her concerns. \"Minnesota has a very open legislative sys- tem, \" Carruthers said. \"Average people can make suggestions and see them actually getaccomplished. But the House tends to be toopartisan in my view. Satisfaction is workinghard to solve a problem in society. \" Carruthers, who has been a city prosecutor in Hennepin County for 20 years, will serveas chief of the prosecution division for theRamsey County attorney, when he begins hisjob. He will supervise the prosecution of ju-venile and adult criminal cases. Though the job will likely put Carruthers in the courtroom, he 'll spend most of his time developing prosecution policies and workingwith the prosecutors in the office. \"It's very exciting, \" Carruthers said. \"I'm looking forward to it. \" STEPPING DOWN Rep. Phil Carruthers DFLDistrict 47B - Brooklyn CenterTerms: 7 Career notes: After serving as majority leader, Carruthers was elected speakerof the House in 1997. He led the Houseduring years that were marked by pas-sage of property tax rebates and rejec-tion of public financing for a baseballstadium. Throughout his career,Carruthers has specialized in legislationrelated to civil and criminal law. Session Weekly 19PEOPLE # # # STEPPING DOWNBY DAVID MAEDA When Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) was elected 22 years ago, one of the issues he ranon was ensuring that the state 's health care system took care of all Minnesotans. For Greenfield, 58, who was active in the civil rights and anti-war efforts in the 1960s,it was just another policy issue for the under-represented in need of political reform. \"I've always believed that everybody should be treated equally, \" said Greenfield, who still has a hint of a New Y ork accent in his voice,betraying a Brooklyn upbringing. Greenfield 's political activism brought him to Minnesota to work. That activism ulti-mately led him to seek and win election to theHouse in 1978. Perhaps the legislative achievement he will best be remembered for, and the one he stillpoints most proudly to, is being one of theso-called \"gang of seven \" legislators who in 1992 helped establish MinnesotaCare, thestate 's health care system working toward health care access for all Minnesotans. Greenfield was then serving as chair of the House Health and Human Services FinanceDivision. He worked with members from bothparties and former Gov. Arne Carlson to passthe legislation that expanded the state 's health coverage of the uninsured from children to allresidents who did not have access to employer-supported coverage. The group gained its nickname through tenacity in addressing the concerns raised byofficials from the insurance and health careindustries, among others, in the state 's effort to become the first to achieve health care ac-cess to all. The gang of seven also included DFLers Sens. Linda Berglin and Pat Piper and formerRep. Paul Ogren, and former Republican Sen.Duane Benson and Reps. Dave Gruenes andBrad Stanius. Greenfield said Minnesota has one of the lowest uninsured rates of any state in the coun-Health care pioneer Greenfield known for persevering to make revolutionaryMinnesotaCare program become law try \u2014 a tribute to how progressive and strong the state 's system continues to be. Since the MinnesotaCare program 's incep- tion, the rate of uninsured in the state hasdropped from 6.1 percent to 5.2 percent. Thenational rate is around 16 percent. Greenfield said he is confident the state will remain a leader in health care access becausethe state 's citizens believe it is important to subsidize care for all. With a degree in physics from Purdue Uni- versity and graduate work in philosophy ofscience at the University of Minnesota, he saidhis scientific background uniquely preparedhim for his legislative work and led to his in-terest and involvement in health care issues. Greenfield said the scientific method val- ues hard data over anecdote. But with theabundance of data presented in crafting leg-islation, he said he learned that often the useof a personal story can be more effective in swaying legislators. Y et in the final analysis, he said, his roots in science were useful in helping him form ob-jective decisions. He said that he felt fortunate to be at the leading edge of many of the causes he foughtfor because of the liberal nature of the area herepresents, which includes parts of the WestBank, Powderhorn Park, and Seward neigh-borhoods in Minneapolis. Ironically, it is Greenfield 's devotion to the health care arena that has led to his decisionnot to seek re-election to the House. \"My interests keep narrowing, \" he said. \"As a member you have to maintain a broadperspective. \" Greenfield said that although he isn 't quite sure what he will do next, he is pursuing sev-eral opportunities that will allow him to con-tinue his commitment to health care relatedissues, including universal health care, from adifferent angle. He said he will miss being part of the legis- lative process and working with many of hiscolleagues. And he is proud of playing a partin helping to maintain and improve the state 's programs for people with disabilities, commu-nity mental health services, and expandinghome health care for senior citizens. \"Many of the most exciting things I 'll ever do will have been done here in this chamber, \" Greenfield said.

HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking new laws, vetoes Once a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23). This information is also available on the governor's Web site (www.governor.state.mn.us).Select the \"It's a New SF=Senate # # 20 April 7, 2000*The legislative bill marked with an asterisk denotes the file submitted to the governor.MARCH 31 - A PRIL 6 CHAPTERS 300 - 344 Res. 4 4060 2348* Resolution for release of Americans held in North Korea, China, Russia and Vietnam. 4/3/00 300 3219 2903* Omnibus gambling bill. 3/31/00 301 Wood sales contracts regulated. 3/31/00 302 2785 2821* Charitable organization annual report filing requirements modified. 3/31/00303 2883 2579* Prescription drug discounts regulated. 3/31/00 304 2675 2569* Vicarious liability insurance coverage for punitive and exemplary damages authorized. 3/31/00 305 3399 3145* Minnetonka qualified newspaper designation priority variance. 2588 designated as the state butterfly. 3/31/00 307 3209* 2699 Health care cost containment major commitment expenditure report requirements modified. 4/3/00 308 3352 3586* Lighted fishing lures authorized. 4/3/00309 2719* insurance coverage regulated. 4/3/00 310 2809* 2631 Ah-Gwah-Ching nursing center admissions criteria clarified. 4/3/00 311 2688* 2769 Omnibus crime prevention and judiciary finance bill. 4/3/00312 3226 2896* Nursing home resident assistants authorized and survey process procedure developed. 4/3/00 313 2994 2748* Ambulance service and EMT requirements modified. 4/3/00 314 3212 2734* Home care and personal care provider transportation expense reimbursement studied. 4/3/00315 3048 2868* New medical assistance case-mix system based on federal minimum data set transition time lines. 4/3/00 316 3107 2634* Civil commitment relative notification provided and minor voluntary treatment consent provisions modified. 4/3/00 317 3306 3549* Residential hospice program requirements modified. 4/3/00318 3023 2701* Lawful gambling fraud defined and criminal penalties imposed. 4/3/00 319 3365 2941* Vulnerable adult neglect and medical error provisions modified. 4/3/00 320 3220 2510* Real property recording and redemption and common interest ownership provisions modified. 4/4/00321 3596 3369* Special environmental purpose districts pilot projects. 4/4/00 322 3310 3055* Health plan contract stacking regulated and remedy provided. 4/4/00Session Weekly 21HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SF _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____323 3290 2894* Occupational safety and health discrimination complaint communications classified as privileged. 4/4/00 324 3555 3283* Snowmobile metal traction device sticker requirement civil enforcement provided. 4/4/00 325 1590* 1952 Warrant authority of alcohol and gambling agents clarified. 4/4/00 326 2819 2444* Stearns County land conveyance authorized. 4/4/00327 3103 3005* Human services licensing provisions modified. 4/4/00 328 3152 2905* Local government units purchase provisions modified. 4/4/00 329 3169* 3167 Dakota County personnel board of appeals provisions modified. 4/4/00330 2670* 2566 Mental retardation community-based waivered services and family support grants provisions modified. 4/4/00 331 3868 3260* Aquatic farm licensing requirements modified. 4/4/00 332 4076 2653* Internet state agency grant information required and uniform application developed. 4/4/00333 2940* 2735 Dry cleaner environmental response and reimbursement law modified. 4/4/00 334 2936 2511* Public and private property entry authorized for the purposes of examinations and surveys. 4/4/00 335 3327 2676* Local government authorization to petition to amend or repeal rules sunset modified. 4/6/00336 3571 2828* Gambling regulated, activities prohibited, and shipment of gambling devices regulated. 4/6/00 337 2559 2546* Inland water sunken logs recovery and historical artifacts ownership provided. 4/6/00 338 3342 3025* Foster care providers medical equipment operation competency required. 4/6/00339 3134* 2857 Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission authority to enter specified state lands limited. 4/6/00 340 3122* 2901 Medical Assistance, General Assistance, MinnesotaCare, and other health care program provisions modified. 4/6/00 341 3510* 3378 Taking two deer authorization extended in specified counties. 4/6/00342 2656* 3441 Auto glass repair and replacement regulated, and rebates and incentives limited. 4/6/00 343 3806 3554* Nonprofit organization re-employment compensation provisions modified. 4/6/00 344 465 624* Firefighter training and education board created. 4/6/00 Governor Jesse Ventura 130 State Capitol 75 Constitution Ave.St. Paul 55155 ................

The present gover- nor is not the first toadvocate for gov-ernment reform. In1939, Harold E.Stassen becamegovernor; he madesome sweeping changes by propagating progressive laborrelations, by signing civil service legisla-tion into law, and by implementing a ma-jor program for state governmentreorganization. At age 31, Stassen was the youngest per- son ever to be elected to such a position.The \"boy wonder \" governor had his eyes on public office years before \u2014 about the time he graduated from Humboldt HighSchool in St. Paul at age 15. Because of his age, he had to wait a year before he entered the University of Min-nesota. Here, he became so involved in ac-tivities that he hired a fraternity brotherto be his personal secretary. He also laidthe groundwork for the Y oung RepublicanLeague. By 1929, Stassen graduated from the university 's law school, passed the bar, opened a law office, and was elected topublic office as county attorney \u2014 all in one year. In his race for governor, Stassen out- campaigned the conservative candidates ofReflections the Republican old guard with help fromhis Y oung Republican \"upstarts. \" Included was Warren A. Burger, the future chief jus-tice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Stassen was a political prodigy. The little- known county attorney overwhelmingly beatthe popular Farmer-Labor incumbent, Gov.Elmer Benson, by 291,000 votes. At the height of World War II, he won election to a third term, even though hesaid he would resign and go on Naval duty\"where I belong. \" On Wednesday, April 21, 1943, when the legislative session ad-journed sine die , Gov. Stassen signed bills until midnight, then resigned the next dayto serve in the U.S. Navy. He was assignedto Admiral Bill Halsey as his chief of staffwith the Pacific Fleet. Stassen was a vocal proponent of peace among nations, international disarma-ment, and for mediating disagreementsamong countries. His visionary conceptswere made known before PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt proposed a unitedorganization of nations. In 1945, Rooseveltassigned him to lead a United States del-egation in San Francisco for creating aUnited Nations Charter. His wife, Esther, also played a key role by noting that the Russian wives suggestedan emissary be sent to speak directly with Stalin to counteract the stubbornness ofhis delegation. The Russians relented andthe Charter was completed. Stassen wasone of its eight signatories. The Minnesota statesman was never elected to public office after he resignedas governor. But for many years, he eitherfiled or ran a campaign \u2014 10 times for U.S. president, and in races for U.S. senator andcongressman. Many said he was like the fictional char- acter, Don Quixote, out \"fighting wind- mills. \" But the compassionate attorney from West St. Paul often stated that hecampaigned many times so that his beliefscould be heard. Stassen 's amazing and full life will reach 93 years at his birthday on April 13. Hisdedication to end war and his interna-tional arbitration for making the world abetter place may be equated to a quote onthe Isaiah Wall in New Y ork 's Tudor City, across the street from the United NationsSecretariat: They shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning hooks.Nation shall not lift up sword against nation. Neither shall they learn war any more. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERT Photo from The Story of Minnesota's Past by Rhoda R. GilmanGov. Harold E.

The House and Senate bills each would pro- vide $6.9 million for construction of athleticand academic facilities at Minnesota StateUniversity, Mankato. The money would bepart of the Taylor Center project, which ben-efited from a $9.2 million donation fromMinnesota Timberwolves owner and Mankato businessman Glen Taylor. The Senate bill would spend $49 million for maintenance and repair projects throughoutthe MnSCU system, which would receive$30 million under the House bill and thegovernor 's plan. MnSCU requested $100 mil- lion for maintenance and repair, and officialssaid at least $56 million would be needed toprevent the system 's $500 million maintenance backlog from growing even larger. State buildings The House bill would spend a total of $48.5 million for building and maintenanceprojects for the state-owned buildings that areused by state agencies and departments. TheSenate bill would spend $85.2 million for thoseprojects. The Senate bill would fund the $58 million proposal for a new building for the Bureau ofCriminal Apprehension. The House bill wouldspend only $28 million to build a laboratoryfacility. The House bill would include $150,000 for a World War II memorial on Capitol grounds,a project that was line-item vetoed by V enturain 1999. The project would not be fundedunder the Senate bill or the governor 's plan. Environment and agriculture The House bill would spend about $82.7 million for projects related to agricul-ture, environment, and natural resources. TheSenate bill would spend $147.8 in those areas.Wastewater system improvements would receive $32.6 million under the House bill and$47.2 million under the Senate plan. Themoney would provide matching grants tocommunities through the Public FacilitiesAuthority, which is part of the Department ofTrade and Economic Development. The Board of Water and Soil Resources would receive $20 million for the Conserva-tion Reserve Enhancement Program under theHouse and Senate bills. The program ismatched by federal funds, and it establishesconservation easements on agriculture landalong the Minnesota River, which reduces soilerosion into the river, helps control flooding,and establishes wildlife habitat. A total of $140 million in federal matching funds is available through September 2002. Transportation improvements House and Senate bonding proposals for transportation are not comparable becausemost of the Senate 's transportation bonding is included in its omnibus transportation fi-nance bill rather than a bonding measure. The House bill would spend $44 million for repairs to bridges throughout the state,$5 million for Rail Service ImprovementLoans, $10.4 million for a Department ofTransportation headquarters in St. Cloud,$8.7 million for an addition to the DetroitLakes headquarters, and $1.6 million for aMoorhead Truck Station.

The House passed a bill April 11 thatwould remove some of those protections. The vote was 78-53.Wolf plan passes Wolf management compromise moves through House,despite sharp criticism, and awaits action by the Senate andgovernor.a University of Minnesota extension agent. The bill would also modify current law that allows the state Department of Agriculture tocompensate a livestock owner for an animalthat is destroyed by a wolf, if the claim is vali-dated by a conservation officer or extensionagent. Under the bill, the current maximumof $750 per animal would be removed, andthe compensation amount would be based on\"fair market value. \" No hunting season for wolves would be al- lowed for five years after the wolf is removedfrom the list. But the bill would allow the com-missioner of the DNR to prescribe open seasonsafter five years and restrictions for taking wolvesafter receiving comments from the public. The bill would prohibit a person from re- leasing a wolf-dog hybrid. A person wouldneed a permit from the DNR to release a cap-tive gray wolf. Those provisions would apply to the entire state. For other provisions, the bill would divide the state into two zones. Zone A would be the northeast corner of the state, which would start from the north-ern part of Pine County and would includeparts of several counties up to the Canadianborder. Zone A also would include much ofthe northern part of the state, including partsof counties near the state 's western border (Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, andPolk counties). In Zone B, which would cover all of the re- maining parts of the state, including the TwinCities area, all of the southern and western partsof the state, and parts of central Minnesota, thecommissioner of the DNR could establish anarea where a person who is certified as a preda-tor controller could trap and kill wolves. Trapping would not be allowed in Zone A, which would provide the wolf with more pro-tection in forest areas, its primary habitat area. The area for trapping would be limited to a one-mile radius of a site where a wolf attackhas been verified in Zone B. The controllercould trap wolves in that area for only 60 days. Violating the laws related to killing wolves would be a gross misdemeanor, under the bill. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), who sat on the House and Senate conference commit-tee that adopted the compromise, said she hasreceived complaints about the different re-quirements for Zone B. Other parts of the bill state that a person may shoot a gray wolf \"when the gray wolf isThe increasing number of wolves in the state, especially in northern Minnesota, hascaused state and federal officials to considerremoving the wolf from the list of Endangeredand Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Under the bill (HF1415), a state plan for managing the wolf population would be es-tablished, which is required before the wolfcan be removed from that list. Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus), sponsor of the bill, said the plan reflects a compromise ofmany different groups and that no group iscompletely happy with the bill. Farmers who have had livestock killed by wolves would favor more leniency in huntingor trapping wolves, whereas some othergroups say those proposals under the bill aretoo lenient. The gray wolf lives primarily in Minnesota,Wisconsin, and Michigan in the lower 48 states. The species also inhabits Canadianprovinces and parts of Alaska. Under the bill produced by a House-Senate conference committee, a person could shoota wolf in defense of a human life. Guard ani-mals could be used to repel or destroy wolvesto protect livestock, domestic animals, or pets. People could \"harass \" a wolf that they actu- ally see within 500 yards of people, buildings, livestock, or domestic animals to discouragewolves from getting too close to homes orfarms. But the bill would make it illegal to lure, track, or search for a wolf with the intent ofinjuring or harassing the animal. Any incident where a wolf is killed would have to be reported within 48 hours to theDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR) or The wolf management plan passed by the House would allow the killing of wolves that threaten live-stock or human life. Shown here is one of the wolves at that International Wolf Center in Ely on theprowl. The center promotes public education about the wolf and the predator's behavior.4 April 14, 2000IT'SAFACT In April 1922, Charles Lindbergh took his first airplane ride. Just five years later, hewould make the first trans-Atlantic soloflight from New Y ork to Paris and becomeMinnesota 's aviation hero. News accounts of the famous flight por- trayed Lindbergh as a bit of a naive farmboyfrom the Midwest. But the 25-year-old from Little Falls was not the first Lindbergh to make a mark inthe world. In fact, he descended from a longline of political activists, among them a U.S.congressman. Lindbergh 's father, Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., was elected to Congress in 1906. Y oungCharles spent many winters in Washington,D.C., and would return home for the mild,pleasant summers of central Minnesota. Nevertheless, those days out East prepared him for the limelight, while his Minnesotahome and the political roots of his Swedish-American ancestors kept him grounded, de-spite his high-flying aspirations. Lindbergh 's grandfather Ola Mansson, who took the name August Lindberghwhen he immigrated to the United States,was elected to one of the houses of Swed-ish parliament in 1847. He represented thefarmers in his district for 11 years. Historical accounts say Mansson was rather progressive for the times, advocat-ing government investment in transporta-tion infrastructure, fewer trade restrictions,and increased rights in Sweden for Jews andwomen. Accounts also tout his gift for public speaking, quick wit, and ability to think onhis feet. The family came to Minnesota by ship, rail, and then steamboat in 1860. Theysettled near Melrose and farmed. August Lindbergh would again serve in public office as clerk of the Melrose schooldistrict for 21 years, town clerk for Melrosefor 18 years, a justice of the peace for 16years, and postmaster for 10 years. It was in that environment that Charles Augustus Lindbergh, the aviator 's father, was raised. Though interest in his studieswas questionable in his younger years,\"C.A. \" attended law school at the University of Michigan.Famous family The Lindberghs left their mark in Minnesota and elsewhere He obtained his law degree in 1883. C.A. Lindbergh returned to Minnesota and set uphis law practice in Little Falls, then a growingcommunity of about 5,000 people. He married a local woman, Mary LaFond, who died two years after theirmarriage. C.A. Lindbergh remarriedEvangeline Land, who had also attended theUniversity of Michigan, receiving a degreein chemistry. Such an achievement was rarefor women of the times. Y oung Charles was born in 1902 and grew up on the farm just outside of town.While the boy laid in the cornfields day-dreaming of flight, his father was making aname for himself politically. C.A. Lindbergh associated himself with the emerging progressive wing of the Re-publican Party, which at the time was push-ing for more government regulation ofbanking and business. He served five terms in Congress, from 1907 to 1917. During that time, he alsowrote three books on the banking indus-try and the economy. He was probably best known for his op- position to U.S. involvement in World War I.He disagreed with allowing financial inter-ests to drive U.S. war policy. And his politicalsuccess would falter because of these views. In 1918, C.A. Lindbergh ran for the Re- publican Party nomination for governoragainst incumbent J.A.A. Burnquist. Hewas endorsed by the Nonpartisan League,a group comprised primarily of farmerspushing for certain reforms. The groupsupported candidates for office regardlessof party affiliation. During the primary campaign, Burnquist and others used Lindbergh 's pro- gressive and anti-war stances against him,calling him a German sympathizer andsocialist. As a result, rallies often turned violent, including one in Martin County in south-central Minnesota, where Lindbergh wasactually thrown in jail. He was defeated in the primary. He un- successfully ran for U.S. Senate in 1923 andwas in the midst of another gubernatorialbid in 1924 when he died \u2014 three years before his son 's historic flight. (M. K IBIGER )posing an immediate threat \" to people or live- stock, for example. But that specific phrase isnot used in provisions related to Zone B. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said that the bill should include the \"immediate threat \" lan- guage for Zone B, otherwise the bill would al-low someone to go into a den and kill wolf pups. But Finseth disagreed, saying that Kahn 's example would still be against the law. \"Y ou can 't just go out and arbitrarily take a wolf, \" Finseth said. \"If you go into a den and club the pups, you would be breaking the lawand you would be prosecuted. \" Finseth also said that the federal government 's plan for the recovery of the wolf populationstates that Zone B is \"not suitable for wolves and should be eliminated by any legal means. \" The bill would provide more protection for wolvesthan that federal plan, he said. \"Only 10 percent of the wolf population is in this zone, and according to the federal plan,those wolves shouldn 't be there, \" he said. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) said that the practices that led to the near-extinctionof wolves were poisoning, shooting wolvesfrom small airplanes, and destroying dens withdynamite \u2014 all of which would still be illegal under the bill. In 1997, the state 's Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCMR), funded aproject for a citizen 's roundtable to develop recommendations for a wolf managementplan. The roundtable included people withvarious interests, such as livestock producers,residents from different parts of the state, andrepresentatives of conservation groups like theSierra Club and the Isaak Walton League. The original version of the bill was intro- duced in the 1999 Legislative Session. The Sen-ate sponsor is Sen. Gary Laidig (R-Stillwater). Each chamber amended the bill, and it was approved by the House in 1999, but it was notpassed by the full Senate until earlier this year. A House and Senate conference committee further modified the bill. The bill now goes tothe Senate, where it could be passed or re-turned to the conference committee.

The vote was72-58. The measure (HF3692*/SF3443) takes into account public testimony opposing new rulesfor permitting animal feedlots. It would givespecific instructions to the agency on how therules should be amended before their finaladoption. The bill also would prohibit the PCA from imposing additional conditions as part of afeedlot permit after the proposed rules are fi-nally adopted. The measure is sponsored byRep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester). State livestock operations would be allowed to grow, and regulation by the agency wouldbe limited, under the bill. Agency officials want farmers to prevent the flow of animal waste from lots into rivers andstreams. The agency is also concerned aboutair pollution caused by feedlots. Currently, the PCA 's new plan would put limits on hydrogen sulfide gas found in ma-nure and require that manure spills on roadsbe treated as serious problems. Sloppy han-dling of manure could result in fines if revisedagency rules, as they stand now, go into effect. The commissioner of the Department of Agriculture would be required under the billto work with the University of Minnesota todevelop educational and training programsaddressing manure applicator concerns, in-cluding water quality protection and the de-velopment of manure management plans. If violations are found, the bill would re- quire that they be brought up to par in a timelymanner. A feedlot operator with less than 300 ani- mal units, however, would not be required bythe bill to spend more than $3,000 to upgradea lot unless cost-share money totaling at least75 percent of the cost is available. Livestock production facilities would be exempt by the bill from state ambient air qual-ity standards while manure is being removedfrom the site, and up to seven days followingthe transfer. The bill also would require the PCA to re- move several provisions from its proposedrules and allow the agency to submit a reportto the commissioner of the Department of Finance if it is unable to accomplish timelyresponse to feedlot permit applications. The bill now goes to the Senate. Sales of funeral services The House passed a bill April 6 that would regulate solicitation and sale of funeral goods.The vote was 130-0. The bill (HF2713/SF2686*), sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), wouldprohibit solicitation at a hospital, gravesite,nursing home, or wake without the solicitorhaving been specifically requested to do so. It also would prohibit an individual from peddling goods and services to any personwhose death is impending, or to a individualresponsible for funeral arrangements of a de-ceased person within 10 days of thatindividual 's death. Again, however, such acts would be permitted, under the bill, if eitherthe deceased or a relative had made arrange-ments to discuss funeral and burial plans be-fore the death. In cases when the deceased handled his or her own arrangements in advance, the billwould require that the funeral provider Economic loss doctrine replaced The state 's existing economic loss doctrine will be repealed and replaced by a new provi-sion, under a law signed April 11 by Gov. JesseV entura. The law will limit commercial parties to le- gal solutions under the Uniform CommercialCode. The code provides a shorter statute oflimitations. A TEST OF WILLSproduce a copy of agreement documents andgive the copy to the person who is in chargeof the remains. A copy of the arrangementswould be required to change hands no laterthan 24 hours after first contact between theprovider and the individual controlling theremains. Provisions that would establish require- ments for such funeral arrangements and al-low someone making advance burialarrangements to cancel those plans are alsocontained in the bill. Rest's bill now goes to a House-Senate con- ference committee. Language pertaining to a potential finan- cial impact of the measure was incorporatedinto the omnibus state government spendingbill (HF2699) in March. The provision wouldappropriate $90,000 in fiscal year 2001 for thepurpose of responding to public complaintsabout funeral goods and services solicitation. House conferees Reps. Bob Ness, left, and Tony Kielkucki debate with Senate conferees, Sens. Larry Pogemiller and Linda Sheid, over differences in Profile of Learning measures duringthe April 10 conference committee discussions of the omnibus education bill.6 April 14, 2000#CRIME Felony DWI advances A bill that would increase penalties for re- peated drinking and driving offenses passedthe House on April 12. The vote was 115-17. The bill (HF2995/SF2677*) would make it a felony for a person to accumulate four drink-ing and driving convictions in a 10-year span. Violators would face up to seven years in prison and a $14,000 fine. The minimum pen-alty would be 180 days in jail.\"This bill clarifies the law on who can sue and when they can sue, \" said Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), who sponsored thelegislation in the House. The law will apply to claims where a buyer is dissatisfied with a seller 's product, usually when the product is damaged, but no injurieshave occurred, Pawlenty said. If an injury oc-curred, a person could sue under tort laws,Pawlenty said. The law is the result of an agreement be- tween several interest groups that met duringthe past year to hammer out the compromise.The provision is seen as an improvement tothe previous law, which passed during a spe-cial session in 1998. That legislation wasprompted by concerns over a case involvingMarvin Windows, a Warroad-based company. The bill is not retroactive, and would have no effect on pending litigation. The law takeseffect Aug. 1, 2000. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1267/SF1126*/CH358 #CONSUMERS Auto glass rebate limit Auto glass rebates will be limited to $35 and insurance companies will no longer be re-quired to pay \"any reasonable cost \" for glass replacement, under a law signed April 6 byGov. Jesse Ventura. The law will require insurance companies to pay an average cost for windshieldreplacement. \"Windshield costs are out of control in this state, \" said House sponsor Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) during earlier debate on theHouse floor. \"Hopefully, this will bring prices back to a reasonable range. \" The average cost will be determined by an annual study, funded voluntarily through in-surance and glass companies. If the compa-nies don 't voluntarily contribute, they will have violated the law and the Legislature willrevisit the issue next year, Wolf said. The Department of Commerce will coor- dinate the study. The study is likely to cost$35,000 a year, he said. There is expected tobe no cost to the state. The law has support from glass and insur- ance companies and the Department of Com-merce, Wolf said. According to an insurance company study last year, Minnesota 's auto glass replacement costs are 69 percent higher than the nationalaverage and are the highest in the nation.Many Minnesota auto glass dealers offer boxesof steaks, rebates of $200 to customers, orother costly incentives to lure customers.Wolf said the most important part of the law is it will no longer require insurance com-panies to pay \"all reasonable costs \" for win- dow replacement. The state Court of Appealsruled earlier this year that \"reasonable costs \" included any freebies or incentives offered byglass companies. Wolf acknowledged that not all problems related to auto glass costs are solved with thislegislation. He still has concerns about insur-ance companies steering consumers to certainglassmakers, even though consumers can le-gally obtain glass from any firm. Wolf said hehopes the new law will allow commerce offi-cials more time to focus on steering issues. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the Senate version. The $35 maximum rebate provision took effect April 7, while the average-cost provi-sions and mandated study will take effectAug. 1, 2000. HF2656*/SF3441/CH342VE-TOWED The felony DWI measure was attached to an otherwise noncontroversial bill created toclarify and reorganize existing DWI statutes.The bill is sponsored by Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji). Backed by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), the felony DWI measures were alreadypassed by the House as part of a massive om-nibus government spending bill now tied upin a House-Senate conference committee. Concerned about constitutional challenges, legislators are pulling policy provisions out ofthat omnibus bill (HF2699) and attachingthem to other legislative vehicles. Stanek said his DWI plan is necessary be- cause the current law \u2014 a gross misdemeanor for repeat offenders, whether they have com-mitted two or 12 offenses \u2014 does not deter chronic drunken drivers. \"Drunken driving ruins lives and tears fami- lies apart, \" Stanek said. Last year, 273 Minnesotans died in alcohol- related vehicle accidents, he added. Several legislators spoke against the felony DWI amendment, saying there is no fundingmechanism in place to pay for potentiallyhigher prison and jail costs. \"I'm opposed to this amendment for the simple reason we don 't pay for it, \" said Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin). \"Be honest and be up-front on what the costs are, \" said Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL- Bovey). Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) noted that one report said the bill would add 1,100people to Minnesota jails and prisons, basedJason Bosley, driver for Chief's Towing, leans against his truck during a demonstration heldApril 13 by towing companies who oppose a bill that would have allowed people to re-trieve personal property from their car after it was towed. The bill aimed to clarify existinglaw which states that a lien can be obtained against vehicles (not the property inside) whoseowners have not paid fees for towing and storage. It was vetoed April 13 by the governor.Session Weekly 7Penalties for false IDs A bill that would increase penalties for mi- nors who attempt to use false identificationcards to purchase alcohol passed the Houseon April 10. The vote was 84-48. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), would increase the penaltyon a second offense for fraudulently attempt-ing to purchase alcohol from a misdemeanorto a gross misdemeanor. The bill (HF2655/SF2845*) also would al- low the alcohol distributor \u2014 from a liquor store clerk to a bouncer at a nightclub \u2014 to confiscate identification cards that appear tobe false. \"The intent is to create a meaningful deter- rent to using false IDs, \" Leppik said. \"T o many people, it is worth the risk because the conse-quences are few. \" Leppik 's plan would require the confiscated license to be turned over to the police or to thecard owner within 48 hours. The Senate billwould require confiscated identification to begiven directly to the police within 24 hours. The Senate bill also includes a provision on truancy that is not in the House version. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) said the bill is necessary because of the increased access tofalse identification cards available on theInternet. Dehler offered a successful amendment that would reduce the penalty for clerks who selltobacco to minors if the clerk accidentallymisreads the identification presented. TheFleeing the police A person who fails to halt a car when sig- naled by police to stop could be charged withfleeing an officer, under a bill the House passedon April 10. The vote was 128-1. The definition of a law enforcement offi- cial also would include an agent at a federallyrecognized American Indian reservation, un-der the bill. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) is sponsoring the bill (HF3825/SF3338*), which would addlanguage to the definition of fleeing an officerin a vehicle. Refusal to stop a car would beadded to the definition of fleeing, which al-ready states that a person is fleeing if the driverincreases speed or extinguishes the headlights. Under the bill, tribal police forces would not be forced to carry unlimited annual liabilityinsurance. Currently, cities in Minnesota haveunlimited annual insurance through theLeague of Minnesota Cities, Smith said. Theforce must have insurance with an annual capof three times the amount of a single occur-rence, which is $3 million, Smith said. The bill comes from a court case where the judge dismissed a drunken driving case be-cause the tribal force that arrested the driverdid not have the unlimited annual liabilityinsurance required by statute, Smith said. \"Let them arrest drunk drivers and not let (the drivers) get off because the officers don 't have enough insurance, \" Smith said during floor debate. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk.on the number of drunken driving offenders with four or more offenses last year. Mahoneysaid the state may have to build another prisonto house only DWI offenders. Stanek said there is some funding for the measure in the omnibus state governmentappropriations bill, where the felony DWImeasures had been approved earlier. Under Stanek 's plan, once a person is found guilty of a felony DWI offense, that personwould always be classified as a felon on fur-ther DWI charges, regardless of the timepassed between offenses, Stanek said. A felony DWI charge would be dubbed a first-degree offense, under the bill. The billclassifies second-, third-, and fourth-degreedrunken driving charges based on aggravatedfactors involved in the offense. A second-de-gree offense would have two factors; a third-degree DWI would have one additional factor. The factors would include prior impaired- driving offenses in the past 15 years, an alco-hol concentration higher than 0.20 at the timeof the offense, and driving impaired with chil-dren under age 16 in the vehicle. The bill now returns to the Senate.penalty, currently a gross misdemeanor, would become a petty misdemeanor on the first twooffenses. Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) then offered an amendment that would lower thepenalty for clerks who sell alcohol to under-age people when the clerk similarly misreadsan identification card. The penalty would bereduced from a gross misdemeanor to a mis-demeanor. That amendment passed 68-64. A gross misdemeanor conviction carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonmentand a $3,000 fine. A misdemeanor convictioncarries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jailand a $700 fine. The bill now heads to a House-Senate con- ference committee. Protecting kids from pimps Penalties would expand laws targeting people who solicit teens to become prostitutes,under a bill the House passed April 12. Thevote was 131-0. Sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL- Mpls), the bill (HF2830) aims to curbsolicitors, commonly called pimps, from en- ticing young children, both boys and girls, intoprostitution. Current law makes it a felony to solicit a per- son under age 16 to become a prostitute. Themaximum penalty is 20 years in prison. The billwould raise the age portion, making it a 20-yearfelony to solicit anyone under age 18. \"It didn 't make sense to have pimps have more severe sentences for soliciting teens un-der age 15 than when they are under age 18, \" Clark said. Clark explained that the bill stems from see- ing the rise in teenage prostitution in herneighborhood. She noted that the average agea child enters prostitution is 14. \"Pimps are there, soliciting particularly young girls, \" Clark said. Increasing the age from 16 to 18 means more pimps will go to prison, Clark said. Cur-rently, a pimp who solicits a 16- or 17-year-old person into prostitution only receivespresumptive probation, she said. \"They don 't even go to jail now, \" Clark said. Many prostitutes do not testify against the pimps now because they are fearful that per-son will be back on the street quickly. \"They are scared to report it, \" Clark said. The bill now heads to the Senate. Falsely reporting stolen checks Falsely claiming that blank checks or debit cards have been stolen will be a misdemeanorunder a law Gov. Jesse Ventura signed April 10. The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), will create amisdemeanor when someone falsely tells hisor her financial institution the items are miss-ing or stolen. \"This is not going after people who mistak- enly overdraft their accounts, \" Stanek said re- cently. \"This is for people who intentionally and criminally defraud banks and businessesby writing out a number of bad checks. \" There is no cost to the bill, he added.The law would cover scenarios where indi- viduals write several bad checks and then re-port to the bank that those checks were stolen. Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington) sponsored the legislation in the Senate. Thelaw takes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF2751/SF3455*/CH354 Treating sex offenders Predatory sex offenders may wind up back in correctional facilities instead of staying intreatment programs, under a law signedApril 11 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The measure, sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), will send8 April 14, 2000offenders back to prison if they refuse to par- ticipate in treatment. \"The taxpayers assume that when they go to a treatment facility, they are trying to getbetter, \" Holberg said. \"That 's not necessarily the case. \" The law creates an incentive for offenders to participate, she said, because they will oth-erwise head to a less attractive prison setting. The sex offender will no longer be able to plead his or her case to a special review board,under the law. The cost of keeping an offender in treatment is three times the cost of correctional facili-ties, Holberg said. \"If they can 't make progress, why should we, as taxpayers, continue to support their treat-ment costs? \" Holberg said. Predatory sex offenders have committed aggravated and repeated offenses, as well assex offenses while committing such crimes asmurder, manslaughter, or robbery. About 15 predatory offenders are commit- ted each year in the state, and none have everbeen released, Holberg said. The law requiresa study examining sex offender policy andmanagement. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version. The law is effective April 12, 2000.HF3457/SF2858*/CH359PICTURE PERFECT John Schooners, legislative coordinator for Minnesota Outdoors Heritage Alliance fromShakopee, videotapes an April 12 rally in the Capitol rotunda as House Speaker Steve Sviggumaddresses the group.

Jesse Ventura will require the Metropolitan Mos-quito Control District to get the approval ofthe commissioner of the Department of Natu-ral Resources before spraying state lands. State law already allowed a landowner to refuse to allow Mosquito Control to spray hisor her land with insecticides. Effective April7, 2000, the new law gives the DNR that sameright with regard to state parks, wildlife man-agement areas, or other publicly owned lands. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), chair of the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Policy Committee, sponsored themeasure because Mosquito Control sprayedchemicals at Fort Snelling State Park in July1999 despite objections from the department. Ozment said the DNR should have juris- diction over the decision to spray chemicalsin wildlife management areas because the de-partment has the expertise in the chemicals ' effects on vegetation, water quality, wildlifehabitat, and related issues. He also said that current law gives the De- partment of Health authority over the DNRor land owners to authorize spraying formosquitoes that are known to carry diseases. The Senate sponsor of the measure was Sen. Bob Lessard (DFL-Int 'l Falls). HF3134*/SF2857/CH339 Underwater lumber recovery Logs that have been submerged on lake and river bottoms can be salvaged under a new lawthat was signed April 6 by Gov. Jesse V entura. Effective April 7, 2000, the new law will al- low a person or company wanting to salvagelogs from underwater to apply for a leasethrough the state Department of Natural Re-sources. The fee for a lease will be $500 for Minne- sota residents and $2,500 for those who liveoutside the state. Terms of a lease arenegotiable. Logs can be salvaged only if they are sub- merged at depths of 20 feet or more. A leasewill require that precautions be taken to avoiddisturbing the bottom of the lake or river. Also, the person or company with a lease will have to notify the Minnesota HistoricalSociety if they find a historical artifact, suchas a sled that was used to carry logs across afrozen lake. The state also will receive 25 percent of the money from the sale of the logs, based on theweighted average selling price. Some of the proceeds from the leases will go to the state 's general fund, and some will go to the game and fish fund. If the lake orriver is on school trust fund lands, the moneywill go into the permanent school fund. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack) and Sen. Dan Stevens(R-Mora). HF2559/SF2546*/CH337 #GAMBLING Card counting devices prohibited Gamblers are prohibited from using devices that can count cards or analyze strategy un-der a law signed April 6 by Gov. Jesse Ventura.Usage of such devices is now considered afelony. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City), the law, effective April7, 2000, establishes several new felonies. Attempting to open or enter a device to re- move money, chips, or tokens will bring afelony charge. Similarly, someone who intentionally uses counterfeit chips or tokens also could becharged with a felony, and an employee of thegambling licensee who cheats, as defined bythe law, could be charged with a felony. \"There are professional cheats that travel across the state using these devices, \" Osskopp said. The law was needed because a card club will open this month at Canterbury Park inShakopee, Osskopp said. \"There is nothing in law to regulate it, \" he said. Indian casinos are exempt from this lawSession Weekly 9#GOVERNMENT #GAME & FISHbecause the state does not have jurisdiction to enforce the measure. The law is modeledafter gambling laws in Nevada and New Jer-sey, Osskopp added. The law also makes it a felony to manufac- ture, sell, or distribute cards, tokens, or diceused to violate these gambling provisions.Another portion of the law makes it a felonyto instruct someone else to violate the law. The law also expands the list of places where charitable gambling halls can legally makecontributions. The amendment would allowgambling facilities to contribute to commu-nity arts organizations. Currently, contributions can be made to public and private educational institutions,scholarships, churches, natural resourcesprojects, such as trail upgrades or recreationaland community facilities. Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) sponsored the Senate version. HF3571/SF2828*/CH336 Lifetime licenses Lifetime licenses for hunting and fishing will be available under a new law signedApril 6. Under the measure, sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Bob Lessard(DFL-Int 'l Falls), people who want to hunt and fish will have the option to buy either a life-time license or the traditional annual license. The licenses are scheduled to be available March 1, 2001, for Minnesota residents andMarch 1, 2002, for non-residents. Fees for lifetime licenses are based on four groups: ages 3 and under, ages 4 to 15, ages 16to 50, and ages 51 and older. Lifetime fishing licenses for Minnesota resi- dents in those age groups will cost $227, $300,$383, and $203 respectively. People who pur-chase that license will still need to purchaseannual stamps if they want to fish for salmonor trout. Lifetime fishing licenses will also beavailable for non-residents at higher prices. Lifetime small-game hunting licenses for residents will cost $217, $290, $363, and $213for the same age groups. Those will also beavailable to non-residents at a higher price. Lifetime deer hunting licenses for residents will cost $337, $450, $573, and $383 respectively. The law also will allow lifetime sporting li- censes for residents that would cover fishingand small-game hunting. Such licenses willcost $357, $480, $613, and $413 respectively. Lifetime deer hunting or sporting licenses will not be available for non-residents. Revenue from the licenses will establish alifetime fish and wildlife trust fund. Money in that fund will be invested by the state Boardof Investment, and it will pay for projects thatcurrently are funded by revenue from annualhunting and fishing licenses. Other provisions of the bill make perma- nent a law that was set to be repealed this year. That law allows people in five Minnesota counties to obtain two deer hunting licenses\u2014 one license to use a firearm and one to use a bow and arrow \u2014 and to take one deer with each license. The five counties are Kittson,Lake of the Woods, Marshall, Pennington, andRoseau. The law took effect April 7, 2000.HF3510*/SF3378/CH341 Angling for a fee hike Hunting and fishing license fees would see across-the-board increases, under a bill theHouse passed April 13. The vote was 87-44. Revenue from licenses and from fines that are generated by enforcement of state lawsgoes into the state 's game and fish fund. That fund also contains money from the federalgovernment, which is allotted according to thesize of the state and the number of people whobuy hunting and fishing licenses. License fee increases would vary, but the primary increase is $3 per license. Fiscal analysts project that the game and fish fund will face a deficit in fiscal year 2003 be-cause revenues are not increasing at the samerate as expenses. The bill (HF3046), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would help resolve thatproblem. The bill would require the license fee in- creases to be effective only with a matchingappropriation from the state 's general fund. Holsten said that only makes sense because thegame and fish fund pays for projects that pro-vide a general benefit to all state residents, notjust to those who hunt and fish. Those projects include improving water quality in lakes, rivers, and streams; stockingfish and enhancing aquatic vegetation; andincreasing public water access. The game and fish fund pays for some of the Department of Natural Resources ' admin- istrative costs. The bill would effectively re-place part of the game and fish fund 's allocation to the administrative costs with thegeneral fund appropriation. Under Holsten 's proposal, $2 of revenue from the fee increase would be matched by $1from the general fund. The fee increases areprojected to raise about $3.1 million in rev-enue for the 2002-03 biennium, and the gen-eral fund match would be slightly more than$1.5 million.The bill would also prohibit the DNR from using the extra money to increase its perma-nent staff levels in the divisions of fish andenforcement beyond their 1994 levels. Also under the bill, $500,000 from the gen- eral fund would go toward the DNR 's walleye stocking program. The bill now goes to the Senate. Bleacher safety changes A bill that would modify safety require- ments for bleachers, such as those at sportsfacilities or local parks, is on its way to thegovernor 's desk. The House passed the bill (HF2846/ SF3272*) April 11. The vote was 93-39. New safety requirements for bleachers were signed into law last year, but Gov. Jesse Venturaline-item vetoed $100,000 that would havehelped communities and school districts paythe costs of complying with the new standards. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), sponsor of the bill, said he is concerned about bleachersafety but that the 1999 law will force schoolsand other organizations to pay for costly up-grades. This bill, he said, would ease the fi-nancial burden of those who have to complywith the 1999 law. That law requires bleachers to have gaps between seats, floorboards, and guardrails thatdo not exceed 4 inches. The previous standardwas 9 inches. Bleachers that do not meet the4-inch requirement and are taller than 30inches need to be replaced or safety nets mustbe installed by Jan. 1, 2001, under the law. Bradley 's bill would make those require- ments apply only to bleachers that are at least55 inches tall, which he said would exemptcommon bleachers that are only about fivetiers high. The bill also would extend the timeof compliance to Jan. 1, 2002. The bill had earlier been modified by the House so that the requirements would applyto bleachers taller than 30 inches. But a House-Senate conference committee removed thatprovision. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), sponsor of the 1999 law, said the House should send thebill back to the conference committee in hopesof upholding the 30-inch standard. But theHouse voted to accept the conference com-mittee report. Smith had sponsored the 1999 measure in response to a fatal accident. Six-year-old T obyLee of Mound died in January 1999 after fall-ing from a set of bleachers while attending ahockey game at a Hutchinson arena. Smithsaid T oby fell through a 13-inch gap in thosebleachers.10 April 14, 2000Bradley said his version of the bill still would require the worst sets of bleachers to be fixed.He also said that no accidents have been re-ported where someone has fallen througha 9-inch gap. Alternative bidding process The state would be able to purchase some items through a \"reverse auction \" process un- der a bill that is on its way to the governor 's desk. The House passed the bill (HF3495/ SF2972*) April 12. The vote was 129-2. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township), sponsor of the bill, said vendors would com-pete to sell office supplies or other such itemsthat the state currently buys through a bid-ding process. The term \"reverse auction \" refers to a pro- cess where sellers compete to offer the lowestprice, instead of a normal auction where buy-ers compete to offer the highest price. Under the bill, the state would request pro- posals for a purchase, and each vendor wouldsubmit an open proposal via the Internet. Ven-dors could then adjust their proposals to com-pete with each other to offer the lowest price. The process would not be used for construc- tion projects or other types of purchases thatare regulated by other laws. Typically, the state uses the traditional bid- ding process, which involves receiving closedbids from a number of vendors and pickingthe lowest one.

JesseVentura. The law is an attempt to decrease the chance that a child left in the company of a foster careprovider could suffer harm due to a provider 's inexperience or lack of training with specialequipment critical to the life and care of thechild. Care providers will be required to have training or experience with a child 's medical equipment before being allowed to care for thechild. Agencies that place children in homes, even if it's only on a temporary basis, will be re- quired to ensure that the care provider has thenecessary training before being entrusted withthe child 's care. The legislation was brought forward with the help of Sharon Morrissey and husbandDon Baierl of St. Paul, whose infant daughterdied in 1997 because a care provider didn 't know precisely how to operate the child 's health equipment.The Department of Human Services will be required to develop the training form. Offi-cials expect little, if any, fiscal impact to thedepartment. Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored themeasure, which is effective Aug. 1, 2000. HF3342/SF3025*/CH338 Prompt payment of claims Health insurance companies will be re- quired to promptly pay clean claims by healthcare providers and facilities under a law signedApril 10 by Gov. Jesse V entura. Third-party administrators also will be sub- ject to payment requirements, but the new lawwill not pertain to services provided bypharmacists. A \"clean claim \" is defined as a claim that has no defect or impropriety, including anylack of required documentation or any cir-cumstance that prevents timely payment. Health plan companies and third-party ad- ministrators will be required to pay or deny aclean claim within 30 days of receiving theclaim. Claims not paid in that time will besubject to an interest payment of 1.5 percentof the claim per month. The company providing the health plan or the third-party administrator would be re-sponsible for paying the interest \u2014 not the insured party. Late claim payments will not be subject to an interest payment if the payment is delayed sothat the company can review potentially fraudu-lent or abusive billing practices, however. Furthermore, the commissioner of the De- partment of Health will be prohibited from as-sessing a financial administrative penalty againsta health plan company that violates the law. The new law takes effect Jan. 1, 2001.Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd)sponsored the legislation. HF2643/SF2767*/CH349 Protection for newborns A bill that would provide a \"safe place \" for desperate mothers to leave unwanted new-borns now awaits Gov. Jesse Ventura 's consideration. The bill, returned from conference commit- tee and passed by the House April 12, wouldallow a mother (or a person of her consent)to leave an unharmed newborn at a hospitalemergency room up to 72 hours following thechild 's birth without facing prosecution. The hospital would be required to acceptSession Weekly 11#LAWthe child and notify a local welfare agency within 24 hours of the departure of the per-son delivering the baby. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior), sponsor of the bill (HF2945/SF2615*), said allowing aperson to leave a child at a place where it willnot be harmed without the fear of being pros-ecuted has the potential to save lives. Under current Minnesota law, a mother who willfully neglects a newborn when con-sidered to be reasonably able to care for theinfant can be charged with a grossmisdemeanor. This measure would allow the individual delivering the unwanted newborn to exit thebuilding without providing identification. Thehospital would be allowed to ask questionsabout the medical history of the mother ornewborn, but the person leaving the babywould not be required to provide any infor-mation. A newborn left behind would be considered an abandoned child. According to the bill, thechild must not have any obvious injuries orillness in order for the hospital to accept it. A hospital or employee of the hospital re- ceiving the child would be considered immunefrom any civil liability that could potentiallyresult, under the bill, if the act of receiving thenewborn is done in good faith. Furthermore, a social service agency taking custody of the child would not be required tolater reunite the child with its parents or searchfor relatives of the child as a placementoption. Paying for audiology services A law amending state medical assistance re- imbursement requirements for audiology andrelated services was signed April 10 by Gov.Jesse Ventura. The law will requires that the state reim- burse speech-language pathology and audiol-ogy services provided by a person issued atemporary registration at the same rate as ser-vices performed by a registered pathologist oraudiologist. To receive the same reimbursement rate, temporarily licensed professionals will have toundergo the appropriate supervision andmonitoring requirements provided in exist-ing state law. A speech-language pathologist is a profes- sional who is licensed by the state, and quali-fied by training and experience, to diagnoseand treat speech and language problems. Audiologists are trained professionals who specialize in working with individuals withhearing problems. Audiologists identify, treat,and help prevent hearing loss for people of allages.The new law will take effect Aug. 1, 2000. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) and Sen.

HF2477/SF2499*/CH347 No public defenders for youths Public defenders will not be appointed to child protection cases if the juvenile is youngerthan 10, under a law Gov. Jesse Ventura signedApril 10. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) was House sponsor of the measure, which creates a uni-form system statewide that dictates when apublic defender should be brought in to rep-resent a child. A juvenile age 10 or older canobtain a public defender, but not a child un-der age 10. \"Infants don 't need separate legal council, and it 's a waste of money, \" Bishop said. \"Some attorneys are being hired to represent a 2-year-old. That doesn 't need to be done. \" The law originates from the state Board of Public Defenders. In a recent letter, State Pub-lic Defender John Stuart explained that the lawpertains only to child protection or servicescases, not to juvenile delinquency cases. Stuart said some courts never appoint at- torneys unless the child is at least 12 years old,while other courts always appoint a lawyer foryoung children. \"The age of 10 was chosen as the cutoff be- cause children under the age of 10 cannot becharged with juvenile delinquency, but maybe dealt with in a children in need of protec-tion or services proceeding, \" Stuart wrote. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version. The law takes effect Aug. 1,2000. HF3119/SF2725*/CH357 Legal actions against brewers The House approved a bill April 10 that would clarify existing law regarding legal ac-tions between beer brewers and wholesalers. The bill (HF1947/SF1618*) would allow wholesalers to sue a brewer who is violatingthe state laws regarding that industry in ei-ther state or federal court. The measure passed on a 128-0 vote.The bill would give wholesalers the right to a trial by jury against brewers, and it wouldprovide that the right to bring action may notbe waived except at the time the suit is filed. The state 's beer brewers and wholesalers laws include provisions prohibiting brewersfrom inducing or coercing wholesalers intoaccepting delivery of any alcoholic beverageor any other commodity which wasn 't ordered by the wholesaler. The laws also establish the right of free as- sociation between all brewers and wholesal-ers. Brewers cannot collaborate to fixsomehow artificially elevate prices. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), now goes to thegovernor. Paintball gun measure fails The House defeated a bill that would have prohibited a person from selling or renting apaintball gun to a person under the age of 18without written consent from a parent or le-gal guardian. The bill failed on a 72-57 vote. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), spon- sor of the bill (HF3041/SF2417*), describedit as a \"parent 's right to know \" measure. \"Parents have the right to know when their children are going out to buy or rent one ofthese paintball guns, \" she said.

Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley) called the measure a \"note from mom bill. \" Gerlach said that the bill was unnecessary because thepaintball gun industry is already beginning toregulate itself by requiring users to wear fa-cial protection and to sign consent forms. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) said that many children 's activities, from playing sports to playing on playground equipment, can bedangerous, too, and safety should remain amatter of parental concern, not a legislativeresponsibility. Rep. Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington) said the bill offered a reasonable solution to a prob-lem. He said that despite wearing facial pro-tection he had been injured on the top of thehead while participating in a paintball gungame. Leppik said the bill would clarify the state 's current laws regarding whether retailers cansell the paintball guns to minors without pa-rental consent. She said the bill would haveestablished a law for paintball guns similar tocurrent laws regulating BB guns. The measure had already passed the Senate. Protection from bloodborne diseases Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law April 10 aimed at reducing occupational exposures tobloodborne diseases through sharps injuries. The law will require employers to comply with federal Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) regulations onbloodborne pathogens. It will also require that employers review written exposure control plans annually anddocument in the plan consideration of appro-priate engineering controls that are designedto eliminate or minimize exposure. Sharps are needles and other medical de- vices used in testing. They are often used todraw blood and therefore carry the most riskfor exposure to diseases carried through theblood. The new law will require that a company establish a safety committee to make recom-mendations for using the best methods tolimit injury. The law also requires that a per-son representing employees most likely to useor encounter a device creating exposure tobloodborne pathogens will be appointed tothe committee. Finally, an employer will be required to es- tablish internal procedures to document theroute of exposure and circumstances underwhich an exposure incident took place. Thelaw spells out how information must be docu-mented, as well. It should include the proce-dure being performed when the incident tookplace and the protective equipment or cloth- ing used at the time of the exposure incident. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thelegislation. The law takes effect June 10, 2000.

The proposal (HF2489), sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), would allow mu-nicipalities selling impounded bicycles to re-quire purchasers to register the bikes with thestate Department of Public Safety or with adeputy registrar appointed by the department. Currently, owners can voluntarily register their bicycles with the state to help preventtheft and increase chances of recovery when abike is stolen. The registration also assists inaccident victim identification. The cost to register a bicycle is $9 for a three- year period with a $1 filing fee. According to the department, over $1.5 million dollars worth of bicycles are stoleneach year in the state. The bill awaits action on the Senate floor. Left-lane bill passed Drivers in the left lane would be asked to move to the right when possible but wouldnot be required to change lanes, under a con-ference committee bill that won final passageApril 13 in the House. The vote was 95-33. The bill (HF3091/SF2484*) now heads to the governor 's desk. Sponsored by Rep. David T omassoni (DFL- Chisholm), the bill would require the place-ment of signs every 50 miles along freewaysreminding drivers to move to the right laneafter passing. \"This bill is aimed at people who park in the left-hand lane and never move over, \" Tomassoni said. \"We're just trying to get people to be more courteous. \" Tomassoni said the revised language \u2014 which asks drivers to move to the right \"to the extent it is practical \" rather than requiring a move \u2014 eliminates legislators ' concerns about making the action a crime. Originally, the bill included a petty misde- meanor penalty for people who would notmove to the right lane. In addition, the earlierversion of the bill also made a violation of thelaw a primary offense, meaning lawenforcement could stop a driver for notmoving to the right lane.T omassoni has said throughout the session that his goal was to obtain signs asking peopleto move out of the left lane and that he wasnot pushing for the petty misdemeanorlanguage. The signs would state, \"Move to the right after passing. \" The signs would not state, \"It's the law, \" which was called for in previous ver- sions of the bill.

Don 't even use terms or letters that describe yourself as adoctor of chiropractics. The minimum pen-alty for this gross misdemeanor is $1,000 or30 days in jail. Minnesota has a wide range of mandatory minimum sentences in its statutes, for offensesfrom drinking and driving to illegal drugpossession. Minnesotans may know about minimum sentences for gun crimes, criminal sexual con-duct offenses, or other violent crimes, but few may realize the history of mandatory penal- ties stretches across the 20th century. Many of the mandatory penalties predate the 1963 criminal code that implemented maximumpenalties, according to a report from the non-partisan House Research Department. State law books contain a variety of man- datory minimum penalties, some of them nowappearing strange and outdated.conservation laws faces a minimum penalty of a $10 fine or 10 days in jail. State law forbids secret societies, and a vio- lation carries a mandatory $2 fine. One mandatory penalty involving banking not only sets up the minimum fine of $700 ora year in jail \u2014 it explicitly requires the jail time to be served in the Stillwater prison. In more recent times, the Minnesota Legis- lature has passed laws with mandatory mini-mum sentences for a variety of criminaloffenses. If a person is convicted of certain drug or gun crimes, the judge must impose the minimumsentence, whether it is 60 days in jail or five yearsin prison. The judge has no leeway in determin-ing the minimum jail time in these cases. Minnesota began to push for more manda- tory minimum penalties for violent crimeabout 1980, when the Legislature approvedminimum sentences for persons who commitcrimes with guns, according to the House Re-search report. Nationally, drug offenders are the hardest hit under mandatory minimum laws, according toa legislative report. A mid-1990s study shows that90 percent of the defendants sentenced understatutes with mandatory minimum provisionswere convicted for drug offenses. Critics of mandatory sentences say such provisions lock up too many low-level offend-ers and do not catch major drug traffickers.Another concern is \"sentencing cliffs, \" which occur when a small dispute in the facts of acase leads to a large difference in sentences. For instance, a drug offender who had the minimum amount of drugs in possession toreach a felony-level crime faces the mandatoryminimum penalty. If that person had slightly lessof a substance in his or her possession, therewould be no mandatory sentence. Other experts say that mandatory mini- mum penalties do not deter crime. \"The weight of the evidence clearly shows that enactment of mandatory penalties has either nodemonstrable marginal deterrent effects orshort-term effects that rapidly waste away, \" wrote University of Minnesota law professor MichaelT onry in a criminal justice journal. Proponents of the mandatory minimums say it is better to have certain people, such asrepeat sex offenders, sent to prison for a longtime. For instance, one law says that no attorney or anyone working for the attorney can solicita person to hire the attorney. The mandatoryminimum penalty is $50. The law took effectin 1929 and was only altered once to make lan-guage gender neutral. The law is meant to deter attorneys from catching people at vulnerable moments, ac-cording to annotated Minnesota statutes. \"The practice of 'ambulance chasing ' is a violation of ethics of legal profession, brand-ing those who indulge in it with professionalinfamy, \" the document states. Until 1995, Minnesota had alaw that prohib-ited working onthe Sabbath. Theminimum finewas mustnot The man-datory penalty is aminimum of $50 or 30 days in the workhouse. That law has not been altered since its pas- sage 77 years ago. Some of the state 's mandatory sentences pertain to food handling. One law says a fineof $50 or 60 days in jail will be imposed on aperson selling veal from calves that were lessthan four weeks old. A person violating the state 's wildflower Judge R.

Most laws that govern gun possession and use are federal laws.Up until 1975, the only laws regulating firearms in Minne- sota were those dealing with the safe use of firearms for hunt-ing; other regulations existed in local ordinance.Gunfight at the Capitol Firearms laws have become a frequent subject of legislativedebate in recent years But in 1975, the Minnesota Legislature took its first major stab at gun control. The Leg- islature passed a bill that regulated the pos-session of handguns and required people toobtain a permit to carry a handgun in a pub-lic place. The law prohibited certain people from possessing handguns, including: people under18, except if they have had firearms trainingor are supervised while using a gun; peopleconvicted of a violent crime, unless 10 yearshave passed since the expiration of sentence;and people who have drug, alcohol, or mentalproblems. T o carry a handgun, eligible people have to apply for a permit with their local chief ofpolice or county sheriff, who must then checkfor criminal records, histories, or warrant in-formation. Applicants must prove they have apersonal safety or occupational hazard in or-der to carry a handgun. Carrying a handgunwithout this permit is a gross misdemeanor. Under the law, handguns can be transported in a motor vehicle, snowmobile, or boat onlyif they are unloaded and stored in a closed andfastened case. The 1975 law also outlawed the sale and manufacture of Saturday night specials, cheapguns made of material having a melting pointof less than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Themelting point is an indication of the \"flimsi- ness \" of the gun \u2014 the lower the melting point, the cheaper the gun. The Legislature acted again in 1977 when it passed a law that imposed a seven-day wait- ing period on the purchase of handguns fromfederally licensed dealers. During that seven-day period, law enforcement officials check the applicant 's background for any conditions that prohibit a person from possessing a handgununder the 1975 law. The background check is good for one year, so people can buy more than one gun afterthe initial application has been approved. Thelaw excludes unlicensed dealers and antiquegun collectors. More importantly, it excludes\"private transfers, \" that is, sales by people who don't trade in guns for a living. The Legislature also passed a law prohibiting the possession, ownership, and operation ofshort-barreled shotguns (i.e., \"sawed-off \" shot- guns), except by the military, law enforcement,or prison officials. The law also excludes thosepossessing these shotguns as collectors ' items. In 1985, the Legislature passed the Uniform Handgun Control Law, which took away localgovernments ' authority to regulate ownership and possession of firearms and ammunitionmore strictly than state laws. Earlier in the decade, both the Minneapolis and St. Paul city councils had passed ordi-nances that required people to obtain permitsto carry loaded, concealed weapons in thosecities. Local ordinances also regulated thetransportation of firearms and required liabil-ity insurance. Those in favor of the law complained that strict local ordinances meant they could bebreaking the law when they came to Minne-apolis or St. Paul, but were in compliance withstate law when they left the city limits. Legislative gun debate in 1988 centered on a proposed \"right to bear arms \" stste consti- tutional amendment.The amendment, backed by the National Rifle Association, among others, would haveasked voters to amend the constitution by add-ing these words: \"The right of a citizen to keep and bear arms for the defense and security ofthe person, family or home, or for lawful hunt-ing, recreation or marksmanship training shallnot be abridged. \" At the time, 42 states, through their consti- tutions, guaranteed their citizens ' right to bear arms. The gun lobby said the amendment wasnecessary to prevent the Legislature from ban-ning gun ownership in the future. The proposed amendment was narrowly defeated in the Senate Judiciary and the HouseRules committees. Legislators expressed con-cern about the amendment 's effect on the state 's existing gun laws. Opponents of the amendment said the pro- posal was not necessary because no one wasproposing to ban gun ownership. They warnedthat it could be used in court to challenge thestate 's existing restrictions on the purchase and carrying of guns. In 1989, legislators tried, and failed, to ban military-style assault weapons. Bills were in-troduced in the House and Senate that wouldhave prohibited the sale and ownership, pos-session or operation of semi-automatic mili-tary assault weapons. Law enforcementofficials and antique collectors would havebeen exempt. The law also would have Handguns that were seized by law enforcement agencies a Firearms Lab.Session Weekly 15required existing owners of assault weapons to register. The legislation was prompted by the Janu- ary 1989 murder of five children in Stockton,Calif., who were shot by a man who had pur-chased an AK-47 assault rifle in Oregon. Simi-lar legislation had been introduced in U.S.Congress at the time, as well. The Minnesota Senate Judiciary Commit- tee passed the Senate 's version of the bill, but the House Judiciary Committee voted to studythe issue rather than pass the House 's version of the bill, thereby killing it for the remainderof the year. The Legislature took up gun control issues again in 1993. Numerous provisions were considered, and many of those provisions be-came law. Under the 1993 measure, people wanting to buy military-style assault weapons have toundergo background checks and a seven-daywaiting period, the same as what 's requiredfor handgun purchases. This provision was enactedinstead of a provision toban military-style assaultweapons. The final bill alsoincluded a ban on conver-sion kits that would makesemi-automatic weaponsfire like machine guns. The law made it a crime to carry a rifle or shotgunin a public place. It is alsoa crime to keep a loadedweapon in a place wherechildren would have accessto it. The Legislature made it a felony to bring a gun toschool or on a school bus.Students bringing guns toschool will lose theirdriver 's license privileges until age 18. In addition, teachers and school officials were givenimmunity from civil andcriminal liability if theyintervene with armed stu-dents to protect othersfrom harm. St. Paul and Minneapolis sought to reverse the 1985 uniform gun control law and gainback the authority to enact gun control ordi-nances tougher than state laws. One bill introduced in 1993 would have al- lowed cities in the seven-county metropoli-tan area to control assault weapons, largeammunition clips, the possession of guns by minors, and the possession of loaded weap- ons in public places. Gun advocates were against this effort be- cause they said it would make gun control lawsin the state too complicated with individualcities having different ordinances from statelaw. They pushed for uniformity in gun con-trol laws. Instead of enacting this provision,the Legislature gave cities the authority toregulate the location of gun shops throughzoning. Legislators tried again to ban assault weap ons in 1994. Targeting trouble with guns in urban areas, Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls)sponsored a bill that would have banned the guns in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.Spear 's bill also required metropolitan gun dealers, under federal jurisdiction, to be li-censed by the state. During a Senate debate, Spear removed the ban on assault weapons in order to win ap-proval for state licensing of Twin Cities gundealers. But he removed the bill from consid-eration after a \"right to bear arms \" amend- ment was added to it. The 1994 Legislature did approve a num- ber of provisions aimed at federally licensedgun dealers and at private sales of guns, whichhad been exempt from background checkrequirements. Under the law, felony penalties are doubled for those supplying guns to minors or to any-one whom the gun dealers know will use thegun to commit a crime. It became a gross mis-demeanor to provide a handgun or assaultweapon to anyone the supplier knows is ineli-gible to receive one. Gun suppliers can be held criminally and civilly liable for gun crimes committed bythose ineligible to own firearms. And for pri-vate, unlicensed dealers, it is a gross misde-meanor for the seller if an ineligible buyer usesthe firearm in a crime within a year of obtain-ing it from the dealer. In 1996, the Legislature passed a law that would require stalkers and those violating protection orders to surrender their handgunsfor three years. In addition, if such offendersuse a gun while violating a protection orderor stalking, they can be barred from owning agun for the rest of their lives. (The same pro-hibition applies to those convicted of domes-tic abuse under a law enacted in 1992.) The 1996 Legislature also toughened pen- alties for gun law violations, including penal-ties for felons illegally possessing firearms.Under those regulations, an adult who negli-gently stores a loaded firearm that winds upin the hands of someone under 18 is guilty ofa gross misdemeanor. A provision to make it easier for Minneso- tans to obtain a permit to carry a concealedweapon was dropped in conference commit-tee that year. Similar measures have been in-troduced in subsequent years, but have nevermade it into law.

Johnson 's work at the Legislature always kept her busy, leaving some to marvel how shehad any free time for herself. She served aschair of the Sales and Income Tax Division ofthe House Taxes Committee in 1997 and 1998and was chair of the House K-12 EducationFinance Division in 1995 and 1996. In addition, Johnson studied at Harvard University when not in session to pursue amaster 's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government. After years of study,she obtained her degree in 1996. Johnson 's strong push in the House to bet- ter public education left some believing earlyon that Johnson, at one point, had to have beena classroom teacher. Not so, Johnson says. \"I do, however, believe that education is where the state 's future lies, \" she said. T omassoni said it was a pleasure to serve with Johnson on the education finance panel. \"Her sense of humor will also be missed, \" he said. Between them, Jefferson and Johnson have nine children. Johnson said community andfamily activities keep them very busy. Sheplans to take a year off before taking on anynew job. In addition, she won 't quit going to local school board meetings and other communityactivities in Spring Lake Park, which she hasactively attended for many years. Johnson offered this advice to future legis- lators: \"Don 't be afraid to ask questions and raise issues. Chances are that someone elseshares your concern. \" STEPPING DOWN Rep.

Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) may be leaving the House this session after serving 10 years, but he 's not leaving the political arena. Orfield will be running for the Senate seat that is held by Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls), who is retiring.Taking the next step After five terms, Orfield leaves House to run for Senate seat STEPPING DOWNThough he 's moving on, Orfield, 38, said it has been a privilege to serve in the House, andrunning for the Senate would be a new chal-lenge. \"The House is a very open and democratic institution, \" he said. \"Everyone gets to speak, and you learn about different people in thestate. It teaches youabout the basic ele-ments of human na-ture with a lot ofadrenaline. Y ou get alot of experienceabout life in a bighurry. \" Orfield is alsoworks with the Met-ropolitan Area Re-search Corporation. Before he was elected to the Housein 1990, Orfield hadworked for one ofhis mentors, formerMinneapolis MayorDon Fraser. Orfield said he was also influenced by members of his ownfamily. When he was growing up, his olderbrothers and sisters were active in the civilrights movement, and many family discus-sions revolved around those kinds of issues.\"We talked more about public issues than politics around the dinner table, \" he said. Orfield has lived in southwest Minneapolis most of his life, and many of his siblings, par-ents, and other extended family members stilllive in that area. He said he is the fourth gen-eration of his family to live in the district, and his son is the fifth. The only times he has lived outsideof Minneapolis werewhen he earned hislaw degree from and hestudied Americanhistory PrincetonUniversity. Orfield accomplish-ments acoalition, which hesaid improved theschool-equity for-mula and helped pass many bills regarding affordable housingand tax sharing. His book, Metropolitics , published in 1997, advocates widespread use of such coalitions,saying it 's the only way to properly conductregional and urban planning. The book sug- gests such coalitions help make the regionmore prosperous and stable. The book, which is just one of many re- gional planning concepts Orfield advocates,led to an appearance on the television pro-gram \"Nightline \" that same year. Orfield sponsored the Metropolitan Reor- ganization Act of 1994, which brought theMetropolitan Transit Commission, the Re-gional Transit Board, and the MetropolitanWaste Control Commission under the juris-diction of the Metropolitan Council. He alsohelped develop the Livable Communities Actof 1995, which is designed to avoid havingpoverty and crime concentrated in certainareas. \"It's a question of fairness between cities and older suburbs versus newer suburbs, \" he said. \"And most cities agree \u2014 really only the most affluent suburbs are opposed to afford-able housing and tax sharing. \"An argument can be made that it 's in everyone 's best interest, but I haven 't per- suaded everyone yet, \" he said.

The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year.

With the proliferation of the Internetinto our everyday culture, the day of onlinevoting may be just around the corner. Indeed with a presidential election loom- ing in the fall, several states \u2014 including,Alaska, Arizona, California, and Washington\u2014 have taken the first election-related stepsdown the super information highway. Last month, Arizona Democrats were al- lowed to cast their ballots via the Internet.Voters were given the choice of votingonline for a four-day period prior to thestate's primary. Voters could also cast theirballots via mail or in the traditional pollingplace.Digital ballots States tinker with voting on the Internet Close to 40,000 of the total 87,000 bal- lots cast were done via the Internet. Voterparticipation for the primary was up from12,844 in the 1996 primary. In January, Alaskan voters could cast their ballots online in the state's non-bindingpresidential straw poll. Only 35 out of a to-tal of 4,000 votes cast came over theInternet. The use of digital signatures and other technological identification measures arehelping ease concerns over the security ofonline voting. In order to vote online, Arizona voters had to pre-register. All registered voterswere then mailed a certificate by the secre-tary of state with a personal identificationnumber.Upon going to a Web site to cast their bal- lots voters were prompted for that identifi-cation number along other personal au-thentication information which comparedthe voter information with the secretary ofstate's records. Non-security related issues might be more troublesome to address. The VotingIntegrity Project, based out of Arlington,Virginia, filed a lawsuit prior to the Arizonaprimary seeking to stop the use of Internetvoting arguing that it discriminated againstlow income and minority voters with lessaccess to the Internet than more affluentvoters. A judge failed to stop the electionbut the case is still before the court. (D.

THE STATES50 This year the Minnesota Legislature be- came one of many to consider banning theuse of the oxygenating additive methyl ter-tiary gasoline. MTBE, which is an oxygenate added to fuel in many states, is intended to help theenvironment by lowering pollution emis-sions into the air. But research shows theadditive is responsible for several groundand water contaminations, including mu-nicipal wells as nearby as Alvord and IdaGrove, Iowa. Minnesota's legislators are not alone in their concern over the effects of MTBE us-age in gasoline. Recent developments inother states are driving a national reconsid-eration of using MTBE as an oxygenate infuel. California Gov. Gray Davis issued an executive order in March 1999 to phase outMTBE from the California gasoline supply by December 31, 2002. His decision wassupported by a state-funded researchproject by the University of California thatindicated that the air pollution benefits ofusing MTBE could be obtained in otherways. Twenty-three states have established regulatory guidelines or standards forMTBE contamination in groundwater ordrinking water. Experts say eight ounces of the additive can contaminate five million gallons ofdrinking water. Spillage from a car accidentcould threaten an entire aquifer. More than 40 percent of the U.S. popu- lation lives in areas where MTBE is used. Atcurrent growth rates of MTBE use, thisfigure could be as high as 80 percentwithin a few years.About 10 billion pounds of MTBE are pro- duced annually, making MTBE one of thelargest volume chemicals produced in theUnited States. MTBE is produced from isobu-tylene, a byproduct in the gasoline refiningprocess, and methanol, a byproduct of natu-ral gas refining. Water contaminated by MTBE has a bit- ter taste and detectable odor. Research hasshown it causes tumors in rats. Minnesota requires all gasoline sold in the state to contain an oxygenate. Ethanolis the oxygenate used here, and MTBE is notin gasoline sold in the state. Many want to pass a law to keep it that way. A bill (HF3292/SF2946*) now being dis-cussed by a House-Senate conference com-mittee would ban the additive inMinnesota. (M. D E LARCO )Unintended consequences Fuel additive used to reduce air pollution poses threat to water resourcesSession Weekly 23April 14 marks the night 135 years ago, when Lincoln was shot while enjoying aplay in the Washington, D.C., Ford 's The- ater. He died the next morning, April 15,1865, at 7:22 a.m. But Minnesota 's many connections to Abraham Lincoln likely are unknown bymany of the state 's residents. One of the last individuals to have a personal conversation with him was hissecretarial assistant, Edward D. Neill, thefounder of Macalester College, St. Paul 's public schools, and a founding memberof the Minnesota Historical Society. On the morning of April 14, Mrs. Lin- coln asked Neill if complimentary ticketshad been received from the theater. Theyhad not, so he sent a messenger to get boxseats for that evening 's performance. Later, Neill spoke to the president about someroutine military officer 's commission. Earlier, Neill observed the president meeting with Gen. Ulysses S. Grant andthe cabinet to hear Grant 's description of Gen. Robert E. Lee 's surrender at Appomattox, five days sooner. Almost to the hour of Lincoln 's death four years before, on April 15, 1861,Minnesota 's Aaron Greenwald and six oth- ers from Anoka were the first in the na-tion to volunteer for the Union Army.They were part of the 1,000 men offeredby Gov. Alexander Ramsey to Lincoln forthe fight against the southern states. When Lincoln made his GettysburgReflections Address at the dedication of the cemeteryin November 1863, he spoke for the thou-sands who died there \u2014 including 232 of 262 members of the First Minnesota V ol-unteer Regiment \u2014 \"that these dead shall not have died in vain. \" The regiment 's entire color guard was lost. The U.S. flag they carried now hangsin the Capitol rotunda, tattered and torn.Next to it is the original broken staff, at-tached by a leather strap to a broken polethat carried the Confederate flag. During Lincoln 's time in public office in Illinois and Washington, he had manycontacts with Minnesota. Among themwas John W. North, who helped to orga-nize the state 's Republican Party. North also constructed the American House inNorthfield \u2014 Carlton College 's first build- ing. Lincoln also knew Minnesota 's ninth governor, L. J. Hubbard, and others. The Italian nobleman, Frances Vivaldi,was appointed as the U.S. consul in Ar- gentina and Brazil. Vivaldi lived in LongPrairie, became a priest, got married, de-serted his wife, and became a priest again. Another Minnesotan, Gen. James Shields was a U.S. senator. Originally fromIllinois, he once challenged Lincoln to aduel for some little-known reason. Theirplan to fight with battle sabers wasaborted. Shields ' statue as a Civil War hero now stands in the Capitol. Other connections are the Golden Horses above the Capitol entrance,sculpted by Daniel Chester French. Frenchalso created the Lincoln Memorial inWashington. And Lincoln 's portrait by St. Paul artist, Edward V . Brewer hangs in theHouse chamber. Lincoln County in southwestern Min- nesota and Lincoln townships across thestate are just some of Minnesota 's honors to the fallen president. The state was thefirst to make his birthday a legal holidayin 1895. Edward Neill aptly noted that Abraham Lincoln \"was a patriot who had the wel- fare of his country close to his heart. \" With malice toward none, with charity toward all. \u2014L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERT Photograph from the Library of Congress Prints andPhotographs Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USACopyright by M.P .

But disagreement on the amount available for spending and permanent tax cuts means the deadline leaders imposed has arrived and the fate of allmajor omnibus measures hangs in the balance.No end in sight Legislature breaks for holiday with differences on majorspending bills and some key policy initiatives still unresolved House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R- Eagan) and other House Republican leadershave been bombarded with daily questionsover the past two weeks regarding whetherthe House would adjourn on schedule. Andas the legislators closed the day before head-ing out on a four-day legislative break, hehad to explain the situation once again. \"Coming away with a good deal is more important than a timely end of the session, \" Pawlenty said. The state Department of Finance has in- dicated that the state can afford approxi-mately $549 million per year for anycombination of tax cuts and new spendingmeasures. But House leadership has sug-gested those numbers are artificially low be-cause the department has underestimatedrevenues in its last 17 budget forecasts. Theythink the Legislature can cut taxes more orspend more. Until all sides can come to an agreement regarding the spending limit, progress on themajor bills \u2014 most of which are in confer- ence committee \u2014 is stalled. Taxes cuts and rebates The House omnibus tax bill would pro- vide permanent income tax cuts totalingover $840 million per year by cutting ratesin all three brackets. The Senate 's tax proposal would provide permanent cuts of around $162 million peryear focusing primarily on increasing ex-emptions and reducing the rate for automo-bile license registration fees, though not asmuch as the governor has proposed. TheSenate 's omnibus transportation bill also contains a license tab reduction proposal. Even where there is some agreement, the House and Senate tax packages differ some-what in their approach. Both sides, along withthe governor, have agreed to a sales tax rebate,they 're each just a slightly different size. The House plan would return around $489 million to taxpayers in a manner similar tolast year 's rebate. The House would expand eligibility to those on social security, and al-low taxpayers with a qualified dependent toincrease the amount of their rebate. The Senate 's $453 million proposal would expand eligibility fordependents and non-filers over the age of 18as of December 21,1998, with at least $500of qualifying income.Those people wouldalso be eligible for aretroactive 1999 re-bate. The bill (HF4127) remains in conferencecommittee. Bonding bill The House and Sen- ate bonding plans,which would pay forrepairs to state build-ings and new con-struction areabout $230 millionapart. The two billsdiffer in the amountthat would be used for such projects, eitherby issuing general obligation bonds, user-fi-nanced bonds, or direct spending. In general obligation bonding, the Housebill and the governor 's capital budget plan each propose to use about $400 million,whereas the Senate bill would use about $665.6million. The proposals also differ in terms of priorities for spending. Some projects would be funded equally under each proposal, such as a $35 millionMolecular Cellular Biology building at theUniversity of Minnesota. But funding for other major projects re- mains to be negotiated, such as a $58 millionproposal for a new Bureau of Criminal Ap-prehension building. The House plan wouldspend $28 million for a new BCA laboratoryfacility and repairs to the current building,while the Senate and governor would fullyfund the $58 million request. The bill (HF4078) awaits action in confer- ence committee. Transportation plans Funding for new roads and the future of a light-rail project also sit in conference com-mittee, which had not met for more than aweek before the holiday break. The commit-tee is negotiating this year 's omnibus trans- House Minority Leader Tom Pugh describes the House Republican tax plan as being like the ocean liner Titanic, saying that \"it too will sink.\" His com-ments came during an April 19 press conference in the Capitol rotunda. Pugh,Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, and other DFL legislators were toutingtheir plans to cut license tab fees and increase funding for education. HouseRepublican leaders held a press conference that day to support their planto cut income taxes in all brackets. In a stalemate on major tax and spend-ing matters, legislators left for holiday break. portation finance bill (HF2891). The House version of the bill would require the Department of Transportation to cancel$92 million in unspent bonds allocated for a4 April 21, 2000IT'SAFACT Upon re-election in 1934, Gov. Floyd B. Olson vowed to change the structure of thestate 's tax system. Since taking office in 1931, changing the way Minnesota taxedits citizens had been one of his primarygoals. Following the governor 's lead, the 1935 session was largely devoted to reformingthe state 's property tax system. The nation was still in the midst of the Great Depres-sion, and the 1935 tax reform proposalswere seen as key to the state 's ability to move out of the economic doldrums. Olson claimed that poorer Minnesotans were bearing too much of the tax burden,and he wanted more taxes on corporations.The Legislature and the governor wouldclash on this very philosophy as theyworked to craft a tax reform package. Minnesota property taxes at the time were considered high especially in com-parison to similar states. In 1934, the statecollected $109 million in property taxes.Wisconsin brought in $90 million that year. While legislators generally agreed on the need to relieve the property tax burden onMinnesota taxpayers, they also knew re-placement revenues would be needed. T oforce local governments to reduce theirbudgets would have had a serious impacton the services they provided, many law-makers argued. As the tax committees held hearings on various proposals, officials determined thatno single tax could be increased to replacethe property tax revenue. In the end, theLegislature instead proposed a combina-tion of increases and new taxes. The Legislature 's proposal included in- creases in the following: income taxes onboth individuals and corporations; inher-itance taxes; rates on telephone, telegraph,and railroad companies; and taxes on to-bacco products. The bill also called for agift tax and a 3 percent state sales tax. It was the last provision that quickly be- came the focus of debate. Many officials,including Olson, argued that sales taxesplaced a greater burden on people withlower incomes.Putting the tax before the sale A failed Depression-era plan would have required consumers to pay a sales tax before they could purchase a product T o offset this burden, legislators pro- posed increasing rates of other taxes andexempting food from the sales tax. Stillthere was considerable opposition to thecreation of a state sales tax. And legislators had devised a system where the state could collect the sales taxbefore the actual sale even transpired. The 1935 omnibus tax bill called for a stamp system in which two-part stamps ofdifferent denominations would be pur-chased from local authorized dealers. At thepoint of sale, the consumer would presentthe stamp to the merchant, who would de-tach the bottom portion containing a se-rial number, which he or she would keepas a record in the event of an audit. Ohio had a similar system, and the method was endorsed by the retailers ' as- sociations as being the most effectivemethod of collecting the sales tax. It wasgenerally considered a more honest andaccurate accounting because it eliminatedan end-of-the-month tax payment by themerchant, based on total sales as shown onthe books rather than actual taxes collected. The massive tax reform bill passed the House by a 70-51 margin, and the Senate37-22. But Olson vetoed it, saying it wasunfair. In his veto message, Olson wrote, \"It is not based on means and ability of the per-sons taxed to pay the taxes imposed. Thosewho can least afford to pay taxes are taxedthe most, and those who can most affordto pay are taxed the least or not taxed atall.\" Shortly after vetoing the bill, Olson in- troduced his own tax measure, parts ofwhich ultimately passed both houses. Hisbill also repealed the 28-year-old mortgageregistry tax, which taxed property based onthe length of time the property owner stillhad left to pay off the existing mortgage. Controversy had swirled around the mortgage issue as Depression-era bankswere forced to foreclose on a number ofMinnesota properties, of which werefarms. (D. M AEDA )Hiawatha Corridor light-rail project. The Senate and the governor oppose the proposal. Both versions of the bill would pump new funding into road construction. The Housebill proposes $402 million in cash, mostly fromthe general fund, for new roads. The moneywould be split evenly between the Twin Citiesand Greater Minnesota. The Senate bill offers $302 million in road projects, but that funding would be dividedthrough county and municipal aid formu-las. The Senate also would provide for $200million in bonds for road construction in2002 and 2003. Both the House and Senate would require a study of the ramp meter system in the TwinCities. The House bill includes funding toconduct a study. The Senate bill would re-quire the meters to be turned off in October2000 while the House version would leavethe option to the company performing thestudy. The House bill contains no license tab fee reductions. The Senate plan offers a consti-tutional amendment that would dedicate 15percent of motor vehicle sales tax, or about$80 million, to a license fee cut. Another 15percent would go into a transit account. The governor favors the constitutional amendment that would dedicate 54 percentto cut vehicle tab fees. His proposal would capfees at $75 annually. The plan would cost thestate $274 million. Education finance The Senate has proposed $293 million for permanent and one-time education spend-ing. The House has tallied a figure of about$70 million. The biggest difference is in permanent fi- nancing. The Senate is proposing to increaseannual spending by approximately $144million, with most of the money earmarkedfor Internet access, special education, andprofessional development. The omnibus education finance bill (HF3800) awaits action in conference committee. Both House and Senate conferees would like to help school districts pay more for teacherswith advanced degrees or extensive service,and plan to discuss the best approach to pro-viding incentives for individuals to enter theteaching profession. Profile of Learning Members of a House-Senate conference committee continue to attempt to resolve dif-ferences in bill (SF3286) proposing repairsto the Profile of Learning.

Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill April 13 that would have allowed people to claim any valu-ables from inside a car that has been towedand impounded. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored the bill and was not pleased by the veto. \"The towing truck companies always knew they were stretching the law on keeping per-sonal items, \" Dawkins said. \"I'm surprised they were able to convince the governor their live-lihood depended on their need to keep base-ball mitts and briefcases. \" The bill would have required impound lot owners to notify the vehicle owner within fivedays of where the car is located. If the vehicleowner did not pick up the vehicle within 45days of the notice and pay all impound andtowing fees, the impound lot would have beenallowed to sell or junk the vehicle. The bill also stated that, in the event of a sale, the bank or financial institution that hasa lien on the car would have received first pri-ority in obtaining payment. (Such languagealso was contained in a separate bill that thegovernor vetoed. See related story on page 7.) Ventura expressed concern that Dawkins ' bill would hurt the towing industry. He saidimpound lots would be required to absorb thecosts of towing and storing abandonedvehicles. \"Owners of the vehicles would bear no re- sponsibility for the towing, storage, or disposalcosts of the vehicle, but would be permittedto obtain their possessions from the vehicle, \" V entura wrote in his veto message. \"Those possessions may be worth more than the ve-hicle itself. \" State law says the impound lot owners have a lien on a car it has in its possession but saysnothing about personal items in the car,Dawkins said. He added that he would like tosee a court rule on that statute, because hebelieves the court would rule against impoundlot owners and towing companies. Ventura also disliked the bill because banks would have received first priority in obtain-ing payment. \"This law could cause towing costs to in- crease significantly, \" V entura wrote. \"Small towing companies may go out of business.Larger companies would pass the costs on topaying customers and the insurance industry,which would, in effect, raise insurance premi- ums for everyone. \" Sen. Steve Novak (DFL-New Brighton) sponsored the bill in the Senate. HF3566/SF3291*/CH388 Soliciting funeral goods The House passed a bill April 18 that would regulate solicitation and sale of funeral goodsand services. The vote was 117-0. The bill (HF2713/SF2686*), sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), wouldprohibit solicitation at a hospital, gravesite,nursing home, or wake, without a specific re-quest from the family of the deceased or otherrepresentative to do so. It also would prohibit an individual from of- fering goods and services to a person whosedeath is impending, or to an individual respon-sible for funeral arrangements of a deceased per-son within 10 days of that individual 's death. Such acts, however, would be allowed, under thebill, if the deceased or a relative had made ar-rangements to discuss plans for the funeral orburial before death occurred. The bill would not apply to communication between an individual and a funeral providerrelated by blood, adoption, or marriage. When the deceased has handled his or her own arrangements in advance, the bill wouldrequire that the funeral provider produce acopy of arrangement documents and give thecopy to the person controlling the dispositionof the remains. A copy of the arrangementswould be required to change hands no laterthan 24 hours after first contact between theprovider and the individual in charge of theremains. Provisions that would establish require- ments for such arrangements and also allow aperson making advance burial arrangementsto cancel plans are also contained in the bill. Furthermore, the measure would require that all funeral establishments and providersclearly state their ownership in all business lit-erature, contracts, and correspondence. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. Language pertaining to a potential finan- cial impact of the measure was incorporatedinto the omnibus state government spendingbill (HF2699) last month. The provisionwould appropriate $90,000 in fiscal year 2001for the purpose of responding to public com-plaints about funeral goods and servicessolicitation. That bill remains in a House- Senate conference committee. Limits on dealership owners Auto manufacturers are barred from buy- ing car dealerships in Minnesota, under a lawsigned April 14 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The new law forbids manufacturers from buying a dealership and competing with otherdealerships in the area. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), who spon- sored the legislation in the House, said hisprimary concern is that without this law,manufacturers could own dealerships andwould have unfair advantage in competitionwithin the local market. With access to dealers ' records and market- ing information, the manufacturers \"could very easily cause mischief, \" Davids said. Davids also said the law protects indepen- dent dealers from being muscled out of busi-ness by more powerful manufacturers. The law was introduced after General Mo- tors announced last fall it planned to purchaseseveral car dealerships across the United States,Davids said. Eleven states already have laws barring manufacturers from owning local dealerships,and more states were pursuing the issue thisyear, he added. The law also specifically lists certain unfair market practices that are prohibited, such asrefusing to offer all models manufactured ina line to a franchised dealership. The law does grandfather in one Rochester Saturn dealership, which is already owned bythe manufacturer. Sen. Steve Novak (DFL-New Brighton) sponsored the Senate measure. The law is ef-fective April 15, 2000. HF2731*/SF2753/CH409 Credit card consent bill stalls A bill that would ask consumers to give \"ad- equate consent \" for telemarketers to use their credit card stalled April 18. The House Commerce Committee tabled the bill (HF3492) on a 10-8 vote. Rep. MattEntenza (DFL-St. Paul), who sponsors the leg-islation, said the tabling motion effectively killsthe bill.6 April 21, 2000Currently, some telemarketers have access to consumers ' credit card account information through arrangements with banks that issuecards, Entenza said. Even if a consumer doesnot give the credit card number over thephone, the telemarketer can charge theperson 's account if that person consents to buy a product or service. Entenza said this telemarketing technique preys on elderly people. T elemarketers mightspeak quickly or confuse the consumer, thenget the person to consent to buy a product,even though the consumer never verbally gavehis or her credit card number. \"We need to stop some of the scam artists out there, \" Entenza said. The committee heard a tape of a senior citi- zen who was charged for a product she didconsent to buy. The elderly woman soundedconfused and twice asked the telemarketer ifthe call was a scam. She also said on the tapethat she believed she would not be charged forthe packet of information. The bill would have required the consumer to actually give the credit card number for thecard to be used. Prentiss Cox, assistant attorney general, brought four boxes filled with complaintsabout this practice to a recent CommerceCommittee meeting. \"This bill is a result of a vehement number of consumer complaints, \" Cox said. \"People use words like 'theft ' in their complaints. It 's like they are taking $20 out of your pocket. \" Cox added, \"Unless the consumer listens to every word carefully and objects, they will becharged. \" Cox said he has never seen a telemarketer use a script that asks the consumer if they cancharge the credit card number. Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) said fraud is not the concern with this bill. \"It is to make sure the consumer is aware of a financial transaction taking place, \" Hilty said. #CRIME Liability for providing alcohol Supplying alcohol to people under age 21 would be a cause of action in civil law, undera law signed April 18 by Gov. Jesse V entura. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter) said the law may help put a stop to partieswhere adults serve liquor to juveniles. Adultswill be less likely to supply alcohol to juve-niles at a party if they know they could be heldliable for the juveniles ' actions when they leave the premises, Carruthers said. \"When adults go and give booze to kids, you know what happens? Kids get killed. That 's thereality, \" Carruthers said in floor debate on the measure. The law pertains to people who do not pos- sess liquor licenses, covering events like houseparties. Adults would not be expected to check iden- tification of guests at a party, Carruthers said. The law will make an adult liable for actions of the minor if the adult supplied alcohol andhad control over the premises, was in a rea-sonable position to stop the juvenile fromdrinking, or knowingly and recklessly permit-ted the underage consumption of alcohol. \"It will hopefully make adults think twice before they give alcohol to minors, \" Carruthers said. The intoxicated teen who caused any injury or other harm would not be able to sue theperson providing the alcohol. The law includes a Senate provision that says homeowners cannot purchase liabilitycoverage under their homeowner 's insurance to cover liability for an intoxicated juvenile 's actions, unless it is specifically stated in thepolicy it is meant to cover such situations.However, that provision will expire Dec. 31,2001. \"If insurance companies want to provide coverage, they can, \" Carruthers said. The law stems from a 1997 New Y ear 's Eve crash, when St. Paul teen-ager Kevin Brockwaywas killed after leaving a party where alcoholwas provided by another teen 's parent. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the Senate version. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF2555/SF1733*/CH423 THE TAX DEBATE Redefining harassment Judges would be granted more discretion- ary power in hearing harassment cases, undera bill the House passed April 19. The vote was110-18. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) is sponsoring the bill (HF2516), which also would redefineharassment to include a \"single incident \" that has a \"substantial adverse effect. \" Current law requires repeated incidents for an act to beconsidered harassment. Smith said the key portion of the bill is it does not require a hearing to take place onevery harassment complaint. \"It gives the court the flexibility they wanted after 10 years of looking at this statute, \" Smith said. Ramsey County District Court Judge Gregg Johnson testified earlier this session that hedoes not want to close the door on worthy fil-ings, but he hears many frivolous cases thatdo not deserve court time and keep him fromother more important business. The state began tracking restraining order filings in 1992, when 4,800 were filed. Last year,people filed for 8,800 restraining orders. A victim would be required to allege a clear and present danger of harassment before thecourt could issue a temporary restraining or-der, under the bill. An earlier version of the bill would have eliminated the fee waiver on filing costs, mean-ing victims would have been required to pay a$50 fee to seek a restraining order. However,the House voted 128-0 to strip that part of thebill and keep the waiver intact. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) spoke Members of the conference committee on the omnibus tax bill meet in the Capitol April 12.The committee, along with other conference committees discussing major omnibus spend-ing measures, has met sparingly while House leaders negotiate budget targets with the Sen-ate and the governor.Session Weekly 7against the $50 fee, saying it would hurt low- income women and others. Skoglund sup-ported the bill after the waiver was reinstated. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) spoke against the bill, saying he disliked the redefinition ofharassment. He expresses fears that a personmight accidentally say something to a men-tally unstable person one time that could leadto a harassment case. The bill now heads to the Senate. Penalty for assault during arrest A person who physically assaults an officer during an arrest but does not cause any de-monstrable bodily harm could be chargedwith a gross misdemeanor, under a bill theHouse passed April 17. The vote was 119-8. Sponsored by Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul), the bill (HF2958/SF2830*) would makeit a felony for someone to escape from policecustody for a felony-related action, even if thatperson has not yet been charged or convictedof a crime. Offenders would face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Cur-rent law only allows for a felony if the personflees after being charged or convicted of afelony. Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) introduced an amendment that would create a gross misde-meanor for a person who physically assaultsan officer in the process of an arrest. Currentlaw allows for a felony charge if there is \"de- monstrable bodily harm \" to the officer, but there are currently no additional penalties forother cases. The House passed the amendment.Biernat, who presented a similar bill in the House Crime Prevention Committee lastmonth, said the measure stems from a case inwhich an officer was struck in the groin by asuspect who was resisting arrest. The personcouldn 't be charged because there was no last- ing demonstrable harm, like a bruise or a cut. The House also changed Biernat 's amend- ment to clarify that a gross misdemeanorcharge would only be applicable on physicalassaults, and not verbal ones. That change wassuggested by Rep. Doug Reuter (Ind.-Owatonna). The bill now returns to the Senate. Vehicle forfeiture bill vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill April 13 that would have given banks more rights to fundsgenerated from forfeited vehicles. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored the bill, which would have allowed banksto acquire forfeited vehicles if there is an out-standing loan or lease on the car.\"Right now, sales are done at impound lots, \" Entenza explained. \"This bill (would have al- lowed) the banks to remove the vehicle fromthe impound lot, clean it up, and sell it at ahigher value. \" Under the bill, banks would have first ap- plied proceeds to the debt they are owed bythe vehicle owner. The bank then would havebeen required to reimburse impound lots forholding the car. Any remaining cash from thesale of forfeited vehicles would have gone intoa special fund for law enforcement. However, Ventura rejected the measure, claiming it had fiscal implications he could notaccept. \"This bill does not require a financial insti- tution to reimburse law enforcement agenciesfor their cost when the sale of the forfeitedvehicle does not equal or exceed the loan bal-ance, \" V entura wrote in his veto message. \"Current law provides an incentive for the lien holder to get the maximum value for theforfeited vehicle because they must pay thecosts incurred by law enforcement before sat-isfying their lien. This bill eliminates the in-centive and would result in increased costs tothe taxpayers. \" Entenza said he was surprised by the veto.\"It was a disappointment that the Depart- ment of Public Safety, which watched this billfor two years, waited until after it passed toregister their objections, \" Entenza said. The measure is being re-written, and Entenza hopes to introduce it as an amend-ment to a different DWI bill yet this session.Language that specifies a priority of whichparty is paid first will not be included in therewritten version, Entenza said. Under state law, drivers are required to for- feit their vehicle only after a third drunkendriving conviction, Entenza said. \"What we are talking about is the most hard-core repeat offenders that continue todrive drunk, \" he said. Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) sponsored the Senate version. HF262/SF76*/CH383 Domestic violence prevention An office of domestic violence and sexual assault prevention will be established, undera law signed April 13 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), the law will create theoffice, establish a position to direct it, and es-tablish an interagency task force on domesticabuse and sexual assault prevention. All battered women and crime victim ser- vices are now monitored through the Depart-ment of Public Safety, Howes said. \"The battered women 's groups have beenaround for 25 years, \" Howes said. \"They 've always been shuffled in the corner. \" The law will create a \"road map \" for put- ting together the task force, Howes said. Thetask force would be required to include repre-sentatives from the departments of Correc-tions, Health, Human Services, EconomicSecurity, and Children, Families and Learn-ing. The task force also must have a countyattorney, city attorney, and a judge. Howes said he wanted a wide variety of people serving on the task force so it repre-sents both urban and rural interests. The director of the new domestic violence office would serve as chair of the task force. The law outlines the director 's duties, which include advocating victims ' rights, increasing education and awareness, supporting litiga-tion, initiating policy changes, and buildingpartnerships with law enforcement and thecourts. The task force will evaluate the progress of the director and the office. In addition, the taskforce will establish a strategic plan for thedirector. Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge (DFL-New Hope) sponsored the Senate version. The lawtakes effect July 1, 2000. HF3331*/SF2980/CH368 Evading sales tax payments People who collect motor vehicle sales tax and then fail to send the tax to the state couldbe charged with a felony, under a law signedby Gov. Jesse V entura on April 13. The law creates a felony for not submitting vehicle sales tax to the state, but it states thatthe person collecting the tax must \"willfully \" fail to send in the tax. The final version of the measure provides for a felony, regardless of the dollar amountinvolved. Previously, the Senate version wouldhave only provided for a gross misdemeanorif the dollar amount was less than $500, and afelony above that amount. House sponsor Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) said the law stems from a February stateSupreme Court decision related to a case inwhich a Mankato businessman was convictedof collecting $12,000 in vehicle sales tax andfailing to send the money to the state. The ef-fect of the court ruling made it no longer afelony to not send in the vehicle sales tax. Entenza said his legislation reverses the law to where it was prior to the court decision. The state will collect about $526 million in vehicle sales tax in 2001, according to the non-partisan House Research Department. It isunknown what amount of sales tax is notcollected. Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids)8 April 21, 2000#EMPLOYMENTsponsored the Senate version. The law is ef- fective April 14, 2000. HF3303/SF3566*/CH366 Limited calls for inmates Inmates will no longer have unlimited ac- cess to phone services, under a law signed April14 by Gov. Jesse V entura. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township) sponsored the House version of the measure,which will give wardens more control overphone systems at correctional facilities. \"We're allowing the warden to make the decision on what is a reasonable level of callsthe inmates can make a day, \" Anderson said. Inmates have more free time than in the past, Anderson said, and many inmates use thephone to make collect calls to friends and fam-ily. Some inmates make three, four, or morecalls to one person each day. This frequent usecan cause the phone system to become over-loaded, Anderson said. \"They were using the phones in a way to clog up or delay, in a way corrections officialscouldn 't use the phones, \" Anderson said. \"It became a point where they were seeing it asan abuse of the phone system. \" State law prescribes that inmates can make only collect calls. The law will change criminal penalties for officials who refuse to let inmates obtainphone privileges, by exempting them fromcriminal penalties. Other inmates who deny inmates ' phone calls will still be subject to misdemeanor finesand penalties. Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) spon- sored the Senate version. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF3512/SF3108*/CH408 #ENVIRONMENT#ENERGYWorkers' compensation benefits Proposed changes to the state 's worker 's compensation laws, determined by a panel ofbusiness and labor leaders, were passed by theHouse April 19. The vote was 129-0. The billnow goes to the governor. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls), the spon- sor of the measure (HF3960/SF3644*), saidthe bill is a reflection of recommendationsfrom the Workers ' Compensation Advisory Council. The council is composed of repre-sentatives from the Minnesota Chamber ofCommerce, the state 's AFL-CIO, and the Legislature. Nornes said the bill would provide an in- crease in the maximum weekly compensationan injured worker can receive for wage lossbenefits. Currently, that amount is capped at $615 per week. The bill would increase theamount to $750. The bill also would increasethe minimum amount per week from $104 to$130. In the case of a worker who is killed in a work-related accident, the bill sets the mini-mum amount of compensation for depen-dents at $60,000. The bill also would transfer $325 million in surplus funds from the Minnesota Workers ' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan to a fundfor the second injury and supplemental ben-efits program. The assigned risk plan provides a source of workers ' insurance for employers who would otherwise be unable to obtain such coveragefrom the private insurance market. Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said that the bill would not go far enough. \"I'm disappointed more wasn 't done for the injured workers of the state, \" Rukavina said. Aid for struggling farmers The House passed a bill April 19 that would allow struggling farmers to qualify sooner forthe state 's dislocated workers program. The vote was 108-22. The bill (HF2797/SF2575*), sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would di-rect the commissioner of the Department ofEconomic Security to give priority in 2001 forgrants that provide training to dislocatedfarmers and ranchers. Currently, farmers can qualify for the department 's dislocated workers ' program once they are unemployed as a result of eco-nomic conditions or because of naturaldisasters. The bill would expand eligibility to farm- ers that have experienced a significant reduc-tion in income due to inadequate crop orlivestock prices, crop failures, or significantloss in crop yields due to pests, disease, ad-verse weather, or other natural phenomenon. The bill now goes to the governor 's desk. Poultry litter as energy source The House passed a bill April 17 that would move Minnesota closer to becoming the firststate in the country to have an electric gener-ating facility that uses poultry litter for fuel.The vote was 105-24. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), the spon- sor of the measure (HF2757), said it would makechanges to the biomass mandate that was in-cluded as part of 1994 legislation relating to thePrairie Island nuclear power facility.That legislation, which allowed Northern States Power Company to store more nuclearwaste at its Prairie Island facility, requiredpublic utilities that operate nuclear powerplants in the state to develop 125 megawattsof electric energy generated by certain formsof biomass or plants grown specifically forfuel. The current bill would provide that 50 of the 125 megawatts may be provided by a fa-cility that uses poultry litter as its primary fuelsource. Fiberwatt, a company based in Great Brit- ain, is proposing to build the poultry litterplant in Minnesota. The company owns andoperates three similar power plants in GreatBritain. The facilities produce energy by burn-ing the litter at 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, pro-ducing steam that drives a turbine. Officials from the company testified that they are interested in building the plant inMinnesota because the state is the second larg-est turkey producing state in the nation. Members approved an amendment that Jennings said was a compromise addressingconcerns raised to the original bill. The origi-nal bill would have extended the deadline re-quiring the production or purchase of 125megawatts of electricity generated from bio-mass from 2002 to 2005. The amendment re-stored the original 2002 deadline. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) said that although she supported restoring thedeadline to the original date, she was con-cerned about providing a public subsidy to acompany that proposes to use a valuable stateresource when there is such a high demandfor that resource. Poultry litter is a popularfertilizer because of its high nitrogen content. Jennings said that the bill doesn 't guaran- tee that the poultry litter facility will be built,but that it would allow the Public UtilitiesCommission to review the proposal. He saidthat although biomass energy would be moreexpensive than energy generated by traditionalplants, the poultry litter proposal was impor-tant for economic development purposes inrural Minnesota. The Senate later approved the bill, which then was sent to the governor. Eventual ban on additive passes The House passed a bill April 17 that would eventually ban the use of the oxygenating ad-ditive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) ingasoline. The vote was 127-0. The measure (HF3292/SF2946*) would prohibit the sale of gasoline containing morethan one-third of 1 percent of the additiveSession Weekly 9#FAMILYafter July 1, 2000, and provide a complete ban of the additive as of July 1, 2005. The measurealso would apply to the two other similaradditives. Contained in gasoline in many states, MTBE is intended to help the environment by low-ering pollution emissions into the air. How-ever, research shows the additive is responsiblefor several incidents of ground and water con-tamination, including municipal wells in Iowa. Experts say eight ounces of the additive can contaminate 5 million gallons of drinkingwater. Spillage from a car accident couldthreaten an entire aquifer. \"This will give us one of the strongest laws in the nation, \" said the bill 's sponsor, Rep. Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea). MTBE is produced from isobutylene, a byproduct in the gasoline refining process, andmethanol, a byproduct of natural gas refin-ing. Water contaminated by the additive has abitter taste and detectable odor. Research hasshown that it causes tumors in rats. Minnesota requires that all gasoline sold in the state contain at least 2.7 percent oxygenby weight. Ethanol, derived from corn, is theadditive currently used here. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. Marriage license discount vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill April 14 that would have reduced the marriage license feesfor couples who received at least 12 hours ofpremarital education. The bill would have raised the cost of a regu- lar marriage license from $70 to $75. But forthose couples who received premarital edu-cation, the marriage license fee would havebeen only $25. The bill specified that the education topics would include teaching about the seriousnessof marriage, conflict management skills, andthe desirability of obtaining counseling if themarriage falls into difficulty later on. Couples would have had to obtain educa- tion from a clergy member, a person autho-rized by law to perform marriages, or amarriage and family therapist. Ventura said he doesn 't believe the govern- ment should have a role in marriagecounseling. \"This bill is overly intrusive and increases costs for those who choose not to receive pre-marital counseling, \" V entura wrote in his veto message. \"I understand the authors ' intent and share their concerns about our high divorcerate, however, I do not believe that govern-ment should intervene in a couple 's marital decisions. \"Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) and Sen. Steve Dille (R-Dassel) sponsored thelegislation. HF2229/SF884*/CH397 SPRING FEVER Hundreds of school kids from around the state enjoy the grassy areas of the Capitol mall onan unseasonably warm April 14.Parenting plan bill advances Parents who are getting a divorce would be allowed to create a parenting plan agreement,under a bill headed to the governor 's desk. The House approved the conference com- mittee version of the bill April 19. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL- St. Paul), the bill would allow divorced couplesto make agreements on splitting parentingtime. Currently, parenting agreements are nei-ther forbidden nor allowed in state law. \"This bill would allow parents to reinsert their own plan, \" Dawkins said. \"Why choose one parent over another parent when you havetwo good parents? \" Parenting plans could specify anything from where a child lives during the day to whichparent can teach religious philosophy or whichparent picks up the child from badmintonpractice. Child support would be a separateissue aside from parenting plans, Dawkinssaid. If both parents agree to a parenting plan, the court must accede unless the court deter-mines the plan is not in the best interest ofthe child, under the bill. If neither parentagrees to a parenting plan, the court would beallowed to create one on its own. Dawkins said the final bill that emerged from conference committee would do moreto protect victims of domestic violence. Ac- cording to the new language in the bill, courtscould not require a parenting plan if one adulthas been accused of domestic assault or sexualabuse. The court would have to ask individuals if a parenting plan was entered into voluntarily,he said. The final bill is similar to a task forcereport recommendation, he added. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) said the bill is better than the original version,which would have allowed a judge to orderparents to enter into a parenting plan agree-ment if only one parent agreed to that route. \"I'm happy it is voluntary at this point, \" Paymar said. The bill also would replace the word \"visi- tation \" in statute with the phrase \"parenting time. \" Dawkins said non-custodial parents find the word \"visitation \" to be offensive. \"It's a good start, \" Dawkins said. \"It's some- thing we can build on. \" Investigating child abuse cases A law signed April 14 by Gov. Jesse Ventura will repeal a 1999 domestic abuse law defin-ing neglect and will replace it with languageredefining counties ' responsibilities in domes- tic violence cases affecting children. The law eliminates language that required counties to investigate cases where there is anychild abuse, including verbal or other non-physical abuse. The repealed law also requiredan investigation if a child was within sight or10 April 21, 2000sound of any attempted abuse. \"It was very broad, and that 's what con- cerned me, \" said Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R- Faribault), House sponsor of the new measure. Several groups, representing those advocat- ing for domestic violence victims and countysocial service administrators, joined togetherasking legislators to repeal the law because ofits costs. Boudreau said the county adminis-trators estimated the old law would cost $30million statewide if fully implemented. The $30 million projection is based on the additional workers needed to investigate all thenew mandated cases, Boudreau said. The new language requires county investi- gation only when the parent \"endangers the child 's mental or physical health, \" the parent engages in \"repeated domestic assault, \" or the child \"witnessed repeated incidents \" of do- mestic violence. \"Counties will appreciate this, \" Boudreau said. A key part of the law, Boudreau said, states that the local welfare agency shall consider thesafety of the child and the victim when deter-mining action. Under the repealed law, a victim might have chosen to not report an abusive situation outof fear that he or she would be found in ne-glect if that person kept living with or movedback in with the abuser. \"They 'd rather be a victim than lose their child, \" Boudreau said. The new law also requires homeless shelter employees to attempt to contact the parentsof a runaway within 72 hours. The employeemust tell the parents or guardian the runaway 's location and status, unless there are compel-ling reasons to withhold that information. Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version. The specific guidelines forabuse investigations take effect July 1, 2001.The other parts of the law are effectiveApril 15, 2000. HF3176/SF3410*/CH401 #GOVERNMENT#HEALTH Designating custodians for children Parents will have more rights to designate a temporary custodian for their children, under alaw signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura on April 14. Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored the House version of the measure,which repeals the designated caregiver statuteand replaces it with the temporary and standbycustodian language. Luther said the new lawmakes it clearer what should happen to childrenin cases where the parent suddenly is not avail-able or is incapable of caring for them. \"It gives parents an opportunity to file with the court a guardian of the child if there was atragic accident or if they are going out of thecountry for an extended period, \" Luther said.\"It helps families plan ahead and reduce an unnecessary burden on governmental childprotection or foster care resources. \" The law provides more options than the repealed statute, such as outlining standby,temporary, and co-custodian guidelines. Standby custodians would assume perma- nent custody in the event of a parent 's inabil- ity to care for the child. A temporary custodianwould have the child or children for two years,up from one year in previous law. A co-custodian shares parenting duties with a par-ent when that parent has extended illnesses. The new law also gives a non-custodial par- ent more rights to decide what happens to thechild if the custodial parent becomes ill or dies,Luther said. Under the law, the non-custodialparent would automatically gain custody un-less that parent lost parental rights. The law allows both natural parents to be involved in the decision and requires a hear-ing if the fitness of a non-custodial parent iscalled into question, Luther said. The custodial parent can designate a tem- porary custodian with the consent of the otherparent, under the new law. Twenty states already have such laws in place, she added. The law originated from several fam-ily law organizations, such as the Minnesota Kin-ship Caregivers Association, Luther said. The repealed designated caregiver statute said the agreement expired four years after itwas signed. The new language designates aperson as temporary custodian indefinitely. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version. The law is effective April 15, 2000.HF3318/SF3018*/CH404 Bleacher safety changes Safety requirements for bleachers, such as those at sports facilities or local parks, will bemodified under a new law signed by the gov-ernor April 17. New safety requirements for bleachers were signed into law last year, but Gov. Jesse V enturaline-item vetoed $100,000 that would havehelped communities and school districts paythe costs of complying with the new standards. The 1999 law required bleachers that are taller than 30 inches to have gaps betweenseats, floorboards, and guardrails that do notexceed 4 inches or to have safety nets installed.The previous standard for gaps was 9 inches. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), House sponsor of the new measure, said it will easethe financial burden for schools, county fairs,and local parks departments without compro-mising safety standards.\"It will save tens of millions of dollars and still require significant upgrades to bleachersthat are unsafe, \" he said. \"I felt the law last year went further than it needed to in reacting tothe serious injuries that have occurred. \" The new law will make the 4-inch require- ment apply to bleachers that are at least 55inches (nearly 5 feet) tall. Those bleachersmust be in compliance by Jan. 1, 2002. Retractable bleachers that are in place by Jan. 1, 2001, and that meet the previous 9-inchrequirement for gaps, will be exempted fromthe 4-inch requirement. The responsibleschool district or organization will have tosubmit a safety management plan and amor-tization schedule for complying with the 4-inch standard. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), House spon- sor of the 1999 law, advocated upholding the30-inch height standard. But the House andSenate voted to accept the 55-inch standard. Smith had sponsored the 1999 measure in response to a fatal accident. Six-year-old T obyLee of Mound died in January 1999 after fall-ing from a set of bleachers while attending ahockey game at a Hutchinson arena. Smithsaid T oby fell through a 13-inch gap in thosebleachers. Bradley said no accidents have been re- ported where someone has fallen througha 9-inch gap. The requirements are applicable to all new construction and installation as of Jan. 1, 2001. Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) was the Senate sponsor of the measure. HF2846/SF3272*/CH417 Exposure to bloodborne diseases Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law April 18 that establishes procedures regarding occupationalexposure to bloodborne diseases for emer-gency medical services (EMS) personnel, cor-rections employees, and secure treatmentfacility workers. The law addresses proper procedure for ob- taining consent for testing, obtaining and test-ing blood samples for bloodborne diseases,and for informing individuals of blood testresults, in certain situations. The situations the new law will apply to in- clude cases when people holding these occu-pations are exposed to a bloodborne diseasein the course of carrying out their jobs. The measure also will expand the state 's HIV and Hepatitis B prevention program forhealth professionals to cover Hepatitis C. HIVis the virus that causes AIDS. Also, the law modifies notification require- ments that apply when emergency medicalSession Weekly 11#HIGHER EDUCATIONpersonnel are exposed to a person with active tuberculosis. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the legis-lation. The new law takes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF1631/SF1202*/CH422 #HUMAN SERVICESDesigning campus buildings Representatives of colleges, universities, and state agencies will be allowed to vote on thedesign of state buildings, under a new law thatwas signed by the governor April 13. Contracts for designing state buildings are awarded through the state Designer SelectionBoard. Under current law, the agency or school that will be using a new building appoints a non-voting member to the board, which consistsof five voting members. The board looks atdesign plans from competing firms and de-cides which firm will receive the contract. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the board will con- sist of seven voting members, including onewho will represent the school or agency thatwill be using the proposed building. Otherboard members will represent the AmericanInstitute of Architects, the Associated GeneralContractors, the Consulting Engineers Coun-cil of Minnesota (with input from other pro-fessional engineering societies in the state), theMinnesota State Arts Board , and two citizenmembers who will be appointed by the statecommissioner of the Department ofAdministration. If, for example, a building is being designed for the University of Minnesota, the univer-sity will have a vote on the final design of thebuilding. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe measure. HF3195/SF3701*/CH384 Newborn drop-off law A law signed by Gov. Jesse V entura April 18 will allow a mother (or a person of her con-sent) to leave an unharmed newborn at a hos-pital emergency room up to 72 hoursfollowing the child 's birth without fear of prosecution. A hospital will be required to accept the child and to notify a local welfare agencywithin 24 hours of the departure of the per-son bringing the baby to the hospital. Under current Minnesota law, a motherwho willfully neglects a newborn when she is reasonably able to care for the infant can becharged with a gross misdemeanor. This new law will allow the individual de- livering the unwanted newborn to exit thebuilding without providing identification. Thehospital will be allowed to ask questions aboutthe medical history of the mother or newborn,but the person leaving the baby will not berequired to provide any information. A newborn that is left behind will be con- sidered an abandoned child. The baby, accord-ing to the new law, must not have any obviousinjuries or illness in order for the hospital toaccept it. A hospital or employee of the hospital re- ceiving the child will be considered immunefrom any civil liability that could potentiallyresult, if the act of receiving the newborn isdone in good faith. Furthermore, a social service agency taking custody of the child will not be required tolater reunite the child with its parents or searchfor relatives of the child as a placementoption. Officials are uncertain how many babies hospitals could realistically expect to bedropped off as a result of the new law. Rep. Luanne Koskinen (DFL-Coon Rapids) and Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) spon-sored the legislation. The new is effectiveApril 19, 2000. HF3008/SF2615*/CH421 Options for vulnerable adults The House passed a bill April 18 that would create a panel to review decisions made by leadagencies regarding cases of potential maltreat-ment of vulnerable adults. The vote was130-0. The bill (HF3250/SF3028*), sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), would pro-vide a vulnerable adult or individual actingon behalf of such a person the opportunity tochallenge an agency 's decision before an im- partial body. \"As it stands now, the vulnerable adult or person acting on the part of the adult has noother place to appeal but to the agency thatproduced the decision, \" Greenfield said. The board the bill would create would con- sist of representatives from the Departmentof Human Services and the Department ofHealth, the ombudsman for older Minneso-tans, and the ombudsman for mental healthand mental retardation. A request for a review, the bill states, would be taken up at the panel 's next quarterly meeting. Greenfield referred to the measure as a \"quality assurance approach \" to reviewingdecisions in cases of potential maltreatment. The bill would require that within 30 days of the panel 's review, it must notify the lead agency and the person who requested the re-view of its decision. The panel may decidewhether it agrees with the agency 's decision or require the agency to reconsider its ruling. If the panel were to decide that the agency must reconsider its decision, the bill wouldrequire that it do so and report back to thepanel with its determination within 30 days. Furthermore, the panel would be required to report to the Legislature each January aboutthe number of requests for review it receivedand how the panel ruled on each case. Thereport would include the number of timeswhen the final disposition changed and anyrecommendations the panel has for improv-ing the review process. The bill now heads to a House-Senate con- ference committee. Nursing center veto override For the second time during this two-year session, the Legislature has voted to overrideone of Gov. Jesse Ventura 's vetoes. This time, the override involved a bill aimed at assuring the continued operation of the Ah-Gwah-Ching center, a nursing facility inWalker. V entura vetoed the bill April 3 and the House voted to override the veto the follow-ing day. The Senate override came April 17 andnow the bill will become law, effective Aug. 1,2000. The override is only the second successful override of a governor 's veto in the past 18 years. The Ah-Gwah-Ching center serves residents whose aggressive or difficult to manage behav-ioral needs cannot be met in their home com-munity. In his veto message, V entura said that the bill was \"unnecessary \" because law currently exists prohibiting the commissioner of theDepartment of Human Services to close thefacility without the Legislature 's approval. The governor declined to comment on the veto override during a press conferenceApril 17. In addition to language in the measure call- ing for the center to remain open, the law willclarify the admissions criteria of the facilityand require that the center promote emer-gency admittance and geriatric rapid assess-ment stabilization programs. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack) and Sen. T ony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) sponsored thelegislation. Last year the Legislature voted to override a veto by the governor of a bill pertaining to the12 April 21, 2000introduction of evidence about seat-belt use in auto accident lawsuits.

Jesse Ventura will assist Holocaust survivors in set-tling and collecting insurance claims. Aimed at insurance companies and their affiliates who do business in Minnesota andissued policies in Europe prior to 1946, thelaw allows the commissioner of the Depart-ment of Commerce to provide special assis-tance to Minnesota residents who have claimsto settle. The law allows the department to establish a registry of records of Holocaust-related in-surance policies and claims. The registry willcontain information such as a list of policiessold with the names of the insured and theirbeneficiaries, and whether the proceeds havebeen paid. Companies that fail to provide the data to assist victims and their beneficiaries could befined or have their authority to do business inthe state suspended. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), House sponsor of the legislation, said that often lifeinsurance claims require a death certificate,which for Holocaust victims is not available. He said there are about 200 Holocaust sur- vivors living in the state. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) was the Sen- ate sponsor. The law is effective April 14, 2000. HF3756/SF3423*/CH367 Access to information Public defenders will be given access to law enforcement databases, under a law signedApril 13 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The law will allow state and district public defenders, along with any attorney who isworking for a public defense corporation, lim-ited access to various criminal and juveniledatabases. \"The defense felt they should have access to information on the people they are defend-ing,\" said Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), House sponsor of the measure. \"We felt it was a fairness issue. \" Public defenders will be given access to data regarding the attorney 's client only and will not be able to examine data on other people.The defender also will not have access to ac-tive and ongoing investigative data, under thelaw.The proposal came from the State Public Defender 's Office, Broecker said.

The law allows wholesalers to sue a brewer in either state or federal court for violationsto state laws regarding the Minnesota beerbrewers and wholesalers act. The new law also gives wholesalers the right to a jury trial against brewers, and it providesthat the right to bring action may not bewaived except at the time the suit is filed. The state 's beer brewers and wholesalers laws include provisions prohibiting brewersfrom inducing or coercing wholesalers intoaccepting delivery of any alcoholic beverageor any other commodity which wasn 't ordered by the wholesaler. The laws also establish the right of free as- sociation between all brewers and wholesal-ers. Brewers cannot collaborate to fix orartificially elevate prices. Rep.

HF1947/SF1618*/CH415#LOCAL GOVERNMENT Municipal finance provisions The House passed a bill April 18 that would make a number of changes related to the state 's public finance laws. The bill vote was 97-30. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), spon- sor of the measure (HF4090/SF3730*), saidthat the bill is the annual public finance billmaking changes in the authority of local gov-ernments to issue bonds and incur debt. The bill would permit the cities of Minnetonka and Shorewood to opt out of themetropolitan transit system and establish re-placement transit systems. Abrams said thatthe city of Minnetonka brought the initiativeto him. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) offered an unsuccessful amendment to deletethat provision saying that to allow more citiesto opt out of the transit system weakens thesystem as a whole. Among the bill 's other provisions is an ex- emption in reporting requirements on busi-ness subsidy bonds that are issued by amunicipality to refund its outstanding bonds.Also, the bill would exempt nonprofit corpo-rations that qualify for federal tax-exempt sta-tus from reporting requirements on bonds. The bill also would authorize the Metropoli- tan Council to issue an additional $19.4 mil-lion of transit bonds. Abrams said that theauthority to issue $36 million was providedlast year and the additional money would ful-fill what the council originally requested.Session Weekly 13#TRANSPORTATION#VETERANSRep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) offered a successful amendment that would allowcounties outside the seven country metropoli-tan areas to form economic development au-thorities. Originally, the bill specified that onlycounties outside the federally defined 11county metro area (which includes Chisago,Isanti, Sherburne, and Wright counties) couldform economic development authorities. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) argued against the amendment saying that economicdevelopment in the metropolitan area shouldbe done looking at the area as a whole. The bill also would require bidders for the contract for the 800-megahertz public safetyradio network to propose systems that meetcompatibility standards. Then any enhancedfeatures that would affect that compatibilitymay not be accepted, according to the bill. The bill now goes to a conference committee. Right-of-way accident liability The state will have limited immunity from civil lawsuits involving recreational motor ve-hicle accidents that occur in a highway right-of-way, under a law signed April 13 by Gov.Jesse Ventura. The law will establish the state is not liable when accidents or injuries occur involvingsnowmobiles or other off-road recreationalvehicles. \"There has to be a level of responsibility on the hands of recreational vehicle users, \" said Rep.

Cost of care is based on the average costs of operating veterans ' homes. Any sales tax rebates that are paid after June 30, 1999, would not be considered income forresidents of veterans ' homes, under the bill. The bill also would allow the governing board of the veterans ' home in Hastings to use federal grant money to purchase a home tobe used as transitional housing for homelessor disabled veterans. The bill now goes to the governor.Right lane measure vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill April 20 that would have authorized the state to post signsrequesting that freeway drivers travel in theright lane when possible. The final bill, which emerged from confer- ence committee April 11, was stripped of lan-guage that made it a petty misdemeanor tonot stay to the right. The final bill also wouldnot have allowed law enforcement to pull overdrivers for failing to follow the provision.Drivers would have been asked, but not re-quired, to move to the right lane afterpassing. Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm) sponsored the bill, which would have requiredthe placement of signs every 50 miles alonghighways reminding drivers to move to theright lane after passing. \"I don 't see any reason why he would veto it,\" T omassoni said. \"I thought this would be the type of bill he would sign. \" T omassoni would not comment further until he sees the governor 's veto message.

HF3613/SF3307*/CH373noted that the bill passed in both houses by a wide margin, and an override is possible if leg-islators don 't change their votes. T omassoni has said throughout the session that his goal was to obtain signs asking peopleto move out of the left lane, and he was notpushing for the petty misdemeanor language. The signs would have stated, \"Move to the right after passing. \" The bill did not contain funding for the signs. Sen. Dick Day (R-Owatonna) sponsored the Senate version.

Jesse Ventura vetoed the contentious\"right-to-know \" abortion bill April 14. The bill would have required a woman con- sidering an abortion to wait at least 24 hoursbefore undergoing the procedure. It also wouldhave required that the woman be given infor-mation about risks and alternatives at least 24hours before the procedure is scheduled. \"I have decided that it is wrong for govern- ment to assume a role in something that I al-ways believed was between a woman, her family,her doctor and, if she chooses, her clergy, \" Ventura said when he announced the veto. Ventura said that he thought long and hard about the bill, and talked with family, friends,advisors, and the people of Minnesota beforecoming to his decision. Had the governor signed the bill, a woman would have been required to receive by mail,phone, Internet, or in person information aboutprenatal care, child support, adoption, and othermaterial about pregnancy and community sup-port services prior to having an abortion.Veto rankles 'informedconsent' backers After days of deliberation, Ventura vetoes a bill that wouldhave required a 24-hour waiting period before a womancould have an abortionAT ISSUE: HEALTH # # # The decision by the governor to veto the measure drew criticism from pro-life organi-zations and House Republican leaders. In a news release issued after the governor announced his veto, House Speaker SteveSviggum called Ventura 's decision \"very upsetting. \" He noted that V entura 's staff had appeared to have worked out a compromise with HouseRepublican leadership over the bill, prior tothe announcement of the veto. \"Ironically, Gov. Ventura talks about not being your typical politician. This action lookstoo much like the worst of a politician: Goback on your campaign promises, don 't honor your word through anegotiated agreement,and bend to powerfulspecial interest grouppressure, \" Sviggum said. The measure was similar to languageproposed earlier thissession by Rep. LyndaBoudreau (R-Faribault) calling for awoman to give her in-formed consent priorto an abortion. That provision was included in the largerstate government ap- propriations bill (HF2699), currently in con-ference committee. The abortion-relatedprovision was later pulled from the bill afterHouse members suggested taking policy issuesout to avoid constitutional challenges to theomnibus bill. The language was then amended onto a separate (and relatively minor) measure dur-ing an early April floor session in the House. The bill would have waived a 24-hour wait- ing period for cases when a woman 's life orhealth may be put in danger by delaying the procedure. The bill did not include an earlier proposal that the name of the doctor performing theprocedure be included with the informationgiven to the patient. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) sponsoredthe vetoed bill. Any override attempt of the veto would have to begin in the Senate. An override requires atwo-thirds majority in both houses \u2014 90 votes in the House and 45 votes in the Senate. The first time through, the House voted 89- 44 and the Senate voted 37-30 in support ofthe measure. HF3652/SF3387*/CH412 Gov. Ventura's remarks to staff on the veto of the abortion waiting period Good Afternoon. It's been a remarkable few days. You have all worked very hard and for the past week have been under constant stress. For yourhard work and your tremendous loyalty to thisoffice, the people of Minnesota, and to me, I wantto thank you. From the bottom of my heart, I wantyou to know how important you all are to me. Yesterday, a legislator who has been around this business for many years told me that no gov-ernor over the last 20 years has been faced witha decision like the one I have been faced with thispast week. But you have served me well. I am proud of you and proud of the way we have come togetherto make this very important decision. I have talked to family, friends, and advisors. I have heard from the good people of Minnesota.And listening to the people has brought me backto the convictions that have always been the cen-terpiece of my administration. Convictions likepersonal responsibility, self sufficiency, and lim-ited government. Therefore I have decided. I decided that those deeply held convictions would not allow me tosign this bill. I have decided that it is wrong forgovernment to assume a role in something thatI always believed was between a woman, her fam-ily, her doctor, and, if she chooses, her clergy. And so today I vetoed Senate File 3387.Sure, we tried to find a way. Together, we were willing to explore whether an acceptable billcould be achieved. And we learned something.We learned that there is no middle ground here.And so now we move on. Thank you for bearing with me, because after all this, I want you to know that I still believe work-ing together . . . we will not fail. Thank you.

Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) got her first taste of politics in her own south Minne-apolis neighborhood where she and her neigh-bors worked to close an adult bookstore. After 10 years in the Legislature, Wejcman plans to return her focus to helping neighborsand strengthening her community. Wejcman, 60, a native of Spencer, Iowa, moved to the Twin Cities for the first time in 1961, thenwent back to Iowa before making a permanentmove to south Minneapolis 10 years later. She has lived in the same home with her husband, Jim, for the past 25 years. It wasn 't long after she moved to Minneapolis when shebecame involved in trying to close the adultbookstore because, she said, the shop drewunwanted people to the neighborhood who harassed neighborhood residents. \"We did a lot of picketing and protesting, \" Wejcman recalls. \"It was meant to let (the own- ers) know that neighbors didn 't appreciate it. \" That focus on community improvement is where Wejcman 's future lies. She started think- ing about leaving the Legislature and focusingon community issues after the 1998 election. \"Being in the minority was so different. I started to think, could I get more done work-ing with people rather than trying to passBack to her roots After 10 years, Rep. Linda Wejcman is leaving the House toreturn to her pursuits in her south Minneapolis communityPEOPLE # # # laws? \" Wejcman said. \"I think building com- munity is the best possible thing I can do now. \" Wejcman wants to work on drug and gang issues, and to help people become \"positive attributes \" to the community. \"I want to help people understand the good- ness in themselves and work on that, \" she said. While her urban district faces poverty and crime problems, Wejcman is upbeat about thesmart and determined youth of her commu-nity. She speaks passionately about how theyoung people in her district are opening theirminds to their own abilities to improve con-ditions in the area. \"Our district is so exciting, just because of the diversity, \" she says. During her tenure in the Legislature, Wejcman focused on health and human service issues. She backed an unsuccess-ful effort to create aconsumer protectionoffice where peoplecould call careprovider or healthmaintenance organi-zation. \"People don 't know where to go for help, \" Wejcman said. \"This would have been anoffice with realpower. \" Wejcman spon- sored a 1997 bill thatestablished a fathers ' registry for people who believe they may bethe father of a child who may be offered foradoption. The registry provides that the manwill be notified of a pending adoption and willhave a chance to argue for his right to custodyin a court hearing. Fathers who do not register within a certain time lose their right to later challenge an adop-tion. The goal is to allow adoptive parents to besure that the adoption will not be overturnedlater by an absent biological parent.In 1997, Wejcman was named speaker pro tempore, which meant she assumed the roleof the speaker when then-Speaker PhilCarruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) left thepodium. She also served as head of the Min-neapolis delegation in the Legislature. Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), who serves a district that neighbors Wejcman 's, spoke highly of Wejcman 's commitment to helping others. \"She's worked hard to empower people in south Minneapolis, \" Clark said. \"She has a good sense of humor. I think she brings peopletogether. \" Clark cited work on human services, cur- tailing prostitution, improving housing, andthe patients ' bill of rights proposal as Wejcman 's chief marks in the Legislature. Although Wejcman comes from an urban district, she jumped at the opportunity toserve on an agriculture committee this year.She cited the parallels between her district andrural Minnesota \u2014 arguing that people in both areas share economic, employment, andenvironmental concerns. Rep. T ed Winter (DFL-Fulda) worked with Wejcman on the House Agriculture PolicyCommittee. He said she \"is giving people a helping hand up and out of poverty. \" \"Her sense of caring and her realistic ap- proach to legislation \" are her memorable at- tributes, Winter said. \"She's always been positive, always up front. \" Even if the DFL were to regain majority sta- tus in the House in the November elections,Wejcman said she wouldn 't regret her deci- sion to leave. \"My decision was, it 's time to move on and do some more hands-on work, \" she said, re- flecting on her decade at the Capitol. \"For me, that's long enough. \" STEPPING DOWN Rep. Linda Wejcman DFLDistrict 61B - MinneapolisTerms : 5 Career notes : Perhaps the best known legislation Wejcman sponsored was a1997 measure that created a registry formen who believe they may be thefather of a child that could be placed foradoption. The aim was to prevent caseswhere a biological father comes on thescene much later and tries to overturnan adoption. 16 April 21, 2000PEOPLE # # # BY JON FURE After serving three terms in the House, Rep. Jim Rostberg (R-Isanti) will not seekre-election. He said his decision to leave is not related to a criminal sexual conduct charge pendingagainst him. He has maintained his innocencein the case. Rather, the 43-year-old Isanti man said he is leaving largely because he and his wife,Kathy, plan to start a family business. Rostberg said he will have fond memories of the six years he has spentas a lawmaker, but that hewants to dedicate more timeto life in the private sector. \"It was never my intent to become a career politician, \" Rostberg said. When he first ran for of- fice, he felt that he had somegood ideas that could ben-efit the state, Rostberg said. At the end of his legisla- tive career, he lists as one ofhis proudest accomplish-ments a bill related to prop-erty taxes that he originallysponsored in 1996. The pro-posal was passed into law in1997 with the help ofRep. Ron Abrams(R-Minnetonka), now thechair of the House TaxesCommittee and long a Re-publican leader on taxissues. The law allows business owners to negoti- ate a property tax abatement to help themexpand their business. The idea came from aconstituent of Rostberg 's who wanted to ex- pand his business and increase staff, but theexpected higher property taxes made the planinfeasible. Under the law, a city, county, or school dis- trict governing board can reduce the tax onthe property that is expanded for up to 10Exiting under a cloud Rostberg says his business pursuits and other interestsprompted his decision to leave, not the criminal chargepending against him years, provided that it would accomplish aspecified public purpose, such as economicdevelopment and job creation. Rostberg said the law makes sense because a business doesn 't realize an immediate profit in that situation. It allows the business to ex-pand and get established before paying thehigher property tax. Such an abatement is ne-gotiated through public hearings, he said, sothat people in a community can speak for oragainst such a proposal. He noted that the measure was significant to him because he helpedthe bill become law eventhough his party was in theminority. \"I've never had a problem working with members ofeither caucus, \" he said. \"They 're all professional, and they do a good job rep-resenting their districts. IfI don 't see eye-to-eye with someone on an issue, that 's not something I take per-sonally. \" This year, Rostberg 's life and political career took aturn nobody could have ex-pected. He was arrestedMarch 2 in the Capitol andcharged in Isanti Countythe next day. Rostberg is facing one count of second-degreecriminal sexual conduct inIsanti County, but he has repeatedly said that is not the reason for hisdecision to not seek re-election. He said he hadalready been contemplating leaving the Leg-islature at the end of this term. According to the criminal complaint, Rostberg is accused of engaging in criminalsexual contact with a girl under 16. Rostberg was originally charged with three counts, but two were dropped after prosecu-tors determined there was not enough evi-dence to support them. He now faces a single criminal count for allegedly fondling the girl. A House Ethics Committee probe into the allegations was delayed earlier this sessionuntil criminal proceedings are complete. Thatis unlikely to occur before the 2000 Legisla-ture adjourns. Addressing his colleagues on the House floor, Rostberg said he is innocent but that he couldnot comment further on the criminal case. Looking back on his career, Rostberg said the ability to negotiate and the willingness tohear views from all sides are among the mostimportant qualities for being a successfullawmaker. \"Y ou need to be reasonable, able to negoti- ate, and willing to negotiate, \" he said. \"Yo u have to have an open door, and to allow inputfrom all sides, and there 's usually many sides. And you have to be able to accept criticism, aswell as accolades. If you can 't do that, you won't be successful here. \" Rostberg currently is the vice chair of the House Governmental Operations and Veter-ans Affairs Policy Committee, and he also serves on the Agriculture Policy, Agriculture and Rural Development Finance, and Envi-ronment and Natural Resources Policycommittees. When the Legislature is not in session, Rostberg works as a veterans service officerand emergency management director forIsanti County. A 1999 law that Rostberg sponsored with bipartisan support set up a training programfor 13 local fire and rescue departments alongthe upper Mississippi River in central Minne-sota, so that those departments can effectivelyrespond to oil spills in the river. Quick re-sponses are necessary in cleaning up thosespills, he said, and the program could be ex-panded to other parts of the state. STEPPING DOWN Rep. Jim RostbergRepublicanDistrict 18A - IsantiTerms : 3 Career notes : Rostberg has worked on veterans issues and environmentalmatters. In his final term, he was namedvice chair of the House GovernmentalOperations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee.Session Weekly 17PEOPLE # # # BY DAVID MAEDARep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) came to the Legislature in 1984 with a slightly different background from many of her colleagues who areattorneys, farmers, or business owners.A mind for policy Long a leader on tax issues, Rest combined background as anaccountant and teacher to push for reforms as House member northwest Crystal, and part of Golden Valley.The Senate district includes all of Crystal, NewHope, Robbinsdale, and a portion of Brook-lyn Center. Rest said she 'll miss the day-to-day relation- ships with many of her House colleagues butshe hopes to continue working on many ofthe same issues she has been involved withover the years. She said she is most proud of working on the following achievements as a member of the House: reforms tothe state 's DWI en- forcement laws, tight-ening the restrictionson youth access to to-bacco products, andseveral tax related ini-tiatives including thestate 's working family credit and reforms totax-increment financelaws. Among her ongoing priorities, Rest said, isfinding adequate andstable funding forpublic education \u2014 which means finding amethod to take educa-tion funding off of theproperty tax. The edu-cation homesteadcredit, which she helped establish, is one step in that direction,Rest said. In a way, Rest has come full circle as a House member. \"I came here in my first term as a member of the minority, and I 'm going to leave as a member of the minority, \" she said.In between that time, as a member of the majority, Rest served as chair of the HouseTaxes Committee and, later, the House LocalGovernment and Metropolitan Affairs Com-mittee. She said being a member of the mi-nority party doesn 't necessarily mean not having an impact on the process. \"When one is willing to work on a biparti- san basis, a member can be effective in influ-encing public policy whether in the majorityor the minority, \" she said. \"I haven 't stopped offering legislation since I 've been in the minority. \" Among her colleagues who hold Rest in high esteem is the current chair of the TaxesCommittee, Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka). Abrams ended the final TaxesCommittee hearing this year by recognizingRest's contributions and accomplishments. \"You made the committee absolutely the best committee to serve on, \" Abrams told Rest. Abrams said that both as the ranking mem- ber from the minority party on the commit-tee and as tax chair, Rest was respectful of allmembers. \"She treated all members with equality re- gardless of their party designation, \" Abrams said. \"She made her decisions as the tax chair based on what was good tax policy. She waswilling to listen to and understand your pointof view. \" Abrams said he has the highest respect for Rest and will miss serving with her. \"She brings a centrist perspective that is so rare in these days of extreme partisan bicker-ing,\" he said. STEPPING DOWN Rep. Ann H. Rest DFLDistrict 46A - New HopeTerms : 8 Career notes : A former chair of the House Taxes Committee, Rest is widelyrespected as an expert in tax policy,and she sponsored several key taxreform measures during her time inthe House.With degrees in Latin, Greek, English, teach- ing, and accounting from a variety of institu-tions including Northwestern University, theUniversity of Chicago, Harvard University,and the University of Minnesota, Rest spentnine years as a teacher in the Robbinsdale areaschool system. Rest was primarily an English and literature teacher with the district. She said declining enrollment in the school district led her to make a career switch to an-other service occupa-tion, working as acertified public ac-countant. And because of her growing interest andinvolvement in her po-litical party 's activities, along with her back-ground in educationand taxes, she then de-cided to run for a seatin the Legislature. Now with her 16 years of experience as amember of the House,Rest, 58, said she hasdecided to change di-rection again. Last winter she an- nounced her decisionto run for her district 's state Senate seat cur-rently held by Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge(DFL-New Hope). Junge, an assistant major-ity leader in the Senate, has decided not to runfor another term. \"I see it as an opportunity to serve a wider constituency, \" Rest said. Her current district covers all of New Hope,18 April 21, 2000HISTORY # # # BY JON FURE Conflicts between politicians and the press have been common throughout history, butthose conflicts today seem tame compared to onethat occurred in Minnesota 's territorial days. That conflict was between Jane Grey Swisshelm, outspoken editor of the St. Cloud Visiter , and Sylvanus Lowry, a prominent busi- nessman and politician in that area. Swisshelm 's editorials caused such animos- ity that her printing press was destroyed by afew angry community members. Nevertheless,she was able to continue publishing her con-troversial editorials as other area residents ral-lied together on her behalf. Before moving to Minnesota in 1857, Swisshelm had been a school teacher, editor,and writer in Pittsburgh. She had moved tothe St. Cloud area after separating from herhusband. She moved to the territory to live near her sister and brother-in-law, George F. Brott.Brott was a recent settler and business ownerwho had bought a printing press, hoping topublish a newspaper that would promote thetown and induce immigration. Brott asked Swisshelm if she would become the editor, and she agreed under one condi-tion. She told Brott that she \"could not edit a paper in which I had not full liberty to expressmy sentiments on any question. \" Brott replied that she could \"talk any kind of politics she had a mind to. \" She spelled out some of her main views in her first editorial on Dec. 10, 1857, includingequal rights for women and the abolition ofslavery \u2014 two topics she had written vehe- mently about for many years. On the subject of voting, for example, she wrote, \"Paying taxes is as unwomanly as vot- ing; and is a privilege which should be exclu-sively confined to 'white male citizens, of this and other countries. '\" She also wrote about the quality of the ag- ricultural land in the area and encouragedpeople from New England to consider settlingPressing for change Early Minnesota editor's views forced confrontation withpolitical powerhouse and vandals to keep newspaper alive in central Minnesota. The Visiter was struggling financially, as advertising revenue was falling far short ofBrott 's costs to produce the paper. So in the spring of 1858, Swisshelm set out to find otherlocal businessmen to invest in the newspaper,because she felt that they stood to benefit fi-nancially from the paper 's role in bringing in new settlers. When Swisshelm approached Lowry, he re- fused to contribute any money, because he op-posed Swisshelm 's political views. Lowry had come to Minnesota from T ennessee, and he spe-cifically opposed her aboli-tionist position, according toNewspapers on the Minne-sota Frontier , a 1967 book by George S. Hage. Swisshelm responded by declaring that she wouldchange her views to sup-port those of Lowry, andadvocate the re-election ofPresident James Buchanan. She explained the switch by writing that she wassimply doing what wasnecessary to stay in busi-ness. Swisshelm wrote, \"[W]hat was the use of our keeping up a 'factious op- position ' like the little stick trying to turn the course of a great river. It isnice for women to be gentle and yielding, es-pecially if there is money to be made by it. \". . . Self interest suggested that our fortune would be about made if we could support Mr.Buchanan. We thought the matter over fiveminutes and concluded that maybe we couldif we tried. \" Despite her claims to support the prevail- ing political views, the obvious sarcastic toneof her editorial showed through \u2014 for ex- ample, she endorsed Buchanan for the elec-tion of 1260 instead of 1860.Those and other editorials prompted Lowry 's attorney, James C. Shepley, to give a public lecture on the role of women. Withoutnaming Swisshelm, he said that there was acertain type of woman \"with whom some of us poor males as yet scarce feel at ease \u2014 the strong-minded woman . . . to enter the bitterinvective and competition of politics. \" After the lecture, Swisshelm wrote that Shepley neglected to describe another type ofwoman, which many people interpreted as adescription of Shepley 's wife. Swisshelm described that type as \"thick- skinned, \" \"coarse, \" \"loud-mouthed, \" \"whose conversational tones are audible at the furthestside of the next square, \" and whose triumphs consist of \"card-table successes, displays of cheap finery, and in catching marriageablehusbands for herself and her poor relations. \" That editorial appeared March 18, 1858, and on March 24, vandals broke into Swisshelm 's office, destroyed the print-ing press and threw its partsinto the Mississippi River. A note was left, signed by the \"Committee of Vigi- lance, \" saying the Visiter was a nuisance and that \"it is fit only for the inmates ofbrothels, and you seem tohave had some experienceof the tastes of such per-sons. Y ou will never havethe opportunity to repeatthe offence in this town,without paying a more se-rious penalty than you donow. \" Swisshelm 's supporters gathered that night andpassed a resolution at a Stearns County meeting, stating that theywould not tolerate the attempt to stifle freespeech and that they would purchase newequipment to allow the continued publicationof the Visiter . News of the vigilantes ' action spread quickly, and it was condemned in variousMinnesota newspaper articles that were re-printed in other states. Shepley and others sued Swisshelm and Brott 's company for libel, and they settled out of court. Continued on page 22 Jane Grey SwisshelmSession Weekly 19HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking new laws, vetoes Once a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23). This information is also available on the governor's Web site (www.governor.state.mn.us).Select the *The legislative bill marked with an asterisk denotes the file submitted to the governor.APRIL 14 - 20 CHAPTERS 390 - 431 390 3554 3138* Veterans Affairs commissioner duties technical changes provided.4/14/00 391 3424 3346* Electronic filing of real estate documents established.4/14/00 392 3597 2795* State investments modified.4/14/00393 3328 2877* Iron Range off-highway vehicle recreation area addition in St. Louis County provided. 4/14/00 394 3075 2655 Insurance tax laws recodified.4/14/00 395 3066 2783* Secretary of State fees and annual corporate registrations regulated.4/14/00396 3260 2968* Lake improvement district provisions modified.4/14/00 397 2229 884* Reduced marriage license fee provided for couples who obtain premarital counseling.4/14/00 398 3964 3626* Comprehensive Health Association eligibility and coverage modified.4/14/00399 1394 1495* Uniform Commercial Code secured transactions provisions adopted.4/14/00 400 1662 1896* Medical assistance programs definition additional powers authorized.4/14/00 403 3519 2794* Expedited child support process provisions modified.4/14/00 404 3318 3018* Standby and levies regulated.4/14/00 406 304 173* Possession of wild animals taken on the Red Lake Indian Reservation authorized.4/14/00 407 2570 3259* Energy code rules to remain in effect for specified residential buildings.4/13/00408 3512 3108* Local and state correctional facility inmate telephone access regulated.4/14/00 409 2731* 2753 Motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors, and factory branches unfair practices regulated.4/14/00 410 2935 2363* Dental benefit plans regulated.4/14/00411 3825 3338* police departments annual insurance cap established.4/14/00 Abortion informed provisions CH SF _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Eighth Air Force Week designated.4/14/00 415 1947 1618* Brewer and wholesaler judicial remedies modified.4/17/00 416 2791 2471* Hennepin County Human Resources Board and department provisions modified.4/17/00 417 2846 3272* Bleacher safety building code requirements modified.4/17/00418 3234 3091* Sales and use tax law recodified.4/18/00 419 1834 1699* Electronic funds transfers and credit card payments to state agencies authorized.4/18/00 420 3495 2972* State purchases open bidding authorized.4/18/00421 3008 2615* Persons leaving unharmed newborns at hospital emergency rooms not prosecuted.4/18/00 422 1631 1202* Protocol established for pathogens.4/18/00 423 2555 1733* Civil third-party liability imposed for damages caused by intoxicated persons under age 21.4/18/00424 3901* 3769 Housing finance agency community rehabilitation grants and loans authorized.4/20/00 425 3091 2484* Motor vehicles required to be driven in the right-hand lane clarified.4/20/00 426 2953 3023* Vehicle registration and titling provisions modified.4/20/00427 2973 2870* regulated.4/20/00 2889 2683* Bowfishing archery bows exempted from casing requirement.4/20/00 429 2671* 2567 Temporary census employee income excluded from public assistance eligibility determinations.4/20/00430 2563* 2381 Mechanics' lien civil cause of action created.4/20/00 431 2830* 2771 Pimps and patrons of juvenile prostitution provided enhanced criminal penalties.4/20/00 districts to choose between the Profile and a second option to assess student achievement,called the North Star Standard. House con-ferees are also pushing for a moratorium onholding students accountable until certainconditions can be met. The Senate has proposed to allow school districts the freedom to vote on the numberof content standards students must completeto demonstrate understanding. Health and human services State welfare recipients could be forced to forfeit their entire welfare checks if they failto comply with work rules tied to MinnesotaFamily Investment Program (MFIP)eligibility. A provision that would cut off benefits to parents who repeatedly fall into noncompli-ance is contained in the omnibus state gov-ernment spending bill (HF2699) currently inconference committee. The provision proposes spending $160 mil- lion in surplus federal funds earmarked for anoverhaul of the state 's welfare system for pro- grams to prevent teen prostitution and to aidhard-to-employ parents. Disabled people on Medicare under age 65 stand to benefit from a provision to expandeligibility for the state 's senior prescription drug program. The measure is also containedin the omnibus state government spendingbill. The provision also would make more peopleeligible to receive help paying for drugs by doubling the asset limit for inclusion in theprogram. A sliding enrollment fee for indi-viduals a certain percentage above the federalpoverty level would also be created. Felony DWI A conviction for a fourth drunken driving offense in 10 years would be a felony under abill (HF2995/SF2677*) currently in confer-ence committee. How to pay for increased stresses on jails and prisons is the main difference thatremains. The Senate version has a one-year sunset date if funding is not provided for more jail andprison space. The House measure would not takeeffect until 2001, giving the next Legislature timeto figure out spending proposals. Wolf management A bill that would establish a state plan to manage the gray wolf population was passedby the House, but the bill was modified by theSenate and attached to another bill related tothe environment. The wolf management plan would allow people to shoot a wolf in defense of a humanlife, and to trap wolves under certain condi-tions in areas where wolves have destroyedlivestock. The number of wolves in the statehas exceeded the federal requirements forkeeping the animal on the list of Endangeredand Threatened Wildlife and Plants. A conference committee had agreed to astate plan that would allow the wolf to be re- moved from the list, and the House approvedthat bill (HF1415), but the Senate rejected itand sent it back conference committee. The Senate later made slight changes to the wolf-management language and attached theplan to a bill that would increase hunting andfishing fees (HF3046), which had already beenpassed by the House. That bill now must return to the House. Unicameral dead The governor 's proposed switch to a one- chamber, or unicameral, Legislature is appar-ently dead. House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) has been a proponent of the measure, whichwould put the question before voters as a con-stitutional amendment. The first bill (HF159), sponsored by Sviggum, stalled in committee earlier this ses-sion. Sviggum introduced another bill(HF4147) last week that included the measure,but he was unable to get the bill sent directlyto the House Rules Committee as he wished.The bill awaits a hearing in the House Gov-ernmental Operations and Veterans AffairsPolicy Committee. Natural resources amendment Another proposal to increase funding for natural resources projects would put a con-stitutional amendment before voters in the2000 election. The amendment would divert three-Continued from page 4.Session Weekly 21sixteenths of 1 percent of sales tax revenue to pay for various environmental improvements,including fish and wildlife resource enhance-ment and improvement. That bill (HF3426)awaits action in the House Ways and MeansCommittee. Auto glass incentives The governor signed a law April 6 that lim- its rebates from auto glass companies to $35. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) said the law (HF2656*/SF3441/CH342) was needed be-cause some glass companies were giving away$200 rebates and boxes of free steaks to lurecustomers, then passing the costs on to insur-ance companies. Newborn drop-off Women can leave an unharmed newborn at a hospital up to 72 hours after the child isborn without fear of prosecution, under a lawsigned April 18 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The law (HF3008/SF2615*/CH421) came as a result of cases where babies were abandoned\u2014 including one left in a dumpster \u2014 caus- ing death or serious injury.Sex offender registration Ventura signed \"Katie 's Law, \" which will re- quire some sex offenders to be registered forlife. More penalties are added for offenderswho fail to register. The law also provides$12 million for startup costs for a statewidecriminal justice information database. The law came as a result of the kidnapping and apparent murder of 19-year-old KatiePoirier. The man accused of killing her is arepeat sex offender. Feedlot rules A bill that would ease a set of new feedlot rules proposed in December by the Minne-sota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) is onits way to the governor 's desk. The measure (HF3692) would give specific instruction to the agency on how the rulesshould be amended before final adoption. The bill would also require that action on permits be taken within 60 days, and prohibitthe MPCA from imposing additional condi-tions as part of a feedlot permit after the pro-posed rules are adopted.Right-to-know bill vetoed A bill requiring a 24-hour waiting period and written consent before a woman couldobtain an abortion was vetoed by VenturaApril 14. The bill (HF3652/SF3387*/CH412) would have also required that the woman be giveninformation about risks and alternatives atleast 24 hours before the procedure isscheduled. Background checks for aides The fate of a bill that would require unli- censed teaching assistants to undergo crimi-nal background checks before being hiredremains uncertain. The bill (HF3402) awaitsa vote in the House. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), sponsor of the bill, said that any increase in studentsafety would greatly outweigh any delay in thehiring process that could result if the bill be-comes law. ReflectionsDuring annual rites ofspring, swallows returnto California 's Mission San Juan Capistrano,Japanese cherry blos-soms in the nation 's capi- tal peak in late March,and robins build theirnests in most states. In Minnesota, it 's around the time \"cabin fever \" subsides \u2014 which waned early this year. Or, for some,spring comes at the end of the legislativesession. But the second year of the 81st Session continues. And the Legislature plans to be in session the week after Easter. Since April 19 was the110th legislative day of this session, the Legis-lature now has 10 legislative days to completeits work. The Legislature must close by mid-night of the 120th legislative day or May 22this year, whichever comes first. Around the state, rites of spring happen earlier. Up north in District 2A, a constitu-ent of Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston),Eric moved annualsand perennials from the Bergeson Nurserygreenhouses so local residents in and nearthe city of Fertile can prepare their summergardens.Down in southwestern Minnesota, in Dis- trict 22B, Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson)had as many as 175 constituents attend anannual Horticulture Day at the Universityof Minnesota Research and Outreach Ser-vice in the city of Lamberton. There theylearned the latest in vegetable and fruit gar-dening, from growing hostas and other pe-rennials to organic gardening. And across the river from the Capitol in south Minneapolis District 63B where Rep.Mark Gleason (DFL-Mpls) resides, a trans-planted Iowa farmboy has already tested thetime \"to plant. \" According to him, each year, he exercises a rite of spring his fathertaught him. During a full moon and after midnight, he sits on the ground. If it is not cold anddamp, the time is right. The ritual mustwork, for the ex-Iowan has the most prolificflower garden in the area. For many, \"true\" spring does not really come to the Capitol until the diverse, an-nual flowers are in place throughout thecomplex. According to groundskeeper RickRauen, some 12,000 annuals are plantedeach year, while thousands of daffodils, tu-lips, roses and other perennials greet theseason of rebirth on their own.Others believe the blossoming and green- ing of the trees are the most significantdesignations of springtime. And tree plant-ing by Rauen and his staff is part of thatprocess. Recently, Rauen planted some tamarack trees and a Kentucky coffee tree to add tothe exterior beauty of the area. As theygrow, the new trees will replace two oldgreen spruce trees south of the State OfficeBuilding that groundskeepers expect couldget lost to a storm. Some donated trees of note include the red splendor flowering crab trees discov-ered and introduced by Bergeson 's grand- father, Melvin Bergeson, in 1948. Theirlustrous pink blossoms also add beauty tothe nation 's capital at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Arts. Other species are a red oak donated by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD),a white spruce, a white pine, and a Sapporoelm. Unlike the 95 Dutch elm trees that stillmanage to grace the Capitol lawn, theSapporo is invulnerable to critical attacksby the elm beetle. Lawmakers will end session and go home soon, but the stalwart beauty of the Capitol 's trees, flowers, and deeply carpeted greenlawn will remain for all to relish. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERT 22 April 21, 2000APRIL 14 - 20 , 2000 HOUSE FILES 4154 - 4161 BILL INTRODUCTIONS # # # Monday, April 17 HF4154\u2014Lenczewski (DFL) Governmental Operations &Veterans Affairs Policy Gifts to legislators from interested per- sons prohibited.

Part of the settlement was that Swisshelm would not continue towrite about the incident in theVisiter . Her response was to close the Visiter and start a new publi- cation, called the St. Cloud Demo- crat.

Upon their return to the Capitol, things re- mained at a relative standstill as the House andSenate continued to disagree over spendingand tax cut priorities. Though they seem to be coming closer, they still haven 't reached an agreement. On April 26, the House leadership made what Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) saidwas its sixth offer to the Senate leadership fi- nally agreeing to the overall budget number of $549 million. That is the figure the state De-partment of Finance has said is the numberavailable per year for spending and tax cutsthat will keep the budget in structural balance. \"We have removed the last roadblock to permanent tax cuts for the taxpayers of Min-nesota, \" he said. House leadership has maintained that the $549 million amount is too small, pointing toDeadline crunch House leaders accept Finance Department numbers, butthere is still disagreement about major tax cut and spendinginitiatives as constitutional deadlines approach 17 consecutive budget forecasts that have un-derestimated the amount of the state 's rev- enue. In agreeing to accept the $549 millionfigure, Sviggum said that the House wouldrequire that most of the money be used forpermanent tax cuts. The session, having now completed its 13th week, can end no later than May 22, if the Legis-lature doesn 't run out of legislative days before then. It could be the first time in recent yearsthat the Legislature has used the entire 120 leg-islative days it is allowed under the MinnesotaConstitution. Legislative days are those on whicheither the House or Senate meets in full session. As of April 27, the Legislature hadused 113 legislativedays. Though it seems like the 2000 ses-sion is dragging onlonger than mostas the House sessions nia, example,the Legislatureused 109 legislativedays in 1997-1998,113 days in 1995-1996, 106 days in 1993-1994, and 100 days in 1991-1992. The even-year session has started and ended at various times over the past decade. Leader-ship of the House and Senate determine theschedule that will be used in the second yearof the biennium. In 1998, for example, the ses-sion opened Jan. 20 and adjourned April 9,which was 13 weeks. This year, the session didnot start until Feb. 1, 2000. The Legislature met only every other yearbefore a 1972 constitutional amendment allowed for the current biennial system. Traditionally, the first year, or odd-num- bered year, of the session has been devoted tosetting budgets for state agencies, constitu-tional offices, the Legislature, and the judicialbranch of state government. The second yearhas been devoted to establishing a list of con-struction and repair projects to be paid for byselling bonds. The second year of the sessionalso has usually included supplemental spend-ing for costs that were unforeseen in the pre-vious budget year. Bonding and spending bills are now being held up until leaders reach an agreement. Buttheir discussions have been primarily tangledin disagreements over permanent tax cuts. The House 's latest proposal would still re- duce income tax rates in all three brackets. Theupper and lower brackets would be reducedby 0.3 percent while the middle bracket wouldreceive a 0.55 percent reduction. An additionalone-eighth percent reduction in each bracketwould occur contingent on a positive Novem-ber forecast, Sviggum said. In its original tax plan the House proposed reducing the rates in the upper and lowerbrackets by 0.5 percent and in the middlebracket by 0.75 percent. As a condition to the House 's acceptance of the $549 million figure, Sviggum said that theHouse would also require that the state use$340 million of the tobacco settlement rev-enue for a three-year \"holiday \" from the health care provider tax. The provider tax is used to fund MinnesotaCare, the state-paid health insur-ance program for low-income families. Therate of the tax on health care providers isscheduled to increase from 1.5 percent to2 percent next year. Sviggum said that because the tax is ulti- mately imposed on those in need of healthcare, it is one of the state 's worst taxes. The House proposal also includes $40 mil- lion in spending for the already passed crimebill and for debt service, leaving an additional$45 million for other ongoing spendingmeasures. Also, the House is proposing to provide one- time funding of $350 million for transporta-tion projects, $141 million for K-12 education,and $11.6 million for higher education initia-tives. The House 's proposal also includes $500 million for bonding and cash capital projects. In an effort to move the budget negotiations closer to resolution, House SpeakerSteve Sviggum, joined by other House Republican leaders, announces April 26they will agree with Senate leaders and Gov. Jesse Ventura and accept the De-partment of Finance numbers regarding money available for tax cuts and spend-ing. Sviggum said House leadership still advocates using most of the moneyavailable for permanent tax cuts.4 April 28, 2000IT'SAFACT The politics of Prohibition marred the career of Ambrose Lennon, a Minneapolisman who spent a total of 16 years in theLegislature. Lennon became the center of a months- long melodrama that was caused by hisstanding in a seemingly innocuous frater-nal organization. A longtime member of hiscommunity 's Eagles lodge, the legislator was, in his own words, \"pressed into the position of trustee when I personally wouldhave avoided it. \" His wish to have avoided becoming a trustee could only have grown after thelodge was raided and several employees andofficials were arrested for illegal liquor sales. Undercover agents had applied to be- come members of the lodge and were ac-cepted into the group quickly andwhole-heartedly. With the trust of their\"brothers, \" the agents then watched the widespread sale of bootleg booze. Theyclaimed to have been witness to more than3,000 sales of alcoholic beverages. When the law eventually swooped in, nine bartenders were arrested, along withall officers and trustees of the lodge. Lennonwas not present when the raid took place,but he was among those later arrested andcharged. All were convicted. The bartenders each got eight months in jail, and the lodge offi-cials also went to jail. Lennon, who ap-pealed his conviction, was the loneexception. With his case on appeal, Lennon contin- ued his work in the Minnesota Senate,much to the chagrin of some of his col-leagues. Led by Sen. Victor Lawson, an ef-fort began to oust Lennon or to shame himinto resigning. \"I have nothing personally against [Lennon], but I do want to state that hiscontinued presence here has been a disgraceto this Senate and you know it, \" Lawson said. \" . . . It surely can be of little satisfac- tion personally for him to be here with thiscloud hanging over him. \" In January 1927, Lawson introduced a resolution asking Lennon to resign fromoffice. The Senate Elections Committeedelayed action on the matter for weeks be-fore finally voting that it should be deferred until the court ruled on Lennon 's appeal. \"I give notice that if he comes back next session, whether he goes to jail or not inthe meantime, and attempts to sit as amember of this Senate, the proceedings tooust him will be renewed, \" Lawson said. And Lawson would get that chance.In the 1928 election, with his case still tied up in the courts, Lennon won re-elec-tion to the Senate, garnering the largestmajority he had ever enjoyed in any of hissix legislative campaigns. (He had servedeight years in the House before moving tothe Senate in 1924.) The 1929 session put Lawson back on the attack, but he wasn 't going to be satisfied with an unenforceable resolution suggest-ing Lennon resign. Lawson and his alliesmounted an effort to have Lennon expelledfrom the body. On the first day of the session, the Sen- ate took up the matter, and Lennon gave along and eloquent defense of himself. He pointed out that he had never been accused of selling liquor, drinking liquor,or profiting from liquor sales. He explainedthat his accusers had claimed only that heknew or should have known about the ille-gal activities at the lodge. \"I wonder how well they will have served their own consciences if they succeed inwrecking my life, branding me with dis-honor, heaping me with reproach as I nearthe end of a life that has been clean even ifit has not been great, \" Lennon said. \" . . . My appeal is to men who can be calm and fairand merciful, not to men who regard them-selves as divinely appointed censors ofhumanity. \" Lennon survived the ordeal, with 25 senators voting to throw him out and 38 infavor of allowing him to stay on the job,though it would be his last term in theLegislature. And the 55-year-old knew that his career would be scarred by the event. \"It touches my wife and children, \" he said. \"It touches my lifetime of effort as a hu- man being, and it effects the heritage I shallleave behind me when I am gone from thisworld. \" (N. H EAL Y)Prohibition politics Ties to illegal liquor sales almost cost a veteran legislator his job Correction A story in the April 21 edition of Session Weekly incorrectly identified the House sponsor of a new law designed to protectunwanted newborns. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) sponsored the legislation, which will allow a mother (ora person of her consent) to leave an un-harmed baby at a hospital emergency roomup to 72 hours following the child's birthwithout fear of prosecution for child aban-donment. Gov. Jesse Ventura signed themeasure (HF2945/SF2615*/CH421) onApril 18. We regret the error.While Sviggum said the agreement to use the $549 million figure was \"significant, \" the House and Senate remain in disagreementover how that money should be used. Of the $549 million, the Senate is propos- ing to spend around $229 million primarilyfor education and health care. The Senate tax cut proposal would reduce the rate in the lowest bracket by 0.1 percentand the middle bracket by 0.25 percent. TheSenate also now has agreed with the Housenot to reduce the state 's vehicle license tab fees, which Gov. Jesse Ventura strongly favors. Two of Ventura 's other key initiatives also received some attention. On April 26, Repub-lican House members had breakfast at thegovernor 's residence to discuss the possibility of reviving his unicameral proposal. Such a bill would place a constitutional amendment on the November general electionballot so voters could decide whether the stateshould adopt a unicameral, or one-house, legislature. Also, Ventura announced this week that the state has received federal approval to begin fi-nal design on the proposed light-rail projectalong the Hiawatha corridor in Minneapolis. Sviggum said he and other House members remain unconvinced about the cost-effective-ness of light rail and that obtaining the latestapproval was not significant. \"I don 't think it was much of a hurdle that was passed, \" he said. House proposals currently in conference com- mittee would repeal the unspent funds previ-ously allocated by the state for the light-railtransit project. Officials estimate about $92 mil-lion remains of the total $100 million in funds. The governor has said he will veto any bill that would repeal the light-rail project. With little time remaining to complete work, the Legislature is working to find an acceptablemiddle ground. The House and Senate can onlyhold floor sessions for a combined seven morelegislative days, as of April 27.

The new law takes into account public tes- timony opposing new rules for permittinganimal feedlots. Effective April 25, 2000, thelaw gives specific instruction to the agency onhow the rules should be amended before theirfinal adoption. The law also prohibits the agency from im- posing additional conditions as part of a feed-lot permit after the proposed rules are finallyadopted. Under the law, state livestock operations will be allowed to grow, and regulation by theagency will be restricted. Agency officials want farmers to prevent the flow of animal waste from lots into rivers,streams, and ground water. The agency is alsoconcerned about air pollution caused byfeedlots. The MPCA 's new plan would put limits on hydrogen sulfide gas found in manure andrequire that manure spills on roads be treatedas serious problems. Sloppy handling of ma-nure could result in fines if the revised agencyrules were to go into effect. The commissioner of the Department of Agriculture will be required by the law to workwith the University of Minnesota to developeducational and training programs address-ing manure applicator concerns, includingwater quality protection and the developmentof manure management plans. If violations are found, the law will require that they be remedied in a timely manner. A feedlot operator with less than 300 ani- mal units, however, could not be required tospend more than $3,000 to upgrade a lot un-less assistance totaling at least 75 percent ofthe cost is available, under the law. Livestock production facilities will be ex- empt by the law from state standards govern-ing air quality in the area surrounding feedlotswhile manure is being removed from the siteand up to seven days following the transfer. The measure also will require the MPCA to remove several provisions from its proposedrules and allow the agency to submit a reportto the commissioner of the Department ofFinance if it is unable to accomplish timelyresponse to feedlot permit applications.Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) and Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored thelegislation. HF3692*/SF3443/CH435 Sales of funeral goods Gov. Jesse V entura signed a law April 24 that will regulate solicitation and sale of funeralgoods and services. It will prohibit solicitationat a hospital, gravesite, nursing home, or wake,without a specific request from the family ofthe deceased to do so. The new law also will prohibit an individual from offering goods and services to a personwhose death is impending, or to an individualresponsible for funeral arrangements of a de-ceased person within 10 days of thatindividual 's death. Such acts, however, will be allowed if the deceased or a relative had madearrangements to discuss plans for the funeralor burial before death occurred. The measure will not apply to communica- tion between an individual and a funeral pro-vider related by blood, adoption, or marriage. In cases when the deceased handled his or her own arrangements in advance, the law willrequire that the funeral provider produce acopy of the agreement and give the copy tothe person controlling the disposition of theremains. A copy of the arrangements will berequired to change hands no later than 24hours after first contact between the providerand the individual in charge of the remains. The law also contains new requirements for pre-death arrangements and a provision al-lowing a person who makes an advance burialarrangement to cancel plans. Furthermore, the law will require that all funeral establishments and providers clearlystate who owns the establishment in all busi-ness literature, contracts, and correspondence. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Claire A. Robling (R-Prior Lake) sponsoredthe legislation. Language pertaining to a potential finan- cial impact of the measure was incorporatedinto the omnibus state government spendingbill (HF2699) last month. The provisionwould appropriate $90,000 in fiscal year 2001for the purpose of responding to public com-plaints about funeral goods and servicessolicitation.That bill remains in a House-Senate con- ference committee. Most portions of the new law take effect Aug. 1, 2000. Provisions governing disclosureof ownership take effect Jan. 1, 2001. SF2686*/HF2713/CH438 Liquor license law Fraternal and charitable clubs will only need 30 members to obtain liquor licenses, under alaw signed April 24 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The omnibus liquor law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie),also will allow specific liquor contracts forspecial events in several towns, includingAnoka, Duluth, Eveleth, and Springfield. The law reduces the number of club mem- bers needed to obtain a liquor license from 50to 30. The provision addresses the droppingpopulation in some rural areas, Paulsen said. However, a provision that would have given cities more control over issuing liquor licensesto local theatres fell in conference committee.That provision was the focus of the originalHouse floor debate about the legislation. The law also will allow a commercial estab- lishment to make wine on the premises forpersonal or family use only. Individuals un-der age 21 will be forbidden from helpingmake wine. Liquor stores will be able to offer wine- tasting events on their premises, under the law.A wine-tasting event will be defined as an ac-tivity that does not last beyond four hours, atwhich patrons do no pay for each individualglass of wine. The state agriculture society also will be al- lowed to sell alcohol at state fairgrounds eventsthat are not held during the normal 12-dayrun of the fair. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), who chairs the House Commerce Committee, said the billaddresses primarily local issues. \"We tried to keep it very focused, \" Davids said. Sen. Sam Solon (DFL-Duluth) sponsored the Senate version. Statewide provisions of the law take effect Aug. 1, 2000. The items affecting specific cit-ies take effect upon local action. HF3974/SF3581*/CH4406 April 28, 2000#CRIME#CONSUMERS Penalties for unscrupulous contractors Contractors who fail to complete work on house projects will be subject to new criminaland civil penalties, under a law signedApril 20 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. A tornado that hit St. Peter in spring 1998 devastated much of that area. Even more dev-astating was the work of an unscrupulous con-tractor who was hired to fix damaged homes,said Rep. Julie Storm (R-St. Peter), who spon-sored the legislation in the House. The contractor collected money from homeowners, then did not pay subcontractors.The subcontractors then placed liens on thehomes, whose owners thought they had fin-ished paying for the repairs. The contractoreventually went bankrupt, but the liens werealready placed on the homes. \"They had a very frustrating time trying to deal with him, \" Storm said. \"They were in limbo. \" That contractor was later ordered to serve two months in jail and repay the homeowners. A builder, material supplier, or subcontrac- tor can place a lien on a property if they arenot paid for work done on the property. Con-tractors should receive a lien-waiver from asubcontractor once that subcontractor hasbeen paid, she said. A felony penalty for theft is also established under the law. The maximum penalty for theftin state statute is 20 years in prison and a$100,000 fine. Under the previous law, the maximum theft charge under the mechanics lien statute was agross misdemeanor, with a maximum penaltyof one year in jail and a $3,000 fine. The law also will allow homeowners to seek civil penalties against contractors, which werenot previously available. Shareholders, officers, and directors of the contracting company who are aware of thetheft could also face criminal and civil penal-ties, under the law. The law will require that money for a con- struction project be kept in a trust fund. Pro-ceeds can be kept separate within the trust.Contractors would then pay subcontractorsfrom the trust. Storm noted that several banks and contrac- tors were involved in the drafting process andapproved the wording of the law. While the law stems from the St. Peter inci- dent, Storm said the law could have a dramaticpositive effect on homeowners and contrac-tors across the state. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the Senate version. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF2563*/SF2381/CH430Cracking down on pimps People who lure teens into prostitution will face expanded penalties, under a law signedApril 20 by Gov. Jesse V entura. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), the law aims to curb solicitors,or pimps, from pushing young children, bothboys and girls, into prostitution. The law will make it a felony for a person to solicit a juvenile under age 18 into prostitu-tion. The maximum penalty is 20 years inprison and a $40,000 fine. Under previous law, a juvenile had to be under age 16 for a felony charge. \"It didn 't make sense to have pimps have more severe sentences for soliciting teens un-der age 15 than when they are under age 18, \" Clark said. The hike in age from 16 to 18 means more pimps will go to prison, Clark said. Under theexisting law, a pimp who solicits a 16- or 17-year old person into prostitution would getonly probation, she said. A task force report submitted to the House Crime Prevention Committee earlier this ses-sion estimated that 1,000 Minnesota teens arecurrently involved in prostitution. The law also requires the commissioner of public safety to study and make recommen-dations on training officers to combat prosti-tution. The study would include informationon ways to increase penalties and prosecutionof solicitors. State law already says that luring adults into prostitution is a gross misdemeanor. Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The increased penalties take effect Aug. 1, 2000, while the study provision takes effectJuly 1, 2000. HF2830*/SF2771/CH431 Penalties for assaulting officers A person who physically assaults an officer during an arrest but does not cause any \"de- monstrable bodily harm \" still could be charged with a gross misdemeanor, under alaw signed April 24 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) was the House sponsor of the legislation, which alsoprovides for a felony charge if someone es-capes from police custody for a felony-relatedaction, even if that person has not yet beencharged or convicted of a crime. The violatorcould face a maximum penalty of five years inprison and a $10,000 fine. Previous law allowed for a felony only if the person fled after being charged or convictedof a felony.Physically assaulting an officer during an arrest could more often lead to a gross misde-meanor charge, under the new law. The lawpreviously required \"demonstrable bodily harm \" sustained by the officer, but there were no additional penalties for harm that was notvisible or \"demonstrable. \" Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) said the pro- vision stems from a case in which an officerwas struck in the groin by someone who wasresisting arrest. The action did not result indemonstrable bodily harm, so no additionalpenalties could be brought against theassailant. Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) sponsored the Senate version of the legisla-tion. The law is effective April 25, 2000. HF2958/SF2830*/CH441 Serving court orders Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law April 24 that will strengthen domestic and child abuse laws.It also will allow officers to serve any courtorders. The law creates a shortened notification process that officers can use to serve courtdocuments to people at any time. The idea behind the law is that many de- fendants and parties to a court case are hardto find, and this measure will allow them tobe formally served if an officer encountersthem in a routine traffic stop or other policeaction. For instance, if an officer pulls over a car for speeding, and the officer learns that a courtis trying to contact that person to serve courtorders, such as a subpoena or protection or-der, the officer will be able give a notificationform to that person, under the law. An officer could serve paperwork at any time, including Sundays or legal holidays, thelaw states. The notification form would include the names of the parties involved, the county thatserved the order, the name of the judge, andthe date of a hearing. The short order form would direct the re- cipient to report to the sheriff 's office or court- house where the proceeding is set to take placeto pick up the full copy of service. The officer could detain the person as long as necessary in order to fill out and serve theperson with the short form, under the law. According to the law, a scheduled hearing can take place if the papers were served at least12 hours before the hearing, and the personreceiving the papers must appear. However,the person who received the papers may re-quest a continuance of up to five days. Previously, the hearing could not begin until five days had passed after the court papersSession Weekly 7With plate in hand and a sea of delec- table hotdishes before them, dozens of leg-islators and staff commemorated thesigning of a law that will loosen restrictionson such potlucks. They gathered April 25 in the Capitol 's Great Hall to sample tasty items such asbaked beans, tuna casserole, potato andtaco salads, said the idea to draft the \"hotdish bill \" surfaced after he had attended a DFL bean feed atthe American Legion Hall in his hometownand was told that health regulations pre-vented outsiders from bringing preparedfood into community potlucks. Aggie Leitheiser, assistant commissioner of the state 's Health Protection Bureau, said such restrictions have existed to preventoutbreaks of food-borne disease. Over thepast four years, Leitheiser said, 16 percentof the confirmed food-borne disease out-breaks in the state were traced to privatelyprepared food. So, following regulations to the letter, or- ganizers of the event in Willmar politelytold Juhnke he could stay but he had to takehis beans back to the car.Hotdish haven Legislators celebrate new law by indulging in long-standing Minnesota dining tradition After the experience, Juhnke said he felt all people should be allowed to attend com-munity potlucks and share their food with-out being subject to health inspection. Gov.Jesse Ventura agreed. He signed the bill intolaw April 13. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the law will allow any person attending a potluck event \u2014 not just members ofthe organizationsponsoring theevent \u2014 to bring peoplewho are notmembers of theorganization to attend the event and eat the food. The bill had once contained language that would have required signs at a potluckevent stating that the food was not pre-pared in a licensed kitchen and is not sub-ject to Health Department regulation. Butthe provision was dropped before the billwon final passage. Organizers of the Capitol potluck thought it would be humorous to postsigns, anyway. Tucked away in a corner bythe plates and napkins stood the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer. It read, \"Welcome to the Great Minnesota Potluck. Warning:This food was not prepared in a commer-cial facility. Eat at your own risk. \" SF3348*/HF2707/CH378 (M. D E LARCO ) were served. The new provision is effectiveApril 25, 2000. The law also will allow an officer to arrest a person who violates a pretrial no-contactorder, even if the officer wasn 't present at the time of the violation. The orders, often issuedin domestic abuse cases, require that the de-fendant have no contact with whoever isnamed in the order, typically the victim andtheir family. Law enforcement already has the ability to arrest someone without a warrant in domes-tic abuse cases. The new law will extend thatarrest ability to persons violating the domes-tic abuse no-contact order. The law also will create a felony for a per- son who caused malicious punishment of achild. The law says the violator may be chargedwith a felony if the child is under age 4 andhas sustained bodily harm to the head, eyes,or neck, or has suffered multiple bruises. Themaximum penalty for the felony would be fiveyears in prison and a $10,000 fine. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) and Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge (DFL-New Hope)sponsored the legislation. Most of the provisions take effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF1067/SF551*/CH437 #EMPLOYMENT Workers' compensation law Workers ' compensation rates will be re- duced while injured workers ' benefits will be increased, under a new law signed April 27 byGov. Jesse Ventura. The law represents recommendations from the Workers ' Compensation Advisory Coun- cil. The council is composed of representativesfrom the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce,the state 's AFL-CIO, and the Legislature. The law provides an increase in the maxi- mum weekly compensation an injured workercan receive for wage loss benefits. Currentlythat amount is capped at $615 per week, butthe new law will increase that benefit to $750.The minimum amount per week will go from$104 to $130. In the case of a worker who is killed in a work-related accident, the minimum amountof compensation for the dependents will be$60,000. Under the law, there will be a transfer of $325 million in surplus fund 's from the Min- nesota Workers ' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan to the compensation fund 's second in- jury and supplemental benefits program. The assigned risk plan aids in the operation of the workers ' compensation system by pro- viding a source of insurance for employersunable to obtain such coverage from the pri- vate insurance market. In a message accompanying his signing of the bill, Ventura said that the transfer of fundswould likely reduce the workers ' compensa- tion fund assessment rate from 30 percent to20 percent. Ventura also said that he expects the Legis- lature to pass a separate bill transferring $95million from the Assigned Risk Plan to reduce the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Asso-ciation assessment for employers in the state. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) sponsoredthe measure. Most of the law 's provisions are effective Aug. 1, 2000. HF3960/SF3644*/CH447Rep. Al Juhnke makes his way down a long table ofhotdishes, salads, breads, and desserts as an honoredguest at the Senate-sponsored \"Great Minnesota Pot-luck\" held April 25 in the Great Hall of the Capitol.8 April 28, 2000#ENERGY Powered by poultry litter Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law April 24 that could lead the way to the construction of anelectricity generating facility that uses turkeylitter as fuel. Effective April 25, 2000, the law changes the definition of biomass energy to include poul-try litter and plants that are grown specificallyfor fuel. Legislation in 1994 relating to thePrairie Island nuclear power facility requiredpublic utilities that operate nuclear powerplants in the state to develop 125 megawattsof electric energy generated by biomass. The law allows 50 of the 125 megawatts to be provided by a facility that uses poultry lit-ter as its primary fuel source. Fiberwatt, a company based in Great Britain, is proposing to build the poultry litter plant inMinnesota. The company owns and operatesthree similar power plants in Great Britain. Those facilities produce energy by burning the litter at 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, produc-ing steam that drives a turbine. Officials fromthe company testified that they are interestedin building the plant in Minnesota because thestate is the second largest turkey producingstate in the nation. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Novak (DFL-New Brighton) were thesponsors. HF2757*/SF2614/CH443 #FAMILY #ENVIRONMENT Gasoline additives banned Gasoline additives that have caused severe water pollution in some states will be bannedin Minnesota, under a new law signed April24 by the governor. Effective July 1, 2000, gasoline in the state can contain only trace amounts of methyl ter-tiary butyl ether are al-ternative fuel additives to ethanol. Currently, those additives are not used in Minnesota 's gasoline supply. But Rep. Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea), sponsor of the mea-sure, said that as other states ban the chemi-cals, gasoline with those additives could besent to Minnesota unless it is banned here. After July 1, 2000, gasoline cannot contain more than one-third of 1 percent of the chemi-cals. Gasoline is moved through commonpipelines throughout the country, so traces ofthose chemicals can be found in almost allgasoline. But after July 1, 2005, no traces of the chemicals will be allowed in gasoline, underthe new law.Research shows the additive is responsible for several incidents of soil and water contami-nation, including municipal wells as nearbyas Alvord and Ida Grove, Iowa. Minnesota 's legislators are not alone in their concern over the effects of MTBE usage ingasoline. Recent developments in other statesare driving a national reconsideration of us-ing MTBE as an oxygenate in fuel. California Gov. Gray Davis issued an execu- tive order in March 1999 to phase out MTBEfrom the California gasoline supply by Decem-ber 31, 2002. His decision was supported by astate-funded research project by the Univer-sity of California that indicated that the airpollution benefits of using the additive couldbe obtained in other ways. Twenty-three states have established regu- latory guidelines or standards for MTBE con-tamination in groundwater or drinking water. Experts say eight ounces of the additive can contaminate five million gallons of drinkingwater. Spillage from a car accident couldthreaten an entire aquifer. Water contaminated by MTBE has a bitter taste and detectable odor. Research has shownit causes tumors in rats. Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy) was the Senate sponsor of the measure. HF3292/SF2946*/CH434 #GOVERNMENTParenting plans become law Parents who are getting a divorce will be allowed to create a parenting plan agreement,under a law signed April 27 by Gov. JesseVentura. The law allows divorced couples to make agreements on splitting parenting time. Planscould specify anything from where a child livesduring the day to which parent can teach reli-gious philosophy. Child support issues are notincluded in the law. If both parents agree to a parenting plan, the court must accede unless the court deter-mines the plan is not in the best interest ofthe child. If neither parent agrees to a parenting plan, the court may create one on its own, underthe law. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), the law is similar toa proposal that came from a task force thatstudied the issue during the interim. An earlier version of the measure would have allowed the judge to order that parentsenter into negotiations even if one parent didnot want a parenting plan. However, the finallegislation allows a plan if both parents agreedto enter into it.The court cannot require a parenting plan if one adult has been accused of domestic as-sault or sexual abuse, under the law. In addi-tion, judges must ask individuals if they agreedto the parenting plan voluntarily. The law also replaces the word \"visitation \" in statute with the phrase \"parenting time. \" Dawkins said non-custodial parents find theword \"visitation to be offensive. Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) spon- sored the Senate version. The law takes effectretroactively to Sept. 1, 1999. HF3311/SF3169*/CH444 Extending judicial pilot project A Ramsey County pilot program that allows one judge to hear all cases involving a singlefamily would be extended another two years,under a bill the House passed April 26. Thevote was 121-8. Sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL- Falcon Heights), the bill would extend theCombined Court Jurisdiction pilot programto 2002. The program is currently set to ex-pire June 30 of this year. The program allows one judge to hear is- sues that would go before family, probate, orjuvenile court, McGuire explained. \"Rather than dealing with three different judges and three different court dates, let 's combine it and put it before one judge, \" McGuire said, in explaining the rationale forthe initiative. The program is referred to as \"one court, one judge, \" she said. Delinquency matters are not included in the program. The Legislature initially approved the two- year pilot program in 1996. Former Rep.Howard Orenstein (DFL-St. Paul) sponsoredthe original measure. The pilot program was extended through 2000 by the 1998 Legislature. McGuire said shehopes the Legislature will make the programpermanent within the next two years. \"Some of the implementation issues caused some concerns, and they want to iron outthose issues, \" she said. The bill (HF3997/SF3300*) now heads to the governor. Plan to move Agriculture Dept. A bill that would call for a plan to relocate the state Department of Agriculture to ruralMinnesota was passed by the House April 26.The vote was 75-56. The relocation proposal was added to a bill (HF3852) that would require state agencies toencourage state employees to work from homeby telecommuting.Session Weekly 9Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Bob Westfall (R-Rothsay), each state agency wouldsubmit an annual report to the Legislature thatwould explain its progress in achieving goalsrelated to telecommuting. The report would include descriptions of positions that are suitable for telecommutingand how they would be adjusted, incentivesfor employees to telecommute, and goals forachieving a minimum percentage of positionsthat can be filled fully or partially by employ-ees who telecommute. Westfall said the goal of the bill is to take a step toward decentralizing government. Rep. T orrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake) pro- posed the plan to take a bigger step towardthat goal by planning to relocate the Agricul-ture Department, and the House voted 75-56to accept his amendment. \"This is a good opportunity to share some equity with rural Minnesota and share somejobs with rural Minnesota, \" Westrom said. The same provision had been proposed by Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) and added tothe omnibus state government spending bill(HF2699), which is currently in a House-Senate conference committee. Juhnke also spoke in favor of the Westrom proposal, saying that it would save money be-cause office space is less expensive to build orlease outside the metro area. And, he said, itwould move that department closer to the ar-eas it serves. The plan would be designed by the state Department of Administration, in consulta-tion with the commissioner of agriculture, byJune 30, 2003, when the department 's current lease expires at its St. Paul office. Several lawmakers spoke against the pro- posal, saying the state would incur costs ofrelocating people and families. Rep. TimMahoney (DFL-St. Paul) said it would hurtfamilies that have to move their children to adifferent school and employees ' spouses who would need to find jobs wherever the depart-ment is moved. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) pro- posed adding a similar plan to relocate theDepartment of Natural Resources outside themetro area, but that proposal failed on a 68-62 vote. The bill now goes to the Senate. #HIGHER EDUCATION#HUMAN SERVICES Paying costs of lawsuits State agencies that instigate unsuccessful lawsuits could have to pay higher costs to de-fendants, under a new law signed April 24 byGov. Jesse Ventura. Currently, agencies are required to pay the attorneys ' fees and other expenses of a defen- dant when the agency brings a civil action andloses, under certain conditions. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the new law will expand the typesof expenses that can be recovered by the pre-vailing party, and it clarifies the procedure forreceiving those awards from a court or admin-istrative law judge. The new law will allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable costs of any study, analy-sis, engineering report, test, or project that theparty has done in response to the state 's ac- tion. Those costs are added to those that al-ready can be recovered under current law,including various court fees, mileage, postage,and delivery costs. Also, current law limits the amount of at- torney fees that can be recovered to $100 perhour. The new law will raise that limit to $125per hour. The new law also modifies the definition of who is eligible for recovering those types ofexpenses. Groups that are eligible under cur-rent law include organizations with up to 50employees and annual revenues that do notexceed $4 million. The new law will expandthe eligibility by increasing the number ofemployees to 500 and the annual revenues to$7 million. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield), sponsor of the measure, said the current law is used veryrarely, and it ideally would not be used at all. \"If the state bases its actions on facts and acts in good faith, there 's nothing to worry about, \" Tuma said when the bill was debated on the House floor. The law applies only if the state agency fails to justify its position when it instigates a civilsuit or contested case other than a tort action. Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge (DFL-New Hope) carried the Senate version of the bill. HF3497*/SF3539/CH439 Setting salary for officials A change would be made in the way the sal- ary is determined for chancellor of the state 's largest higher education system, under a billthe House passed April 25. The vote was95-34. The bill (HF3726/SF3386*), sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), would allowthe Board of Trustees of Minnesota State Col-leges and Universities (MnSCU) to establisha salary range for the chancellor position. Theboard would then submit the proposed salaryrange to the Legislature for approval. Currently, the board sets a specific salary amount that is then approved by the Legisla-ture. The current salary for the chancellor is$185,000. The bill also would allow the board moreflexibility in the contracts they offer to presi- dents and other non-classified positionswithin the MnSCU system. Under current law,the board is allowed to propose a salary rangefor its presidents, which the Legislature ap-proves. But the bill would allow the board tosubmit to the Legislature proposed contractswith other incentives to attract candidates. Bishop said that increasing competition from other states has made retaining and re-cruiting quality people in the positions moredifficult. He said he aims to give MnSCU moreoptions to attract qualified candidates. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) offered a successful amendment deleting a sec-tion of the bill that would have requiredMnSCU to conduct a study on the use of non-profit educational foundations to provide ad-ditional compensation and benefits for thechancellor and president positions. McCollum said she opposed using founda- tion money to pay officials at public institu-tions because of the inequities in pay thatwould likely be created under such a system. The bill now goes to the governor. Responsibility for care The commissioner of the Department of Human Services is now required to consultwith stakeholders and develop recommenda-tions for transferring guardianship responsi-bilities for adults with mental retardation fromthe department to another entity, under a lawsigned April 20 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Under the law, stakeholders include family members, advocacy organizations, counties, ser-vice providers, and the office of the ombudsmanfor mental health and mental retardation. The law requires those taking over guard- ianship responsibilities to be either a multi-purpose agency providing a broad range ofsocial services or a new or existing officewithin state government that does not cur-rently have duties related to mentally retardedpeople. The law also states that an entity must pro- vide assurance that it will act in the best inter-ests of each person left in its care. Officials must provide recommendations for transferring guardianship responsibilities,including cost estimates, to the chair of theHouse Health and Human Services PolicyCommittee and the chair of the Senate Healthand Family Security Committee by Decem-ber 15, 2000, under the law. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) and Sen. John C. Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) sponsoredthe legislation. The law is effectiveApril 21, 2000. HF2671*/SF2567/CH42910 April 28, 2000#LAW#METRO AFFAIRS #TRANSPORTATIONAccess to sex offender records Lawyers would have more access to court and health records of sex offenders who couldpossibly be elevated to the level of predatoryoffender, under a bill the House passed April26. The vote was 130-0. Sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL- Mpls), the bill would make alterations to theSexually Dangerous Persons Act, which allowsthe state to civilly commit repeated predatoryoffenders to treatment. The bill would allow county attorneys or the state attorney general access to health andcourt records before a petition to deem some-one a predatory offender and have that per-son committed is filed in court. Currently,attorneys usually obtain those records after apetition is filed. \"What they want to do is look at the health records, \" Skoglund explained. There are about 160 predatory offenders in state hospitals. The offenders have completedtheir prison sentences and have been sent tothe state hospital for treatment rather thanbeing released. While a predatory offender could complete treatment and be released from a state hospi-tal, that has yet to happen in the six-yearhistory of the civil commitment law. The attorney general or county attorneys are responsible for seeking petitions to com-mit offenders. The attorney general usuallyhandles commitment cases for less-populatedcounties. If the attorneys had access to records be- fore a petition is filed, they might determinethat civil commitment is not necessary and notpursue a petition, Skoglund said. The bill (HF2880/SF2854*) would require the individual be notified that attorneys areseeking his or her records. However, that no-tice could be waived if it would result in harmor harassment of potential witnesses. The health and court records would not be considered public information. The Legislature approved the Sexually Dan- gerous Persons Act during a special session in1994. The law stemmed from a case involvingDennis Linehan, who had a history of rapingteen-agers in the 1960s and murdered oneperson. Linehan was set to be freed after acourt struck down his commitment. The 1994law allowed the state to keep Linehancommitted. The bill now returns to the Senate.Defining minor-use airports The House passed a bill April 26 that would shore up law that prevents expenditures toexpand or upgrade minor-use airports to in-termediate-use airports without approvalfrom the Legislature. The vote was 78-53. The bill (HF849), sponsored by Rep. Barb Haake (R-Mounds View), would set into lawthe definition of a minor use airport as onewith a runway or runways no longer than5,000 feet. In 1980, the Legislature approved a measure known as the \"McCarron Amendment, \" named after former Rep. Paul McCarron. Itprohibited the expansion of minor- andintermediate-use airports in the metropolitanarea unless the expansion was approved by theLegislature. This new bill would not change the McCarron Amendment. It would merely putinto law the definition of a minor-use airport,Haake said. The bill stems from a compromise between the Metropolitan Airports Commission andcommunities near the Anoka County Airport.The airport has proposed extending its east-west runway, which would allow business jetsto use the airport. In its Metropolitan Development Guide, the Metropolitan Airports Commission defines aminor-use airport as one with a runway of nolonger than 5,000 feet, Haake said. Currently, St. Paul 's Downtown Airport is the only intermediate-use airport in the met-ropolitan area, she said. Minor-use airportsinclude Flying Cloud, Crystal, Anoka County,Blaine, Lake Elmo, and Airlake. The measure now moves to the Senate. Exceptions to restrictions Some heavier vehicles such as public utility or recycling trucks are exempt from spring-time road weight restrictions, under a lawsigned April 24 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The law allows a few specified vehicles to travel on roads that usually have weight re-strictions for eight weeks in the spring. \"No one is for wrecking roads. I 'm certainly not,\" said Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen), House sponsor of the measure. Public utility vehicles need to be able to travel on side roads when emergencies occur,Workman said.\"For them to come onto your street and re- store your power, they are technically break-ing the law, \" Workman said during a House Transportation Policy Committee meeting inFebruary. \"That 's ridiculous. \" Exempted vehicles under this bill must not exceed 20,000 pounds per axle. The law sunsets in three years, so legisla- tors will have to take further action to con-tinue the law if it works well, Workman said. The law does not include two House floor amendments, which would have exemptedtrucks containing raw sewage or milk from theroad restrictions. The eight-week weight restrictions are en- forced when the ice thaws and roads becomeparticularly soft. Road restrictions are gener-ally placed on state and county highways orcity streets. By starting the weight restrictionson time, the department estimates it saves $10million annually in road replacement costs. Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon- sored the Senate measure. The law is effect-ive April 25, 2000, and is to be repealedJune 1, 2003. HF3274/SF2785*/CH433 #VETERANS Exempting rebate income Sales tax refunds or rebates will not be con- sidered income for residents of veterans ' homes, under a new law signed April 24 byGov. Jesse V entura. The new law, sponsored by Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls), will clarify current law that re-quires residents of veterans ' homes to pay for their care based on their ability to pay. Cost of care is based on the average costs of operating veterans ' homes. The law relates to any future sales tax re- funds and rebates, and to those paid after June30, 1999. That money will not be consideredincome for residents of veterans ' homes, un- der the law. The law also will allow the governing board of the veterans ' home in Hastings to use fed- eral grant money to purchase a home to beused as transitional housing for homeless ordisabled veterans. That provision of the lawtakes affect Aug. 1, 2000. Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2968/SF3139*/CH442Session Weekly 11BY JON FUREAn artwork that once stirred considerable controversy during its design has beennoticeably absent from its perch on the Capitol grounds in recent months. Known as the \"Promise of Y outh, \" the foun- tain features a bronze statue of a nude womansitting in the middle of tulip petals that openand close. People have commonly referred tothe statue as \"Millie \" after the model who posed for the piece. Now more than 40 years old, thestatue has been sentaway for repairsthat are nearly com-plete. The fountain was designed in 1952 byAlonzo Hauser aspart of the V eteransService Building.The building andsurroundingmonuments serveas a memorial to allmembers of thearmed services. Hauser had been chosen as the sculp-tor in 1952 byBrooks Cavin, ar-chitect of atMacalester Collegeuntil he became afreelance sculptorin 1949. He also has made sculptures for sev-eral Twin Cities area churches. Hauser 's concept for the Promise of Y outh was to reflect the larger theme of the impor-tance of peace, with the youthful figure look-ing up at the Court of Honor, which is a wallof commemorative plaques dedicated to vari-ous groups of veterans.Y outh restored Once-controversial fountain should soon return to its homenear the Veterans Service Building after months of repairs According to a 1957 article in the Minne- sota Daily , Hauser showed a small model of the Promise of Y outh to the 11-member V et-erans Service Building Commission in 1952as part of the overall design for the building.None of the board members objected to thedesign of the fountain when they approved thebuilding. But in 1954, the board voted to reject the design due to concerns that the community would considerthe nude statueinappropriate. Then-secretary of the board,William Fallon,explained theboard ture and Minnesotans \"would not go for it, \" ac- cording to the article. Walsh suggested that the public would find the sculpture more appropriate if instead ofthe female nude figure it depicted a soldierthrowing a grenade. At a May 1954 board meeting, Cavin spoke in favor of Hauser 's sculpture and pressed theissue of taking a vote to formally approve or reject the design. Cavin had brought letters ofsupport from W.B. Bryan, director of the Min-neapolis School of Art, and Malcolm E. Lein,director of the St. Paul Gallery and School ofArt. But the board refused to read the lettersand unanimously voted to reject Hauser 's design. The issue did not receive much more atten- tion until a Minnesota Daily article and oth- ers appeared in 1957, which led to publicsupport for the Promise of Y outh fountain de-spite the statue 's risque nature. Several letters from readers appeared in local newspapersasking for the board members ' names and qualifications as art critics. In 1958, the fountain was finally placed in its perch in front of the veterans building, justsouth of the Capitol. But that wasn 't the end of its struggle. According to a 1963 St. Paul Dispatch story, children in the neighborhood were using thereflecting pool surrounding the fountain as aswimming pool, leaving behind their candywrappers, pop bottles, banana peels, and otherlitter. The article also said \"some legislators felt the young lady should have some clothes oneven if they got wet, \" and that vandals had jammed the mechanism that opened the pet-als, so that the nude statue was permanentlycovered by the closed petals. More recently, leaks in the pool have forced it to be left empty for the past several years,which has made it an occasional destinationfor local skateboarders. The current repair project was funded through the 1998 bonding law. The law or-dered several repair projects for Capitolmonuments. The work for the Promise of Y outh will cost $262,000, which includes repairs to the reflect-ing pool and pipes, as well as the repairs tothe statue. The fountain 's petals will be fixed in a permanent position, partially open to re-veal the statue and high enough to preventchildren from climbing on the petals. Thefountain 's base will be strengthened to help it withstand wind and elements. The water level in the pool will be kept at a depth of about six inches. The work is expected to be complete in June, so it will be on display for the Taste of Minne-sota festival held on the Capitol grounds an-nually in early July. PROJECTS # # # This somewhat risque fountain attracted controversywhen it was first installed on the Capitol grounds. Afteryears of neglect, it has been temporarily removed forrepairs.12 April 28, 2000BY DAVID MAEDA In the political world of checks and balances, where the three equal branches of govern- ment share power and keep each other in line,the veto override is the equivalent of a bodycheck. If it connects, it can really sting. Just consider the circumstances of former Gov. Harold LeVander, who in the late 1960sused a veto to stop enactment of a state salestax, only to have a Legislature controlled byhis own party override that veto. LeVander may have seen the override as more of a cross check, to stick with the hockeyterminology. T o him, it may have seemed acheap shot meant to cause harm. The governor 's veto power is an obvious, highly visible one of the checks and balancescreated by this three-branch system of gov-ernment. A check on that check is theLegislature 's ability \u2014 with a two-thirds ma- jority vote \u2014 to override the governor 's veto. These safeguards are considered important enough that every state in the nation now al-lows gubernatorial vetoes and legislative vetooverrides. In 1996, North Carolina became thelast state to give its chief executive veto power. Considering the number of bills passed into law in Minnesota 's history, there haven 't been that many vetoes used. In the past 60 yearsgovernors have vetoed about 375 bills. Former Gov. Arne Carlson was far and away the most frequent user of this executive power,vetoing 179 bills in his eight years in office.The next highest amount came from Gov. AlQuie who vetoed 31 bills in four years. As relatively infrequent as vetoes have been, the Legislature 's use of its power to override those vetoes has been even rarer. The Legislature has overridden vetoes only six times since 1939. Two governors have had twoveto overrides. Several governors have had none. In the current era of tri-partisan govern- ment, Gov. Jesse Ventura may be less protectedfrom the veto override because he has no di-rect party allies in either the House or the Sen-ate. He is the lone member of theIndependence Party to hold office in the state. Last year, the Legislature overrode a veto byCross checks and balances The Legislature's veto override power has been usedinfrequently throughout the history of the stateHISTORY # # # Ventura of a bill that allows court evidenceabout allegedly defective seat belts in productliability lawsuits. It was the first veto overridesince 1982. And the 2000 Legislature overrodeanother Ventura veto of a bill aimed to pre-vent closure of a state-run nursing facility inWalker. Also this session, an attempt to override a line-item veto of a measure that would haveappropriated $150,000 for a World War IImemorial at the Capitol failed in the House,coming up 11 votes short. Prior to the overrides of those V entura ve- toes, the last time the Legislature exercised thatpower was in 1982, when two of Quie 's vetoes were overridden. One was to a bill that re-moved the education commissioner from theState UniversityBoard. took earlyretirement. The House also attempted tooverride a veto ona third, and muchmore controver-sial estab-lish a $46 49hazardous waste dumps. The override vote failedby eight votes. Perhaps the most contentious veto override came with the establishment of the state 's sales tax in 1967. The Legislature, looking for amethod to alleviate the state 's dependence on property taxes passed a bill establishing thesales tax. LeVander said he would veto any billthat contained a sales tax provision and didnot also contain a clause for a referendum onthe issue.But members of LeVander 's own Republican Party, which had a majority in both the Houseand Senate, ignored the governor 's warning and passed a measure creating a 3 percent sales taxwithout a referendum provision. True to his word, the governor vetoed the bill. The House then voted to override thegovernor 's veto. But the Senate, despite a ma- jority vote, didn 't have the necessary two- thirds majority required for a veto override. LeVander called a special session during which both the House and Senate re-passedthe tax bill containing the 3 percent state salestax. LeVander again vetoed the bill. But thistime both the House and Senate voted to over-ride the veto. It was the first time in state history that a governor 's own party voted twice to overturn his veto. The only other veto override since 1939 occurred when Gov. Luther Y oungdahl vetoeda bill that authorized financial assistance toseven counties that the state agreed to pay offoutstanding ditch bond indebtedness. In his veto message, Y oungdahl said he was vetoing the bill because it had passed both houses with little or no discussion and he hadbeen informed that it had lacked \"full disclo- sure of the facts involved. \" However Y oungdahl 's argument didn 't dis- suade legislators against the importance of thebill. An overwhelming majority \u2014 124 in the House and 60 in the Senate \u2014 voted for the override. Until Gov. Jesse Ventura came to the Capitol, former Gov. Al Quie was the only person totwice feel the sting of a veto override. Shown here, Quie signs a veto message in hisCapitol office Dec. 21, 1981.Session Weekly 13BY CHRIS VETTERWhen the Legislature passes changes to law that strengthen felony-level penalties, the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission mustfigure out how to make those changes fit into its guidelines.Hard time State's Sentencing Guidelines Commission rates crimes anddetermines how long felons should stay in prison The 11-person board, which is a policy- making body, has been tweaking the state 's sentencing guidelines annually since the con-cept was approved in 1978. \"They are constantly being changed every year, both by the Legislature and by otherchanges, \" says Deb Dailey, executive director of the commission for the past 14 years. Prior to the inception of the guidelines, there was little consistency in how long a con-victed felon was sentenced to prison. \"People were not happy with the indeter- minate time people spent in prison, \" Dailey said. \"People felt inmates were getting out of prison too soon. \" State Supreme Court Justice Russell A. Anderson, a member of the commission, saidthe process makes sentencing rules similaracross the state. \"Our job is to make sure sentencing is ra- tional and consistent, \" he said. \"Sentencing should be neutral with respect to gender, race,or economic status of the felons. \" The Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission was created by the 1978 Legisla-ture and has been making a guideline systembased on the average crime ever since. \"The statute maximum is meant to address the most egregious cases, \" Dailey said. \"The guidelines address the typical case. \" The guidelines rank offenses on a scale of 1-10, ten being the worst level of offense.Second-degree murder is a level 10 offense;sale of a controlled substance, such as mari-juana, is a level one offense. The level of offense is then cross-referenced with the felon 's \"criminal history score, \" which is based on a separate formula of prior crimi-nal offenses. The higher the criminal historyscore, the longer period of prison sentence fora convicted felon.\"Our job is to make sure sentencing is rational and consistent. Sentencing should be neutral with respect to gender, race, or economic status of the felons.\" \u2014State Supreme Court Justice Russell A. AndersonThe guidelines pertain to felony crimes only, not to gross misdemeanors or lesser offenses. Along with the guidelines, convicted felons are required to serve at least two-thirds of the fullsentence imprisoned, with a maximum of one-third of the sentence on supervised release. Judges can depart from the guidelines, de- livering either a lengthier or shorter sentencethan the guidelines suggest, Dailey said. \"It's important that judges have the discre- tion to depart from the guidelines, \" she said. \"The guidelines cannot address every situation. \" If the felon is convicted of a crime with a mandatory minimum sentence lengthier thanthe guidelines suggest, the felon must serve themandatory minimum. Scott Swanson, assistant state public de- fender, was appointed to the commission lastyear. Swanson likes the system, saying it \"treats similarly situated people similarly. \" Swanson predicts the commission will be unusually busy altering the guidelines this yearbecause of felony changes in \"Katie 's Law. \" The law increases penalties for sex offenders. Thelaw is named for Katie Poirier, who was ab-ducted and allegedly killed by a repeat sexoffender. Swanson said the commission is concerned about the disproportionate number ofminorities in Minnesota prisons \u2014 about 37 percent of current inmates are black, accord-ing to the Department of Corrections. Thatpercent is far higher than the state 's black population. \"It's stunning, when you look at people walking down the street, \" Swanson said. Robert Knickerbocker, Anoka County pro- bation officer, also was appointed to the boardlast year. He said he hears input from proba-tion officers from across the state, asking fortechnical changes or questioning the weightgiven to specific provisions. \"I find it very interesting and challenging, \" Knickerbocker said. While it meets at least once a month, the board is likely to meet more often in the sum-mer months as it changes the guidelines tomatch changes passed by the Legislature in thespring. That way, the guideline changes are inplace by August 1, when most of the new lawstake effect, Dailey said. The commission board members are ap- pointed to four-year terms that are concur-rent with the governor 's term. The governor appoints eight members. His appointments include a county attorney, a law enforcement official, a probation officer, and three citizens.The chief justice of the Supreme Court ap-points the other three members. About 20 states currently have a sentencing guidelines commission, Dailey said.Minnesota 's system is similar to versions in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, andWashington. Changes to law since 1989 have shifted the sentencing guidelines toward lengthier prisonterms, Dailey said. She noted that the guide-lines for murder increased from 17 years inprison to 30 years. The guidelines for severalother crimes have doubled in recent years, sheadded.

The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23). This information is also available on the governor's Web site (www.governor.state.mn.us).Select the *The legislative bill marked with an asterisk denotes the file submitted to the governor.FEBRUARY 1 - A PRIL 27 , 2000 CHAPTERS 251 - 447 Res. 4 4060 2348* Resolution for release of Americans held in North Korea, China, Russia and Vietnam. 4/3/00 251 2980 2763* Fishing season modified. 2/16/00 252 2634 2411* Northern hospital board membership requirements modified. 3/1/00 253 2521 2320* Lake Edwards township name change. 3/1/00254 76 86* K-12 education technical changes provided. 3/7/00 offenders modifications. 3/7/00 dissolution authority. 3/7/00257 2535* 2291 Shorewood authorized to elect city council members by wards. 3/13/00 258 3039 2554* Wadena County truth in taxation process advertisement requirement penalty exemption. 3/13/00 259 3338* 2907 Scott County officials bill. 3/14/00 261 2642* requirements modified. 3/14/00 262 2774 2485* Carisoprodol schedule IV controlled substance listing effective date delayed. 3/20/00263 2680 2465* Political party treasurers authorized to sign political contribution refund receipt forms. 3/20/00 264 3232 2692* Business corporations and limited liability companies shareholder rights modified. 3/20/00 265 2603 2346* Permanently disabled hunters permit privileges modified. 3/20/00266 2723* 2528 McLeod County office authority extended. 3/23/00 267 3236* 3236 Vital record certified copy issuance provisions modified. 3/23/00 268 979* 2059 Landlords authorized to apportion utility payments among units. 3/23/00269 1865* 2094 Nursing mothers needs study by the Supreme Court Jury Reform Task Force required. 3/23/00 270 2815* 2386 Hennepin County District Court fine proceeds distribution modified. 3/23/00 271 3064 2776* St. Louis County nursing home renovation approval deadline extended. 3/23/00272 3762 3355* Port authority electronic funds disbursement authorized. 3/23/00 273 2927* 2685 Metropolitan Inter-County Association group insurance protection authorized. 3/23/0018 April 28, 2000HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SF _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 275 2873* 2516 Anoka County department head time requirements clarified. 3/23/00276 3113* 3089 Pharmacies permitted an additional certified technician. 3/24/00 277 118* 160 State agency commissioners acting service time limited. 3/24/00 278 2505* 2289 Annual state park permits effective for a 12-month period. 3/24/00279 2502* 3207 C.

ReflectionsThe State Capitol building, occupied by the Legislature since1905, has often been a re-pository for art by localand national visual art-ists. The permanentworks are diverse. Onecan find paintings offormer governors andCivil War battles, and sculptures of important people who madean impact on the state. Ceiling designs and allegorical murals are also an integral part of the permanent mo-tif of the edifice. Singularly, the buildingitself is a major accomplishment and glori-fication of art and architecture available forall to ponder. But some of the works of art that grace the Capitol are transitory. These are worksthat appear temporarily for a day, or for ashort exhibition in the North Hall off theRotunda. Some school art classes have anannual showing of their students ' best works, while on occasion, some Minnesotaartists ' productions appear. One exhibition of note in 1995 was the newly acquired collection of GeorgeMorrison by St. Paul 's Minnesota Museum of American Art. Five pieces of his work are presently on exhibit by the museum atLandmark Center, as a memorial to hisApril 17 death at the age of 80. The host group for Morrison 's 1995 ex- hibition opening at the Capitol includedtwo artists, Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), and Rep. Leslie Schumacher(DFL-Princeton). Other hosts were mu-seum board members Rep. Steve T rimble(DFL-St. Paul) and Larry Kitto, who hassince died. Early on, Morrison saw himself as an art- ist who was American Indian, rather thanan American Indian artist, but often foundhimself being mis-defined. In Trimble 's opinion, this was \"because he did not paint feathers, beads, and leather as some art crit-ics unfairly expected. \" For those who are intrigued by art, those fascinations are onlyenhanced by Morrison 's outstanding use of imagery that only few artists attain. Born near Grand Portage in 1919, he be- gan his career early with a scholarship tothe Minneapolis School of Art, now theMinneapolis College of Art and Design. After art school, he purchased a one-way ticket to New Y ork City during a new artexplosion in America. There, he becamefriends with Jackson Pollock, Willem DeKooning, and others, and with them, greatly influenced abstract expressionism. Morrison briefly lived in Paris and also taught at the prestigious Rhode IslandSchool of Design before he returned toteach at the University of Minnesota. The artist 's Ojibway roots drew him back to the shores of Lake Superior where someof his best works were produced. \"I guess my religion is nature, \" he once said. It shows in his unique depictions of the lake, sky andhorizon through color, light, and reflections. \"I was always impressed by his imagery, \" even before I knew him, said Peterson. \"He had the unusual ability to take you awayfrom reality in his art of the North Shore,but bring form back to you through hisimages. \" Artist Schumacher, who said she was very honored to meet Morrison and be photo-graphed with him, remarked how impressedshe was by his use of color to depict a senseof place. As his health became worse in later years, Morrison was asked about retirement. Hesaid, \"What are you supposed to do if you don't make art? \" And he did until he died. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERTGeorge MorrisonSession Weekly 23 HF4162-HF4166TAX CUT PROPOSED, SURPLUS IN COFFERS, AND MOREIn this issue: THE 2000 L EGISLATURE CONVENESAPRIL 28, 2000 VOLUME 17, N UMBER 13SESSIONA NONPARTISAN PUBLICATION # # # Weekly MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICEOrder a free copy of New Laws 2000 Complete this form to receive your copy of New Laws 2000 , a publication describing the new laws passed this year.

The House, Senate, and Gov. Jesse Ventura will each designate a third of the $525 million reserved for a combination of permanent tax cuts and new spending, under anagreement announced May 3 by House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon).A three-way split Budget compromise would give House, Senate, and governoreach an equal piece of the piefees to a maximum of $75. That proposal isestimated to cost the state $274 million.Sviggum said the governor 's office still must figure out a tab fee reduction plan that limitsthe state 's costs to $175 million. \"That may not be the tax cut we would have chosen, but it does reduce the tax burden forMinnesotans, \" Sviggum said. Minnesota will lead the nation in tax cuts for the biennium with this package, Sviggumsaid. The Legislature cut taxes by $750 mil-lion last year. While Sviggum said he is pleased with the accord, the $350 million in tax cuts is less thanhalf what House leaders sought prior to thebeginning of the session, when they outlined$850 million in tax cuts. The final agreementis better than nothing at all, he said. \"We can 't just take our marbles and go home, \" Sviggum said. Even with the agreement on permanent money, there is still much to accomplish be-fore the session ends, said House MajorityLeader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan). The questionof how much to spend on one-time fundinghas not been settled. Pawlenty noted the Senate bills spend $25 million more for transportationand $100 million more on bonding projects. The House 's bonding bill is about $400 million, similar to a proposal byV entura. The Senate has proposed about $500million for bonding. However, the bonding priori- ties of the House, Senate, andVentura vary widely. For ex-ample, Ventura has been a strongadvocate of bonding funds for anew Bureau of Criminal Appre-hension laboratory at a cost of$58 million. The House 's bond- ing bill provides for only abouthalf of that figure. The House and Senate have agreed on some areas of one-time spending. For instance,state agencies would receive $10million in emergency fundingrequested by the governor andhigher education will receive$11.6 million. Leaders also agree to spend $270.5 million in federalT emporary Assistance to NeedyFamilies to varying de- grees, \" Sviggum said. Each of the three parties will have about $175 million to work with as they see fit, un-der the agreement. There is a total of $549 million available, be it for permanent tax cuts or other ongoingspending, according to the Finance Depart-ment. The Legislature has already agreed tospend $9.2 million for a criminal records da-tabase and could spend as much as $15 mil-lion for debt service on bonds from this year 's bonding bill. Subtracting the money alreadyallocated leaves $525 million to be split threeways. That money is totally separate from the $1.8 billion surplus forecast for the2000-2001 biennium. Any taxrebates would be drawn fromthat money. Sviggum said he has a verbal agreement from V entura that allof his portion of the money willbe used to cut license tab fees.Sviggum said he plans to holdVentura to that promise. Under the plan, the House would use its third of the pie toreduce taxes. Rep. Ron Abrams(R-Minnetonka) said theHouse 's share would likely go toward across-the-board in-come tax reductions. A decisionon how to split the $175 mil-lion through three tax bracketswill likely be made quickly,Abrams said. Permanent K-12 educationfunding is expected to comprise $125 million of the Senate 's $175 million portion. The Senate is also expected to invest $25 millionfor human services and another $25 millionin natural resources programs. Sviggum stressed that the total tax reduc- tion to Minnesotans will be $350 million un-der the agreement, even though a cut in tabfees was not a priority in the House. The House omnibus transportation bill, currently in conference committee, containedno tab fee cuts. The Senate 's bill, in its current form, would designate 15 percent of the mo-tor vehicle sales tax \u2014 about $80 million \u2014 to reduce tab fees. Ventura advocates reducing all license tab Photo illustration by Tom Olmscheid4 May 5, 2000IT'SAFACT In his message upon vetoing a bill that would have provided reduced marriage li-cense fees for couples who attended premari-tal counseling, Gov. Jesse Ventura wrote thathe did not believe government should inter-vene in such personal decisions. The bill was one of two well-publicized measures considered this year attemptingto address Minnesota 's increasing divorce rate. The other bill, which stalled in com-mittee, would establish a covenant marriageoption in the state, making it more diffi-cult to obtain a divorce for couples whoenter such a marriage. This is certainly not the first time legis- lators have tried to make young couplesthink about their decision to marry or pre-pare for married life. In 1913, when divorce rates had not even climbed to 1 percent, Rep. ClaudeSouthwick, a Republican from Wells, intro-duced a bill that would have requiredpeople to wait five days after a marriage li-cense was issued before the wedding cer-emony could be performed. Southwick, who was single, was the city attorney of Albert Lea prior to his six-yearstint as a member of the House. He had thefurther distinction of being one of threestudents who composed the first graduat-ing class of Wells High School in 1890. The intent behind his bill was to prevent people entering into \"hasty \" and \"ill-con- sidered \" marriages. But not everyone agreed his bill was the solution. C.J. Buell, who wrote several books chronicling the Minnesota Legislature inthe early 1900s, said Southwick 's bill was \"a very good example of ill-advised at- tempts to remedy evil. \" Buell agreed with Southwick that the leg- islation would prevent some hasty marriages.But he argued that other ramifications wouldoccur if the bill were to become law. \"It certainly would open the door to any evil-minded man who wanted to take ad-vantage of an ignorant girl, \" Buell wrote. \"To first get a license and persuade the girl that all legal requirements had been met;live with the girl five days, as his wife, andthen leave her to the tender mercies of so-ciety perhaps with a child to rear, and thescorn of good people to endure. \"But even more pervasive, Buell wrote, was the bill 's provision proposing to abol- ish common law marriages in the state. That type of marriage, which was com- mon in Europe during the Middle Ages, wasa marriage undertaken without either a civilor religious ceremony. In a common lawmarriage, both partners for legal purposesare considered \"married \" after a period of living together as a couple. Recognizing common law marriages as le- gal marriages allowed wives and children toinherit property from the father and husband. Southwick said that such an arrangement led to situations where \"bad women \" used a common law marriage to \"get part of the property of some old rounder who had diedand left more money than character. \" But Buell argued for the state to abolish common law marriages would have placedan undue burden on those \"honest, faith- ful, and pure \" couples who would then have to go before a minister or magistrate to havetheir marriage legally recognized. Buell said Southwick 's bill would have denied wives the right to property and leftwomen and children to face their remain-ing years in poverty and destitution. Further, he said, that to place more re- quirements on becoming married wouldsimply mean more people would ignorethose requirements. Southwick 's bill failed in the House, but his efforts weren 't entirely in vain. In 1941, the Legislature finally banned common law marriages in the state. Thattype of marriage is now recognized in only14 states. In addition, since 1931 couples have to wait five days after applying for a marriagelicense before they can pick it up and walkdown the aisle. As lawmakers continue to examine government 's role in marriage, perhaps Buell 's words provide a common starting point. \"Marriage \u2014 the real true love union of a man and a woman \u2014 is the purest and most sacred relation in all the world, \" he wrote. \"And what we really need is to be educated to look upon that relation in itstrue light, as the one most cherished hopeand grandest consummation of life. \" (D. M AEDA )Taking the plunge Legislator's attempt to make couples wait for marriage fell short they have not settled which programs to sendthe money to. Sviggum said he is still optimistic that the Legislature will settle on a one-time tax rebatehigher than previously estimated. \"We are going to try and supersize the re- bate, \" Sviggum said. He estimates the rebate will be between $800 million and $900 mil-lion. The one-time rebate also will contain aportion \u2014 less than $20 million \u2014 for farmer relief, he said. A few weeks ago, the House proposed a $500 million rebate. Currently, the Senate planwould return $600 million in a rebate. Pawlenty said conference committees will meet throughout the weekend in hopes to havethe non-funding measures completed whilethey wait for budget targets. One of the larger unresolved issues is the Hiawatha corridor light-rail transit project.House Republicans advocate canceling previ- ously allocated funding for the Hiawatha line; the Senate and the governor do not. V enturahas promised to veto any bill that could haltthe project. The Legislature is running out of time to complete its work. After both houses met May4, only four legislative days remained. Underthe state Constitution, no action can take placeon the final, or 120th, legislative day. Legislative leaders can spread those days apart to work on negotiations. However, thesession must be completed by May 22. Ventura has the power to call a special ses- sion to wrap up legislation, but he has statedhe does not intend to do that. Sviggum acknowledged that the plan does not have unanimous support from the Repub-lican caucus, but he believes the major spend-ing bills now have enough votes to pass. The compromise splitting the money three ways evenly was reached after the Senate re-jected a plan that would not have given thegovernor a portion of the allotted money,Sviggum said. While Sviggum said he is happy with the agreement, he is displeased with the processthat led to the compromise. \"It doesn 't feel right. That 's not the premise of good government, \" Sviggum said of the deal. \"That 's not the process we like. \" At a May 3 press conference, House Speaker Steve Sviggum and others from the House RepublicanCaucus announce that the House, Senate, and gov-ernor arrived at a three-way budget agreement.Session Weekly 5APRIL 28 - M AY 4 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #BUSINESS #CRIMEChanging business subsidies The House passed a bill May 1 that would make several changes to a business subsidy lawthat was enacted last session. The vote was133-0. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), who is sponsoring the bill (HF3057/SF2893*), saidthat last year the Legislature passed a law thatdefined, clarified, and established further cri-teria for when financial assistance is givenfrom a public entity to a business. McElroy said the bill would raise the amount of what is defined to be a businesssubsidy as any financial assistance in excess of$100,000. Currently the amount is definedamounts of more than $25,000. Current law also requires wage and job goals of all subsidies. The bill would allow those jobgoals to be set at zero, if it is determined thatjob retention and creation are not purposesof the subsidy. A zero job goal would requirea public hearing. The bill also would allow a recipient of a subsidy to switch locations within five yearsof receiving the subsidy, which is prohibitedunder current law. The bill would allow therecipient to move at any time after a publichearing is held. The bill would make several technical changes. For example, under current law abusiness subsidy is required to meet a publicpurpose other than increasing the tax base.The bill would require a subsidy to meet apublic purpose, which may include, but maynot be limited to increasing the tax base. The bill now goes to the Senate. False ID measure denied A bill that would increase penalties for us- ing false identification to buy alcohol or to-bacco failed in the House April 28, after somemembers expressed concern over questionsabout penalties and public safety. The House returned the bill to conference committee on a 93-33 vote. The bill would allow alcohol providers \u2014 from liquor store clerks to bartenders \u2014 to confiscate what they believe to be false identi-fications. The bill also would increase the pen-alty to a gross misdemeanor for a secondconviction for attempting to purchasealcohol under age 21. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) is sponsoring the bill (HF2655/SF2845*). Shesaid the measure is necessary to enforce thestate 's laws on selling alcohol to minors. \"These are people who are knowingly vio- lating the law, and they are doing it over andover again because there are few penalties, \" Leppik said. \"We have a rampant problem in Minnesota with false IDs. \" On April 28, the Senate approved the con- ference committee report 59-0. Leppik said shedid not expect difficulty in getting the billpassed through the House. \"I think everyone was caught by surprise, \" Leppik said. \"(Opponents) were able to raise enough doubts in people 's minds. \" Leppik said she expects the bill will return to the House floor before the session ends. Shecould not specify what changes she plans tomake to the bill in conference committee. In its current form, the bill would allow the commissioner of public safety to suspend aminor 's driver 's license for up to 90 days if the minor attempted to purchase alcohol withfalse identification. Rep. David T omassoni (DFL-Chisholm) spoke against that provision, saying juvenileswho have their license suspended would havedifficulty obtaining insurance once the licenseis reinstated. #GAME & FISH Captain Chue Chou Tchang, left, salutes as lawmakers recognize the sacrifice of the Hmong veterans who filled the House gallery during session May 4. Other Hmong officers seated onthe House floor were, from left , Captain Neng Mai Xiong, Major Wakai Yang, Lieutenant Cher Pao Pha, and Captain Chong Ge Chang. (See related story, page 9.)HMONG VETERANSRep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said she dis- likes the provision that would allow clerks orbartenders to hold licenses for up to 24 hoursbefore they are turned over to the police. \"It's not a minor inconvenience, \" Kahn said. \"It could be really serious. \" The penalty for clerks who mistakenly sell tobacco to minors would be reduced from agross misdemeanor to a misdemeanor for thefirst offense, under the bill. Rep. Loren Solberg(DFL-Bovey) presented a similar bill earlierin the session, saying the Legislature was tootough on clerks. \"It's over-punishment for a mistake, \" Solberg said. The clerk could still be charged with a gross misdemeanor on a second offense of sellingtobacco to minors, under the bill. The bill now returns to conference committee. DNR enforcement bill rejected The House rejected a proposal to modify the responsibilities of conservation officers inthe state Department of Natural ResourcesApril 28. The vote was 102-27 to return thebill (HF2962/SF3036*) to a legislativeconference committee.6 May 5, 2000When the microphone system on the House floor went haywire April 28, Rep.T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) found aspot where he could be heard loud andclear. Rukavina left his seat and walked to the \"well, \" just in front of the chief clerk 's desk at the front of the House chamber. From that location, his voicecould be heard throughout the room. The House floor, which was designed similar to opera houses, has greatacoustics. \"I think it 's the first time I 've seen it used in my time here, \" Rukavina said. \"I've never seen it used because we had the microphones. \" All legislators know where the spot is be- cause they hear their voice echo when theywalk across that area, Rukavina said. He saidit was fascinating to hear his voice bounce around the chamber and echo back to him. \"It was fun while it lasted, \" he said. Until the late 1930s, when microphones were installed, a legislator would walk to theIn the well Acoustic conventions used in early days of Legislature came in handy when modern technology failed on the House floor well to deliver his speech. A permanentpodium stood in the walkway for legis-lators to place their notes while deliver-ing their speeches. The podium was laterremoved with the installation of themicrophones. The public announcement micro- phone system allowed legislators to stayat their desks. Pages would carryhandheld microphones to legislators ' desks and plug them in. The state hadeight to 10 portable microphones. Now, the microphone system is highly sophisticated. When a legislator picks upthe microphone on the desk, it activatesitself. Because legislators use the microphones at their desks, it is truly a rare occasion whenone speaks before the House in the well. (C. V ETTER ) Conservation officers, like police officers, have authority to give blood-alcohol tests un-der the state 's implied consent laws. But conservation officers can issue those tests only to people who are hunting whileintoxicated, or to those who are intoxicatedwhile driving snowmobiles, motorboats, orall-terrain vehicles \u2014 not automobiles. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), conservation officers ' implied consent authority would be extended to in-clude automobile drivers. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) spoke against the bill, saying conservation officersalready can pull over a vehicle and contact theState Patrol or other law enforcement officerto handle drunken driving incidents. He saidthe DNR officers do not need the additionalauthority. Haas disagreed with Bishop 's objections, saying the increased authority for DNR offic-ers would mainly benefit rural areas. \"(DNR officers) can call for the state patrol or sheriff, but they could be on the other side ofthe county, \" he said. \"That is a waste of time. \" Another provision in the bill would allow the DNR to keep proceeds from the sale of aforfeited vehicle. The bill would require theDNR to use that money for DWI-related en-forcement, training, and education. Bishop said the House wisely removed that provision, or \"open appropriation, \" from the bill, because it would take away theLegislature 's oversight of those funds. Rep. Tom Rukavina speaks from the well of the House cham- ber to be heard as he debated a conference committee reportApril 28. In years past, before the modern sound system wasinstalled in the chamber, members would go to the well to givespeeches.#GOVERNMENTRegarding the open appropriation, Haas said it would rarely be used and it only woulddeal with small amounts of money. Bishop countered by saying, \"If it's not good policy if it 's regularly used, it 's not good policy if it's rarely used. \" Also, the bill would modify some proce- dures regarding forfeited vehicles or property. Under current law, conservation officers can seize firearms from hunters who are violatinglaws, such as shooting at deer from a road orpossessing too many game birds. In some in-stances, the officer later finds out that the per-son illegally possessed a firearm because ofprior criminal convictions or other reasons. In that kind of situation, current law re- quires the officer to send the firearm to thecounty sheriff 's office, even though that of- fice was not involved in the original incident. The bill would allow the DNR to adminis- ter the forfeiture instead of sending it to thecounty. The bill now goes back to the conference committee. Board members confirmed The House confirmed two members of the Campaign Finance and Public DisclosureBoard on May 4. Sidney Pauly of Eden Prairie, a former House member and current board chair, andDouglas Kelley of Bloomington, both Repub- licans, were appointed by Gov. Jesse Venturaand confirmed by the House. Pauly served eight years as a member of the Eden Prairie City Council and 12 years in theMinnesota House of Representatives. She hasserved one term on the board and was re-appointed. Kelley owns and manages a law firm that concentrates on white-collar crime, providesservices in compliance programs, internal in-vestigations, Indian gaming, employment law,and complex civil litigation. Both terms expire Jan. 5, 2004.The board 's stated mission is \"to promote public confidence in state government deci-sion-making through development, adminis-tration, and enforcement of disclosure andpublic financing programs, which will ensurepublic access to and understanding of infor-mation filed with the board. \" The board was established in 1974 as part of the Ethics in Government Act. The six-member board administers programs thatprovide for disclosure of economic interestsand of conflicts of interest for certain state andmetropolitan officials. The board is also re-sponsible for administration of the state 's pub- lic subsidy program, which provides publicfunding for political campaigns. The board 's programs require registration and public disclosure by candidates, politicalcommittees and funds, and lobbyists.Session Weekly 7#HEALTH #LOCAL GOVERNMENTHospital pay bill vetoed Gov. Jesse V entura vetoed a bill May 1 that would have exempted certain public hospitalemployees from state law that sets compensa-tion limits on individuals employed by a city,town, county, or other local governmentagency. The law says that a person employed by a political subdivision, excluding a school dis-trict, may not exceed 95 percent of the salaryof the governor. The bill would have provided an exemption for public hospital administrators, pharma-cists, and psychologists to exclude them fromhaving to comply with limitations on compen-sation. In his veto message, Ventura said the exemp- tion is not necessary because there is alreadyan existing process for public employers torequest exemptions on a case-by-case basis. He continued by saying the Department of Employee Relations and the Legislative Coor-dinating Commission 's Subcommittee on Employee Relations have responded positivelyto exemption requests that demonstrate thatan employer is competing in a national or re-gional market and would have problems at-tracting or retaining employees if forced tofollow statutory salary limits. \"The current exemption process works and should not be circumvented with broad ex-clusions in statute, \" Ventura wrote. Rep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake) and Sen. Mark Ourada (R-Buffalo) sponsored the ve-toed bill. Any override of attempt of the veto would have to begin in the Senate. An override re-quires a two-thirds majority in both houses\u2014 90 votes in the House and 45 votes in the Senate. The first time through, the House voted 74- 52 and the Senate voted 34-27 in support ofthe measure. HF3629/SF2385*/CH448 Complementary health care The House gave final passage to a bill May 1 that would allow the Department ofHealth to oversee complementary and alter-native health care practices and would makepolicy changes to statutes that govern thedepartment 's regulation of other health occu- pations. The vote was 110-23. Sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), the bill (HF3839*/SF2474)would establish an office, housed at the De-partment of Health, for unlicensed comple-mentary and alternative health care. The office would investigate complaintsagainst alternative health care practitioners and serve as a clearinghouse for informationon such practices. The language in the bill that would enable the department to oversee complementaryand alternative heath care practices was addedto the measure in conference committee. As a result, the proposal drew some criti- cism from House members during floor de-bate of the conference committee report. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), a physi- cian, urged members to vote the bill downbecause of the provisions providing for regu-lation of complementary and alternativehealth care. He said there is some fear in the medical community that patients may opt for one ormore unproven alternative treatments insteadof conventional medicine for life-threateningillnesses. \"By passing this bill, we 're going to recog- nize all these procedures that have not beenbased on scientific fact, \" Mulder warned. Goodno, however, disagreed.\"The bill provides for consumer protection and does not encourage the use of proceduresunproven in the medical community, \" he said. Mulder also said many doctors are already using alternative methods to complement tra-ditional medicine. Less controversial parts of the bill would make changes to the regulation of bothspeech-language pathologists and audiolo-gists, unlicensed mental health practitioners,and alcohol and drug counselors. Goodno 's bill also would alter the Admin- istrative Simplification Act by requiring uni-form procedures, both for offering medicaladvice and for explaining health care benefits.The act, originally passed in 1994, was in-tended to reduce certain health care coststhrough simplifying administrative processesand electronic data exchange. The bill now heads to the Senate.Similar language pertaining to complemen- tary health care exists as part of the omnibusstate government spending bill (HF2699), cur-rently in conference committee. Abortion amendment approved During May 1 debate on a bill related to runaways and homeless youth, the Housepassed an amendment that would prohibitstate funding for organizations that provideabortion information, counseling, or services. The amendment was attached to a bill that would rearrange existing law related to run-aways and homeless youth and put the De-partment of Human Services in charge of acomprehensive program to aid such youths.The bill passed 92-40. With the amendment attached, the mea- sure would dictate that \"any entity that is an organization or affiliate of an organizationwhich provides abortions, promotes abor-tions, or directly refers for abortions shall notbe eligible to receive state funds under thischapter. \" Rep. Kathy Tinglestad (R-Andover) is spon- soring the bill (HF2622/SF2865*). The billprovides clarified definitions and other tech-nical changes, and it does not include anyfunding measures, Tinglestad said. Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) offered the successful amendment that would bar or-ganizations that promote or provide abortionsfrom obtaining state money. The amendmentpassed 77-55. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) spoke against the amendment, saying it would effec-tively kill the entire bill. Folliard said Gov. JesseV entura would likely veto the bill if the fund-ing restriction remains. Earlier this session, Ventura vetoed a bill, dubbed the \"Woman 's Right to Know, \" which called for a 24-hour waiting period for abor-tions and would have required women begiven information about the procedure at least24 hours before it could be performed. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) spoke against the Wenzel amendment, saying heworried women and children would sufferbecause other services not related directly toabortion would be inhibited by the amend-ment. Skoglund agreed with Folliard, sayingthe governor would likely strike the entire billdown. However, Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) urged legislators to vote with theirconvictions rather than weighing whether ameasure would be signed. Tinglestad acknowledged that she did not want the amendment attached to her bill. The bill is intended to establish a compre- hensive program in the Department of Hu-man Services to deal with already homelessyouth, youth at-risk of homelessness, andrunaways. Resolving boundary adjustments A law that would clarify the process for resolving disputes over municipal boundaryadjustments was signed April 26 by Gov. JesseV entura. Those adjustments, such as consolidations or annexations of towns or cities, used to beresolved by the Minnesota Municipal Board. The board was abolished in 1999. The Leg- islature had set Dec. 31, 1999, as the date forthe board to expire, but all of the board8 May 5, 2000Many years ago, information about what was going on at the State Capitolrelied heavily on the spoken word.Often constituents found out the newsby talking to their neighbors. Even the way business was conducted by the Legislature was wholly different.Because some legislators were illiterate, theentire text of bills had to be read on theHouse and Senate floor. Now, with the click of a mouse button, information appears on a computer screenfaster than the revolution of a horse buggywheel. In 1993, the Minnesota House of Repre- sentatives established its first Internet pres-ence. That year the House developedresources on Gopher, which was a precur-sor to the World Wide Web allowing usersto search for and retrieve materials fromother sites. It was the first legislative infor-mation to be found on the Internet. The House made available the text of bills and statutes, and other information aboutthe Legislature. There was an average of23,946 requests for information or \"hits\" toOne million hits Legislature's Web site reaches milestone by receiving more than 1 million requests for information in one week the Gopher server per week. It took about10 months to reach 1 million hits. In 1996, the Legislature 's World Wide Web site went online. And last year, the sitehad logged more than 1 million hits dur-ing the first four weeks of January. This year, the House 's Web site reached a milestone. For the week of March 26, theHouse 's site received more than 1 million requests for information in a single week\u2014 for the first time ever. There have been more than 46 million total requests for information since the Leg-islature established its Internet presence.According to the staff of the LegislativeReference Library, an estimated 30 percentto 40 percent of the hits to the Web sitecome from the outside public. Other ma-jor users are legislative staff and staff fromstate agencies.The use of information provided via the Internet is expanding rapidly. Ac-cording to the Computer Industry Al-manac, the United States had morethan 110 million users by the end of 1999, a 62 percent increase from the previ-ous year. As the use of the Legislative Web site (www.leg.state.mn.us) increases, so does theeffort to provide more and more information.In addition to viewing the text of bills andstatutes, users can now find out the authorsand status of bills, view committee schedulesalong with the calendar for the day, and fol-low floor activity via the official Journal. Publications, such as Session Weekly and its online companion Session Daily, are alsoavailable online, as well as links to over2,000 other pertinent Web sites. Live video of floor sessions was also made available for the first time this year. An interim committee of legislative staff will examine ways to enhance and revampthe online information to make the Web siteeven more useful. (D. M AEDA ) #TRANSPORTATIONmembers resigned by June 1999, which leftsome of the adjustments unresolved. At that time, the board 's duties were set to be transferred to Minnesota Planning, a stateagency that acts as a long-range planning armof the governor 's administration. The new law, effective April 27, 2000, clari- fies the dispute resolution process that maybe used, and it authorizes the director of Min-nesota Planning to delegate such disputes tothe Office of Administrative Hearings. Theparties involved in the dispute will share theassociated costs of the resolution process. Some provisions of the new law are retro- active to June 1, 1999, to address the disputesthat were unresolved by the municipal board. The law also requires Minnesota Planning to send a report to the House and Senate com-mittees on local government and metropoli-tan affairs during the 2001 Legislative Session,regarding the effects of the transfer of duties. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) and Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy) were the sponsors ofthe measure. HF3586/SF2951*/CH446Fight over exam stations The House rejected a transportation house- keeping bill May 4 because it did not includea provision to keep several small-town driverexamination stations open. The House sent the bill back to conference committee on a 109-23 vote. Sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL- Harris), the bill (HF3319/SF3160*) wouldmake technical changes to a pilot program onignition devices that automatically refuse toallow drivers to operate vehicles if they aredrunk. An amendment by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL- Granite Falls) was previously included in thebill with the intent of keeping open 22 ruraldriver examination stations that were sched-uled to close May 1, 2000. The measure wouldhave required the Department of Public Safetyto keep the stations open until July 1, 2001. However, Kubly 's amendment was dropped in conference committee, which drew criti-cism from several rural legislators. Rep. GeorgeCassell (R-Alexandria) called for the House tosend the measure back to conference commit-tee, saying the department should have heldhearings about closing the stations, rather than simply informing towns they would be closed. \"It is appropriate to talk to the people af- fected, \" Cassell said. Other rural legislators agreed the stations should be open beyond their new closing date,slated for Aug. 1, 2000. \"It is very important to keep these driving stations open, \" said Rep. Richard Mulder (R- Ivanhoe). \"If it was a good idea (to close them), they should have brought it to the Legislature. \" Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) agreed, say- ing it would hurt small towns across the state. \"It's a fairness issue for rural Minnesota, \" Juhnke said. Managing rail project Under the state 's plan for managing the Hiawatha Corridor light-rail transit project,the Metropolitan Council now has primaryauthority over other state agencies, whichsome House members say is a violation of statelaw. The House Governmental Operations and Veterans Affairs Policy Committee votedMay 1 to request a written opinion on the is-sue from the state 's attorney general.Session Weekly 9Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) proposed the measure, saying state law gives the author-ity for the management of the Hiawathaproject to the Department of Transportation\u2014 not the Met Council. The Federal Transit Authority recently approved the state 's management structure, which was necessaryto allow the federal government to providefunds for the project. Several committee members objected to Krinkie 's proposal to formally ask for the at- torney general 's opinion. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said the committee should not act on the issue becauseit had not been publicized on the meetingagenda. And Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls)said Attorney General Mike Hatch had notbeen notified and was not at the meeting togive his input on the issue. An attempt to adjourn the meeting before the committee could vote on the matter failed. Krinkie said the request is appropriate be- cause the governmental operations commit-tee has jurisdiction over the power andstructure of state government. Also, state lawallows any committee in either the House orSenate, or a Legislative commission, to makesuch a request for the attorney general 's opinion. Krinkie said he had already asked Hatch about the issue in an April 13 letter. In thatletter, Krinkie asked Hatch to investigate pos-sible violations of state law related to the state 's management plan. Also, Krinkie wrote that the Met Council has not completely responded to requests for infor-mation under the state 's data practices laws. Krinkie wrote that withholding information inthat situation could be considered an attemptto influence the vote of a legislator by conceal-ing facts, which is punishable by a maximum offive years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Hatch responded in an April 14 letter that his office does not have jurisdiction over thosequestions and that he forwarded copies ofKrinkie 's letter to the Ramsey County attor- ney, the state auditor, and to the legislativeauditor. The committee 's May 1 vote specifically re- quests that the attorney general issue a for-mal opinion about whether the Hiawathamanagement plan conforms with state law andlegislative intent for the design and construc-tion of the project.#VETERANS Passenger rail compact passes The House passed a bill May 4 that would allow the state to join a compact of Midwest-ern states intended to improve passenger raillines. The vote was 128-2. The Midwest Interstate Passenger RailCompact commission will take effect when it is signed into law by any three states in theMidwest. Currently, only Indiana has signedthe compact. More than three states can be involved in the compact, however. The compact is designed to promote, coor- dinate and support regional improvements topassenger rail lines, said Laura Kliewer, seniorpolicy analyst for the Council of State Gov-ernments, located in Chicago. \"It's an effort among Midwest states to bring improved passenger rail to the Midwest, \" she explained. \"They would have the authority to say, 'It is important to all Midwestern states. '\" States in the commission could lobby on the federal, state, and local level for support onprojects. The Midwest, as defined by the Council of State Governments, stretches as far east asOhio, south to Missouri, and as far west asNebraska and South Dakota. Because the bill calls for a compact, each state must pass an identical version, Kliewer said. The commission would include one legis- lator from each body (or two total from a uni-cameral state) and two appointments of eachgovernor, for a total of four members per state.The commission could meet in person or con-duct business through conference calls,Kliewer said. Legislatures in Missouri, Ohio, and Michi- gan are still working on the compact this year,Kliewer said. Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) is sponsor- ing the bill (HF3688/SF2956*). Sen. SheilaKiscaden (R-Rochester) is the Senate sponsor. The bill now goes to the governor.Helping Hmong veterans The House indicated support for a federal bill pending in the U.S. Senate that wouldmake it easier for Hmong people who foughtfor the United States in the Vietnam War tobecome U.S. citizens. The resolution (HF2216), sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), urges Congress topass and the President to sign the bill, known asthe Hmong V eterans ' Naturalization Act of 1999. Trimble 's measure passed in the House May 4. The vote was 129-0. It now goes to the Senate. Trimble said the resolution would honor the 25,000 Hmong veterans and their widows wholive in Minnesota. The federal bill would allow the veterans to take the naturalization tests in their nativelanguage. It says that many of them did nothave the opportunity for education in theirhomelands, as well. According to the House resolution, Hmong and Lao guerilla units fought along with U.S.clandestine and armed forces during the war,and more than 35,000 soldiers were killed. During the war, the White House National Security Council, in joint cooperation with theU.S. Department of Defense and the Central In-telligence Agency, relied upon Hmong and Laounits and air units in Laos for ultra-sensitiveintelligence gathering programs. They fought inthe U.S. Secret Army with Air America. At the time, governmnet officials promised they would not be abandoned if they helped inthe fight. Many of the soldiers and their familiesfaced retaliation for being involved in the covertoperations, according to the resolution. DAY OF PRAYER Several participants in the May 4 National Day of Prayer gather in front of the Capitol tocelebrate the 50th annual event. The rally included music and speakers representing manydenominations.10 May 5, 2000BY JON FUREA proposal to switch to a one-chamber, or unicameral, legislature has been revived, and it is one step closer to receiving a vote on the Housefloor. The House Governmental Operations and V eterans Affairs Policy Com- mittee voted May 1 to send the bill (HF4147), sponsored by House SpeakerSteve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), to the House Rules Committee. The vote was13-10.Off the mat Once down for the count, a unicameral proposal staggersto its feet, thanks to a House committee Whether the bill will move ahead and come up for a vote on the House floor remained un-certain. Under the bill, a question would be placed on the 2000 general election ballot asking vot-ers, \"Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to provide that the Minnesota Houseof Representatives and Senate be replaced byvote. Before that, the proposal had received many hearings during the interim through-out the state, as well as several committeemeetings during the session. Some committee members denounced the unusual amount of attention that the com-mittee has given the proposal, which is a toppriority for Gov. Jesse V entura and is stronglysupported by the speaker. \"I think this is an abuse of power, \" said Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal). Normally, a bill that has failed in a commit- tee would not be heard again until the nextLegislative session, he added. Others objected to the fact that the Legisla- ture is still in session, considering that Houseleadership had set a goal to adjourn by Easter. Sviggum responded by saying, \"I will take part of the blame for you being here onMay 1. We 're arguing for tax cuts for moms and dads. \" He also explained that he wanted to revive the bill as a courtesy to the governor. Two weeks ago, Sviggum had said the uni- cameral proposal was dead. But V entura re-cently re-emphasized his desire to put thequestion before voters. \"I think it 's appropriate to give Gov. V entura \u2014 and this is his marquee issue \u2014 one more chance, \" Sviggum said. This move comes after V entura invited House Republican members to the governor 's residence for breakfast April 25 so he couldpitch his unicameral proposal one last time. Sviggum cited a recent poll where 82 per- cent of Minnesotans said they would like tovote on the issue. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said that conclusion is not surprising. \"That question is posed in a way that everyone answers 'yes,'\" she said. She added that people would also like to vote on cuts orincreases in taxes, funding for stadiums or the-aters, or any sort of spending items. But Sviggum said the inherent self-interest of the legislators on the unicameral issue doesnot carry over to those other issues. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), chair of the committee, said he also supports put-ting the question on the ballot. \"We take a lot of votes that affect the people of the state, and this would be a chance forthem to take a vote that affects us, \" he said. a single legislative body called the Legislature, beginning in 2003? \" If that question makes it onto the ballot, and if a majority of voters were to support themeasure, the one-house legislature wouldconsist of 135 districts. Currently there are 67Senate districts, each of which is divided to make 134 House districts. The proposed terms would be four years, and they would be staggered \u2014 half of the members ' terms would expire every two years. If the voters were to approve the constitu- tional amendment, the people who takeoffice in 2001 would have the task of re- drawing district boundaries and establishing specific rules for those who would later beelected to the unicameral legislature in 2003.

Laws governing registration and disclosure of lobbying activities were passed during the1974 legislative session \u2014 nearly 20 years af- ter initial recommendations for such laws. Many of those initial provisions are still in effect, while new ones have been added overthe years. Still, perceptions about back-roomdeals and wining and dining of legislators stillcolor public opinion. Back in the late 1950s, when lobbyists were routinely wining and dining legislators, therewas no clear trail to the interests lobbyists wererepresenting, and the public had no way toLaws on lobbying Concerns about public perceptions prompted firstefforts to register and monitor lobbyists address those concerns without creating acumbersome bureaucracy for lobbyists. Butsome lawmakers felt strongly that lobbyistswere expressing important views and thatright should not be inhibited in any way. Gov. Orville Freeman decided an impartial group should evaluate the situation and de-termine whether a formal state law governinglobbyists was necessary. In 1958, Freeman ap-pointed a 12-member commission that stud-ied the issue for 18 months, without pay. In his speech when he appointed the Com- mittee on Ethics in Government, Freeman saidthat lobbying is an important function, pro-viding important points of view. He chal-lenged the panel to determine whether federallaws regulating lobbyists and such measuresenacted in other states were effective andshould be implemented in Minnesota.\"Governmental processes today involve weighing the arguments on one side in bal-ance with the arguments on the other, andlobbies fill a useful and necessary function inpresenting such arguments, \" Freeman said. \"But there exist serious problems relating to lobbying. . . . And it may even conceal its ex-istence by failing to openly state what andwhom it represents. \" The committee, led by Rabbi W. Gunther Plaut of St. Paul, determined that lobbyistsshould register and should be required to re-port who they represent and how muchmoney they spend \u2014 both during the session and during campaigns. Specifically, the committee found it was per- fectly acceptable for legislators to support a partyplatform or otherwise work to promote the in-terests of schools, taxpayers, business, or otherlegitimate groups. However, perceived behind-the-scenes decision-making that was pervasiveat the time was not acceptable. \"It is one thing to pledge publicly to sup- port an already formulated and publishedplatform of a group, and quite another to bar-ter away secretly in advance his independenceof decision on public issues that may comebefore him for action, \" the committee wrote in its report. \"The question is not whether in fact a leg- islator or public official . . . has actually votedor acted differently from what he would havedone without having so compromised him-self. The real question is whether he has notput himself in a position where public doubtsmay arise as to his loyalty to the public ser-vice and even as to his integrity and the integ-rity of others in the public service. \" In 1959, the Senate passed a rule that re- quired lobbyists to register with the secretaryof the Senate. An early tally of registered \"lob- byists \" was 31, including one House member and 12 staff members at the University ofMinnesota. Several attempts to require a similar pro- cess \u2014 where lobbyists would register with the chief clerk in the House \u2014 failed. In fact, from 1957 to 1971, the years pre- ceding the enactment of legislation to regu-late lobbyists, more than 20 bills wereintroduced in the House alone to require reg-istration and disclosure of expenditures. Four times the House passed such a bill, but the Senate did not take up the matter.HISTORY # # # determine just how much money lobbyistswere spending to perform their duties.

Furthermore,he questioned the lengths to which lobbyinggroups would go to make sure legislationturned out in their favor.

Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) was a school teacher when he was drafted by the U.S. Army in 1969. While Biernat did not see action overseas, he workedwith personnel who fought while he was stationed at Fort Benning in Geor-gia, and experienced the bitter reaction that many Vietnam veterans receivedafter the war was over.Remembering Vietnam Twenty-five years after fall of Saigon, Legislators reflect ontheir experiences during the Vietnam War and its impact ontheir livesPEOPLE # # # \"It was quite hurtful to see how poorly many who had served their country in the war weretreated upon their return home, \" Biernat said. As the history books say, the goal of U.S. involvement in Vietnam was containing thespread of communism in Southeast Asia. TheU.S. government attempted to accomplish thistask by supporting the anti-communist regimeknown as the Republic of Vietnam (SouthVietnam) in its battle against a communisttake-over. But the United States ' involvement in the war continues to be a hotly debated topic.Some question whether the problems in Southeast Asia were military in nature, or ifour country 's involvement had more to do with political and economic gain. Biernat recalls watching the vicious fight- ing on television at night, he said. During thewar, South Vietnam not only had to contendwith the military power of its communistneighbor, the Democratic Republic of Viet-nam (North Vietnam), but also faced a com-munist-led revolutionary movement within itsown borders.On April 29, 1975, the city of Saigon fell to the communists, essentially marking the endof the conflict. North Vietnamese militaryunits were successful in bringing the fightingto a close, but insurgency among the peopleof South Vietnam is said to have allowed thatoutcome to occur. Troop support at home during the war was low. Biernat said he hopes that in the future,the United States has strong support for acause before the government commits troopsto engage in combat. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) agreed with Biernat. Her husband, Doug,served at a radio communications post for theMarines in the village of Dien Ban for severalyears, beginning in the late 1960s. \"I've always viewed war veterans as people who take their patriotism very seriously, \" McCollum said. \"It's a shame the servicemen in the Vietnam War didn 't receive the support they rightly deserved. \" McCollum said she and her husband met shortly after his return from the war. She re-members some people expressing disapprovalover the fact she was dating a Vietnam vet-eran early in their courtship. Twenty-five years after their marriage, McCollum and husband Doug are discussinga trip to Vietnam. \"Doug would like to go back, and I 'm in- terested in joining him, \" she said. As the anniversary of the war 's end came and passed, thoughts centered on soldiers whohave yet to be accounted for. Officials estimate 2,000 U.S. servicemen re- main unaccounted for in Indochina, includ-ing 1,500 in Vietnam. The process of locatingthe servicemen or finding out what happenedto them has been slow and often frustratingfor families and officials in the United States. McCollum has worn a Vietnam POW/MIA bracelet around her wrist since 1969. Earlier this month, Gov. Jesse V entura signed a resolution calling for the presidentand Congress to take whatever action is nec-essary to obtain the release of Americans whomay be still being held against their will inNorth Korea, China, Russia, and Vietnam. Theresolution was sponsored by McCollum andSen. Charles W. Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul).

Unlike modern county facilities, where jail- ers sometimes sit behind bulletproof glass andhave doors with electronic locks and otherhigh-tech features, Haugerud and his \"guests \" at the jail got to be pretty close. In a recently published book, Haugerud, who served in the House from 1968 to 1977,describes some of his adventures as a sheriffin rural Minnesota in the 1950s and 1960s. Haugerud said he has told many of the sto- ries in conversations with friends, and he be-gan taking writing classes in 1994. He receiveda lot of positive feedback from his classmates,and he wrote a column in the Fillmore County Journal , a local weekly newspaper, called Jailhouse Stories . The book carries the same title, and it fea- tures short stories about the people he metwhile working as the main law enforcementofficer in the county, which is in southeasternMinnesota. He served the same district currently rep- resented by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston). The building that the Haugeruds called home contained jail space on both levels. Bothfeatured heavy steel bars with four separatecells, each with two bunks \u2014 a total 16 beds in eight cells. \"We were one of the last sheriff families that served in an era when the family residence,the sheriff 's office, and the jail were all in one building, \" he writes. \"In many ways we became a family. It is out of respect for these charac-ters that I write. \" His wife, Helen, cooked meals for the inmates, responded to calls on the two-way radio, andJailhouse confessions Former legislator and sheriff tells tales of his life as a rurallaw enforcement officer and jailer in a new bookPEOPLE # # # helped out with other office duties. Many of thestories reveal how the prisoners of the jail ben-efited from that family-like atmosphere. In one of the stories, Haugerud writes about a recent conversation with a man who hadspent time in his jail and later the state prisonat Stillwater. Haugerud had called the man,and found that he had stayed out of troubleafter serving his time. He wrote a letter for thebook, which reads in part: \"I later realized the importance of where it starts. The way you are treated in jail beforeyou are sentenced. I thank you and your depu-ties for the way you treated me. Also your wifefor all the good food, especially on Thanks-giving and Christmas. \" Other stories reflect Haugerud 's tendency to defuse, rather than escalate, conflicts. In one situation, Haugerud had beencriticized for notputting in jail twoparticipants in a barfight. But his re-sponse was, \"I told them a sheriff 's job wasn 't to punish, but to keep thepeace. I said it was alot easier to stopfights if you had areputation for beingconsiderate. \" In another, about 400 members of theNational Farm Or-ganization plannedto stop a weeklyauction to protestlow commodity prices, and threats of violencehad been rumored. Haugerud went to theevent armed not with a gun, but with a friendwho had an 8 mm camera. The sale took placewithout any major incidents. He later learned that a similar protest oc- curred in Wisconsin, where two of theorganization 's members were run over by a truck and killed.Many of the people who spent time in the Fillmore County Jail had been taken in forpublic intoxication, while others had commit-ted more serious crimes, such as burglaries,thefts, or domestic abuse. Haugerud describesthe various people he met and the things helearned about dealing with people in thosesituations. \"When you can personalize it and bring the characters out, that 's what makes it interest- ing,\" he said. In the book 's final chapter, Haugerud writes about his own recent brush with law enforce-ment officers. He was arrested in Iowa by someover-zealous officers in 1996. He had beenwalking home after attending an evening class,and he had stopped for dinner at a local sportsbar. He saw two officers harassing anotherman, and when one officer told Haugerud toget moving, he replied \"I think I 'll just watch. \" He was arrested for public intoxication, and he spent the night in jail. He describes themany differences in how he was treated com-pared to how he had treated the people he hadtaken into custody. The next day, he appeared in court and was found not to have violated the law in any way. Haugerud 's experiences as a sheriff had in- fluenced him to run for the House. Amonghis main goals were probate reform and otherreforms of the judicial system. In those days, anyone who received an Neil andHelen Haugerud Continued on page 16.The Fillmore County Jail, which has now been converted to a bed and break- fast, used to serve as the office and home for the county sheriff.

Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) said the same poll that Sviggum referred to foundthat only 24 percent of the people felt that theyhad enough information to make an informeddecision on the issue. But the committee voted against an amend- ment that would have required the Office ofthe Secretary of State, along with the Officeof the Attorney General, to prepare a votersguide that would explain the common argu-ments for and against the proposal. That amendment had been added to the bill that had failed to advance out of the StateGovernment Finance Committee. \"It is critical that if we put this on the ballot that voters be informed, \" said Rep. Mark Gleason (DFL-Mpls). Kahn also stressed the importance of an impartial voters guide, especially due to apamphlet that has been distributed by thegovernor 's office and Minnesota Planning. According to the agency 's Web site, it 's mis- sion is to \"provide policy-makers and the pub- lic with accurate information and analysisabout emerging and critical issues, influencepolicy decisions for a better future throughlong-range planning and keep Minnesotansfocused on the future. \" Critics point out the pamphlet does not contain any of the arguments against a uni-cameral legislature. The bill now heads to the House Rules Committee. When a bill is introduced andconsidered this late in the legislative session,the Rules Committee must determine whetherit can bypass the normal committee processand deadlines and go straight to the floor fora vote. In Freeman 's third inaugural address in 1959, he implored legislators to heed the wordsof the committee and pass some legislation toheal some of the rifts in the public trust. \"As elected representatives of a free people, we assume the responsibility of expressing, inour attitudes and our actions, the highest ethi-cal aspirations of the people of our state, \" Free- man said. \"The search for personal advantage or private gain has no place in our publicservice. \" In 1971, a special committee on ethics to the House of Representatives noted in its re-port that there were no laws governing ethics.The committee noted that there should besuch laws accompanied by a unit of state gov-ernment to keep track of the information andfield complaints of any kind. That plan came to fruition in 1974 when the Legislature adopted the Ethics in Govern-ment Act. The act established the Ethical Prac-tices Board, now the Campaign Finance andPublic Disclosure Board, to govern lobbyingand campaigning. In addition, the act established reporting and registration requirements for lobbyists, aswell as campaign staff. The board estimates there are currently 1,300 registered lobbyists in the state. Continued from page 11Continued from page 10 Continued from page 13 inheritance had to get an attorney and go through the probate process, he said. The at-torney could immediately collect a percent-age of the estate, while the heirs had to waitindefinitely for their share of the estate. Mean-while, the money would sit in an account with-out drawing interest. Haugerud talked to a judge about such an incident, and the judge said there was noth-ing he could do about it. So when Haugerud began his career in the Legislature, he introduced several bills thatsought to change state law related to estatesand other judicial issues. But he said his bills did not receive hear-UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE . . .ings in the Judiciary Committee, a committeethat entirely consisted of attorneys back then. So Haugerud spoke to then-Speaker Martin Sabo, a DFLer from Minneapolis, andthe two were instrumental in adding a newHouse rule regarding committee membership.That rule states that \"a committee of the House must not have exclusive membership from oneprofession, occupation, or vocation. \" He also accomplished some of his goals by attaching an amendment to a related bill. Hisamendment was to eliminate the attorneys ' ability to collect their fee before resolving anestate. He later served as chairman of the State Appropriations Committee, which at that timeset the budgets for 41 state agencies. The com-mittees were organized differently back then,so the departments under that committee 's purview included the Highway Department,the State Supreme Court, and other agenciesthat are now under separate committees. Haugerud also was instrumental in convert- ing abandoned railroad tracks into recre-ational trails, which he said was controversialat the time. Farmers had wanted to buy thatland, and Haugerud said he nearly lost an elec-tion due to the unpopularity of converting itto trails. But now recreational trails such as those in the Fillmore County area, also known as bluffcountry, are becoming increasingly popular. Haugerud said he plans to write another book in the same vein about the characters hemet while working in the Legislature.

Session Weekly 17HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking new laws, vetoes Once a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto.

ReflectionsIf it were not for some well-known dig- nitaries ' decisions during the early years of the nation 's history and in the history of Minnesota 's past, the state today would be a very different locale, guided by some un-known public policies. Imagine! If Benjamin Franklin had not persisted in adopting the international bor-der between Minnesota and Canada, mostof the state, northern Wisconsin, and all ofLake Superior would have been lost to GreatBritain. Imagine that the nation 's third president, Thomas Jefferson, was not a dreamer whofollowed his vision by defying critics of hisLouisiana Purchase for future expansion ofthe country. What if he had not sent the Lewis and Clark expedition into French territory, orapproved a trek by Zebulon Pike to exploreand set up a government fort at the con-junction of the Minnesota and Mississippirivers?It is highly likely that Minnesota would not be the state it is today. It could havebecome a part of Missouri, based on a veryexclusive wording to its originalconstitution. Just imagine if Jefferson did not add to the Declaration of Independence, \"that all men are created equal, \" and have the rights to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi- ness. \" Would members of the Minnesota constitutional convention have written Ar-ticle I, Sec. 2, that states \"No member of this state shall be disenfranchised or deprivedof any of the rights or privileges secured toany citizen thereof \"? What if the state 's lawmakers in 1895 did not extend parameters for legislative policyby heeding the words of Gov. CushmanDavis that \"The best constitution . . . is that one which, while it secures the essential andprimary rights of the people [but] leavesthe greatest possible power to legislative action \"? And what if the 1899 Legislature ignored Gov. John Lind 's unparalleled speech to lawmakers when he called for taxation re-form, support for education, and his ac-knowledgment of society 's acceptance of individuals suffering from social ills beyondtheir control? Minnesota and its government are a di- rect outgrowth of national and regional vi-sionaries. As the 81st Legislative Sessioncomes to a close, Minnesota 's 201 lawmak- ers have made some difficult decisions forthe state 's system of government by which to function. Likely, the compromises andconclusions they make are the correct onesfor Minnesotans.

Printedon recyledpaperGovernment 9 Higher Education 11 Human Services 11Session Weekly 3FIRST READING # # # BY JON FUREThe House and Senate agreed to a bonding bill May 9 that would spend $640.3 million for repairs to state facilities and new construction projects. The two bodies reached a compromise late in the game after their origi- nal proposals of $532 million from the House and $762 million from theSenate.Ready to break ground House and Senate members settle on bonding priorities tosplit the difference between original proposals emergingfrom the bodiesU of M facilities Overall spending for higher education would be $231 million, $176.3 million ofwhich would come from general obligationbonding. For most projects, the college oruniversity pays one-third of the payments onthe debt, or they are partially funded throughmatching non-state funds. T otal bonding for the University of Minne- sota would be about $100.2 million. The largest expense would be $35 million for a Molecular Cellular Biology building. A proposed new Art Building would receive $18.5 million, which would be spent if theuniversity raises $23 million in non-statematching funds. A $10 million Microbial and Plant Genomics building at the U of M campus inSt. Paul also would be funded, which wouldrequire $10 million in non-state matchingfunds. The Duluth campus would receive $6.1 mil- lion for a music performance center, but itwould not receive funding for a proposedsports center. Other U of M projects that would receive funding include $8 million for a science andmath building in Morris, $6.5 million for a building renovation and addition in Crookston, and $6 million for greenhouses inSt. Paul. The bill would provide $9 million for main- tenance and repair projects on all U of Mcampuses.That final amount includes $470.9 million in general obligation bonding, and $98 mil-lion in direct spending from the state 's gen- eral fund. Nearly $30 million would be savedby canceling funds for capital projects ap-proved in previous years. The bill would spend about $100 million more than earlier proposals by the House andthe governor. Part of the increase is attribut-able to Gov. Jesse V entura 's requirement that $44 million be spent from the general fund topay for transit in the metropolitan area \u2014 a proposal that had not been in his capital bud-get plan or in the House or Senate versions ofthe bonding bill. That provision was part of an end-of-ses- sion agreement that would allow the gover-nor, House, and Senate to each decide how tospend a portion of the projected ongoing bud-get surplus. V entura 's portion includes reduc- tions in license tab fees for motor vehicles andthe transit spending. V entura has repeatedlysaid that the Legislature should focus on bond-ing this year, and that he opposes any supple-mental spending. Of that $44 million, $25 million would be spent in fiscal year 2001 and $19 million wouldbe spent in fiscal year 2002. That money wouldmainly pay for designing and building an ex-clusive bus transitway, including the costs ofacquiring land and right-of-way. The bill doesnot stipulate where such a transitway wouldbe built, but the speculation is that it wouldrun between downtown St. Paul and the Min-neapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The bill would prohibit that money from be- ing spent on light-rail transit or commuter rail. In addition, the bill includes one of Ventura 's top priorities, bond funds for a $58 million Bureau of Criminal Apprehensionbuilding. A policy change related to the sale of bonds also is included in the bill. Current law thatgives the governor leeway in issuing bondswould be repealed. That law allows a gover-nor to refuse to sell bonds, thereby causing aproject to languish. The bill would give that authority instead to the commissioner of the state Departmentof Finance.The commis-sioner flow requirements for making debtpayments, and other financial or legal factors. Here are some other highlights of the bill (HF4078), sponsored by Rep. Jim Knoblach(R-St. Cloud) and Sen. Linda Berglin(DFL-Mpls). Rep. Jim Knoblach, right , and Sen. Linda Berglin take a closer look at a provision of the bonding bill during a May 8 meeting.4 May 12, 2000IT'SAFACT The first woman to be Minnesota 's first lady wasn 't always enamored with her adopted home, and she let her husbandknow about it. Anna Ramsey, wife of the first governor of the Minnesota T erritory, found thingsdifficult during her first Christmas seasonin the frontier town of St. Paul. Her husband, Alexander Ramsey, had left Anna, who was busy with one child and an-other on the way, in St.Paul while he was awayon travels that kepthim from home forthe holidays. In a letter written on Christmas day of 1849,Anna showed littlecheer. \"Oh, Alex, could [you] be here we sufferwith cold, [you] wouldnever want to winteragain in St. Paul, \" Anna wrote. \"I know I will not. I nearly frozeto death in bed as well as out. \" Anna was 19 when she married Alexander in 1845. He was 30 and alreadybuilding a political career as a congressmanfrom Pennsylvania. Alexander became a dominant figure in early Minnesota history. He was appointedgovernor of the new Minnesota T erritoryin 1849, and he later served as the state 's second governor, mayor of St. Paul, U.S.senator, and U.S. secretary of war. Anna 's life was dominated by the arc of her husband 's political career. She followed him to St. Paul, Washington, D.C., and else-where. And she lived within the confines of her era \u2014 when women in her position were expected to be subservient to their hus-bands, to handle domestic concerns, andto function as the head of the family 's pres- ence in religious and social circles. She kept up a proper public face andFirst winter for first lady Anna Ramsey found frontier life less than pleasant during her early days in Minnesota filled her role well, but Anna lived a some-times stifling existence that limited publicexpressions of her personal opinions. Things were different in private. Letters exchanged between Anna and Alexandershow that the pair communicated openlyand frankly, for better or worse. The letter written on that cold Christ- mas Day was among the unhappiest ofthose that survive the family 's papers held by the Minnesota His-torical Society, accord-ing to a 1977 article inMinnesota Historymagazine. \"My health is not very good. I suffer somuch with head-aches, \" Anna contin- ued in that 1849correspondence. \"I do hope [you] will has-ten. It is such forlornliving alone in a hor-rid place such as this.I think it intolerable. \" She closed her letter by telling her husband that he \"shall never leave me again so long. I will not stay. \" Of course, she did stay. And if Anna 's first months in Minnesota were unhappy anddifficult, her outlook improved with time.She made her home in St. Paul until herdeath in 1884, although she spent longstretches away from the city over the years. Even in unhappy times, Anna main- tained a sense of humor. Her 1849 letter included a description of her attempts to enjoy the outdoors dur-ing a northern winter. Anna said she founda sleigh ride along the river to be \"splen- did,\" as did her toddler son, Alexander Jr. \"Sonny enjoys it amazingly if mama will hold him and not let him get cold. Unfor-tunately, mama is losing her lap, \" the preg- nant 23-year-old wrote. (N. H EAL Y) MnSCU construction Projects in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) system would receive$131 million, $96.8 million of which wouldbe in general obligation bonding. Anoka-Hennepin T echnical College would receive $12.5 million under the House bill forroof repairs; improvements to the heating,ventilating, and air conditioning system; andother necessary repairs. The MnSCU Board ofTrustees had voted to close the school, but thebonding bill would make the repairs neces-sary to keep it open. An $11.7 million information technology center at Minneapolis Community and T ech-nical College would be funded. The bill would provide $6.9 million for con- struction of athletic and academic facilities atMinnesota State University, Mankato. Themoney would be part of the Taylor Centerproject, which benefited from a $9.2 milliondonation from Minnesota Timberwolves ownerand Mankato businessman Glen Taylor. Maintenance and repair projects through- out the MnSCU system would receive $30million. MnSCU requested $100 million formaintenance and repair, and officials said atleast $56 million would be needed to preventthe system 's $500 million maintenance back- log from growing even larger. The bill specifies that the maintenance and repair money would pay for several projectsthat were line-item vetoed by Ventura last year,including a new boiler system for WinonaState University and the completion of a heat-ing and air conditioning project at theHutchinson campus of Ridgewater College. A project that would demolish old homes on property owned by Moorhead State Uni-versity and expand parking would receive $3.6million in direct spending from the state 's gen- eral fund. Other MnSCU projects slated for funding under the bill include $11.4 million for a sci-ence building at Normandale CommunityCollege in Bloomington, $11 million for gen-eral renovation at North Hennepin Commu-nity College in Brooklyn Park, and $8 millionfor a remodeling project at St. CloudT echnical College. Several other MnSCU campuses would re- ceive funding under the House bill, includingNorthwest Technical College in Bemidji, St.Cloud State University, Northland Commu-nity Technical College in Thief River Falls,Winona State University, Itasca CommunityCollege in Grand Rapids, and Rochester Com-munity and T echnical College. Continued on page 23Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical SocietySession Weekly 5MAY 5 - 11 , 2000HIGHLIGHTS # # # #AGRICULTURE Omnibus policy bill passes The House passed an omnibus agriculture policy bill May 9 that would bring uniformityto the state 's meat inspection program and update state references to federal food lawregulations. The vote was 115-16. The bill (HF3312), sponsored by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus), would bring poultry up topar with other meats and meat products forpurposes of inspection. Inspections of poul-try, however, would not be required during theslaughter of one 's own animals or at a custom processing plant, under the bill. Poultry products would also be allowed to carry the \"Minnesota Approved \" label. The omnibus policy bill also would add sev- eral new activities to those that would qualifyfor a Department of Agriculture grant of upto $50,000 for the development of new farmproducts, as well as business and marketingplans for the products. Corporate farm law changes included in the bill would allow nonprofit groups such asscout troops, churches, and sports clubs toretain ownership of agricultural land rentedto a neighboring farmer. Limited liability com-panies would be able to own farmland andengage in farming, as well. Certain corporations would be permitted to own up to 40 acres of farmland so long asthey earn no more than $150 per acre per yearfrom the land. In addition, a non-qualifying entity could apply for a \"commissioner 's exemption \" (re- newable annually) for permission to retaintitle to farmland. Under the bill, the commissioner of the Department of Agriculture would be requiredto team with the University of Minnesota, theDepartment of Trade and Economic Devel-opment, and the Board of Animal Health todevelop a pilot program for verifying claimsmade by agricultural producers and busi-nesses. Finally, the bill would make relatively mi- nor changes to fertilizer and grain warehouseprovisions in current law. The bill now heads to the governor.

The vote was 130-0. Under the bill, any potential agricultural contract would be required to contain a clearstatement of the risks the producer faces byentering into the contract, and producerswould be allowed to review the contract forup to three days before signing it. Sponsored by Rep. Elaine Harder (R- Jackson), the measure (HF3534) would alsorequire that the contract be legible, clearly laidout, and contain a cover sheet with an indexto the contents of the contract and a warningto producers to \"read your contract carefully. \" Under the bill, a producer would be allowed to ask the commissioner of the Departmentof Agriculture to review a contract and certifythat language in the proposed contract com-plies with requirements contained in themeasure. The bill would allow a court to change the terms of a contract if it found a lack of clarityor readability had confused the producer andresulted in financial harm. Finally, the bill would specify certain kinds of agricultural contracts that would not besubject to minimum standards, and wouldestablish limits on the extent to which pro-ducers and contractors could use the formatof a contract to claim damages against oneanother. The bill now goes to the governor.Gas station franchises Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law May 5 that regulates franchise agreements between gasstations and fuel providers. Fuel providers generally enter into a fran- chise agreement with stations operated by in-dividuals but owned by the gas company. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), House spon- sor of the measure, said it clarifies what canbe written in marketing agreements. The lawprotects small businesses, Haas said. The key aspect of the law allows the gas sta- tion management the right to purchase thestation before the gas provider decides to sellthe store to another gas provider. For example, if a company were going to sell a T exaco station to a provider for Amoco,T exaco would have to offer the station to thelocal management first. That section expires in one year. Officials say the repealer is intended to allow both par-ties to find a better working arrangement andcontinue negotiations if initial offers are un-acceptable. Haas said the first right of refusal is neces- sary because fuel providers can sell the sta-tion to another fuel provider. The new ownermay attempt to close service centers to openconvenience stations. Without the first right of refusal, a6 May 12, 2000#CRIMEneighborhood mechanic could suddenly lose his or her job when the station 's ownership changes hands, Haas said. Other states, such as California, have en- acted similar legislation to protect franchisees,Haas said. When a gas supplier enters into a market- ing agreement with a person to operate a sta-tion, the supplier is required to submit ahistory of how much fuel was sold, any pos-sible adjustments to property or surroundinginfrastructure, and the names of the peoplewho operated the station for the past threeyears, under the law. For example, if the city where the station is located plans to close down streets surround-ing the station, thereby affecting business andprofit, the gas company is obligated to informthe station management of those situations. A variety of items can be included in fran- chise agreements. Gas suppliers can requirestations to be open a certain number of hoursa day. A fuel supplier is not prohibited fromremodeling or altering a full-service station. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the Senate version. The law is effectiveMay 6, 2000. HF1748/SF1870*/CH456 Study on felony DWI Legislators have agreed to study possible felony penalties for repeat drunken drivingoffenders, but no felony penalties would beimplemented this session, under a bill theHouse passed May 10. The vote was 125-6. Previously, legislators had sought to make it a felony for a person to accumulate fourDWI convictions in a 10-year span. Under anearlier proposal, violators could have servedseven years in prison, with a minimum of a180 days stayed sentence in jail. The maximumfine would have been $14,000. In the bill 's current form, a working group would be created. The group would includelegislators from both houses, the commission-ers of corrections, public safety, and finance,county attorneys, and public defenders. The working group would study and rec- ommend how to implement felony penalties.It would determine the most cost-effectivemanner, the number of offenses needed toreach a felony-level, the length of incarcera-tion, and whether a penalty should have man-datory prison time. \"It assumes there will be a felony DWI, and this is how to best implement it, \" said Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center), whoserved on the conference committee. It is still unclear what the total cost wouldbe to incarcerate repeat drunken driving of- fenders, although one report estimated itwould add 1,100 people to the correctionssystem. \"The governor said he would veto the bill if there were unfunded local costs, and state costswere unfunded, \" Carruthers said. \"The issue of costs has to be handled, and next year in abudget year would be the time to do it. \" Because of the cost issue, the original House bill had offered to delay implementation un-til 2001 to give legislators time to find a fund-ing source. The original Senate bill would havecreated felony drunken driving offenses thisyear, but eliminated the offense in 2001 if nofunds were available for additional correctionscosts. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) and Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington) are chief spon-sors of the legislation. The bill (HF2995/SF2677*) now heads to the governor 's desk. Public Safety Commissioner Charlie Weaver, right , talks with Rep. Doug Fuller as they wait for Senate members to arrive for a May 5 conference committee hearing on a DWI bill. Statute of limitations extended Domestic abuse victims would have more time to consider filing civil charges against theperpetrator, under a bill the House passedMay 9. The vote was 130-0. The bill (HF47/SF11*) would extend the statute of limitations in domestic abuse casesfrom two years to six years. A victim could sueanother person for assault, battery, false im-prisonment, or personal injury, as defined bythe statutes on domestic abuse. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), who spon- sored the legislation, said the statute of limi-tations would begin at the point of the lastincident. \"So many times, these domestic abuse wrongs are covered up or delayed, \" Bishopsaid. \"It doesn 't surface for a long time. \" The bill also would allow Ramsey County to establish a pilot project domestic abuse unit. The unit would aim to prosecute cases, rec- ognize interests of children in abuse cases, andreduce the exposure of domestic abuse forvictims. If Ramsey County chooses to create the pro- gram, the county would be required to reportits results to the Legislature next year. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. Hearing harassment complaints Judges would have more discretion in hear- ing harassment cases, under a bill the Housepassed May 9. The vote was 129-0. Sponsored by Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), the bill (HF2516*/SF3580) would redefineharassment to include a single incident thathas a \"substantial adverse effect. \" Current law requires repeated incidents for an act to beconsidered harassment. Smith said the key provision of the bill is that it does not require judges to hear everyharassment complaint. \"It gives the court the flexibility they wanted after 10 years of looking at this statute, \" Smith said. A judge could throw out frivolous harass- ment complaints, such as name-calling, Smithsaid. The judges would then have more timeto hear serious harassment matters, he added. The state began tracking restraining order filings in 1992, when 4,800 were filed. Last year,8,800 retaining orders were filed. A victim must allege a clear and present danger of harassment before the court mayissue a temporary restraining order, accord-ing to the bill. However, the bill does not eliminate a fee waiver on restraining orders. In certainSession Weekly 7#EDUCATIONcircumstances of financial hardship, men and women who file for restraining orders can stillattempt to have all costs and fees for filing theorder waived. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk. Sharing juvenile information School officials will be required to share information about delinquent juveniles withthe juvenile justice system, under a law signedMay 5 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The law also al-lows information about delinquent juvenilesto be shared within the school, as deemed nec-essary. If school officials catch a student who is on probation using alcohol, tobacco, or con-trolled substances, or being threatening orbringing a weapon onto the school grounds,the officials must notify the juvenile justicesystem that the student has failed probation,the law states. Schools also must notify juvenile justice of- ficials if the student engages in theft or van-dalism. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), who sponsored the measure in theHouse, said it seeks to balance the rights ofstudent 's privacy and protecting the public. \"It's a start toward the responsible sharing of information between the juvenile justicesystem and the schools, \" McGuire said. \"The goal is really to help the student. All the peopleinvolved with the student would have the his-tory. \" A school official must notify the student 's parents or guardian that the juvenile justicesystem has been notified, the law states. Currently, the juvenile justice system gives schools a disposition order that states a childhas been delinquent and is on probation. The new law requires the disposition order to be placed in the student 's permanent record. Disposition orders follow a student if he orshe transfers schools. A school counselor also must be notified of the disposition order. The law further clarifies which school offi- cials would know that a student is on proba-tion. The principal may notify district officialsfrom employees to substitutes or volunteerswho are \"in direct contact with the student \" that he or she is on probation. Disposition orders are considered private information. Teachers, counselors, or staffmembers may not disseminate the informa-tion to school personnel who are not in con-tact with the student. The school must destroy disposition orders once the student graduates or when that per-son reaches age 23.Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) also car- ried the legislation in the Senate. The new lawtakes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF2833*/SF2891/CH451 False ID measure passes The House passed a false identification con- fiscation bill May 9 that strengthens penaltiesfor people under age 21 who attempt to pur-chase alcohol by using a fake ID. The vote was84-43. It took a third try for the House to finally pass the plan, after sending it back to confer-ence committee two previous times. The bill would allow alcohol providers \u2014 from liquor store clerks to bartenders \u2014 to confiscate what they believe to be false identi-fication cards. The person confiscating theidentification would be required to turn it overto the police within 24 hours. The bill also would make it a gross misde- meanor on a second offense for a person un-der age 21 to attempt to buy alcohol. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) is sponsoring the bill (HF2655/SF2845*). Shesaid the bill is necessary to enforce the state 's laws on selling alcohol to minors. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Brainerd) spoke in favor of the bill, saying there has to be con-sequences for using false identification. \"If we don 't pass this, we will be sending a message to our kids that it is ok to have fakeIDs to purchase alcohol and tobacco, \" Hasskamp said. The House rejected the bill and sent it back to conference committee last month, sayingthere were too many concerns about personalsafety. Many of those legislators voiced theiropposition again when the bill returned to thefloor again with few alterations. \"It gives bouncers authority that virtually no one else in the state has, \" said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls). Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) noted that the penalty would be lower if underagepeople stole alcohol instead of purchasing itillegally, under the bill. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said she fears for the safety of women who might be bulliedby a bouncer. One change made in conference commit- tee would lessen the penalty for clerks whomistakenly sell tobacco to minors. The pen-alty would be reduced from a gross misde-meanor to a misdemeanor for the first offense,under the bill. The clerk could be charged with a gross misdemeanor on a second conviction withinfive years of selling tobacco to minors, underthe bill. The five-year provision was addedduring the recent conference committee, de- creasing the possible charges against clerks. \"It makes it better for the real victims, the store clerks, \" said Rep. Bob Gunther (R- Fairmont.) The bill would allow the commissioner of public safety to suspend a minor 's driver 's li- cense for up to 90 days if the minor attemptedto purchase alcohol with a false identification. The bill goes to the governor. Agreement on Profile Legislators were able to tentatively agree May 9 on modifications to the Profile ofLearning and to allow districts to choose be-tween continuing its use or implementing theprescribed alternative called the North StarStandard. Last minute talks about fine-tuning the of- ten-criticized Profile delayed House votes onfour important spending bills. In a night oftalks between the House and Senate, majorspending bills were put on hold until legisla-tors could agree on changes to the Profile. However, neither the House nor the Senate has officially passed the compromise bill yet. The Profile of Learning is a companion to the state 's other graduation requirement - the basic skills tests. A year ago, legislators failed to reach an agreement on how to improve the initiative,and for a while, it looked as if both houseswould adjourn again this year without a solu-tion. The Profile has been criticized by teachers and school districts for excessive paperworkand problems with implementation. It was created to shift learning away from textbooks and lectures and move it in the di-rection of experiments, teamwork, research,and independent projects. Under the Profile, students are required to perform various tasks in core learning areasthat have practical applications for life beyondthe classroom. The agreement would allow school boards to vote to choose whether to use the Profile, arevised version of the Profile, or the new NorthStar Standard. T eachers would serve advisoryroles in the decision-making process. \"T eachers won. They 're now going to have some say in what 's going on in the classroom, \" said Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls). Representatives of Education Minnesota (the teachers union) and others also expressedpleasure that the Legislature was able to finallytake action to change the Profile, and for theflexibility that the agreement allows districts.8 May 12, 2000Part of that flexibility would be the ability to abandon the Profile altogether in favor ofthe North Star Standard. The North Star Standard was designed as a knowledge-based alternative to the Profile. Itwould ease the Profile 's practical skills orien- tation. It would also spell out rewritten stan-dards in such basics as science, math, English,and history. Under the North Star Standard, students would have to complete credits in up to 10learning areas. T eachers would still be able toassign projects designed to test a student 's ability to understand and apply subject mat-ter, but such hands-on demonstrations wouldno longer be a standard requirement. Districts that would choose to stay with the Profile would vote on a school-by-school ba-sis on the number of Profile tasks required forhigh school graduation. This year 's ninth- and tenth-graders would be excused from Profile requirements. Edu-cators have said this session they were wor-ried that some students would be denieddiplomas because implementation problemsput completion of the Profile 's 24 content standards out of reach for some. The class of2002 would be the first to be held to the Pro-file of Learning or North Star Standard as ameasure for graduation. A vote on the Profile of Learning agreement is expected during House and Senate floorsessions May 17. STATEHOOD WEEK #ELECTIONS#GAME & FISH As part of Minnesota Statehood Week, historic interpreter David Geister dressed in 1850speriod costume to play Lewis McKune, a farmer from Waseca and delegate to the MinnesotaConstitutional Convention in 1857. He displays a map of the territory to sixth-graders fromOnamia Elementary School, who traveled to the Capitol May 10.Elections bill advances The House gave final passage to a bill May 9 that would make minor changes in state elec-tion laws. The vote was 132-0. The bill (HF2826), sponsored by Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), would modify the begin-ning dates of terms of offices, among otherminor changes. Names of candidates could be printed on both sides of a primary ballot, which Seifertsaid would allow counties to save money inprinting costs. He estimated that HennepinCounty, for example, would save $145,000 perelection. T erms of office for soil and water conserva- tion district supervisors, school board mem-bers, town officers, and hospital districtofficers would begin the first Monday in Janu-ary, instead of Jan. 1, following an election. Also, current law allows county, state, and federal candidates to file for office if they areaway from the state during the filing period,and the bill would extend that to apply to can-didates for municipal offices.The bill also would extend the time period for a candidate to withdraw his or her namefrom the ballot. The secretary of state would be required to notify each minor political party by the firstMonday in January of each odd-numberedyear of the conditions necessary for the partyto participate in programs involving campaignmoney from income tax and property taxforms. The bill now goes to the governor. Major changes in store A bill that would increase fees for hunting and fishing licenses, establish a state plan formanaging the wolf population, and allocate aportion of revenue from lottery ticket sales topay for natural resources projects was passedMay 9 by the House. The vote was 87-44. The bill (HF3046), sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), had once containedonly the license fee increases. But as action forthe session wound down, three other promi-nent natural resource issues were included inthe measure. License fee increases first passed the House April 13, and the Senate added the provisionsrelated to the wolf management plan and lot-tery ticket revenue. The bill also includes aminor change in a law that was signed April 3allowing lighted fishing lures to be used in thestate.The fee increases would send more money to the game and fish fund, which pays forprojects that improve water quality, stock fishand enhance aquatic vegetation, increase pub-lic water access, and other such projects. Money from the license fee increases would be matched with revenue from the state 's gen- eral fund. Under the bill, $2 of revenue from the fee increase would be matched by $1 from thegeneral fund. The fee increases are projectedto raise about $3.1 million in revenue for the2002-03 biennium, and the general fundmatch would be slightly more than $1.5million. The bill also would include a $500,000 gen- eral fund appropriation to pay for walleyestocking. The lottery ticket revenue provision that was added to the bill would further increasefunding for game and fish projects, as well asprojects for state parks, recreational trails, andzoos. Those projects would receive 97 percent of the money that the state collects as a paymentin lieu of sales tax on lottery tickets. Of theproceeds from lottery tickets, 16 cents perdollar goes to the state 's general fund, which includes 6.5 cents per dollar that is considereda payment in lieu of sales tax. The wolf management plan under the bill is nearly identical to a plan that was approvedApril 11 by the House (in the form of a sepa-rate bill, HF1415). The Senate had clarified part of the bill thatSession Weekly 9would allow a person to shoot a wolf that is attacking livestock or domestic animals. Thebill would specify that the person could shootthe wolf only on the person 's property. A certified predator controller could be hired to trap wolves in an area where a wolfhas destroyed livestock or domestic animals.The trapping could be done on the farmer 's property and in a one-mile radius of the siteof the attack for 60 days. A person could shoot a wolf in defense of a human life, and guard animals could be usedto repel or destroy wolves. People could \"harass \" a wolf that they actu- ally see within 500 yards of people, buildings,livestock, or domestic animals to discouragewolves from getting too close to homes orfarms. Any incident where a wolf is killed would have to be reported within 48 hours to theDepartment of Natural Resources or a Uni-versity of Minnesota extension agent. Compensation for a livestock owner who has an animal that is killed by a wolf would bebased on fair market value instead of the cur-rent maximum of $750 per animal. No hunting season for wolves would be al- lowed for five years after the wolf is removedfrom the federal list of endangered species. Butthe bill would allow the commissioner of theDNR to prescribe open seasons and restric-tions for taking wolves after the five years andafter receiving comments from the public. Violating the laws related to killing wolves would be a gross misdemeanor, under the bill. The bill now goes to the governor. Fishing contests, hunting laws A bill that would limit the number of fishing contests in the state and make other changes tohunting and fishing laws was passed by theHouse May 9. The vote was 131-0. People who want to have fishing contests would need a permit unless several criteria aremet: the number of participants would befewer than 30 for open water and fewer than150 for ice fishing; the entry fee is $25 per per-son or less; the total prize value is $25,000 orless; the contest is not limited to trout speciesonly; the contest is not limited to specificallynamed waters; and all the contest participantsare age 18 years or under. If those criteria are not met, the person could apply for a permit from the Departmentof Natural Resources. The bill (HF866/SF1288*) would limit the number of permits that could be issued dur-ing the fishing season. And on all waters 55,000acres or less, the DNR commissioner could setaside at least two weekends per month withno permitted fishing contests.A contest for a species on its opening day would not be allowed. The commissioner would be allowed to specify restrictions as part of the permit toprevent undue loss of fish or to accommodateother concerns regarding large fishing con-tests. Another provision in the bill would improve some people 's chances of getting a license to hunt moose. Minnesotans who have appliedfor and failed to get a license at least 10 timeswould be able to apply in a separate selectionprocess. The separate process would make 20 per- cent of all moose-hunting licenses availableto those applicants who have repeatedly failedto win a license. The state issues a limited number of such licenses every other year, through a lotterysystem that includes all applicants in one pool.In 1999, 189 licenses were issued to hunt innortheastern Minnesota. There will not be amoose hunt in 2000. A new deer license would be established under the bill, which would allow the holderto take one antlered buck throughout the state,rather than from a particular area. The licensewould cost $66. Deer licenses currently cost$22, and a separate bill would increase thatto $25. Another provision would allow a person with mental retardation or a related conditionto receive a provisional firearms safety certifi-cate and hunting license. The bill would require the person to com- plete the classroom portion of the firearmssafety course. The person would be able to hunt only while accompanied by a parent, guardian, or otheradult who possesses a firearms safety certifi-cate. The bill would not apply if the personwere otherwise prohibited from possessing afirearm under state or federal law. The bill also would attempt to resolve ques- tions about state lands within the BoundaryWaters Canoe Area. The state owns about 100,000 acres of land, known as school trust land, in that area. Mostof the land was donated from the federal gov-ernment when Minnesota became a state. The state-owned land is located on various parcels and is surrounded by federal land.Revenue from the land, through leases and thesale of logging rights, goes to the state 's per- manent school fund. The University of Minnesota, Duluth would conduct an inventory and appraisal of the statelands. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) said the inventory would determine exactly how manyacres of land belong to the state and provideother detailed information about the land.Rukavina said that information would al- low the state to negotiate a land exchange withthe federal government, so that the state-owned parcels would be separate from the fed-eral land. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), now goes to the governor. DNR enforcement bill The House passed a bill May 9 that would modify some of the procedures used by thestate Department of Natural Resources re-garding DWIs, forfeited vehicles, or property. The bill (HF2962/SF3036*), sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), was altered by aHouse-Senate conference committee after theHouse had objected to provisions in an ear-lier version of the bill. One would have expanded the authority of DNR conservation officers to give blood-al-cohol tests under the state 's implied consent laws, and the other would have allowed theDNR to keep proceeds from the sale of a for-feited vehicle. Both provisions were removedby the conference committee. The bill would allow the DNR to adminis- ter forfeiture procedures in some situationsthat currently are done by the county sheriff 's office. Under current law, conservation officers can seize firearms from hunters who are violatingcertain laws, such as those prohibiting shoot-ing at deer from a road or possessing too manygame birds. In some instances, the officer laterfinds out that the person illegally possessed afirearm because of prior criminal convictionsor other reasons. In that kind of situation, current law re- quires the officer to send the firearm to thecounty sheriff 's office, even though that of- fice was not involved in the original incident. The bill would allow the DNR to follow for- feiture procedures without involving thesheriff 's office. Also, the commissioner of natural resources would be required to develop plans for deal-ing with gross violations of game and fish laws.A report for defining and determining penal-ties for gross violations must be completed bythe department and delivered to the Houseand Senate committees on natural resourcespolicy and finance by Feb. 1, 2001. The bill now goes to the governor. #GOVERNMENT Dead, alive, and dead again A proposal to switch to a one-chamber, or unicameral, legislature was approved May 8by the House Rules Committee, but even thebill's sponsor says it is unlikely to advance to10 May 12, 2000a vote on the House floor before the session adjourns. The bill (HF4147) was sent to the House floor, but members then voted to send the billto the House Ways and Means Committee May9. The vote was 76-54. The bill would allow voters to decide if the Minnesota Constitution should be amendedto replace the state House of Representativesand Senate with a single legislative body calledthe Legislature, beginning in 2003. The Rules Committee voted against an amendment that would require the Office ofthe Secretary of State, along with the Officeof the Attorney General, to prepare a votersguide that would explain the common argu-ments for and against the proposal. \"This issue will bring a lot of people out to vote, and they will be informed, \" said House Speaker Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), sponsorof the bill, at the Rules Committee hearing. Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen- ter), a co-sponsor of the proposal, said thatmost other proposed constitutional amend-ments have not had voters guides. \"I don 't know if we need the government to lay out the pros and cons on this issue, \" he said. Sviggum, who has supported the unicam- eral concept for several years, said it wouldenable citizens to understand the lawmakingprocess better and it would make lawmakersmore accountable for their votes. Some committee members criticized the proposal 's lack of details. If the voters were to approve the constitutional amendment, thepeople who take office in 2001 would have thetask of re-drawing district boundaries andestablishing specific rules for those who would Former Gov. Al Quie testifies in favor of a unicameral form of state government during a May 8 hearingof the House Rules Committee. later be elected to the unicameral legislaturein 2003. But Carruthers said lawmakers could make the decisions about the specific committeeprocess and other details if the voters approvethe overall concept. \"The big issue clearly would be before the people \u2014 should we switch to a unicameral system or should we stick with bicameral? \" Carruthers said. If that question makes it onto the 2000 elec- tion ballot, and if a majority of voters were tosupport the measure, the one-house legisla-ture would consist of 135 districts. Currently,there are 67 Senate districts, each of which isdivided to make 134 House districts. The proposed terms would be four years, and they would be staggered \u2014 half of the members ' terms would expire every two years. The entire Legislature would be up for elec-tion the year after districts are redrawn, whichis done every 10 years, following a census, toaccommodate shifts in population. To achieve the staggered terms, half of the legislators would serve an initial term of twoyears. The other half would serve a two-yearterm at the beginning of a decade, just beforethe redistricting takes place. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall) said he does not oppose Sviggum 's bill, but that two-year terms would be a better idea. The longer termsmake it easier to avoid \"change-of-mood years, \" he said. The state Senate, for example, has not been up for election in some recentyears where major political tides have changed,he said. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) said that lawmakers benefit from running foroffice every two years by participating invarious community events and knocking on doors before the election. \"It keeps you more in tune with the people in your district, \" she said. Sviggum countered by saying that the uni- cameral system would make it easier for citi-zens to follow pending legislation, so thatpeople would likely participate more duringthe lawmaking process instead of waiting forthe election season. With only two official days left for the Leg- islature to conduct business, the bill only couldbecome law if it is approved by the Ways andMeans Committee, then gets a majority ofvotes before the entire House and Senate, andis signed by the governor. Data practices revisions The House passed a bill May 9 that would clarify the state 's laws regarding government data practices. The vote was 129-0. The bill (HF3501), sponsored by Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), would clean up lawsrelating to how government agencies collectand disseminate information, as well as pub-lic access to that data. Holberg said the bill would allow the Department of Labor and Industry and theDepartment of Revenue to exchange informa-tion relating to employees for tax administra-tion purposes. The bill also would establish an adminis- trative process for people who believe that agovernment agency is not complying with lawsgoverning public access to data. Such a com-plaint would be filed with the commissionerof the state Department of Administration,who would then be required to conduct aninvestigation to determine whether the com-plaint is valid. The bill also would require every govern- ment entity to appoint or designate a personas its data practices compliance official. Thatofficial would be the one who will answerquestions and concerns regarding problems inobtaining access to data. Government agencies would also be re- quired to make public data stored on com-puters available in an electronic format if thegovernment entity can reasonably make thecopy or have a copy made. The governmententity may require the requesting person topay for the cost of the copy. The bill also allows counties to approve a system in which a notice is included on prop-erty tax statements notifying taxpayers thattheir name and other information may be dis-closed for non-government purposes includ-ing surveys, marketing, and solicitation. The county would be required to allowSession Weekly 11#HIGHER EDUCATION#HUMAN SERVICEScitizens to request that their name be excluded from lists generated by the county and dis-closed to non-government entities. The bill also would limit tort liability against municipalities in claims based on alleged oractual inaccuracies in geographic informationsystems data arising from the public 's use of that data. Such data is used by municipalitiesfor mapping, districting, and zoning purposes. The bill calls for the municipality to pro- vide a disclaimer of the accuracy of the infor-mation. The bill aims to clarify that geographicinformation systems data is accurate for itsintended use by a municipality and may beinaccurate for other uses. The bill now goes to the governor. Setting pay for MnSCU officials A new law signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura May 5 will change the way the salary is deter-mined for the chancellor of the state 's largest higher education organization. Currently, the board sets a specific salary amount that is then approved by the Legisla-ture. The current salary for the chancellor is$185,000. Under the new law, the Board of Trustees of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities(MnSCU)will be allowed to establish a salaryrange for the chancellor position. The boardwill then submit the proposed salary range tothe Legislature for approval. The new law also will allow the board more flexibility in the contracts they offer to presi-dents and other non-classified positionswithin the MnSCU system. Under current law, the board is allowed to propose a salary range for its presidents, whichthe Legislature approves. The new law will al-low the board to submit to the Legislature pro-posed contracts with other incentives toattract candidates. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), the House sponsor of the measure, said that increasingcompetition from other states has made re-taining and recruiting quality people in thepositions more difficult. He said he aims togive MnSCU more options to attract quali-fied candidates. Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls) was the Senate sponsor. The new law is effec-tive August 1, 2000. HF3726/SF3386*/CH453Protecting vulnerable adults The House passed a bill May 9 that would create a panel to review decisions made by leadagencies regarding cases of potential maltreat-ment of vulnerable adults. The vote was 129-0.Sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL- Mpls), the bill (HF3250/SF3028*) would pro-vide a vulnerable adult or individual actingon behalf of such a person the opportunity tochallenge an agency 's decision before an im- partial body. Currently, Greenfield said, a vulnerable adult or person acting on his or her behalf hasno other place to appeal but to the agency thatproduced the decision. The board created by the bill would consist of representatives from the Department ofHuman Services and the Department ofHealth, the ombudsman for older Minneso-tans, and the ombudsman for mental healthand mental retardation. A request for a review, the bill states, would be taken up at the panel 's next quarterly meeting. Greenfield referred to the measure as a \"quality assurance approach \" to reviewing decisions in cases of potential maltreatmentwhen the bill was first considered by the Housein April. The bill would require that within 30 days of the panel 's review, it must notify the lead agency and the person who requested the re-view of its decision. The panel may decidewhether it agrees with the agency 's decision or require the agency to reconsider its ruling. If the panel were to decide that the agency must reconsider its disposition, the bill wouldrequire the agency reconsider and report backto the panel with its determination within 30days. Furthermore, the panel would be required to report to the Legislature each January thenumber of requests for review it received, thenumber of cases where the panel required thelead agency to reconsider its decision, thenumber of times when the final dispositionwas changed, and any recommendations toimprove the review or investigative process. A provision in the bill adopted by a House- Senate conference committee would requirethat the commissioner of the Department ofHuman Services offer medically necessary psy-chiatric and dental services to developmen-tally disabled clients in the Faribault servicearea, which would extend 100 miles aroundthe city. The bill now heads to the governor 's desk.

The bill also would provide money to school districts for vocational education and build-ing improvements, and fix a funding problemfor charter schools that would allow them tolease buildings more easily. The measure is larger than the two previ- ous non-budget year funding measures. How-ever, both the law in 1998, spending $124million, and the measure from 1996, allocat-ing $31.7 million, dealt only with K-12 edu-cation. This year 's bill also includes higher education and early childhood and familyeducation items. Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), spon-sor of the (HF3800), said thespecial moneydistricts would receive un-der the bill and the train-ing and experience moneywould especially help dis-tricts that are facing bud-get cuts. Under the bill, the state 's special education fundingcap would be increased by$83 million, she said. Aboost in cross-subsidyspecial education aidwould allow districts tofree up money to spendelsewhere, perhaps restor-ing some cuts made in past years. Some of those cuts came in the form of teacher layoffs. The growing problem of teacher shortages and the decline \u2014 especially in rural areas \u2014 of experienced instructors in Minnesota class-rooms is addressed in the bill by a provisionthat makes it easier for districts to bring inteachers from other states. Minnesota 's Board of T eaching would be required under the bill to issue a temporaryteaching license to a person holding both abachelor 's degree and an out-of-state teach- ing license requiring such a person to havecompleted a teacher preparation program,which included field-specific teaching meth-ods and student teaching. The bill also would provide $30.8 million to districts for teacher training, and experi-ence replacement. The provision is designedto fill the vacancies left by a great number ofteacher retirements and other factors withhigh quality classroom leaders. In addition, the bill proposes $31 million to soften the phase-out of a program that gavemoney to districts having large numbers ofteachers with extensive experience or ad-vanced degrees. \"I'm proud to vote in support of this bill because we, as a body, are finally making thenecessary commitment to education, \" said Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul). \"We're showing that education is our top priority. \" The bill would provide about $11.6 million to the Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU) system to address unexpectedincreases in enrollment. The money \u2014 $5. 8 million in the current fiscal year and $5. 8 million in fiscal year 2001\u2014 would come from the state 's general fund. The bill also would spend $9.8 million in federal T emporary Assistance for Needy Fami-lies (TANF) funds in 2001, with future TANFspending of $23.7 million in 2002-03, for pro-grams such as male responsibility and father-hood grants, child care services, transitionalhousing and citizenship grants. Approximately $12 million dollars for sec- ondary vocational aid is part of the proposal.The additional aid for high school programswould be spread out over a two-year period. The omnibus education spending bill also makes an attempt to protect students fromInternet material considered obscene or harm-ful to minors. All public school and public library com- puters with access to the Internet available foruse by children under the age of 17 would needto be equipped with up-to-date software fil-tering technology or other methods to restrictstudent viewing of inappropriate material. A public library would not be required to purchase filtering technology if the library would incur more than in-cidental expense in mak-ing the purchase, however. If behavioral problems arise in a classroom, thebill would allow teachersand certain other schoolemployees to use \"reason- able\" force to discipline a student. The provisionwould include languagepertaining to the legal de-fenses teachers and dis-trict agents have againstprosecution for usingforce to disciplinestudents. The bill would permit reasonable force to corrector restrain a student or to prevent bodily harm to another. Furthermore, districts would be required to indicate in school discipline policy the circum-stances under which teachers, school employ-ees and school bus drivers may use force todiscipline students.

The vote was 110-21.The big bill Human services items dominate state governmentappropriations bill, though environmental, judicial, andeconomic development programs are in the mix The version of the bill originally passed in the House called for a cost savings to the gen-eral fund of about $42 million. After a confer-ence committee compromise, the final versionof the plan actually allocates $79.9 million innew general fund spending, primarily tohealth and human services programs. Nearly every major area of state government spending jumped in the final product passedby both the House and Senate. Several noteworthy policy provisions once included in the House bill (HF2699) weretaken out during the previous weeks and actedon individually after concerns were raised thatthe omnibus bill might violate the Minnesota Constitution 's requirement that laws be lim- ited to a single subject. Those items included proposals related to felony drunken driving charges, a waitingperiod for abortion, and establishing an of- fice for alternative health care providers. The omnibus bill would spend $79.9 mil- lion from the general fund and another$105 million from other accounts, including$100 million in federal T emporary Assistanceto Needy Families (TANF) funds. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) sponsored the bill, which now goes to the governor. Health and human services The largest portion of the bill deals with health and human services programs, whereit would spend a total of $138 million \u2014 $26 million from the general fund, $12 mil-lion in forecast changes, and $100 million in TANF dollars. Proposals to in- crease sanctionsfor people who failt o m eet w \u2014 for re- cipients who wereout of compliancea sixth time. The bill would pump $26 million into improving salaries forcertain health care providers, creating a 3 per-cent cost-of-living increase. There also was acost-of-living increase last year.This provision applies to staff in nursing homes and group homes, and for care pro-viders who serve people with disabilities. Eligibility for the state 's senior citizen drug program would be expanded, under themeasure. Beginning later this year, the income limits for seniors would be increased to allow morepeople to receive aid under the program. In2002, the program would be expanded furtherto include people with permanent disabilitieswho meet the same income limits. MFIP programs would receive $20 million in TANF money for county-level interventionto provide family employment grants. Moneywould be used to help hard-to-employ indi-viduals, who face barriers such as transporta-tion problems, chemical dependency, lack ofeducation, or the inability to speak English. Jobs, development, and housing The bill would provide $6.6 million toward economic development programs. Among the highlights are $1 million in grants that would be used to expand Internetservices in rural towns. Another provisionwould provide $1 million to boost tourism innorthern Minnesota. The Job Skills Partnership Board could of- fer grants for distance-work projects, underthe bill. Grants could be used to train ruralworkers in new technology or purchase equip-ment such as telecommunications infrastruc-ture, computer upgrades, or software. Among the policy measures, the Depart- ment of Economic Security would be requiredto develop a 10-year plan for locatingworkforce centers near campuses in the Min-nesota State Colleges and Universities system. The bill also would increase penalties for businesses that violate child labor laws. Manyof the fines have not been updated in severalyears. And the bill would appropriate $50 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.Approximately $30 million would go towardbuilding and financing affordable housingunits. It is estimated that 1,163 units will likelybe developed and maintained by this money.The remaining $20 million is an interest-freeloan to Habitat for Humanity.

The House and Senate had been deadlocked for weeks over the amount available for tax cuts. \"The process we got here is not one that cov- ers any of us with a great deal of glory, \" said Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the bill 's spon- sor and chair of the House Taxes Committee.\"The bill that is before us probably does not sat- isfy the Republicans. It probably does not satisfythe DFL members. The only one who may betotally happy here is Gov. Ventura. \" Abrams words were a reflection on the agreement designating a third of the $525million available for permanent tax cuts andspending measures to the House, Senate, andthe governor for each to decide how to use. The original House omnibus tax bill would have provided income tax cuts of about$501 million for 2000. The final version of thebill calls for income tax cuts of about$142 million for that period. The bill (HF4127) incorporates the governor 's proposal to reduce license tab fees in the state. Under the measure, the maximumA fat load of tax cuts House passes tax bill including $142 million in income taxcuts and license tab fee reductions and a $685 million salestax rebateAT ISSUE: TAXES # # # tab fee would be set at $189 in the second yearof a car 's life and $99 in the third through tenth years. The fee in the first year would remainunchanged, as would the minimum $35 taxthat applies to all cars older than 10 years. For the second year in a row, income tax rates in all three brackets would be provided.Here 's how the proposed cuts break down. In the lowest bracket (paid on income up to $25,680 for married couples and up to$17,570 for individuals), the rate would bereduced from 5.5 percent to 5.35 percent. In the middle bracket (paid on income up between $25,680 and $102,030 for marriedcouples and between $17,570 and $57,710 forindividuals), the rate would be reduced from7.25 percent to 7.05 percent. The upper bracket rate would be reduced from 8 percent to 7.85 percent for income over$102,030 for couples and over $57,710 forindividuals. For an unmarried head of household, the lower bracket rate of 5.35 percent would beapplied to income up to $21,630, the middlerate of 7.05 percent would be applied to in-come up to $86,910, and the upper rate of 7.85percent would be for any income over $86,910.Rep. T om Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) criti- cized the rate reduction for the upper bracket,saying that the state 's wealthy stand to benefit from the cuts in all three brackets. He said thestate 's lower wage earners pay the highest per- centage of their income in taxes. But House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) said that those who pay the mosttaxes should get the most relief. \"Fairness is based on getting back what you pay in, \" Pawlenty said. \"This (bill) is a modest step in the right direction. It is fair, propor-tional, and weighted toward the middle class. \" The bill also would provide a one-time $635 million sales tax rebate, based on 1998receipts. Abrams said the rebate is similar tolast year 's, though it is smaller. Rebates for married couples and heads of households would be at least $168 and couldgo as high as $2,400. For other filers, the mini-mum would be $95 and the maximum wouldbe $1,200. Taxpayers could expect a check of about 40 percent to 45 percent of what they receivedlast year and the rebate checks would bemailed out in August, he said. People eligible for the automatic rebate would be those who had income tax liabilityin 1998, those who filed a claim for the 1998property tax rebate, and those who had socialsecurity income in 1998. Unlike last year 's re- bate, dependents would be eligible for a re-bate equal to 35 percent of the amount anon-dependent would receive. Abrams said that the bill would provide agri- cultural assistance for farms located in 31 coun-ties that were declared disaster counties in 1999by President Clinton or were contiguous to adisaster county. Farmers in those counties wouldreceive a payment equal to $4 for each acre cov-ered under crop insurance in 2000. The bill also would increase the percentage of earnings used in calculating the state 's working family credit. That credit is similarto the federal earned income credit that pro-vides a wage supplement equal to a percent-age of the earnings of low-income individuals. The bill would increase the percentage of earnings used in calculating the working fam-ily credit so that for all claimants, the creditequals at least 25 percent of the federal earnedincome tax credit. The bill now goes to the governor. House Tax Conference Committee chair, Rep. Ron Abrams, right, smiles at his Senate counter- part, Sen. Doug Johnson, as they discuss who will most benefit from a tax rebate during arecent hearing.Session Weekly 17AT ISSUE: TRANSPORTATION # # # BY CHRIS VETTERA $600 million transportation funding package passed by the House May 9reflects a number of changes from the original version passed last month. The original House bill would have cancelled remaining funding for the Hiawatha light-railtransit project and would have bonded for bridgeand building improvements. The new bill preserves light-rail funding and appropriates cash for nearly all transportationitems. \"This is a well-balanced bill, \" said Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), sponsor of the House bill.\"It finally puts an emphasis on transportation. It's one of the best opportunities we 've had in transportation in a long time. \" The bill (HF2891) won final passage on a 96-35 vote. The bill features $405 million in cash spend- ing for road improvements. House leaders have said it 's important to take advantage of the $1.8 billion projected surplus for the bi-ennium and fund areas that have beenunderfunded in recent history. The Department of Transportation would spend $177 million for eliminating bottle-Funding bill on track House passes $600 million package that saves light rail andreturns emphasis to neglected infrastructure, backers say necks on Twin Cities highways and another$177 million on rural interregional corridors,which are major roadways that connect urbanand rural areas. Another $100 million for transportation will come from trunk highway bonds. The bill does not include any new funding for Capitol Security or increases in the num-ber of troopers assigned to the governor 's se- curity team. The Senate had sought $232,000for more troopers at the Capitol. Transit debate During negotiations over the weekend of May 6 and 7, House members on the bill 's con- ference committee agreed to drop their stanceof repealing $92 million in bonds for light-rail transit. \"Without the support of the Senate and gov- ernor, we really didn 't have a choice, \" Molnau said. \"You have to know wherereality is. \" Provisions in two other billsthat might havehalted light railhave also beenremoved be-cause of a vetothreat. It is unclear if the has Gov.Jesse V (DFL-Willmar) gested the governor use a portion of the $175million he could allocate for permanentspending toward transit needs. The governor, House, and Senate leaders agreed last week to split available money threeways \u2014 giving the House, Senate andgovernor each $175 million to spend however they wanted. \"If there is more money for transit, it must come from other sources, \" Johnson said dur- ing conference committee negotiations. The transportation finance bill faced oppo- sition from some metro legislators, who alsosaid it would not adequately fund transit pro-grams. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring LakePark) noted that only $20 million of the fundswould go toward transit. \"The emphasis on transit is missing, \" Johnson said. \"It's a very shortsighted man- ner in dealing with transportation. \" Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) agreed that the bill is far from balanced. \"It is an absolutely perfect bill, for the 1950s, \" Wagenius said. \"It's not perfect for now or the future. \" The governor succeeded in getting some of his desired transit funding elsewhere. Hepushed to get $44 million to pay for transit inthe metropolitan area included in this year 's capital projects bill (HF4078). That 's short of his original request, and it left him with lessmoney to devote to cutting fees for licenseplate tabs. While the bill would not strip funding for light rail, a provision remains that would notallow the Department of Transportation toseek federal funds for the Hiawatha line un-less the money is available to the state onlybecause of light rail. In other words, if themoney could be used for roads or bridges inMinnesota, the department could not seek themoney for light rail. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) spoke against this provision, saying the languagewould limit money coming into the state fromWashington, D.C., and the money will be re-directed to other states considering railprojects. The bill also would allow the Metropolitan Council to sell or lease naming rights to the14 transit stations that are planned along the11-mile Hiawatha line. Department spending The omnibus transportation bill calls for $39 million in cash for bridge improvementsor replacements. The House had sought $44million in bonds. However, the House ac-cepted the Senate position to pay for the up-grades with cash. Continued on page 24Reps. Steve Wenzel, Bernie Leider, Michelle Rifenberg, and Tom Workman pour over each section of the omnibus transportation bill during a long day in conference com-mittee May 8.18 May 12, 2000HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking new laws, vetoes Once a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when con-sidering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differ- ent effects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsand files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required.But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sine die\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a date certain \"). If the governor does not sign a bill within this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto. \" The governor is not required to provide areason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to elimi-nate the appropriation items to which he orshe objects. As with all vetoes (save pocketvetoes) the governor must include a state-ment listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for billspassed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the gover-nor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor 's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23). This information is also available on the governor's Web site (www.governor.state.mn.us).Select the *The legislative bill marked with an asterisk denotes the file submitted to the governor.FEBRUARY 1 - M AY 1 1 , 2000 CHAPTERS 251 - 457 Res. 4 4060 2348* Resolution for release of Americans held in North Korea, China, Russia and Vietnam. 4/3/00 251 2980 2763* Fishing season modified. 2/16/00 252 2634 hospital board membership requirements modified. 3/1/00253 2521 2320* Lake Edwards township name change. 3/1/00 254 76 86* K-12 education technical changes provided. offenders modifications. 2291 Shorewood authorized to elect by ward 3/13/00 258 3039 2554* Wadena County truth in taxation process advertisement requirement penalty exemption. 3/13/00259 3338* 2907 Scott County officials duties Revisor's bill. 3/14/00 261 requirements modified. 3/14/00262 2774 2485* Carisoprodol schedule IV controlled substance listing effective date delayed. 3/20/00 263 2680 2465* Political party treasurers authorized to sign political contribution refund receipt forms. 3/20/00 264 3232 2692* Business corporations and limited liability companies shareholder rights modified. 3/20/00265 2603 2346* Permanently disabled hunters permit privileges modified. 3/20/00 266 2723* 2528 McLeod County office authority extended. 3/23/00 267 3236* 3236 Vital record certified copy issuance provisions modified. 3/23/00268 979* 2059 Landlords authorized to apportion utility payments among units. 3/23/00 269 1865* 2094 Nursing mothers needs study by the Supreme Court Jury Reform Task Force required. 3/23/00 270 2815* 2386 Hennepin County District Court fine proceeds distribution modified. 3/23/00271 3064 2776* St. Louis County nursing home renovation approval deadline extended. 3/23/00 272 3762 3355* Port authority electronic funds disbursement authorized. 3/23/00 273 2927* 2685 Metropolitan Inter-County Association group insurance protection authorized. 3/23/00Session Weekly 19_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ CH SF 274 3766* 3676 records transmission format specified. 3/23/00 275 2873* 2516 Anoka County department head time requirements clarified. 3/23/00276 3113* 3089 Pharmacies permitted an additional certified technician. 3/24/00 277 118* 160 State agency commissioners acting service time limited. 3/24/00 278 2505* 2289 Annual state park permits effective for a 12-month period. 3/24/00279 2502* 3207 C.

The East Metro Magnet School would re- ceive $16 million for a new middle schoolbuilding. School districts that would receive funding through the state 's Maximum Effort Loan Pro- gram include Caledonia, Laporte, Red Lake,Cass Lake, and Ulen-Hitterdahl. The programis designed to help school districts in areaswhere declining enrollment, economicchanges, or other conditions have made it dif-ficult for the local taxpayers to support theschool district 's needs. The department also would receive $5 million from the state 's general fund to pay for youth enrichment grants. Local govern-ments apply for those grants to build or im-prove parks and recreation facilities nearschools, or to pay for arts and cultural activi-ties, clubs, athletic programs, or other recre-ational or academic enrichment programs forchildren. Environment and natural resources The Department of Natural Resources would receive $73.2 million for improvementsto parks, recreational trails, conservation ease-ments, and other projects. Como Park would receive $16 million for a new educational resource center, which wouldinclude a visitors ' reception area and meeting rooms. And $14 million would be available for flood hazard mitigation grants in the RedRiver Valley area. A proposal to build a new DNR office build- ing in Fergus Falls would receive $3.3 million. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program would receive $20 million. The pro-gram establishes easements along the Minne-sota River to prevent soil and chemicals fromeroding into the river. The program is matchedby federal funds, which are available throughSeptember 2002. Programs to reduce water pollution and im- prove wastewater systems would receive $33.2million. The Department of Agriculture would receive $20 million for Rural Finance Authority Loans,and $1.7 million for other loan programs. Other funding projects Several other projects across the state re- ceived funding through the bill. Two key projects originally received no sup- port in the House bill, but the most recent ver-sion includes some funding. The new GuthrieTheater project in Minneapolis would receive$3 million under the measure, and the bill in- cludes $3 million for public safety training fa-cilities statewide. In addition, the Heritage Center at St. An- thony Falls would receive $3 million. It origi-nally was allocated $1 million in bonds by boththe House and the Senate. Other projects include $8.8 million for a Minneapolis Great Lakes Center, $7.5 millionfor sewer repairs at the state prison inFaribault, $7 million for the Gillette Children 's Hospital in St. Paul, and $7 million for a V et-erans ' Home in Hastings. Continued from page 4 Criminal justice Fines for petty misdemeanors and misde- meanors would climb, under the bill. Themaximum penalty for a petty misdemeanorwould increase from $200 to $300, while themaximum fine for a misdemeanor wouldmove from $700 to $1,000. The bill features $6.5 million in new spend- ing for the Department of Public Safety, $3million for courts, and $1.2 million for theCenter for Crime Victims Services. District courts would receive $2.7 million to reduce judge vacancies across the state.Some salaries for judges could be paid throughthis appropriation. While the bill provides no funding for Capi- tol Security, it would establish a committee torecommend plans for improving security atthe Capitol. Funding for the Automobile Theft Preven- tion Board would be cut by $1.89 million. Thefunding cut includes money for a computer-controlled driving simulator. Corrections One of the larger changes in the bill would require the state to pay 35 percent of per diemcosts for juveniles housed at the Red WingJuvenile Correctional Facility, while countieswould pay the other 65 percent. Currently,counties pay 100 percent of the costs. Costs tothe Department of Corrections would be re-pealed on June 30, 2001. The bill aims to increase the population at the Red Wing center. It would prohibit delin-quent juveniles from being placed in out-of-state facilities unless it is for the safety of thechild or if another center is closer to the child 's home. Juveniles could be placed in private juve- nile detention centers or non-state facilities ifthey are located in Minnesota, the bill states. The Department of Corrections would re- ceive $2.25 million in the bill, which includes$500,000 for designing a joint headquartersfor the departments of Corrections and Pub- lic Safety. Environment and Agriculture The Department of Natural Resources would obtain $5.4 million, under the bill. Ap-proximately $4 million would go toward set-tling legal costs incurred from litigationinvolving several Indian tribes. The other $1.4 million would be used as grants for northern counties that have wild-fire concerns this year. Grants could be usedto purchase emergency communications andresponse equipment or used for training toprepare for wildfires. About $1.73 million would be allocated to the Department of Agriculture under the bill.The state meat inspection program would re-ceive $500,000 to expand its program. Another $200,000 in grants would be avail- able for farmers interested in growing short-rotation woody crops. These plants, which aregrown for their fiber, would be harvestedwithin 15 years of being planted. The bill out-lines the agroforestry program and states howloans can be offered to farmers who convertagriculture land for agroforestry purposes. The Pollution Control Agency would receive $307,000 to administer its wastewater infra-structure fund. Agency officials could also is-sue citations to persons who fail to report anydischarges. The current law says agency offi-cials can only issue citations if the dischargeis oil or hazardous substances. New state recreation areas also would be created through the bill. The Big Bog recre-ational area would be established in BeltramiCounty, while the Red River recreational areawould be established in Polk County. Immigration measures The bill would provide $150,000 to the De- partment of Economic Security for alien la-bor certification. The bill states that thedepartment should have a goal of certifyingpermanent alien laborers within 60 days ofreceiving an application. The Department of Human Services would be required to use the federal Systematic AlienV erification for Entitlement (SAVE) programto conduct immigration verifications. SA VE would be used when an immigrant applies for food assistance programs, includ-ing both state and federal programs, and whenan immigrant applies for general assistance,such as Minnesota supplemental aid or groupresidential housing. The human services commissioner would be required to report to the Immigration andNaturalization Service all undocumented per-sons identified by the use of SA VE. Continued from page 1324 May 12, 2000Four of the state 's large highway department facilities would be upgraded or replaced at acost of $25.7 million, under the bill. Renova-tions at the Transportation Department head-quarters in St. Cloud would run $10.3 millionand upgrades to the Detroit Lakes Headquar-ters would cost $8.7 million. Like the bridgefunding, the buildings would be fundedthrough cash rather than with bonds. The bill also calls for a new Regional Trans- portation Management Center in Roseville.The House did not support funding for thecenter. The bill would require the departmentto sell the current center within three years ofcompletion of the new center. The bill also includes $15 million for a re- volving loan fund, which can be used for statehighway projects. The governor vetoed$10 million for the fund last year. Ramp meter study A study of the ramp meter system in the Twin Cities highlights the non-funding por-tions of the bill. The Transportation Depart-ment would perform the study at no cost tothe state. Meters would be turned off for a period of time determined by the department to evalu-ate the effectiveness of the ramps. Departmentofficials could not further specify when theContinued from page 17 the tune of $23 million dollars \u2014 would be available to school districts under the bill. Thisaid must be applied toward making accessi-bility improvements, or to make fire, safety,or health repairs, according to the bill. Approximately $16 million would be avail- able to districts under the bill for reimburse-ment of certain telecommunications costs.School districts would need to submit ongo-ing or recurring telecommunications costs \u2014 subject to examination by officials from theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing \u2014 before schools could be reimbursed for the costs. Furthermore, school districts also would be required to inform parents and staff about anyuse of pesticides. The bill now heads to the governor.

Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) wanted an independent contractor to performthe study, but Molnau said that plan was foundto be infeasible. New road commission The bill would also establish a commission dealing with major transportation projects.The commission would hear project propos-als that exceed $5 million and have a signifi-cant role in the overall transportation system.The commission would also require environ-mental impact surveys to help evaluate theproject. The commission would only review and comment on projects \u2014 it would not be given final approval authority. The commission would include seven state senators, seven members of the House, thegovernor or his or her appointee, and four citi-zens appointed by the governor. Proper use of funds The state attorney general and Department of Finance would be asked to examine the con-stitutionality of using trunk highway fundmoney for non-highway projects, under the bill.Molnau said money used for Office of T ourismkiosks and tort claims has been improperly spentfrom the trunk highway fund, when it should have come from the general fund. Molnau said using those funds inappropri- ately has cut the money available for trans-portation projects. The bill would move funding for kiosks, tort claims, and other non-highway relatedprojects from the trunk highway fund to thegeneral 25Phone District/Member/Party Room* (651) 296-Phone (651) 296-Minnesota House of Representatives 2000 Members Note: Room numbers are subject to change.49A Abeler, Jim ...................................... 537 ..................................... 5066 *All rooms are in the State Office Building unless otherwise noted, St. Paul, MN 55155RESOURCES # # #26 May 12, 2000MAY 5 - 11 , 2000 HOUSE FILES 4175 - 4177 BILL INTRODUCTIONS # # # Tuesday, May 9 HF4175\u2014Buesgens (R) Governmental Operations &Veterans Affairs Policy Regular legislative sessions confined to odd- numbered years.HF4176\u2014Broecker (R) Health & Human Services Policy MSAs; Congress memorialized to remove medical savings account restrictions.HF4177\u2014Paulsen (R) Taxes Sales tax deduction provided to retailers for collections cost compensation.

ReflectionsAnne Wilson Schaef, in her book, Women's Reality , stated that for ages, people have spent a lot of time and energy specu-lating on the existence of a dualistic worldof good and evil, right and left, up anddown, black and white. She called it an \"Ei- ther-Or Syndrome. \" Schaef noted that the \"Either-Or, \" concept becomes more efficient when an alternativeis introduced, and more effectual if the con-cept is \"Either and Or. \" For the Queen of Hearts, in Lewis Carroll 's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland, rarely was there an \"either-or \" situation. The Queen 's decision for her subjects ' actions was limited \u2014 whether it was during a game of croquet, or because roses in the gardenwere painted red. Invariably, her verdict was,\"Off with his head \" for anyone whose ac- tions she disliked. While the King of Hearts quietly deferred to the Queen 's demands, which clearly lacked any thought of compromise, un-known to her, he would pardon many of thepotential victims. But Alice was bold and outspoken. She of- fered ideas and alternatives to the Mad Hat-ter, the Gryphon, the White Rabbit, and evento the Queen. Conversely, the Queen 's arbi- trary decision was final, or so she thought.Minnesota 's legislative process is directly the opposite. Based on diverse reasoning andcompromise, the process is a coming to-gether of ideas that get debated and are usu-ally improved by amendments for positiveresults. When this happens, changes may beadded or deleted for striking some kind ofbalance among lawmakers. The Legislature is comprised of two ma- jor parties in a two-body system. In recenthistory, it has been in the forefront of otherstates for introducing new ideas. Thus, lawsin the state are implemented by unique, in-novative, and ingenious methods throughchange and exchange of ideas, though notalways amicably. Now there is an augmentation to that pro- cess of compromise \u2014 the addition of an- other set of ideas through a third party inthe executive branch. Its introduction pro-vides different ingredients to add to the fi-nal mix of legislative decisions that willeffect the lives of citizens in the state. For those unfamiliar with proceedings \"on the hill \" in St. Paul, some of the infor- mation they encounter may resemble theconfusing poem, \"Jabberwocky \" from Carroll 's Alice's Adventures.The first lines, brillig did gyre and gimble in thewabe ...\" are small examples of what appear to be paragraphs full of nonsense and de-void of meaning. Activity at the Capitol ismuch less confusing and easier to under-stand \u2014 more than a newcomer to the leg- islative process might realize. In some ways, it 's like Alice 's conversation with the Cheshire Cat on seeking informationabout her travel destination. \"That depends on where you want to get to, \" said the Cat. \"So long as I get somewhere, \" said Alice. \"Oh, you're sure to do that, \" said the Cat, \"if only you walk long enough. \" Lawmakers do not and cannot go as far in making final decisions as did the Queenof Hearts. Yet, for some onlookers this year,their willingness to even compromiseseemed impossible. But as expected, the2000 Legislature and the executive branchnow have pooled their ideas and struck abalance to bring the 81 st Legislative Session to its conclusion. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, one the nation 's founding fathers, \"No demo- cratic government can last long withoutconciliation and compromise. \" \u2014L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERTSession Weekly 27 Order a free copy of New Laws 2000 Complete this form to receive your copy of New Laws 2000 , a publication describing the new laws passed this year.

Officially the longest session since the Legislature began meeting annu-ally in the early 1970s, many of thisyear's major bills were passed during a marathon 20-hour session that be-gan 11 a.m. May 9 and ended at7 a.m. May 10.Down to the wire Legislators end grueling session with long nights, vetooverrides, and heartfelt goodbyes to departing colleagues Among the measures passed dur- ing the marathon session were billsproviding tax cuts and rebates, fur-ther transportation and educationspending, and a bonding bill thatspends $639.5 million for repairs tostate facilities and new constructionprojects.4 May 19, 2000For a time, it appeared that the 2000 ses- sion would be known only as the year thestate 's butterfly was officially designated in law (the monarch butterfly) and also the year alaw was passed loosening the state 's regula- tions on community potluck dinners. In addition, the 2000 Legislature: Approved a measure allowing desperate mothers to drop off unwanted newbornbabies at any hospital in the state; Provided higher compensation to injured workers while reducing premiums toemployers; Approved a study to look at the establish- ment of a felony DWI penalty in the state; T oughened penalties for minors caught using false identification to purchasealcohol and tobacco; Provided approximately $50 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency forbuilding and financing affordable housingunits; Approved an increase in game and fish licenses to help bolster natural resources;and Passed a wolf management plan for the state. The roadblock to the major spending and tax cut legislation was a disagreement betweenthe House and Senate over the amount ofmoney available that would be sustainable inthe future. The impasse was finally brokenwith a unique arrangement allowing each leg-islative body and the governor to decide howto use a third of the $525 million surplus. The House used most of its third to pro- vide permanent income tax cuts. Along withrate reductions in all three income tax brack-ets and a reduction in vehicle registration fees,there will be a $635 million rebate to taxpay-ers. The Department of Revenue has indicatedthose checks, which will average $377 for mar-ried couples and $187 for single filers, will bemailed out in August. Major capital improvement projects include $58 million for a new Bureau of Criminal Ap-prehension building, $44 million for transitin the metropolitan area, $35 million for a Mo-lecular Cellular Biology building at the Uni-versity of Minnesota, $33.2 million forprograms to reduce water pollution and im-prove wastewater systems, $20 million for con-servation easements along the MinnesotaRiver, $20 million for Rural Finance Author-ity Loans, and $18.5 million for a new ArtBuilding at the U of M. The $600 million transportation bill spends $405 million in cash for road improvements,with $177 million used to eliminate bottle-necks in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.Another $39 million will be spent on roadsand bridges throughout the state. The $184 million education bill increasesHouse Speaker Steve Sviggum and Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty share a light mo-ment as the House worked into the night May 17. spending forhigh-speedInternet ac-cess forschools andteachertraining. With most year,when thegovernor caught members by surprise with anumber of vetoes after they had adjourned,time was left to act upon any vetoes thissession. The governor ended up line-item vetoing only a handful of appropriations. And onWednesday, May 17, both the House and Sen-ate once again held all-night marathon floorsessions to consider veto overrides and debatethe Profile of Learning bill. Four of the governor 's vetoes were overrid- den. They were $1 million for a Lanesboro artscenter, $3 million for a new Guthrie Theater,$135,000 for an organ donor mobile unit, and$1.5 million for multicultural library grantsin St. James and Pelican Rapids. The House voted on 10 other attempted overrides, but those measures fell short of thenecessary two-thirds majority. The four veto overrides were historic \u2014 never before has a governor had so many ofhis vetoes overridden. Last year, the Legislature overrode Ventura 's veto of a bill allowing court evidence aboutallegedly defective seat belts in product liabil-ity lawsuits. Earlier this session the Legislatureoverrode another Ventura veto, of a bill aimedto prevent closure of a state-run nursing fa-cility in Walker. Prior to the V entura administration there had only been a combined total of four vetooverrides since 1939. Having completed the overrides, the Legis- lature turned its attention to one final pieceof work. In the waning hours of the session,the House and Senate struggled to find a com-promise on the Profile of Learning bill. Following weeks of talks between House and Senate leadership over what to do aboutthe Profile, the Legislature passed a measurethat would allow schools to ease requirementsunder the show-what-you-know initiative.Legislators also agreed to discard a second proposal that would have allowed schoolboards the choice between the Profile and aback-to-basics alternative proposed earlier inthe session called the North Star Standard. Thus came a unique end to a long and at times difficult session. With much focusthroughout the session devoted to the unicam-eral debate, rarely has there been as much at-tention on the lawmaking process itself. (Bills calling for a constitutional amend- ment allowing voters to decide on whether ornot the state should adopt a one-house legis-lature stalled in committee in both the Houseand Senate.) Twelve members of the House took their last votes early May 18. Some of them are leavingto pursue higher office, while others are re-turning to a more private life. The departing members are Reps. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), Phil Carruthers(DFL-Brooklyn Center), Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park),Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland), Betty McCollum(DFL-North St. Paul), andLinda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls). Now as the new laws take effect, more and more attention may be directed toward theirlong-term effects and impact on everyday lifeacross the state. Therefore, it seems appropriate that when House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty(R-Eagan) moved that the House adjourn its81st session \"sine die, \" many Minnesotans were just beginning to wake up for anotherworkday. (Writer Jon Fure contributed to this report.)Session Weekly 5FEBRUARY 1 - M AY 18 , 2000NEW LAWS # # # Feedlot rules relaxed A new law will relax new feedlot rules pro- posed by the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency (MPCA). Effective April 25, 2000, the law gives spe- cific instructions to the agency on how therules should be amended before their finaladoption. The law also prohibits the agency from im- posing additional conditions as part of a feed-lot permit after the proposed rules are finallyadopted. Under the law, state livestock operations will be allowed to grow, and regulation by theagency will be restricted. Agency officials want farmers to prevent the flow of animal waste from lots into rivers,streams, and ground water. The agency is alsoconcerned about air pollution caused byfeedlots. The MPCA 's new plan would put limits on hydrogen sulfide gas found in manure andrequire that manure spills on roads be treatedas serious problems. Sloppy handling of ma-nure could result in fines if the revised agencyrules were to go into effect. The commissioner of the Department of Agriculture will be required by the law to workwith the University of Minnesota to developeducational and training programs address-ing manure applicator concerns, includingwater quality protection and the developmentof manure management plans. If violations are found, the law requires that they be remedied in a timely manner. A feedlot operator with less than 300 ani- mal units, however, could not be required tospend more than $3,000 to upgrade a lot un-less assistance totaling at least 75 percent ofthe cost is available, under the law. The law exempts livestock production fa- cilities from state standards governing airquality in the area surrounding feedlots whilemanure is being removed from the site andup to seven days following the transfer. The measure also requires the MPCA to re- move several provisions from its proposedrules and allow the agency to submit a report to the commissioner of the Department ofFinance if it is unable to accomplish timelyresponse to feedlot permit applications. Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) and Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the leg-islation. HF3692*/SF3443/CH435 Requirements for contracts A law that will establish minimum stan- dards of both readability and content for con-tracts between agricultural producers andcontractors was signed May 15 by Gov. JesseVentura. Under the new law, any potential agricul- tural contract will be required to contain aclear statement of the risks the producer facesby entering into the contract, and producerswill be allowed to review the contract for upto three days before signing it. The measure will also require that the con- tract be legible, clearly laid out, and contain acover sheet with an index to the contents ofthe contract and a warning to producers to\"read your contract carefully. \" A producer will be allowed under the law to ask the commissioner of the Departmentof Agriculture to review a contract and certifythat language in the proposed contract com-plies with requirements contained in themeasure.The law also will allow a court to change the terms of a contract if it found a lack ofclarity or readability had confused the pro-ducer and resulted in financial harm. Finally, the law specifies certain kinds of agricultural contracts that will not be subjectto minimum standards, and establishes limitson the extent to which producers and contrac-tors can use the format of a contract to claimdamages against one another. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) and Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsoredthe legislation. The law takes effect Jan. 1, 2001. HF3534*/SF3070/CH470 Ag policy changes A new law that will bring uniformity to the state 's meat inspection program and update state references to federal food law regulationswas signed May 15 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. The law will bring poultry up to par with other meats and meat products for purposesof inspection. Inspections of poultry, however,will not be required during the slaughter ofone's own animals or at a custom processing plant. Poultry products will also be allowed to carry the \"Minnesota Approved \" label. The measure will add several new activities to those that would qualify for a Departmentof Agriculture grant of up to $50,000 for thedevelopment of new farm products, as well as#AGRICULTURE A new law eases rules proposed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on animal feedlots. Therules will govern manure storage pools, like the one pictured here, and the air pollution often associ-ated with them.Editor's note: This section includes summaries of many key laws passed during the 2000Legislative Session. For a full listing of all billspassed this year, see the Governor's Desksection, beginning on page 35.6 May 19, 2000business and marketing plans for the products. Corporate farm law changes included as part of the new law will allow nonprofit groupssuch as scout troops, churches, and sportsclubs to retain ownership of agricultural landrented to a neighboring farmer. Limited liabil-ity companies will be able to own farmlandand engage in farming, as well. Certain corporations will be permitted to own up to 40 acres of farmland so long as theyearn no more than $150 per acre per year fromthe land. In addition, an entity that previously did not qualify could now apply for a \"commissioner 's exemption \" (renewable annually) for permis- sion to retain title to farmland, under the newlaw. Furthermore, the commissioner of the De- partment of Agriculture will be required toteam with the University of Minnesota, theDepartment of Trade and Economic Devel-opment, and the Board of Animal Health todevelop a pilot program for verifying claimsmade by agricultural producers andbusinesses. Finally, the law will make relatively minor changes to fertilizer and grain warehouse pro-visions in existing law. Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) and Sen. Dal- las Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the legisla-tion. The law is effective Aug. 1, 2000. HF3312*/SF3223/CH477 #BONDING #BUSINESS Capital projects bill signed A $639.5 million capital projects law will fund repairs to state facilities and new con-struction projects. Gov. Jesse V entura signedthe measure May 15. The House and Senate had reached a com- promise after original proposals of $532 mil-lion from the House and $762 million fromthe Senate. V entura had line-item vetoed eight projects from the bill, but the Legislature successfullyoverrode four of those vetoes May 17. Thevetoes that were not overridden amount to areduction of $750,000. That final amount includes $470.2 million in general obligation bonding, and $98 mil-lion in direct spending from the state 's gen- eral fund. Nearly $30 million will be saved bycanceling funds for capital projects approvedin previous years. Major funding areas include $131 million for the Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU) system, $100.2 million for theUniversity of Minnesota, $80.7 fortransit in the metro-politan area. The $44 million for transit was backed byVentura as part of anend-of-session agree-ment that wouldallow the governor,House, and Senate toeach decide how to spend a portion of the pro-jected ongoing budget surplus. V entura 's por- tion includes reductions in license tab fees formotor vehicles and the transit spending. The transit money will mainly pay for de- signing and building an exclusive bustransitway, including the costs of acquiringland and right-of-way. The law does not stipu-late where such a transitway would be built,but the speculation is that it would run be-tween downtown St. Paul and the Minneapo-lis-St. Paul International Airport. The law prohibits that money from being spent on light-rail transit or commuter rail. A previous law that gives the governor lee- way in issuing bonds was repealed. That lawallowed a governor to refuse to sell bonds,thereby causing a project to languish. The new law gives that authority instead to the commissioner of the state Department ofFinance. The commissioner is required to sellbonds based on funding needs of capitalprojects. The decision on when to sell the bonds only can be based on specific factors: taking advan-tage of favorable interest rates, managing cashflow requirements for making debt payments,and other financial or legal factors. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thecapital projects legislation. HF4078*/SF3811/CH492 Sales of funeral goods A new law will regulate the solicitation and sale of funeral goods and services. The law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, will prohibit solicitation at a hospital, gravesite, nursinghome, or wake, without a specific request fromthe family of the deceased to do so. The new law also will prohibit an individualfrom offering goods and services to a person whose death is impending, or to an individualresponsible for funeral arrangements of a de-ceased person within 10 days of thatindividual 's death. Such acts, however, will be allowed if the deceased or a relative had madearrangements to discuss plans for the funeralor burial before death occurred. The measure will not apply to communica- tion between an individual and a funeral pro-vider related by blood, adoption, or marriage. In cases when the deceased handled his or her own arrangements in advance, the law willrequire that the funeral provider produce acopy of the agreement and give the copy tothe person controlling the disposition of theremains. A copy of the arrangements will berequired to change hands no later than 24hours after first contact between the providerand the individual in charge of the remains. The law also contains new requirements for pre-death arrangements and a provision al-lowing a person who makes an advance burialarrangement to cancel plans. Furthermore, the law will require that all funeral establishments and providers clearlystate who owns the establishment in all busi-ness literature, contracts, and correspondence.That provision takes effect Jan. 1, 2001. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Claire A. Robling (R-Prior Lake) sponsoredthe legislation. SF2686*/HF2713/CH438The new bonding law includes Gov. Jesse Ventura's $58 million request for anew St. Paul facility for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Original plansin the House would not have provided full funding for the project. Electronic pawn records A law effective March 24, 2000, requires pawnbrokers who use computerized trackingof items to use a uniform electronic format. Several Minnesota communities already track items by computer. The law ensures allpawnbrokers use the same computerized sys-tem. It also enables police to access the uni-form system to check on possible stolen goods. Most pawnshops keep track of records withSession Weekly 7paper receipts, though more and more of them are moving to electronic tracking systems. Thelaw will not require the shops to use electronictracking, but it does require that all the sys-tems in use be compatible. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of the measure in the House, said with thousandsof transactions each year, law enforcement isnot able to track all of them. A uniform sys-tem for those shops that are computerizedwould help if law enforcement had access tothose records, he said. While only a handful of cities require com- puterized tracking of pawn items now,Skoglund said he thinks more cities will fol-low, as they realize it is a better way to catchthieves and return stolen property to rightfulowners. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the law in the Senate. HF3766*/SF3673/CH274 Liquor license law A new law that takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, will change the requirements for fraternal andcharitable clubs attempting to obtain liquorlicenses. The omnibus liquor law will only require clubs to have 30 members to obtain a license.In addition, the law will allow specific liquorcontracts for special events in several towns,including Anoka, Duluth, Eveleth, and Spring-field. Those items in reference to special events take effect upon action by local communities. The law reduces the number of club mem- bers needed to obtain a liquor license from 50to 30. The provision addresses the droppingpopulation in some rural areas, said Rep. ErikPaulsen (R-Eden Prairie), House sponsor. The law also will allow a commercial estab- lishment to make wine on the premises forpersonal or family use only. Individuals un-der age 21 will be forbidden from helpingmake wine. Liquor stores will be able to offer wine-tast- ing events on their premises, under the law. Awine-tasting event will be defined as an activ-ity that does not last beyond four hours, andpatrons would not pay for each individualglass of wine. The state agriculture society also will be al- lowed to sell alcohol at state fairgrounds eventsthat are not held during the normal 12-dayrun of the fair. Sen. Sam Solon (DFL-Duluth) sponsored the Senate version. HF3974/SF3581*/CH440Economic loss doctrine replaced A new law will repeal the state 's existing eco- nomic loss doctrine and replace it with a newprovision. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the law will confine commercial legal disputes to those prescribedby the Uniform Commercial Code. The codeprovides a shorter statute of limitations. House sponsor, Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), said the law will clarifywho can sue and when they can sue regardingcommercial transactions. The law will apply to claims where a buyer is dissatisfied with a seller 's product, usually when the product is damaged, but no injurieshave occurred, Pawlenty said. If an injury oc-curred, a person could sue under tort laws,Pawlenty said. The law is the result of an agreement be- tween several interest groups that met duringthe past year to hammer out the compromise.The provision is seen as an improvement tothe previous law, which passed during a spe-cial session in 1998. That legislation wasprompted by concerns over a case involvingMarvin Windows, a Warroad-based company. The bill is not retroactive, and would have no effect on pending litigation. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1267/SF1126*/CH358 LONGTIME LEADER Former House Speaker Phil Carruthers hasaccepted a position with the RamseyCounty Attorney's Office. He is leaving af-ter 14 years in the House. #CONSUMERSLimits on dealership owners A new law bars auto manufacturers from buying car dealerships in Minnesota. The law, effective April 15, 2000, forbids manufacturers from buying a dealership andcompeting with other dealerships in the area. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), who spon- sored the law in the House, said his primaryconcern is that without this law, manufactur-ers could own dealerships and would haveunfair advantage in competition within thelocal market. The law was introduced after General Mo- tors announced last fall it planned to purchaseseveral car dealerships across the United States,Davids said. Eleven states already have laws barring manufacturers from owning local dealerships,and more states pursued the issue this year,he added. The law also specifically lists certain unfair market practices that are prohibited, such asrefusing to offer all models manufactured ina line to a franchised dealership. The law does grandfather in one Rochester Saturn dealership, which is already owned bythe manufacturer. Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) sponsored the Senate measure. HF2731*/SF2753/CH409 Auto glass rebate limit A new law effective April 7, 2000, limits re- bates from auto glass companies to $35. It alsoestablishes a new standard for determiningreasonable costs for glass replacement. The law will require insurance companies to pay an average cost for windshield replacementbased on a study of auto glass replacement costsfrom regions around the state. (That study pro-vision takes effect Aug. 1, 2000.) The study will be funded voluntarily through insurance and glass companies. If thecompanies don 't voluntarily contribute, they will have violated the law and the Legislaturewill revisit the issue next year. The Department of Commerce will coor- dinate the study. Cost of the study is estimatedat $35,000 a year. There is expected to be nocost to the state. According to an insurance company study last year, Minnesota 's auto glass replacement costs are 69 percent higher than the nationalaverage and are the highest in the nation.Many Minnesota auto glass dealers previouslyoffered boxes of steaks, rebates of $200 to cus-tomers, or other costly incentives to lure cus-tomers.8 May 19, 2000Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the law. HF2656*/SF3441/CH342#CRIME Penalties for unscrupulous contractors A new law that takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, will subject contractors, who fail to complete workon house projects, to new criminal and civilpenalties. A tornado that hit St. Peter in spring 1998 devastated much of that area. Rep. Julie Storm(R-St. Peter) sponsored the legislation after thedisaster because of evidence that an unscru-pulous contractor hired to fix damaged homesdid not follow through on commitments. The contractor collected money from homeowners, then did not pay subcontractors.The subcontractors then placed liens on thehomes, whose owners thought they had fin-ished paying for the repairs. The contractoreventually went bankrupt, but the liens werealready placed on the homes. That contractor was later ordered to serve two months in jail and repay the homeowners. A builder, material supplier, or subcontrac- tor can place a lien on a property if they arenot paid for work done on the property. Con-tractors should receive a lien-waiver from asubcontractor once that subcontractor hasbeen paid, Storm said. A felony penalty for theft will also be estab- lished under the law. The maximum penaltyfor theft in state statute is 20 years in prisonand a $100,000 fine. Under the previous law, the maximum theft charge available for such situations was a grossmisdemeanor, with a maximum penalty ofone year in jail and a $3,000 fine. The law also will allow homeowners to seek civil penalties against contractors, which werenot previously available. Shareholders, officers, and directors of the contracting company who are aware of thetheft could also face criminal and civil penal-ties, under the law. The law will require that money for a con- struction project be kept in a trust fund. Pro-ceeds can be kept separate within the trust.Contractors would then pay subcontractorsfrom the trust. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the Senate version. HF2563*/SF2381/CH430 If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's Web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.usA new law that increases restrictions and registra-tion requirements for sex offenders was passedthis session. The law was due in part to the lobby-ing efforts of Pam and Steve Poirier, picturedabove, whose daughter Katie was kidnapped andpresumed murdered last year. A six-time convictedsex offender is charged with the crime. Katie's Law on books A new law, most of which is effective Aug. 1, 2000, will stiffen laws regulating sex offend-ers and will provide start-up money for newcriminal justice information systems. The law will provide $12 million to imple- ment a statewide criminal justice informationsystem, which officials estimate could cost asmuch as $100 million before completion. One goal of the information system is bet- ter tracking of registered sex offenders in thestate. It also would integrate probation andarrest information from local law enforcementagencies, so law enforcement officers aroundthe state have access to the most up-to-dateinformation about offenders. The law will also spend $5 million to in- crease the number of probation officers han-dling sex offender cases. The intent is to reducethe number of cases each officer must handleso they can keep better track of their sex of-fenders. Appropriations in the bill take effectJuly 1, 2000. Further provisions change who is required to register, adding certain penalties to that list.In addition, it extends the period of registra-tion for many offenses, including a require-ment that some offenders register for life. The law will also authorize the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to establish a Web sitewhere it will post all the names of level 3 reg-istered sex offenders in the state.Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored thelegislation. Many of its provisions were in-cluded as a result of the lobbying efforts ofPam Poirier. Poirier 's 19-year-old daughter Katie was abducted from a Moose Lake conveniencestore last May and was apparently murdered. Donald Blom, a six-time convicted sex of- fender, is charged with the crime. In his statement upon signing the law, V entura said the measure takes a step to im-prove public safety in Minnesota. HF2688*/SF2769/CH311 Domestic violence prevention A new law will establish a new state office to prevent domestic violence and sexualassault. Effective July 1, 2000, the law will create the office of domestic violence and sexual assaultprevention, establish a director position, andestablish an interagency task force on domes-tic abuse and sexual assault prevention. The office will be placed within the Depart- ment of Public Safety. The law will create guidelines for putting together the task force, including representa-tives from the departments of Corrections,Health, Human Services, Economic Security,and Children, Families and Learning. The taskforce also must have a county attorney, cityattorney, and a judge. The director of the new domestic violence office would serve as chair of the task force. The law outlines the director 's duties, which include advocating victims ' rights, increasing education and awareness, supporting litiga-tion, initiating policy changes, and buildingpartnerships with law enforcement and thecourts. The task force will evaluate the progress of the director and the office. In addition, the taskforce will establish a strategic plan for thedirector. Rep. Larry (R-Hackensack) and Hope) spon-sored the measure. HF3331*/SF2980/CH368 Penalties for assaulting officers A person who physically assaults an officer during an arrest will be subject to gross mis-demeanor charges even if the attack does notcause any \"demonstrable bodily harm, \" under a law effective April 25, 2000. The law also provides for a felony charge if someone escapes from police custody for afelony-related action, even if that person hasnot yet been charged or convicted of a crime.The violator could face a maximum penaltySession Weekly 9of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Previous law allowed for a felony only if the person fled after being charged or convictedof a felony. The new law will establish that officials no longer have to prove demonstrable harm in asituation involving an assault against an of-ficer. They merely need to prove that an as-sault took place. Previously, there was no additional penalty if an assault did not result in visible harm. That provision stems from a case in which an officer was struck in the groin by someonewho was resisting arrest. The action did notresult in demonstrable bodily harm, so noadditional penalties could be brought againstthe assailant. Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) spon-sored the legislation. HF2958/SF2830*/CH441 TAX POLICY EXPERT Rep. Ann H. Rest says goodbye to her friends in the House on May 17. Rest, a former chair ofthe House Taxes Committee, decided to leave the House to make a run for the state Senate.She is seeking the seat currently held by Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge, who will not seek re-election. Statute of limitations extended Domestic abuse victims will have more time to consider filing civil charges against the per-petrator, under a law signed May 15 by Gov.Jesse Ventura. The bill will extend the statute of limitations in domestic abuse cases from two years to sixyears. A victim could sue another person forassault, battery, false imprisonment, or per-sonal injury, as defined by the statutes gov-erning domestic abuse. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), who spon- sored the legislation, explained that the stat-ute of limitations will begin at the point ofthe last incident. The law also will allow Ramsey County to establish a pilot project domestic abuse unit.Once created, the unit will prosecute cases,recognize interests of children in abuse cases,and reduce the exposure of domestic abuse forvictims. If Ramsey County chooses to create the pro- gram, the county will be required to report itsresults to the Legislature next year. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the Senate version. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF47/SF11*/CH471 Felony DWI study Legislators have agreed to study possible felony penalties for repeat drunken drivingoffenders, but no felony penalties will beimplemented this session. Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law May 15 that creates a \"driving while impaired working group. \" The working group becomes effective May 16.Previously, legislators had sought to make it a felony for a person to accumulate fourdrunken driving convictions in a 10-year span.Currently, 35 other states have some form offelony DWI laws. However, legislators eventually agreed to examine the issue further this year. Many leg-islators were concerned about the correctionscosts that would be created down the line. The working group will include legislators from both houses, the commissioners of cor-rections, public safety, and finance, countyattorneys, and public defenders. The law will require the working group to study and recommend by Dec. 1, 2000, howto implement felony penalties. The group willdetermine the most cost-effective manner, thenumber of offenses needed to reach a felony-level, the length of incarceration, and whethera penalty should have mandatory prison time. \"It assumes there will be a felony DWI, and this is how to best implement it, \" said Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center), whoserved on the conference committee. It is still unclear what the total cost would be to incarcerate repeat drinking and drivingoffenders, although one report estimated itwould add 1,100 people to the corrections system. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) and Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington) were the spon-sors of the legislation. HF2995/SF2677*/CH478Fake ID measure signed Penalties will increase for people under age 21 who attempt to purchase alcohol, under alaw signed May 15 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The law also will allow alcohol providers \u2014 from liquor store clerks to licensed retailers\u2014 to confiscate what they believe to be false identifications. The law will make it a gross misdemeanor on a second offense for a person under age 21to attempt to buy alcohol. Minors who attemptto purchase tobacco with false identificationalso could have their driver 's license sus- pended, under the law. The person confiscating the identification would be required to turn it over to the policewithin 24 hours. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), who sponsored the measure in the House, said themeasure is necessary to enforce state laws onselling alcohol to minors. \"The intent is to create a meaningful deter- rent to using false IDs, \" Leppik said. \"To many people, it is worth the risk because the conse-quences are few. \" The House rejected the measure last month, sending the bill back to conference commit-tee, although it had passed the Senate with-out a dissenting vote. The legislation returnedfrom conference committee took further stepsto de-criminalize clerks who mistakenly selltobacco to minors. Previously, state law called for a gross mis- demeanor charge against a clerk who sells10 May 19, 2000tobacco to minors for a first offense. The new law provides for a gross misdemeanor only ifthe clerk is caught selling tobacco to minorstwice in a five-year period. The new law will allow the commissioner of public safety to suspend a minor 's driver 's license for up to 90 days if the minor attempted to pur-chase alcohol with false identification. Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) spon- sored the Senate version. The law takes effectAug. 1, 2000. HF2655/SF2845*/CH472 Cracking down on pimps A new law that takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, will expand penalties for people who lure teensinto prostitution. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), the law aims to curb solicitors,or pimps, from pushing young children, bothboys and girls, into prostitution. The law will make it a felony for a person to solicit a juvenile under age 18 into prostitu-tion. The maximum penalty is 20 years inprison and a $40,000 fine. Under previous law, a juvenile had to be under age 16 for a felony charge. The hike in age from 16 to 18 means more pimps will go to prison, rather than facing jailtime or probation, Clark said. A task force report submitted to the House Crime Prevention Committee earlier this ses-sion estimated that 1,000 Minnesota teens arecurrently involved in prostitution. The law also will require the commissioner of public safety to study and make recommen-dations on training officers to combat prosti-tution. The study will include information onways to increase penalties and prosecution ofsolicitors. The study provision takes effect July1, 2000. State law already says that luring adults into prostitution is a gross misdemeanor. Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2830*/SF2771/CH431 Falsely reporting stolen checks Falsely claiming that blank checks or debit cards have been stolen will bring misdemeanorcharges, under a law effective Aug. 1, 2000. The law will make it a misdemeanor crime for someone to falsely tell his or her financialinstitution the items are missing or stolen. The law would cover scenarios where indi- viduals write several bad checks and then re-port to the bank that those checks were stolen. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) and Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington) sponsoredthe legislation. HF2751/SF3455*/CH354Drug change delayed A new law will delay the classification of the prescription painkiller Carisoprodol as a con-trolled substance for at least one more year. The law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, represents the third consecutive year the Legislature hasdelayed the effective date for classifying thepainkiller and muscle relaxant. It was origi-nally set to be scheduled in August 1998. Under the law, Carisoprodol will become a schedule IV controlled substance on Aug. 1,2001. The previous law would have made thedrug a controlled substance on Aug. 1 of thisyear. Officials say they needed to delay the action another year while the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration examines the painkiller todetermine its effects. Under Minnesota law, a schedule IV con- trolled substance is a drug that has a low po-tential for abuse and it is currently acceptedfor medical treatment in the United States.However, abuse may lead to physical or psy-chological dependence. Doctors can prescribe drugs in schedule II to schedule V , but cannot prescribe drugs inschedule I. Classifying a drug like Carisopro-dol as a controlled substance would make itmore difficult for doctors to prescribe. Scheduling is done on the state level, which is usually consistent with federal drug regula-tions. Carisoprodol is not a controlled sub-stance on the federal level. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul)sponsored the legislation. HF2774/SF2485*/CH262 Fugitive apprehension unit A new law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, will cre- ate a formal fugitive apprehension unit in theDepartment of Corrections. The unit will have limited police powers to investigate and arrest Department of Correc-tions escapees and parole violators. There is currently an apprehension unit with 13 employees. However, that unit doesnot have police powers, and the workers can-not carry firearms. Under the law, those em-ployees will be trained by law enforcement tobecome officers. House sponsor Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) said there were three things he wantedto accomplish with this law. First, he wantedto give the workers the adequate tools to dotheir job, which includes the right to carry fire-arms. The law will also allow the unit to at-tend deadly force training. Second, the law establishes the flow of in- formation between corrections officials work-ing inside a prison and police officers workingthe street. The information exchange is nec- essary because some inmates still have ties toillegal gang and drug activity, Stanek said. Finally, the police powers were limited to hunting the fugitives and parole violators, sothe unit could concentrate on its task. Under the law, the unit will be required to inform a city 's police force when they enter a town to conduct surveillance or to makearrests. The law will also give the fugitive apprehen- sion unit initial processing power of the fugi-tive \u2014 such as taking the person 's fingerprints and photos \u2014 unless directed differently by the law enforcement agency with primary ju-risdiction. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF3003/SF3097*/CH291 Attorney-client phone calls Officials at state prisons are exempt from civil and criminal penalties for restricting in-mate telephone access with attorneys, undera law effective Aug. 1, 2000. State law allows persons detained by law enforcement the ability to speak with a law-yer free of charge at any reasonable time. Previously, if corrections personnel at a state prison or local detention facility refused toallow a person telephone access to an attor-ney, state law provided for fine of $100 and amisdemeanor charge against the official. The new measure keeps the civil and crimi- nal penalties in place at local correctional fa-cilities, such as county jails and workhouses,but eliminates the penalties at state prisons. The law will pertain to all detained people at local facilities, regardless of whether theyhave been convicted or charged of a crime. Theonly exceptions where local corrections offi-cials can restrict telephone access without fac-ing criminal or civil penalties is when officialsbelieve the detained person may attempt toescape or cause injury. Neither the detained person nor the attor- ney will be responsible for the cost of a phonecall, according to the law. A detained personcan speak with an attorney or a person he orshe \"may desire to consult with \" about an up- coming proceeding involving pendingcharges. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo T ownship) and Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) spon-sored the law. HF3512/SF3108*/CH408Session Weekly 11 THE LONE INDEPENDENT Rep. Doug Reuter says goodbye to House colleagues this week with plans to move to Texas. Reuter was elected to the House in 1996 as a Republican, but declared himself an inde-pendent at the close of the 1999 session.Serving court orders A new law will allow law enforcement of- ficers to serve any court order. The law, most of which takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, will create a shortened notification pro-cess that officers can use to serve court docu-ments to people at any time. The idea behind the law is that many defen- dants and parties to a court case are hard to find,and this measure will allow them to be formallyserved if an officer encounters them in a routinetraffic stop or other police action. For instance, if an officer pulls over a car for speeding, and the officer learns that a courtis trying to contact that person to serve courtorders, such as a subpoena or protection or-der, the officer will be able to give a notifica-tion form to that person, under the law. An officer could serve paperwork at any time, including Sundays or legal holidays, thelaw states. The notification form will include the names of the parties involved, the county thatserved the order, the name of the judge, andthe date of a hearing. The short order form will direct the recipi- ent to report to the sheriff 's office or court- house where the proceeding is set to take placeto pick up the full copy of service. The officer could also detain the person as long as necessary in order to fill out and servethe person with the short form, under the law. According to the law, a scheduled hearing can take place if the papers were served at least12 hours before the hearing, and the personreceiving the papers must appear. However,the person who received the papers may re-quest a continuance of up to five days. Previously, the hearing could not begin until five days had passed after the court paperswere served. That new provision is effectiveApril 25, 2000. The law also will allow an officer to arrest a person who violates a pretrial no-contact or-der, even if the officer wasn 't present at the time of the violation. The orders, often issuedin domestic abuse cases, require that the de-fendant have no contact with whoever isnamed in the order, typically the victim andtheir family. The law also will create a felony for a per- son who causes malicious punishment of achild. The law says the violator may be chargedwith a felony if the child is under age 4 andhas sustained bodily harm to the head, eyes,or neck, or has suffered multiple bruises. Themaximum penalty for the felony would be fiveyears in prison and a $10,000 fine. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) and Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge (DFL-New Hope)sponsored the legislation. HF1067/SF551*/CH437#EDUCATIONTreating sex offenders A new law effective April 12, 2000, will send sex offenders back to prison instead of treat-ment programs if they refuse to participate intreatment. The sex offender will also no longer be able to plead his or her case to a special reviewboard, under the law. The cost of keeping an offender in treatment is three times the cost of correctional facili-ties, said Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville),House sponsor. She said the law gives offenders incentive to choose treatment given the alternative ofprison. To be a predatory sex offender, someone has committed aggravated and repeated offenses,as well as sex offenses while committing suchcrimes as murder, manslaughter, or robbery. About 15 predatory offenders are commit- ted each year in the state, and none have everbeen released, Holberg said. The law will re-quire a study examining sex offender policyand management. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the law in the Senate. HF3457/SF2858*/CH359 Spending bill becomes law Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a $184 million education spending package May 15 that in-cludes one-time spending and permanentfunding for several K-12 efforts including spe-cial education, teacher training, and high-speed Internet access. The new law will provide money to school districts for vocational education and build-ing improvements and will fix a fundingproblem for charter schools that will allow them to lease buildings more easily. The measure is larger than the two previ- ous non-budget year funding measures. How-ever, both the law in 1998, spending $124million, and the measure from 1996, allocat-ing $31.7 million, dealt only with K-12 edu-cation. This year 's package also includes higher education and early childhood and familyeducation items. The special education money districts will receive under the law along with money fortraining and experience, should especially helpdistricts that are facing budget cuts. Under the law, the state 's special education funding cap will be increased by $83 million.A boost in cross-subsidy special education aidwill allow districts to free up money to spendelsewhere, perhaps restoring some cuts madein past years. Some of those cuts came in the form of teacher layoffs. The growing problem of teacher shortages and the decline \u2014 especially in rural areas \u2014 of experienced instructors in classrooms isaddressed in the measure by a provision thatmakes it easier for districts to bring in teach-ers from other states. Minnesota 's Board of T eaching will be re- quired under the law to issue a temporaryteaching license to a person holding both abachelor 's degree and an out-of-state teach- ing license requiring such a person to havecompleted a teacher preparation program,which included field-specific teaching meth-ods and student teaching. The law also will provide $30.8 million to districts for teacher training and experiencereplacement. The provision is designed to fillthe vacancies left by a great number of teacherretirements and other factors with high qual-ity classroom leaders.12 May 19, 2000In addition, the spending package will pro- vide $31 million to soften the phase-out of aprogram that gave money to districts havinglarge numbers of teachers with extensive ex-perience or advanced degrees. Approximately $11.6 million will be avail- able under the law to the Minnesota StateColleges and Universities (MnSCU) system toaddress unexpected increases in enrollment. The money \u2014 $5.8 million in the current fiscal year and $5.8 million in fiscal year 2001\u2014 will come from the state 's general fund. The law also will spend $9.8 million in fed- eral T emporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF) funds in 2001, with future TANFspending of $23.7 million in 2002-03, for pro-grams such as male responsibility and father-hood grants, child care services, transitionalhousing and citizenship grants. Approximately $12 million for secondary vocational aid is part of the measure. The ad-ditional aid for high school programs will bespread out over a two-year period. The new law will also protect students from Internet material considered obscene or harm-ful to minors. All public school and public library com- puters with access to the Internet available foruse by children under the age of 17 will needto be equipped with up-to-date software fil-tering technology or other methods to restrictstudent viewing of inappropriate material. A public library will not be required to pur- chase filtering technology if the library wouldincur more than incidental expense in mak-ing the purchase, however. If behavioral problems arise in a classroom, the measure will allow teachers and certainother school employees to use \"reasonable \" force to discipline a student. The provisionincludes language pertaining to the legal de-fenses teachers and district agents have againstprosecution for using force to discipline stu-dents. Reasonable force will be permitted to cor- rect or restrain a student or to prevent bodilyharm to another. Furthermore, districts will be required to indicate, in school discipline policy, the cir-cumstances under which teachers, school em-ployees, and school bus drivers may use forceto discipline students. One-time deferred maintenance aid \u2014 to the tune of $23 million dollars \u2014 will be avail- able to school districts under the new law. Thisaid must be applied toward making accessi-bility improvements, or to make fire, safety,or health repairs. Approximately $16 million will be available to districts for reimbursement of certain tele-communications costs. School districts willneed to submit ongoing or recurring telecom-munications costs \u2014 subject to examination by officials from the Department of Children,Families and Learning \u2014 before schools can be reimbursed for the costs. Furthermore, school districts also will be required to inform parents and staff about anyuse of pesticides. Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington) and Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) spon-sored the legislation. Many sections of the law are effective May 16, 2000. Other portions become effec-tive July 1, 2000, or after the beginning of the2000-2001 school year. HF3800*/SF3559/CH489 #ENERGY #EMPLOYMENTThe $184 million omnibus education bill increases spending for high-speed Internet access for K-12schools, and provides funds for teacher training. Workers' compensation law A new law will reduce workers ' compensa- tion rates while increasing benefits for injuredworkers. The law, most of which takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, represents recommendations from theWorkers ' Compensation Advisory Council. The council is composed of representativesfrom the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce,the state 's AFL-CIO, and the Legislature. The law provides an increase in the maxi- mum weekly compensation an injured workercan receive for wage loss benefits. Under pre-vious law, that amount was capped at $615 perweek, but the new law will increase that ben-efit to $750. The minimum amount per weekwill go from $104 to $130. In the case of a worker who is killed in a work-related accident, the minimum amountof compensation for the dependents will be $60,000. Under the law, there will be a transfer of $325 million in surplus funds from the Min-nesota Workers ' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan to the compensation fund 's second in- jury and supplemental benefits program. The assigned risk plan aids in the operation of the workers ' compensation system by pro- viding a source of insurance for employersunable to obtain such coverage from the pri-vate insurance market. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) sponsoredthe measure. HF3960/SF3644*/CH447 Powered by poultry litter A new law changes the definition of biom- ass energy to include poultry litter and plantsgrown specifically for fuel. The law, effective April 25, 2000, could lead the way to construction of an electricity gen-erating facility that uses turkey litter as fuel. Legislation in 1994 relating to the Prairie Island nuclear power facility required publicutilities that operate nuclear power plants inthe state to develop 125 megawatts of electricenergy generated by biomass. The new law allows 50 of the 125 megawatts to be provided by a facility that uses poultrylitter as its primary fuel source. Fiberwatt, a company based in Great Britain, is proposing to build the poultry litter plant inMinnesota. The company owns and operatesthree similar power plants in Great Britain.Session Weekly 13#ENVIRONMENTThose facilities produce energy by burning the litter at 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, produc-ing steam that drives a turbine. Officials fromthe company testified that they are interestedin building the plant in Minnesota because thestate is the second largest turkey producingstate in the nation. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) were thesponsors. HF2757*/SF2614/CH443 Gasoline additives banned A new law limits and ultimately bans gaso- line additives that have caused severe waterpollution in some states. Effective July 1, 2000, gasoline in the state can contain only trace amounts of methyl ter-tiary butyl ether are al-ternative fuel additives to ethanol. Currently, those additives are not used in Minnesota 's gasoline supply. But Rep. Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea), House sponsor of themeasure, said that as other states ban thechemicals, gasoline with those additives couldbe sent to Minnesota unless it is banned here. After July 1, 2000, gasoline cannot contain more than one-third of 1 percent of the chemi-cals. But after July 1, 2005, no traces of thechemicals will be allowed in gasoline, underthe new law. Gasoline is moved through common pipelines throughout the country, so traces of thosechemicals can be found in almost all gasoline. Research shows the additive is responsible A new law will restrict the use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in Minnesota andeventually ban it. The additive has contaminated groundwater in states such as Iowa and California.for several incidents of soil and water contami-nation, including municipal wells as nearbyas Alvord and Ida Grove, Iowa. Minnesota 's legislators are not alone in their concern over the effects of MTBE usage ingasoline. Recent developments in other statesare driving a national reconsideration of us-ing MTBE as an oxygenate in fuel. California Gov. Gray Davis issued an execu- tive order \u2014 supported by a University of California study \u2014 in March 1999 to phase out MTBE from the California gasoline sup-ply by December 31, 2002. Twenty-three states have established regu- latory guidelines or standards for MTBE con-tamination in groundwater or drinking water. Experts say eight ounces of the additive can contaminate five million gallons of drinkingwater. Spillage from a car accident couldthreaten an entire aquifer. Water contaminated by MTBE has a bitter taste and detectable odor. Research has shownit causes tumors in rats. Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy) was the Senate sponsor of the measure. HF3292/SF2946*/CH434 Underwater lumber recovery A new law will allow a person or company to salvage logs that have been submerged onlake and river bottoms. Effective June 1, 2000, the new law will al- low a person or company to apply for a leasethrough the state Department of Natural Re-sources to salvage the logs. Applications forleases will be published in the State Register,and the DNR will approve or deny the appli-cation within 60 days, after allowing 30 daysfor public comments.The fee for a lease will be $500 for Minne- sota residents and $2,500 for those who liveoutside the state. T erms of a lease are nego-tiable. Logs can be salvaged only if they are sub- merged at depths of 20 feet or more. A leasewill require that precautions be taken to avoiddisturbing the bottom of the lake or river, pro-tect public rights in boating or recreation ar-eas, and comply with federal laws. The person or company with a lease will have to notify the Minnesota Historical Soci-ety if they find a historical artifact, such as asled that was used to carry logs across a fro-zen lake. Also, if a log is found that containsan American Indian brand or marking, thenearest tribal government must be notified. The state will receive 25 percent of the money from the sale of the logs, based on theweighted average selling price. The application fees from the leases will go to the state 's general fund. Money from the sale of lumber that is recovered will go to thegame and fish fund, except that if the lake orriver is on school trust fund lands, the moneywill go into the permanent school fund. A person or business cannot hold more than three leases at a time. Permission for mosquito spraying The Metropolitan Mosquito Control Dis- trict will need the approval of the commis-sioner of the Department of NaturalResources before spraying state lands, undera law effective April 7, 2000. Previously, state law allowed a landowner to refuse to allow Mosquito Control to sprayhis or her land with insecticides. The new lawgives the DNR that same right with regard tostate parks, wildlife management areas, orother publicly owned lands. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) spon- sored the measure because Mosquito Controlsprayed chemicals at Fort Snelling State Parkin July 1999 despite objections from thedepartment. Ozment said the DNR should have juris- diction over the decision to spray chemicalsin wildlife management areas because the de-partment has the expertise in the chemicals ' effects on vegetation, water quality, wildlifehabitat, and related issues. He also said that current law gives the De- partment of Health authority over the DNRor landowners to authorize spraying for mos-quitoes that are known to carry diseases. The Senate sponsor of the measure was Sen. Bob Lessard (DFL-Int 'l Falls). HF3134*/SF2857/CH33914 May 19, 2000#FAMILY Parenting plans become law A new law will allow parents who are get- ting a divorce to create a parenting planagreement. The law, most of which is effective Aug. 1, 2000, will allow divorced couples to makeagreements on splitting parenting time. Planscould specify anything from where a child livesduring the day to which parent can teach reli-gious philosophy. Child support issues are notincluded in the law. If both parents agree to a parenting plan, the court must accede unless the court determinesthe plan is not in the best interest of the child. If neither parent agrees to a parenting plan, the court may create one on its own, underthe law. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), the law is similar toa proposal that came from a task force thatstudied the issue during the interim. The court cannot require a parenting plan if one adult has been accused of domestic as-sault or sexual abuse, under the law. In addi-tion, judges must ask individuals if they agreedto the parenting plan voluntarily. The law also replaces the word \"visitation \" in statute with the phrase \"parenting time. \" Dawkins said non-custodial parents find theword \"visitation to be offensive. Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) spon- sored the Senate version. Nearly all provisionsof the new law are effective Jan. 1, 2001. HF3311/SF3169*/CH444 HEALTH CARE LEADER Rep. Lee Greenfield has been a House member since 1978 and is stepping down this year. He isknown for his work in reforming the state's health care system, most notably the creation ofMinnesotaCare, the state's health insurance program for low-income residents. Involuntary commitment A new law will give parents more control in admitting mentally ill children to hospitals. The law, which takes effect Aug. 1, 2000, will add mental illness to previous law governinginvoluntary admission and treatment. The lawcurrently allows parents to admit a child age16 or 17 to a hospital only if the child is men-tally retarded or chemically dependent. The previous law allowed parents to admit children to hospitals for a mental illness up toage 16. The law will now extend that provi-sion to age 18. Even if the 16- or 17-year-oldchild refuses treatment, the parents will be ableto admit the child to a hospital. The law also will require hospital officials to inform the patient that a family memberhas made an inquiry about the patient 's health. The patient would then have to authorize therelease of any information. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) and Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsoredthe legislation. HF3107/SF2634*/CH316Investigating child abuse cases A new law, effective April 15, 2000, will re- peal a 1999 domestic abuse law defining ne-glect and will replace it with languageredefining counties ' responsibilities in domes- tic violence cases affecting children. The law eliminates language that required counties to investigate cases where there is anychild abuse, including verbal or other non-physical abuse. The repealed law also requiredan investigation if a child was within sight orsound of any attempted abuse. Several groups, representing those advocat- ing for domestic violence victims and countysocial service administrators, joined togetherasking legislators to repeal the law because ofits costs. County administrators estimated theold law would cost $30 million statewide iffully implemented. The $30 million projection is based on the additional workers needed to investigate all thenew mandated cases. The new language requires county investi- gation only when the parent \"endangers the child 's mental or physical health, \" the parent engages in \"repeated domestic assault, \" or the child \"witnessed repeated incidents \" of do- mestic violence. Specific guidelines for inves-tigations do not take effect until July 1, 2001. The new law also states that the local wel- fare agency shall consider the safety of thechild and the victim when determining action. Under the repealed law, a victim might have chosen to not report an abusive situation outof fear that he or she would be found inneglect if that person kept living with or moved back in with the abuser. The new law also requires homeless shelter employees to attempt to contact the parentsof a runaway within 72 hours. The employeemust tell the parents or guardian the runaway 's location and status, unless there are compel-ling reasons to withhold that information. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thelaw. HF3176/SF3410*/CH401 Designating custodians for children A new law effective April 15, 2000, allows parents the authority to designate a tempo-rary custodian for their children. The law repeals the previous designated caregiver statute and replaces it with the tem-porary and standby custodian language. Thenew law makes it clearer what should happento children in cases where the parent suddenlyis not available or is incapable of caring forthem, said House sponsor Rep. Darlene Luther(DFL-Brooklyn Park). \"It gives parents an opportunity to file with the court a guardian of the child if there was atragic accident or if they are going out of thecountry for an extended period, \" Luther said. \"It helps families plan ahead and reduce an unnecessary burden on governmental childprotection or foster care resources. \" The law provides more options than the repealed statute, such as outlining standby,Session Weekly 15temporary, and co-custodian guidelines. Standby custodians would assume perma- nent custody in the event of a parent 's inabil- ity to care for the child. A temporary custodianwould have the child or children for two years,up from one year in previous law. A co-custo-dian shares parenting duties with a parentwhen that parent has extended illnesses. The new law also gives a non-custodial par- ent more rights to decide what happens to thechild if the custodial parent becomes ill or dies,Luther said. Under the law, the non-custodialparent would automatically gain custody un-less that parent lost parental rights. The law allows both natural parents to be involved in the decision and requires a hear-ing if the fitness of a non-custodial parent iscalled into question, Luther said. The custodial parent can designate a tem- porary custodian with the consent of the otherparent, under the new law. The repealed designated caregiver statute said the agreement expired four years after itwas signed. The new language designates aperson as temporary custodian indefinitely. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version.

Jesse Ventura. \"It will be a significant new way to reach people we haven 't caught before, \" said Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), who sponsoredthe legislation in the House. \"(The state) will have the capacity to take it straight out of theirbank account without their permission. \" The law will include all financial institutions within the state, from larger banks in the TwinCities to smaller facilities in rural areas. Thelaw was necessary to comply with federalrequirements. The law also will allow the department to send letters to banks, telling them to freeze theamount of money a delinquent parent owes.The department is then responsible for noti-fying the parent the money has been seized. A bank cannot be held liable for damages for seizing funds from accounts, under the law. An appeals process for the parent to con- test the seizure is also outlined in the bill. Entenza said the state Department of Rev- enue and federal Internal Revenue Service al-ready could seize money from bank accounts,but this measure extends that ability to thestate Department of Human Services. Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville)sponsored the Senate version. The law takes effect Aug. 1, 2000. HF3345/SF3016*/CH458 Gambling fraud penalties Tampering with gambling devices or claim- ing a gambling prize through fraud or use ofcounterfeited equipment will now be a felony,under a law effective Aug. 1, 2000. The law will establish felonies if the dollar amount involved in the gambling fraud ex-ceeds $2,500. The maximum penalty for afelony offense will be three years in prison anda $6,000 fine. A person could be charged with a misde- meanor when the dollar amount involved is$500 or less, or a gross misdemeanor when thevalue is between $500 and $2,500. The law will make it illegal to knowingly claim a gambling prize using altered or coun-terfeited equipment. It also will make it ille-gal to claim a prize through fraud, deceit, ormisrepresentation. Tampering with gambling equipment in an attempt to influence the outcome of the gamealso will be illegal, under the law. Gambling officials say the law is necessary to curb the growth of cheating and fraud. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe measure. HF3023/SF2701*/CH318 Card counting devices prohibited Gamblers are prohibited from using devices that can count cards or analyze strategy, un-der a law effective April 7, 2000. Use of suchdevices is now considered a felony. The law establishes several new felonies.For example, attempting to open or enter a device to remove money, chips, or tokens willnow bring a felony charge. Similarly, anyone who intentionally uses counterfeit chips or tokens also could becharged with a felony, as could an employeeof the gambling licensee who cheats. \"There are professional cheats that travel across the state using these devices, \" said Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City), House sponsorof the measure. The law was needed because a card club opened this spring at Canterbury Park inShakopee, Osskopp said. \"There is nothing in law to regulate it, \" he said. Indian-owned casinos are exempt from this law because the state does not havejurisdiction to enforce the measure. The law is modeled after gambling laws in Nevada andNew Jersey, Osskopp said. The law also makes it a felony to manufac- ture, sell, or distribute cards, tokens, or diceused to violate these gambling provisions.Another portion of the law makes it a felonyto instruct someone else to violate the law. The law also expands the list of places where charitable gambling halls can legally makecontributions to include community arts or-ganizations. Previously, contributions couldbe made only to public and private educa-tional institutions, scholarships, churches,natural resources projects. Sen.

HF3571/SF2828*/CH336 Major changes in store Hunting and fishing licenses will see across- the-board increases, under a new law signedMay 15 by Gov. Jesse V entura. The law also allocates a portion of revenue from lottery ticket sales to pay for natural re-sources projects and establishes a state planfor managing the wolf population. The measure had once contained only the license fee increases, but as action for the ses-sion wound down, the other natural resourceissues were attached. License fee increases first passed the House April 13, and the Senate added the provisionsrelated to the wolf management plan and lot-tery ticket revenue. Effective March 1, 2001, the fee increases will send more money to the game and fishfund, which pays for projects that improvewater quality, stock fish and enhance aquaticvegetation, increase public water access, andother such projects. Money from the license fee increases will be matched with revenue from the state 's gen- eral fund. Every $2 of revenue from the fee increase will be matched by $1 from the general fund.The fee increases are projected to raise about$3.1 million in revenue for the 2002-03 bien-nium, and the general fund match will beslightly more than $1.5 million. The bill also includes a $500,000 general fund appropriation to pay for walleye stock-ing in fiscal year 2001. The lottery ticket revenue provision will further increase funding for game and fishprojects, as well as projects for state parks, rec-reational trails, and zoos. Those projects will receive 97 percent of the16 May 19, 2000money that the state collects as a payment in lieu of sales tax on lottery tickets. Of the pro-ceeds from lottery tickets, 16 cents per dollargoes to the state 's general fund, which includes 6.5 cents per dollar that is considered a pay-ment in lieu of sales tax. The wolf management plan that is part of the law is nearly identical to a plan that wasapproved April 11 by the House (in the formof a separate bill). The Senate had clarified part of the mea- sure that allows a person to shoot a wolf thatis attacking livestock or domestic animals. Thenew law specifies that the person can shoot awolf in that situation only on the person 's property. A certified predator controller can be hired to trap wolves in an area where a wolf has de-stroyed livestock or domestic animals. Thetrapping can be done on the farmer 's prop- erty and in a one-mile radius of the site of theattack for 60 days. A person can shoot a wolf in defense of a human life, and guard animals can be used torepel or destroy wolves, under the law. People will also be allowed to \"harass \" a wolf that they actually see within 500 yards ofpeople, buildings, livestock, or domestic ani-mals to discourage wolves from getting tooclose to homes or farms. Any incident where a wolf is killed must be reported within 48 hours to the Departmentof Natural Resources or a University of Min-nesota extension agent. And effective July 1, 2001, compensation for a livestock owner who has an animal that iskilled by a wolf will be based on fair marketvalue instead of the current maximum of $750per animal. No hunting season for wolves will be allowed for five years after the wolf is removed from thefederal list of endangered species.

Unless other- wise noted, theprovisions de-scribed above are effective Aug. 1, 2000. Rep. Mark (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May T ownship) sponsoredthe legislation. HF3046*/SF2950/CH463 Fishing contests, hunting laws Limits on the number of fishing contests in the state were established under a new lawsigned May 15. The law makes several otherchanges to hunting and fishing laws. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, people who want to have fishing contests will need a permit un-less several criteria are met: the number ofparticipants is fewer than 30 for open waterand fewer than 150 for ice fishing; the entryfee is $25 per person or less; the total prizevalue is $25,000 or less; the contest is not lim-ited to trout species only; the contest is notlimited to specifically named waters; and allthe contest participants are age 18 years orunder. If those criteria are not met, the person can apply for a permit from the Department ofNatural Resources. The limits on fishing contests are based on the size of the lake, the number of participants,and the number of days that the contest wouldtake place. And on all bodies of water 55,000acres or less, the DNR commissioner can setaside at least two weekends per month withno permitted fishing contests. A contest for a species on its opening day will not be allowed. The commissioner can specify other restric- tions as part of the permit to prevent undueloss of fish or to accommodate other concernsregarding large fishing contests. Another provision in the law will improve some people 's chances of getting a license to hunt moose. Minnesotans who have appliedfor and failed to get a license at least 10 timescan apply in a separate selection process. The separate process will make 20 percent of all moose-hunting licenses available tothose applicants who have repeatedly failed towin a license. The state issues a limited number of such licenses every other year, through a lotterysystem that includes all applicants in one pool.In 1999, 189 licenses were issued to hunt innortheastern Minnesota. There will not be amoose hunt in 2000. A new deer license will be established un- der the bill, which will allow the holder to takeone antlered buck throughout the state, ratherthan from a particular area. The license willcost $66. Deer licenses currently cost $22, anda separate law will increase that to $25 in 2001. Another provision in the law allows a per- son with mental retardation or a related con-dition to receive a provisional firearms safetycertificate and hunting license. The person will need to complete the class- room portion of the firearms safety course,and he or she could then hunt only while ac-companied by a parent, guardian, or otheradult who possesses a firearms safety certifi-cate. The law does not apply if the person isotherwise prohibited from possessing a fire-arm under state or federal law. The law also takes a step toward resolving questions about state lands within the Bound-ary Waters Canoe Area. The state owns about 100,000 acres of land, known as school trust land, in that area. Mostof the land was donated from the federal gov-ernment when Minnesota became a state. The state-owned land is located on various parcels and is surrounded by federal land.Revenue from the land, through leases and thesale of logging rights, goes to the state 's per- manent school fund. The University of Minnesota, Duluth will conduct an inventory and appraisal of the statelands to determine exactly how many acres ofland belong to the state and provide otherdetailed information about the land. That information will allow the state to ne- gotiate a land exchange with the federal gov-ernment, so that the state-owned parcelswould be separate from the federal land. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Bob Lessard (DFL-Int 'l Falls) sponsored the legislation. The law also includes a minor change in a law that allows lighted fishing lures to be usedin the state, which is effective May 16, 2000. Other provisions of the law are effective Aug. 1, 2000. HF866/SF1288*/CH473Session Weekly 17Lifetime licenses A new law will make lifetime hunting and fishing licenses available to Minnesotans andresidents of other states. Under the measure, people who want to hunt and fish will have the option to buy ei-ther a lifetime license or the traditional an-nual license. The licenses are scheduled to be available March 1, 2001, for Minnesota residents andMarch 1, 2002, for nonresidents. Fees for lifetime licenses are based on four groups: ages 3 and under, ages 4 to 15, ages 16to 50, and ages 51 and older. Lifetime fishing licenses for Minnesota resi- dents in those age groups will cost $227, $300,$383, and $203 respectively. People who pur-chase that license will still need to purchaseannual stamps if they want to fish for salmonor trout. Lifetime fishing licenses will also be avail- able for nonresidents at higher prices. Lifetime small-game hunting licenses for residents will cost $217, $290, $363, and $213for the same age groups. Those will also beavailable to nonresidents at a higher price. Lifetime deer hunting licenses for residents will cost $337, $450, $573, and $383respectively. The law also will allow lifetime sporting li- censes for residents that would cover fishingand small-game hunting. Such licenses willcost $357, $480, $613, and $413 respectively. Lifetime deer hunting or sporting licenses will not be available for nonresidents. Revenue from the licenses will establish a lifetime fish and wildlife trust fund. Money inthat fund will be invested by the state Boardof Investment, and it will pay for projects thatcurrently are funded by revenue from annualhunting and fishing licenses. The law was sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Bob Lessard(DFL-Int 'l Falls). HF3510*/SF3378/CH341 Law allows lighted lures A new law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, will allow anglers to use lighted fishing lures. While the lures are used in neighboring states, current state law allows the manufac-ture and sale of lighted lures but does not al-low anglers to use them in Minnesota waters. Rep. Chris Gerlach (R-Apple Valley) spon- sored the measure in the House on behalf of aconstituent who manufactures those lures,which contain a small battery. The new law also contains a provision man- dating that batteries used in lighted fishinglures cannot contain mercury. That provisionof the law was added due to concerns that the #GOVERNMENTAnglers in Minnesota will now be able to uselighted fishing lures due to a law passed in the2000 Legislative Session. batteries could be swallowed by fish or lost inthe water. Mercury pollution has caused theDepartment of Natural Resources to issuewarnings against eating fish in some lakes inthe state. A separate bill was signed into law that fur- ther clarified that spotlights or other power-ful light sources are prohibited whilefishing. Sen. Pat Pariseau (R-Farmington) spon- sored the legislation in the Senate. HF3352/SF3586*/CH308 Permits for disabled hunters A special hunting permit will be available to people who have a permanent disability,under a new law effective Jan. 1, 2001. The permit will allow people with certain medical conditions to use a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle while hunting in the state 's wildlife management areas. The law will allow the commissioner of natural resources to issue such permits topeople who cannot step from a vehicle with-out the aid of a wheelchair, crutches, braces,or other means of support. Permits will also be available to people who have heart or lung conditions and requirebreathing assistance. A person who fraudulently applies for a permit, or a physician or chiropractor whofraudulently certifies that a person is disabled,will be guilty of a misdemeanor, under the law. Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R-Cedar) and Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May T ownship) sponsoredthe legislation. HF2603/SF2346*/CH265 Longer ice fishing season The 2000 ice fishing season was extended by nine days, under a law effectiveFeb. 17, 2000. The measure was sponsored in the House by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), who said itwould help small businesses and resorts in areas where ice fishing is popular. Those busi-nesses lost potential income due to unusuallywarm weather in the early winter and a lackof snow. Under previous state law, the ice fishing sea- son was to last until the third Sunday in Feb-ruary, which this year would have beenFeb. 20. The new law extended the season through Feb. 29. The extension also included the spear-ing season. The Senate sponsor was Sen. Pat Pariseau (R-Farmington). HF2980/SF2763*/CH251 Wide-ranging state funding law Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a $185 million state government appropriations measure,which contains new funding for courts, natu-ral resources, and jobs and housing programs.He did line-item veto two minor provisions. The omnibus law will spend $79.9 million from the general fund and another $105 mil-lion from other accounts, including $100 mil-lion in federal Temporary Assistance to NeedyFamilies (TANF) funds. Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed $1.78 million from the measure. He singled out twoprovisions \u2014 $1.75 million for construction grants at adult regional jail facilities and$30,000 for purchasing drug detection dogs. The largest portion of the spending law deals with health and human services pro-grams, where it will spend a total of $138 mil-lion \u2014 $26 million from the general fund, $12 million in forecast changes, and $100 millionin TANF dollars. Proposals to increase sanctions for people who fail to meet work requirements of theMinnesota Family Investment Program(MFIP) were dropped in conferencecommittee. The law will pump $26 million into improv- ing salary for health care providers in nursinghomes, group homes and those who servepeople with disabilities. The law creates a 3percent cost-of-living increase. There also wasa cost-of-living increase last year. Beginning later this year, the income limits for seniors would be increased to allow morepeople to receive aid under the state 's prescrip- tion drug program. In 2002, the program willbe expanded further to include people withpermanent disabilities who meet the same in-come limits. MFIP programs will receive $20 million in TANF money for county-level intervention to18 May 19, 2000provide family employment grants. Money will be used to help hard-to-employ individu-als, who face barriers such as transportationproblems, chemical dependency, lack of edu-cation, or the inability to speak English. The law will provide $6.6 million toward economic development programs. Among thehighlights are $1 million in grants to expandInternet services in rural towns. Another pro-vision will provide $1 million to boost tour-ism in northern Minnesota. And the law will appropriate $50 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency. Ap-proximately $30 million will go toward build-ing and financing affordable housing units.The remaining $20 million is an interest-freeloan to Habitat for Humanity. The law features $6.5 million in new spend- ing for the Department of Public Safety, Monarch becomes state butterfly A new law, effective Aug. 1, 2000, makes the monarch the state butterfly. It is the 13th state symbol, joining the state flag and state seal, state tree (red or Norwaypine), state song ( \"Hail! Minnesota \"), state bird (loon), state fish (walleye), state mush-room (morel), state drink (milk), state grain(wild rice), state muffin (blueberry), stateflower (lady slipper), and state gemstone (LakeSuperior agate). The idea for the butterfly law came from a group of fourth-grade students at OH Ander-son Elementary School in Mahtomedi. Theywere studying how a bill becomes a law and aspecial unit on butterflies. Then the studentsdecided to combine the two and bring the ideato Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), whosponsored the law. The last state symbol to be established was the blueberry muffin in 1988, which was pro-posed by third-grade students from Carlton,a small town near Duluth. The students feltthat the choice was appropriate because blue-berries are plentiful in northern Minnesota,and farmers throughout the state produceother ingredients needed to make the muffins. Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2588/SF2326*/CH306Paying costs of lawsuits A new law will potentially require state agencies that instigate unsuccessful lawsuits topay higher costs to defendants. Currently, agencies are required to pay the attorneys ' fees and other expenses of a defen- dant when the agency brings a civil action andloses, under certain conditions. Effective Aug.1, 2000, the new law will expand the types ofexpenses that can be recovered by the prevail-ing party, and it clarifies the procedure for re-ceiving those awards from a court oradministrative law judge. The new law will allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable costs of any study, analy-sis, engineering report, test, or project that theparty has done in response to the state 's ac- tion. Those costs are added to those that al-ready can be recovered under current law,including various court fees, mileage, postage,and delivery costs. Also, previous law limited the amount of attorney fees that can be recovered to $100 perhour. The new law will raise that limit to $125per hour. The new law also modifies the definition of who is eligible for recovering those types ofexpenses. Groups that are eligible under ex-isting law include organizations with up to 50employees and annual revenues that do notexceed $4 million. The new law will expandthe eligibility by increasing the number ofemployees to 500 and the annual revenues to$7 million. The law applies only if the state agency fails to justify its position when it instigates a civilsuit or contested case other than a tort action. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) and Sen. Ember Reichgott Eligibility for the state's prescription drug discountprogram will be expanded to include disabled resi-dents under a provision in the omnibus stateappropriations law.$3 million for courts, and $1.2 million for theCenter for Crime Victims Services. District courts will receive $2.7 million to reduce judge vacancies across the state. Somesalaries for judges could be paid through thisappropriation. The Department of Corrections will receive $2.25 million, which includes $500,000 fordesigning a joint headquarters for the depart-ments of Corrections and Public Safety. The Department of Natural Resources will obtain $5.4 million. Approximately $4 millionwould go toward settling legal costs incurredfrom litigation involving several Indian tribes. The other $1.4 million will be used as grants for northern counties that have wildfire con-cerns this year. Grants can go toward purchas-ing emergency communications and responseequipment or for training to prepare for wild-fires. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) sponsoredthe law. Many of the individual provisions are ef- fective May 16, 2000. HF2699*/SF3798/CH488 Turning over state property The state turned over ownership of a former correctional facility to the city of Sauk Centreunder a law effective April 5, 2000. The facility was established in 1911 as a fa- cility for delinquent girls and became coedu-cational in 1967. Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria), House sponsor of the measure, said the MinnesotaCorrectional Facility-Sauk Centre was closedin July 1999 and has been vacant since then. Local officials can now use the property for economic development or for city or countygovernment purposes, which Cassell said willbe a vehicle to create jobs. The city must studyland-use options to determine the best use ofthe property and submit a report to the stateDepartment of Administration. If the state had not turned the land over toSession Weekly 19the city, the state Department of Administra- tion estimated that it would have spent$200,000 per year in minimal maintenance tothe vacant facility. Under state law, when an agency vacates a piece of property, the state Department ofAdministration offers the property to otherstate agencies or departments that might wantto use the property. But in this case, no otheragency expressed interest. Cassell said that the land originally was pur- chased by the city and given to the state in theearly 1900s to be used as a correctional facil-ity. The city also extended water and sewerlines to the buildings and has continued tomaintain that system. Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) was the Senate sponsor of the measure. HF2819/SF2444*/CH326 #HEALTH Regulating alternative care A law that will allow the Department of Health to oversee complementary and alter-native health care practices was signed by Gov.Jesse Ventura. The law will establish an office, housed at the Department of Health, for unlicensedcomplementary and alternative health care. The office will investigate complaints against alternative health care practitioners,will discipline practitioners in some cases, andwill serve as a clearinghouse for informationon such practices. Language in the law enabling the depart- ment to oversee complementary and alterna-tive heath care practices was added to themeasure by a conference committee before itwas presented to the governor for hissignature. The proposal drew some criticism from House members during debate on the confer-ence committee report earlier this month. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), a physi- cian, said some fear exists in the medical com-munity that patients may opt for one or moreunproven alternative treatments instead ofconventional medicine for life-threateningillnesses. Mulder said that by approving the measure, legislators were recognizing procedures thathave not been based on scientific fact. But Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), sponsor of the legislation, said the new law willprovide for consumer protection and does notencourage the use of procedures unproven inthe medical community. The law also will make changes to theregulation of both speech-language patholo- gists and audiologists, unlicensed mentalhealth practitioners, and alcohol and drugcounselors. Furthermore, the law will alter the Admin- istrative Simplification Act by requiring a uni-form report for offering medical and benefitsadvice, as well as a uniform document explain-ing benefits for patients and providers. Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. Most sections of the new law take effect Aug. 1, 2000. Sections about governing proceduresfor alternative health care and recommenda-tions for making employee health insuranceaffordable are effective May 12, 2000. HF3839*/SF2474/CH460 Training for care providers Foster and respite care providers will have to meet training standards to care for childrendependent on certain medical devices to live,under a law effective Aug. 1, 2000. The law is an attempt to decrease the chance that a child left in the company of a foster careprovider could suffer harm due to a provider 's inexperience or lack of training with specialequipment critical to the life and care of thechild. Care providers will be required to have training or experience with a child 's medical equipment before being allowed to care for thechild. Agencies that place children in homes, even if it's only on a temporary basis, will be re- quired to ensure that the care provider has thenecessary training before being entrusted withthe child 's care. The legislation was brought forward with the help of Sharon Morrissey and husband,Don Baierl, of St. Paul, whose infant daughterdied in 1997 because a care provider didn 't know precisely how to operate the child 's health equipment. The Department of Human Services will be required to develop the training form. Offi-cials expect little, if any, fiscal impact to thedepartment. Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored themeasure. HF3342/SF3025*/CH338 Prescription drug cards People will be prohibited from selling, mar- keting, promoting, and distributing any cardoffering discounts for prescription drugs thatfails to meet certain requirements, under a law. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the measure will al- low an individual or the state attorneygeneral to sue to stop any such act and obtain damages any deception may have caused. The measure will protect consumers from promised discounts that are either confusingor not backed by insurance policies. Discounts that are deceptive or that are not authorized by contract with the pharmacieslisted on the card, will be in violation of thenew law, and people issuing or distributing thecards will be subject to prosecution. Also, discount cards will have to promi- nently state that discounts offered are not be-ing offered through any insurance policy. The new law will not apply, however, to vi- sion care, glasses, or contact lenses providedby an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Discounts promised under contract with the state of Minnesota, or a consumer discountcard issued by a store for use at that particu-lar store will also be allowed. Furthermore, a card administered by a health insurer, nonprofit health service plancorporation, or health maintenance organiza-tion will be exempt from complying with cardrequirements put forth by the law. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) sponsoredthe legislation. HF2883/SF2579*/CH303 Exposure to bloodborne diseases A law will establish procedures regarding occupational exposure to bloodborne diseasesfor emergency medical services (EMS) person-nel, corrections employees, and secure treat-ment facility workers. The law addresses proper procedure for ob- taining consent for testing, obtaining and test-ing blood samples for bloodborne diseases,and for informing individuals of blood testresults, in certain situations. The situations the new law will apply to in- clude cases when people holding these occu-pations are exposed to a bloodborne diseasein the course of carrying out their jobs. The measure also will expand the state 's HIV and Hepatitis B prevention program forhealth professionals to cover Hepatitis C. HIVis the virus that causes AIDS. Also, the law modifies notification require- ments that apply when emergency medicalpersonnel are exposed to a person with activetuberculosis. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen.

Myron Orfield bids the House adieu as members pack up and ad- journ for the year. Orfield served as a House legislator for five terms, andhe is running for a spot in the state Senate. #HIGHER EDUCATIONDealing with 'sharps' Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law aimed at re- ducing occupational exposures to bloodbornediseases through \"sharps \" injuries. Effective June 10, 2000, the law will require employers to comply with federal Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) regulations on bloodbornepathogens. It also will require that employers review written exposure control plans annually anddocument in the plan consideration of appro-priate engineering controls that are designedto eliminate or minimize exposure. Sharps are needles and other medical de- vices used in testing. They are often used todraw blood and therefore carry the most riskfor exposure to diseases carried through theblood. The new law will require that a company establish a safety committee to make recom-mendations for using the best methods tolimit injury. The law also will require that aperson representing employees most likely touse or encounter a device creating exposureto bloodborne pathogens will be appointed tothe committee. Finally, the employer will be required to es- tablish internal procedures to document theroute of exposure and circumstances underwhich an exposure incident took place. Thelaw spells out how information must be docu-mented, as well. It should include the proce-dure being performed when the incident tookplace and the protective equipment or cloth-ing used at the time of the exposure incident. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thelegislation. HF2639/SF2397*/CH351 Jury duty for nursing mothers A judicial task force will suggest possible changes to jury rules for nursing mothers,under a law effective Aug. 1, 2000. The Supreme Court Jury Reform Task Force has been instructed to study the issue and sug-gest recommendations to accommodate theneeds of nursing mothers who are selected forjury duty. During the 2000 session, the House even- tually accepted the Senate language calling fora study. However, an earlier version of theHouse bill would have exempted all nursingmothers from jury duty.

HF1865*/SF2094/CH269Designing campus buildings Representatives of colleges, universities, and state agencies will be allowed to vote on thedesign of state buildings, under a new law ef-fective Aug. 1, 2000. Contracts for designing state buildings are awarded through the state Designer SelectionBoard. Under current law, the agency or school that will be using a new building appoints a non-voting member to the board, which consistsof five voting members. The board looks atdesign plans from competing firms and de-cides which firm will receive the contract. Under the new law, the board will consist of seven voting members, including one whowill represent the school or agency that willbe using the proposed building. Other board members will represent the American Institute of Architects, the Associ-ated General Contractors, the ConsultingEngineers Council of Minnesota (with inputfrom other professional engineering societiesin the state), the Minnesota State Arts Board,and two citizen members who will be ap-pointed by the state commissioner of theDepartment of Administration. If, for example, a building is being designed for the University of Minnesota, the univer-sity will have a vote on the final design of thebuilding. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen.

HF3195/SF3701*/CH384 #HOUSING Interest on security deposits A new law effective Aug. 1, 2000, will delay a scheduled increase in the interest rate paidby property owners on tenant securitydeposits. Current law sets the rate at 3 percent until 2001, and after that time the rate was to beincreased to 4 percent. The new law willchange the date of the increase to 4 percentfrom May 1, 2001, to May 1, 2004. State law related to the interest rate on se- curity deposits has been adjusted several timesin recent years. The 1992 Legislature changedthe rate from 5.5 percent to 4 percent untilMay 1, 1997, but the rate was to return to 5.5percent thereafter. In 1996, the rate was cut to3 percent until May 1, 1999, with an increaseto 4 percent thereafter. The 1998 Legislature extended the 3 percent rate until 2001, and the new law will give itthree more years. Rep.

HF3132*/SF2890/CH282 Newborn drop-off law A law effective April 19, 2000, allows a mother \u2014 or a person of her consent \u2014 to leave an unharmed newborn at a hospitalemergency room up to 72 hours following thechild 's birth without fear of prosecution. A hospital is required to accept the child and to notify a local welfare agency within 24 hoursof the departure of the person bringing thebaby to the hospital. Under Minnesota law, a mother who will- fully neglects a newborn when she is reason-ably able to care for the infant can be chargedwith a gross misdemeanor. The new law pro-vides a small exception. This law allows the individual delivering the unwanted newborn to exit the building with-out providing identification. The hospital isallowed to ask questions about the medicalhistory of the mother or newborn, but the per-son leaving the baby is not required to pro-vide any information. A newborn that is left behind will be con- sidered an abandoned child. The baby, accord-ing to the new law, must not have any obviousinjuries or illness in order for the hospital toaccept it. A hospital or employee of the hospital re- ceiving the child is considered immune fromany civil liability that could potentially result,if the act of receiving the newborn is done ingood faith. Furthermore, a social service agency taking custody of the child is not required to laterreunite the child with its parents or search forrelatives of the child as a placement option. Officials are uncertain how many babies hospitals could realistically expect to bedropped off as a result of the new law. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) and Sen.

The Ah-Gwah-Ching center serves residents whose aggressive or difficult to manage behav-ioral needs cannot be met in their homecommunity.In his veto message, V entura said that the bill was \"unnecessary \" because law currently exists prohibiting the commissioner of theDepartment of Human Services to close thefacility without the Legislature 's approval. Ventura vetoed the bill April 3 and the House voted to override the veto the follow-ing day. The Senate override came later inApril, and the measure will become law effec-tive Aug. 1, 2000. In addition to language in the measure call- ing for the center to remain open, the law willclarify the admissions criteria of the facilityand require that the center promote emer-gency admittance and geriatric rapid assess-ment stabilization programs.

Under a new law effective April 21, 2000, stakeholders include family members, advo-cacy organizations, counties, service provid-ers, and the office of the ombudsman formental health and mental retardation. The law requires those taking over guard- ianship responsibilities to be either a multi-purpose agency providing a broad range ofsocial services or a new or existing officewithin state government that does not cur-rently have duties related to mentally retardedpeople. The law also states that an entity must pro- vide assurance that it will act in the best inter-ests of each person left in its care. Officials must provide recommendations for transferring guardianship responsibilities,including cost estimates, to the chair of theHouse Health and Human Services PolicyCommittee and the chair of the Senate Healthand Family Security Committee by Decem-ber 15, 2000, under the law.

JesseV entura. The new law will require that people with disabilities be provided with a telephone num-ber to call for the purpose of filing a complaintwith the office of the ombudsman for mentalhealth and mental retardation. The measure also eliminates a previous re- quirement that stated requests for home careservices for persons residing in a foster caresetting include the foster care placementagreement and a determination of the level ofan enrollee 's difficulty of care. Shared personal care assistant and private duty nursing services will be allowed to takeplace outside an enrollee 's home or foster home when normal life activities take a carerecipient outside his or her typical care set-ting, under the new law. Several other technical changes to depart- ment language regarding care for disabledpersons are included as part of the law. A fewof those provisions pertain to requirementsfor rate and pay adjustments for facilities thatcare for the disabled. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) and Sen.

HF3409*/SF2841/CH474 Recourse for vulnerable adults Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a law May 15 that will create a panel to review decisions madeby lead agencies regarding cases of potentialmaltreatment of vulnerable adults. The law will provide a vulnerable adult or individual acting on behalf of such a personthe opportunity to challenge an agency 's de- cision before an impartial body. Under current law, a vulnerable adult or person acting on his or her behalf has no otherplace to appeal but to the agency that pro-duced the decision. The board created by the new law will con- sist of representatives from the Departmentof Human Services and the Department ofHealth, the ombudsman for older Minneso-tans, and the ombudsman for mental healthand mental retardation. A request for a review, the law states, will be taken up at the panel 's next quarterly meeting. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of the legislation, referred to the measure as a\"quality assurance approach \" to reviewing decisions in cases of potential maltreatment. The law will require that within 30 days of the panel 's review, it must notify the lead agency and the person who requested the re-view of its decision. The panel may decidewhether it agrees with the agency 's decision or require the agency to reconsider its ruling. If the panel were to decide that the agency must reconsider its disposition, the measurewill require the agency reconsider and reportback to the panel with its determinationwithin 30 days. Furthermore, the panel will be required to report to the Legislature each January thenumber of requests for review it received, thenumber of cases where the panel required thelead agency to reconsider its decision, thenumber of times when the final dispositionwas changed, and any recommendations toimprove the review or investigative process. Finally, the commissioner of the Depart- ment of Human Services will be required tooffer medically necessary psychiatric and den-tal services to developmentally disabled clientsin the Faribault service area, which would ex-tend 100 miles around the city, under the newlaw.

Jesse Ventura will assist Holocaust survivors in settling and col-lecting insurance claims. Aimed at insurance companies and their af- filiates that do business in Minnesota and is-sued policies in Europe prior to 1946, the lawallows the commissioner of the Departmentof Commerce to provide special assistance toMinnesota residents who have claims to settle. The law allows the department to establish a registry of records of Holocaust-related in-surance policies and claims. The registry willcontain information such as a list of policiessold with the names of the insured and theirbeneficiaries, and whether the proceeds havebeen paid. Companies that fail to provide the data to assist victims and their beneficiaries could befined or have their authority to do business inthe state suspended. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), House sponsor of the legislation, said that often lifeinsurance claims require a death certificate,which for a Holocaust victim is not available. He said there are about 200 Holocaust sur- vivors living in the state. Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) was the Sen- ate sponsor. The law is effective April 14, 2000. HF3756/SF3423*/CH367 Prompt payment of claims Health insurance companies will be re- quired to promptly pay clean claims by healthcare providers and facilities, under a laweffective Jan. 1, 2001. Third-party administrators also will be sub- ject to payment requirements, but the new lawwill not pertain to services provided by phar-macists. A \"clean claim \" is defined as a claim that has no defect or impropriety, including anylack of required documentation or any cir-cumstance that prevents timely payment. Health plan companies and third-party ad- ministrators will be required to pay or deny aclean claim within 30 days of receiving theclaim. Claims not paid in that time will besubject to an interest payment of 1.5 percentof the claim per month. The company providing the health plan or the third-party administrator would be re-sponsible for paying the interest \u2014 not the insured party. Late claim payments will not be subject to an interest payment if the payment is delayed sothat the company can review potentially fraudu-lent or abusive billing practices, however.Furthermore, the commissioner of the Department of Health will be prohibited fromassessing a financial administrative penaltyagainst a health plan company that violates thelaw.

HF2643/SF2767*/CH349 Liability for providing alcohol A new law will make people who supply al- cohol to those under age 21 subject to civilsuits. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the law is an attempt to curtail parties where adults serve liquor tojuveniles. House sponsor Rep. Phil Carruthers(DFL-Brooklyn Center) said the law will po-tentially make such adults liable for the ac-tions of a juvenile after he or she leaves thepremises. The law will pertain to people who do not possess liquor licenses, thereby covering eventslike house parties. The law will make an adult liable for actions of the minor if the adult supplied alcohol andhad control over the premises, was in a rea-sonable position to stop the juvenile fromdrinking, or knowingly and recklessly permit-ted the underage consumption of alcohol. The intoxicated teen who caused any injury or other harm would not be able to sue theperson providing the alcohol. The law includes a provision that says homeowners cannot purchase liability cover-age under their homeowner 's insurance to cover liability for an intoxicated juvenile 's ac- tions, unless it is specifically stated in thepolicy that it is meant to cover such situations.However, that provision will expire Dec. 31,2001. The law stems from cases such as a 1997 New Year 's Eve crash that killed St. Paul teen- ager Kevin Brockway, who was leaving a partywhere alcohol was provided by another teen 's parent. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the Senate version.

Steve Smith (R-Mound) was the House sponsor of the measure, which also redefinesSession Weekly 23harassment to include a \"single incident \" that has a \"substantial adverse effect. \" Previously, law required there be repeated incidents foran act to be considered harassment. Smith said a key provision in the law is that it will not require a hearing to take place onevery harassment complaint. \"It gives the court the flexibility they wanted after 10 years of looking at this statute, \" Smith said. A judge can throw out frivolous harassment complaints, such as those involving name-call-ing, Smith said. The judges would then havemore time to hear serious harassment mat-ters, he added. The state began tracking restraining order filings in 1992, when 4,800 were filed. Last year,8,800 retaining orders were filed. A victim must allege a clear and present danger of harassment before the court mayissue a temporary restraining order, under thelaw. The new law does not eliminate the court 's option of waiving a fee for restraining ordersin cases of financial hardship. Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the Senate version.

The law will create a uniform statewide sys- tem that dictates when a public defendershould be brought in to represent a child. Ajuvenile age 10 or older could obtain a publicdefender, but a child under age 10 could not. \"Infants don 't need separate legal council, and it 's a waste of money, \" said Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), who was House spon-sor of the measure. \"Some attorneys are being hired to represent a 2-year-old. That doesn 't need to be done. \" The law originates from the state Board of Public Defenders. In a recent letter, State Pub-lic Defender John Stuart explained that the lawpertains only to child protection or servicescases, not to juvenile delinquency cases. Stuart said some courts never appoint at- torneys unless the child is at least 12 years old,while other courts always appoint a lawyer foryoung children. \"The age of 10 was chosen as the cutoff be- cause children under the age of 10 cannot becharged with juvenile delinquency, but maybe dealt with in a children in need ofprotection or services proceeding, \" Stuart wrote.

The new law also gives wholesalers the right to a jury trial against brewers, and it providesthat the right to bring action may not bewaived except at the time the suit is filed. The state 's beer brewers and wholesalers laws include provisions prohibiting brewersfrom inducing or coercing wholesalers intoaccepting delivery of any alcoholic beverageor any other commodity which wasn 't ordered by the wholesaler. The laws also establish the right of free as- sociation between all brewers and wholesal-ers. Brewers cannot collaborate to fix orartificially elevate prices. Rep.

HF1947/SF1618*/CH415 Access to information Public defenders will be given access to law enforcement databases, under a law effectiveAug. 1, 2000. The new law will allow state and district public defenders, along with any attorney whois working for a public defense corporation,limited access to various criminal and juve-nile databases. \"The defense felt they should have access to information on the people they are defend-ing,\" said Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada), House sponsor of the measure. \"We felt it was a fairness issue. \" Public defenders will be given access to data regarding the attorney 's client only and will not be able to examine data on other people.The defender also will not have access to ac-tive and ongoing investigative data, under thelaw. The proposal came from the State Public Defender 's Office, Broecker said. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate version of the legislation. HF3950/SF3154*/CH37724 May 19, 2000#LOCAL GOVERNMENTInformation on sexual predators Attorneys will have more access to court and health records of possible predatory sex of-fenders, under a law signed May 15 by Gov.Jesse Ventura. The law makes alterations to the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, which allows the stateto civilly commit repeated predatory offend-ers to treatment. The law allows county attorneys or the at- torney general access to health and courtrecords before a petition is filed in court. Priorto this law, attorneys obtained those recordsafter a petition is filed. \"What they want to do is look at the health records, \" said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), House sponsor of the measure. There are about 160 predatory offenders in state hospitals. The offenders have completedtheir prison sentence and have been sent to astate hospital for treatment rather than beingreleased into the general populace. While a predatory offender could complete treatment and be released from a state hospi-tal, that has yet to happen in the six-year his-tory of the civil commitment law. Because attorneys will have access to records before a petition is filed, they might determinethat civil commitment is not necessary and notpursue a petition, Skoglund said. The law will require that the individual be notified that attorneys are seeking his or herrecords. However, that notice can be waived ifit could result in harm or harassment of po-tential witnesses. The health and court records are not con- sidered public information. The Legislature approved the Sexually Dan- gerous Persons Act during a special session in1994. The law stemmed from a case involvingDennis Linehan, who had a history of rapingteen-agers in the 1960s and murdered oneperson. Linehan was set to be freed after acourt struck down his commitment, sayingLinehan could control his personal behavior. Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the Senate version.

HF2880/SF2854*/CH480#RECREATION Township name change A new state law allows the residents of the township of Lake Edwards in Crow WingCounty to drop the \"s\" from the town 's name. There has been confusion about whether the legal name of the township had the \"s\" at the end, and the confusion has led to delayswhen the town has had to file documents withstate and federal governments.T ownship officials discovered that to legally change the name to the township of Lake Ed-ward would ordinarily require a petitionsigned by at least 55 percent of the number ofresidents who voted in the last generalelection. For Lake Edwards, a rural township located in the central part of the state with a popula-tion of approximately 1,500 people, the costsassociated with that process seemed too high. The new law allows the county board to change the name of the township upon receiv-ing a resolution from the town board request-ing the change. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) and Sen.

HF2521/SF2320*/CH253 Resolving boundary adjustments A law will clarify the process for resolving disputes over municipal boundary adjust-ments. Those adjustments, such as consolidations or annexations of towns or cities, used to beresolved by the Minnesota Municipal Board. The board was abolished in 1999. The Leg- islature had set Dec. 31, 1999, as the date forthe board to expire, but all of the boardmembers resigned by June 1999, which leftsome of the adjustments unresolved. At that time, the board 's duties were set to be transferred to Minnesota Planning, a stateagency that acts as a long-range planning armof the governor 's administration. The new law, effective April 27, 2000, clari- fies the dispute resolution process that maybe used, and it authorizes the director of Min-nesota Planning to delegate such disputes tothe Office of Administrative Hearings. Theparties involved in the dispute will share theassociated costs of the resolution process. Some provisions of the new law are retro- active to June 1, 1999, to address the disputesthat were unresolved by the municipal board. The law also requires Minnesota Planning to send a report to the House and Senate com-mittees on local government and metropoli-tan affairs during the 2001 Legislative Session,regarding the effects of the transfer of duties.

Currently, annual park permits are valid only for the calendar year. Proponents of the new law said it likely will increase the number of annual permits thatare sold and encourage more visits to stateparks year-round. Earlier this year, an official from the Parks and Recreation Division of the Departmentof Natural Resources said survey results showthe state could sell about 5,000 more permitsper year. The change could make enforcement more difficult than the current system, where anannual permit is distinctive and easy for parkemployees to see. But the official told lawmak-ers the change will be manageable because thesticker will be designed to clearly show themonth and year it expires. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen.

HF2505*/SF2289/CH278 Law sets fine for studs The governor signed a measure that adds a civil penalty for using metal traction devices,or studs, on snowmobiles. The new law was necessary because a civil penalty was inadvertently left out of a 1999 lawthat requires people to purchase a sticker for theirsnowmobiles if they intend to use studs. The 1999 measure contains criminal pen- alties for people who drive a snowmobile withstuds on a paved state trail. The new law, effective April 5, 2000, estab- lishes civil penalties for people who use snow-mobile studs but do not purchase a sticker. For the first offense, the penalty is capped at $50. The fine for a second offense is up to$300, and for third and subsequent offensesthe fine is up to $600. A new law imposes civil fines and penalties forunauthorized use of snowmobile studs. Criminalpenalties were enacted during the 1999Legislative Session.Session (R-Blaine) (R-Circle Pines) spon-sored the legislation. HF3555/SF3283*/CH324 Legislators made changes to the bleacher safety requirements passed into law during 1999. Heightrequirements were raised for bleachers required to have gaps no more than four inches and exemp-tions were expanded. Implementation of the requirements was also delayed.#TAXES#SAFETY Bleacher safety changes Safety requirements for bleachers, such as those at sports facilities or local parks, will bemodified under a new law that takes effectJan. 1, 2002. New safety requirements for bleachers were signed into law last year, but Gov. Jesse Venturaline-item vetoed $100,000 that would havehelped communities and school districts paythe costs of complying with the new standards. The 1999 law required bleachers that are taller than 30 inches to have gaps betweenseats, floorboards, and guardrails that do notexceed 4 inches. Otherwise, safety nets mustbe installed under bleachers that have gapswider than 4 inches. The previous standardfor gaps was 9 inches. The new law will make the 4-inch require- ment apply to bleachers that are at least 55inches (nearly 5 feet) tall. Retractable bleachers that are in place by Jan. 1, 2001, and that meet the previous 9-inchrequirement for gaps, will be exempted fromthe 4-inch requirement. The responsibleschool district or organization will have tosubmit a safety management plan and amor-tization schedule for complying with the 4-inch standard. A separate bill (HF4078) extended that ex- emption to bleachers at public and privatecolleges and universities in the state that meet the 9-inch standard. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester), House sponsor of the new measure, said it will easethe financial burden for schools, county fairs,and local parks departments without compro-mising safety standards. The original legislation was brought for- ward after 6-year-old T oby Lee of Mound fellthrough a set of bleachers at a hockey game inHutchinson and died in January 1999. The boyfell through a 13-inch gap in those bleachers. The requirements are applicable to all new construction and installation as of Jan. 1, 2001. Sen.

HF2846/SF3272*/CH417 Tax cut and rebate plan signed State taxpayers will receive more than $1 bil- lion in tax reductions and rebates, under a newlaw signed May 15 by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Included in the new law is a rate reduction in all three income brackets, a one-time salestax rebate, a cap on automobile license tab fees,and an agricultural rebate totaling$18 million. The new law reduces the income tax rates by 0.15 percent in the upper and lower taxbrackets. The middle bracket rate is reducedby 0.20 percent. Taxpayers will receive abouta $142 million income tax cut for tax year2000. The state will collect around $317 mil-lion less over the next biennium. The new law also caps license registrationtab fees. The fee is now set at $189 in the sec- ond year of a car 's life and $99 in the third through 10th years. The fee in the first yearremains unchanged, as does the minimum $35tax that applies to all cars older than 10 years. Lower income families benefit from an in- crease in the percentage of earnings used incalculating the state 's working family credit. The credit is similar to the federal earned in-come credit that provides a wage supplementequal to a percentage of the earnings of low-income individuals. The new law increases the percentage of earnings used in calculating the working fam-ily credit so that for all claimants, the creditequals at least 25 percent of the federal earnedincome tax credit. A one-time $635 million sales tax rebate based on 1998 receipts is provided for in thelaw. Rebates for married couples and heads of households will be at least $168 and as highas $2,400. For other filers, the minimum willbe $95 with the maximum set at $1,200. Taxpayers can expect a check of about 40 percent to 45 percent of what they receivedlast year and the rebate checks will be mailedin August. People eligible for the automatic rebate are those who had income tax liability in 1998,those who filed a claim for the 1998 propertytax rebate, and those who had social securityincome in 1998. Social Security recipients who were Minne- sota residents in 1998 but did not claim a 1998property tax rebate or have 1998 income taxliability will receive a rebate of $95. And unlike last year 's rebate, dependents will be eligible for a rebate equal to 35 percentof the amount a nondependent would receive. The law also provides agricultural assistance for farms located in 31 counties that were de-clared disaster counties in 1999 by PresidentClinton or were contiguous to a disastercounty. Farmers in those counties will receivea payment equal to $4 for each acre coveredunder crop insurance in 2000. Farmers also will benefit from an $11.5 mil- lion increase in the education agriculturalcredit. The rate of the credit is increased from54 percent to 70 percent for agriculture home-stead land and buildings up to $600,000 inmarket value. The rate for nonhomestead ag-riculture property is increased from 50 per-cent to 63 percent.

HF3303/SF3566*/CH366 Wadena County exemption A new law will provide a one-time exemp- tion to Wadena County from a truth-in-taxation publishing requirement. Due to an oversight, the required public notice of the public hearing was not published,House sponsor Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee) said during a February hearing on thebill. She said the county 's auditor was new to the position. At the same time as preparing for thetruth-in-taxation process, the auditor was alsoinvolved in administering a special election. The county did meet its requirement of mailing notices to all taxpayers. The state Department of Revenue ruled that the county did not substantially comply withstate truth-in-taxation laws because of the fail-ure to advertise the public hearing. The rul-ing would have required the county to use itsprevious year 's levy. Under the law, the county will be able to use its payable 2000 levy that was adopted atthe public hearing. During a House Taxes Committee hearing of the bill, department officials expressed con-cern about setting precedence by exempting the county from meeting its requirements. Assistant Commissioner Jenny Engh said that the department supplies a checklist thatclearly lays out each requirement of the truth-in-taxation process. Daggett said that the mistake was not de- liberate, and since the county had met its othernotification requirements, the county 's tax- payers were sufficiently made aware of thepublic hearing. Sen.

The law preserves light-rail funding and appropriates cash for nearly all transportationitems. Ventura line-item vetoed a $750,000 appro- priation to the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development, but left the rest of thelaw intact. However, the governor said in a letter that accompanied the bill that he is not happy withthe bill and he feels legislators have squan-dered permanent funding in favor of the one-time appropriations. \"At best, this will accelerate a few already-planned highway projects, and it largely ig- nores needed new investment in transit, \" V entura wrote. V entura also objected to a measure in the law that moves nonhighway spending from thetrunk highway fund to the general fund. Thestate attorney general and Department of Fi-nance will examine the constitutionality ofusing trunk highway fund money fornonhighway projects. \"It is difficult to understand how appropria- tions made by the Legislature for manybiennia could now be considered unconstitu-tional, \" Ventura wrote. Money used for Office of T ourism kiosks and tort claims has been improperly spentfrom the trunk highway fund, when it shouldhave come from the general fund, legislatorssaid. V entura also said in his letter that legisla- tors did not look at the long-term impact ofshifting these funds to the general fund. Hesaid the Department of Finance 's numbers will reflect those costs. The law features $405 million in cash spend- ing for road improvements. House leadershave said it 's important to take advantage of the $1.8 billion projected surplus for the bi-ennium and fund areas that have beenunderfunded in recent history. The Department of Transportation will spend $177 million for eliminating bottle-necks on Twin Cities highways and another$177 million on rural interregional corridors,which are major roadways that connect urbanand rural areas. Another $100 million for transportationSession Weekly 27will come from trunk highway bonds. In addition, the final agreement leaves about $92 million in previously allocated bonds forlight-rail transit intact. While the law does not strip funding for light rail, one provision will not allow theDepartment of Transportation to seek federalfunds for the Hiawatha line unless the moneyis available to the state only because of lightrail. In other words, if the money could be usedfor roads or bridges in Minnesota, the depart-ment could not seek the money for light rail.That section is effective May 16, 2000. The law also will allow the Metropolitan Council to sell or lease naming rights to the14 transit stations that are planned along the11-mile Hiawatha line. The Transportation Department cannot spend state funds on commuter rail projectsunless the money has been specifically appro-priated for that purpose, under the law. Thisprovision is effective May 16, 2000. The law will also call for $39 million in cash for bridge improvements or replacements. Four of the state 's large highway department facilities will be upgraded or replaced at a costof $25.7 million. Renovations at the Transpor-tation Department headquarters in St. Cloudwill run $10.3 million and upgrades to theDetroit Lakes headquarters will cost $8.7 mil-lion. Like the bridge funding, the buildings willbe funded through cash rather than withbonds. The law also will spend money for a new Regional Transportation Management Centerin Roseville.

The law will establish the state is not liable when accidents or injuries occur involvingsnowmobiles or other off-road recreationalvehicles. \"There has to be a level of responsibility in the hands of recreational vehicle users, \" said Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), whosponsored the measure in the House. \"Some- one who uses a recreational vehicle in a pru-dent and responsible manner will be fine. \" Recreational vehicles are supposed to drive only on the outside, or \"backslope \" of the ditch, not at the bottom or the side closest tothe highway. The law will not affect wheremotor vehicles can be driven. Statute already gives the state limited liabil- ity for accidents that occur on ice-coveredroads or in state parks. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the Senate measure. HF3613/SF3307*/CH373 One plate for collector cars Cars manufactured prior to 1972 and clas- sic or model cars will only be required to haveone license plate, under a law. Effective Aug. 1, 2000, the measure will al- low cars with a pioneer, classic car, collector,or street rod license to only display one plate. If the car owner chooses to display just one plate, that plate must be located on the rear ofthe car, the law states. Previously, the law allowed only certain cars manufactured prior to 1968 to display just oneplate. \"This covers muscle cars made in 1971 or 1972, \" said Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said, who sponsored the measure in the House. The reason for the change came from con- stituents who believed that two plates on theirstreet rods were not necessary, Haas said. The new law also states that only one plate is needed for cars built prior to 1972 that areused for general transportation purposes. \"Some people do use them for driving around, \" Haas said. \"Y ou don 't see many of these cars in the winter. \" Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the Senate bill. HF2824*/SF2578/CH28028 May 19, 2000#VETERANSExceptions to weight restrictions Some heavier vehicles such as public utility or recycling trucks are exempt from spring-time road weight restrictions, under a law ef-fective April 25, 2000. The law allows a few specified vehicles to travel on roads that usually have weight re-strictions for eight weeks in the spring. \"No one is for wrecking roads. I 'm certainly not, \" said Rep. T om Workman (R- Chanhassen), House sponsor of the measure. Public utility vehicles need to be able to travel on side roads when emergencies occur,Workman said. \"For them to come onto your street and re- store your power, they are technically break-ing the law, \" Workman said during a House Transportation Policy Committee meeting inFebruary. \"That 's ridiculous. \" Exempted vehicles under the new law must not exceed 20,000 pounds per axle. The law will be repealed in three years, so legislators will have to take further action tocontinue the law if it works well, Workmansaid. The eight-week weight restrictions are en- forced when the ice thaws and roads becomeparticularly soft. Road restrictions are gener-ally placed on state and county highways orcity streets. By starting the weight restrictionson time, the department estimates it saves$10 million annually in road replacementcosts. Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon- sored the Senate measure. HF3274/SF2785*/CH433 C. Elmer Anderson highway A Minnesota road will be named in honor of a former governor, under a new law. The portion of Highway 371 from Baxter to Barrows in Crow Wing County, which isknown as the Brainerd bypass, will be namedthe C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway. Anderson, who died in January 1998, served as Minnesota governor from 1951 to 1955. Healso served as lieutenant governor for 11 non-consecutive years. When he was first electedlieutenant governor in 1938, Anderson wasonly 26 years old. Anderson, a Republican and a native of Brainerd, became governor in 1951 when Gov.Luther Y oungdahl resigned to accept an ap-pointment to the federal bench. Andersondefeated Orville Freeman in 1952 but lost tothe same man in 1954. (Governors served onlytwo-year terms at the time.) After leaving the statehouse, Anderson re- turned to Brainerd, where he was a business-man and, for 10 years, served as the town 's mayor. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) wasquoted at Anderson 's funeral as saying he was always proud of Brainerd and stayed active inthe issues important to the area. Signs designating the road must be funded from nonpublic money, according to the law,which is effective Aug. 1, 2000. Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) spon-sored the measure. HF2502*/SF3207/CH279 Red Bull highway A portion of Interstate 35 will be renamed to honor a military unit, under a law effectiveAug. 1, 2000. The stretch of freeway will be renamed the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division Highway.Private money must be used to purchase andplace signs. The designation will extend fromthe Iowa border to the Twin Cities. The Red Bull Division, comprised of Na- tional Guard members from Minnesota, Iowa,and South Dakota, was the first division de-ployed overseas during World War II, accord-ing to the Minnesota National Guard. Thedivision was stationed in North Africa andItaly during the war. Rep. T om Workman (R-Chanhassen) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon-sored the measure. HF3156*/SF2709/CH281 Highway named after contractor A southern Minnesota highway will be named after a noted contractor and transpor-tation advocate, under a new law effectiveAug.1, 2000. The stretch of Highway 4 from Sleepy Eye to St. James will be named the Richard J.Mathiowetz Memorial Highway. Mathiowetz,a Sleepy Eye native, was dubbed a \"legendary contractor \" in the December issue of Con- struction Bulletin. He died Oct. 31, 1999, atage 64. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) spon- sored the measure the House. Swenson saidthat Mathiowetz regularly traveled to theCapitol seeking funding for roads andhighways. \"He had been an energetic advocate for good roads and highways, \" Swenson said. Mathiowetz began working at his father 's construction company when he turned 18, andhe was involved in contracting throughout hislife. Swenson said Mathiowetz deserves to havea highway named after him due to his long-standing reputation as a contractor in the area. Funds for the purchase and placement of signs marking the highway must comethrough nonpublic sources.Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored the legislation in the Senate.

Cost of care is based on the average costs of operating veterans ' homes. The law relates to any future sales tax re- funds and rebates, and to those paid after June30, 1999.

Betty McCollum has served four terms inthe House and is leaving to pursue a seat inCongress. She won the DFL endorsement forthe seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. BruceVento.Session Weekly 29#BONDING #BUSINESSFour bonding vetoes overridden The House voted to override four line-item vetoes from the $640.3 million bonding law,which will pay for repairs to state facilities andnew construction projects. Four other line-item vetoes were allowed to stand. The Legislature had passed several major bills May 9 and recessed until the vetoes couldbe re-considered May 17. The Senate also voted to override the same provisions, which means they will become law. Gov. Jesse Ventura has had six full or line- item vetoes overridden in his first two yearsas governor. That is more than any other gov-ernor, according to records that date back onlyto 1939. An override requires 90 votes in theHouse and 45 votes in the Senate. One override was a veto of a $3 million ap- propriation from the state 's general fund to be- gin construction on a new Guthrie Theater inMinneapolis. The law will allow that $3 millionto be spent only if an equal amount of non-statemoney is contributed to the project. In his veto message, Gov. Jesse Ventura wrote, \"Projects of this nature should, at mini- mum, be able to demonstrate significant lo-cal and philanthropic financial commitmentsprior to a request for state funding. \" Ventura added that additional policy dis- cussions should take place before the statecommits money for capital requests from artsorganizations. One attempt to override the veto failed on an 84-42 vote. It was later reconsidered andwas passed on a 92-36 vote. A similar line-item veto was overridden that will send $1 million to the city of Lanesborofor a new arts center. Lanesboro is located justnorth of the Iowa border in southeastern Min-nesota. Another veto override was for $135,000 to the Department of Health to fund a vehicle topromote organ donation. \"There are a variety of health-related causes that are worthy of public education but it isnot the state 's role to single out one cause or outreach mechanism, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message. But the House voted 112-16 to override theveto. Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) proposed the override, saying that the$135,000 will be matched with an equalamount of nonstate money, and it will helpaddress a serious health concern. A fourth line-item veto that was overrid- den will spend $1.5 million to pay formulticultural learning centers in St. James andPelican Rapids. The vote was 100-26. Rep. Bob Westfall (R-Rothsay) said the money mainly will pay for English as a sec-ond language classes and other services forrecent immigrants. The center in Pelican Rap-ids originally was designed to provide thosetypes of services for about 1,800 people, butthe immigrant population has grown to morethan 2,600 in that area, he said. Rep. Gregory Gray (DFL-Mpls) added that the centers help build a sense of communityand that the governor was \"dead wrong in ve- toing both of these provisions. \" Line-item vetoes that were not overridden were $500,000 for a Center for AgriculturalInnovation in Olivia, $100,000 for the Hous-ing and Redevelopment Authority in Landfallto repair retaining walls, and $150,000 for theSt. Croix Valley Heritage Center. \"I believe that local or private funding is the most appropriate financing source for each ofthese projects, \" Ventura wrote. Finally, a line-item veto cancelled $2.7 million to build a cold weather testing Veto kills towing bill The governor vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to claim any valuables frominside a car that has been towed and im-pounded. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), who sponsored the bill in the House, was notpleased by the veto. \"The towing truck companies always knew they were stretching the law on keeping per-sonal items, \" Dawkins said. \"I'm surprised they were able to convince the governor their live-lihood depended on their need to keep base-ball mitts and briefcases. \" Gov. Jesse V entura expressed concern that Dawkins ' bill would have hurt the towing center in International Falls, which would have tested products to determine how they re-spond to cold temperatures. That moneywould have required an equal amount ofnonstate matching funds. An attempt to override the veto failed on a 59-68 vote. V entura also wrote that for all the projects that were vetoed, more pressing state needscould have been funded in the bonding bill.

He said impound lots would have been required to absorb the costs of towingand storing abandoned vehicles. \"Owners of the vehicles would bear no re- sponsibility for the towing, storage, or disposalcosts of the vehicle, but would be permittedto obtain their possessions from the vehicle, \" V entura wrote in his veto message. \"Those possessions may be worth more than the ve-hicle itself. \" State law says the impound lot owners have a lien on a car it has in its possession but saysnothing about personal items in the car,Dawkins said. He added that he would like tosee a court rule on that statute, because hebelieves the court would rule against impoundlot owners and towing companies. Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF3566/SF3291*/CH388 #FAMILY Vehicle forfeiture bill Gov. Jesse V entura vetoed a bill that would have given banks more rights to funds gener-ated from forfeited vehicles. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) was the House sponsor of the bill, which would haveallowed banks to acquire forfeited vehicles ifthere is an outstanding loan or lease on thecar. \"Right now, sales are done at impound lots, \" Entenza explained. \"This bill (would have al- lowed) the banks to remove the vehicle fromthe impound lot, clean it up, and sell it at ahigher value. \" Under the bill, banks would have first ap- plied proceeds to the debt they are owed bythe vehicle owner. The bank then would havebeen required to reimburse impound lots forholding the car. Any remaining cash from thesale of forfeited vehicles would have gone intoa special fund for law enforcement. However, V entura rejected the measure, claiming it had fiscal implications he could notaccept. \"This bill does not require a financial insti- tution to reimburse law enforcement agenciesfor their cost when the sale of the forfeitedvehicle does not equal or exceed the loan bal-ance, \" V entura wrote in his veto message. \"Current law provides an incentive for the lien holder to get the maximum value for theforfeited vehicle because they must pay thecosts incurred by law enforcement before sat-isfying their lien. This bill eliminates the in-centive and would result in increased costs tothe taxpayers. \" Entenza said he was surprised by the veto.\"It was a disappointment that the Depart-ment of Public Safety, which watched this bill for two years, waited until after it passed toregister their objections, \" Entenza said. Under state law, drivers are required to for- feit their vehicle only after a third drunkendriving conviction. Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) spon- sored the Senate version. HF262/SF76*/CH383 No marriage license discount Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that would have reduced the marriage license fees forcouples who received at least 12 hours of pre-marital education. And a failed attempt to override the veto kept the bill from becoming law. The Senatevoted May 17 to override the veto, but the at-tempt failed to get a two-thirds majority inthe House. The bill would have raised the cost of a regu- lar marriage license from $70 to $75. But forthose couples who received premarital edu-cation, the marriage license fee would havebeen only $25. The bill specified that the education topics would include teaching about the seriousnessof marriage, conflict management skills, andthe desirability of obtaining counseling if themarriage falls into difficulty later on. Couples would have had to obtain educa- tion from a clergy member, a person autho-rized by law to perform marriages, or amarriage and family therapist. Ventura said he doesn 't believe the govern- ment should have a role in marriagecounseling. \"This bill is overly intrusive and increases costs for those who choose not to receive pre-marital counseling, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message. \"I understand the authors ' intent and share their concerns about our high divorcerate, however, I do not believe that govern-ment should intervene in a couple 's marital decisions. \" Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) and Sen. Steve Dille (R-Dassel) sponsored thelegislation. HF2229/SF884*/CH397 #GOVERNMENT No time limit on confirmation The first bill Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed dur- ing the 2000 Legislative Session would havelimited the term of an acting or temporarycommissioner of a state department. Under state law, commissioners areappointed by the governor, subject to the Senate 's confirmation of the appointment. The bill would have limited the term of anacting or temporary commissioner to 18months. In his veto message, Ventura said the bill would have punished a commissioner for theSenate 's failure to \"fulfill its obligation to act \" within the time limit. \"The confirmation of commissioners is an important role for the Senate, \" the governor wrote. \"It is imperative to maintain a certain level of accountability and a clear expectationfor all parties involved. \" V entura, who watched the Senate reject one of his appointees this year, acknowledged thatthere is a need for change. \"I look forward to working with the Legis- lature to create a comprehensive piece of leg-islation that addresses the concerns of boththe legislative and executive branches of gov-ernment on this matter, \" he wrote. Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton) and Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora) sponsored the bill. HF118*/SF160/CH277 Regional jails, drug dogs cut Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed $1.78 million from the omnibus state governmentappropriations bill, which includes $185 mil-lion in total spending. V entura singled out two provisions \u2014 $1.75 million for construction grants at adult re-gional jail facilities and $30,000 for purchas-ing drug detection dogs. In his veto message, Ventura said both items should come from local funds, not statemoney. The Department of Corrections would have been responsible for distributing the grants tocounties for regional jails. The money wouldhave comprised up to 30 percent of overallconstruction costs. The money for dog purchases would have been distributed through the Department ofPublic Safety. Agencies would have been al-lowed to seek funding for only one drug-sniff-ing dog. The remainder of the funding bill was left intact. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) sponsoredthe omnibus legislation. HF2699*/SF3798/CH488Session Weekly 31Waiting period plan scuttled Wanting to avoid what he called \"govern- ment intrusion \" into an individual 's private life, Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed the contentious\"right-to-know \" abortion bill. The bill would have required a woman con- sidering an abortion to wait at least 24 hoursbefore undergoing the procedure. It also wouldhave required that the woman be given infor-mation about risks and alternatives at least 24hours before the procedure is scheduled. \"I have decided that it is wrong for govern- ment to assume a role in something that I al-ways believed was between a woman, her family,her doctor and, if she chooses, her clergy, \" Ventura said when he announced the veto. Ventura said that he thought long and hard about the bill, and talked with family, friends,advisors, and the people of Minnesota beforecoming to his decision. Had the governor signed the bill, a woman would have been required to receive by mail,phone, Internet, or in person information aboutprenatal care, child support, adoption, and othermaterial about pregnancy and community sup-port services prior to having an abortion. The bill would have waived a 24-hour wait- ing period for cases when a woman 's life or health may be put in danger by delaying the procedure. The decision by the governor to veto the measure drew criticism from pro-life organi-zations and House Republican leaders. In a news release issued after the governor announced his veto, House Speaker SteveSviggum called Ventura 's decision \"very upsetting. \" He noted that V entura 's staff had appeared to have worked out a compromise with HouseRepublican leadership over the bill, prior tothe announcement of the veto. \"Ironically, Gov. Ventura talks about not being your typical politician. This action lookstoo much like the worst of a politician: Goback on your campaign promises, don 't honor your word through a negotiated agreement,and bend to powerful special interest grouppressure, \" Sviggum said.

Gov. Jesse V entura vetoed the bill in early April, and the House voted to override the vetothe following day. The Senate override camelater, and now the measure is effectiveAug. 1, 2000. The Ah-Gwah-Ching center serves residents whose aggressive or difficult to manage behav-ioral needs cannot be met in their home com-munity. In his veto message, V entura said that the bill was \"unnecessary \" because law currently exists prohibiting the commissioner of theDepartment of Human Services to close thefacility without the Legislature 's approval. In addition to language in the measure call- ing for the center to remain open, the law willclarify the admissions criteria of the facilityand require that the center promote emer-gency admittance and geriatric rapid assess-ment stabilization programs. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack) and Sen. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) sponsored thelegislation. HF2809*/SF2631/CH310Right lane measure vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that sought to have the state post signs urging drivers onthe freeway to travel in the right lane when-ever possible. But a later agreement with the Department of Transportation satisfied one of the maingoals of the bill 's supporters. The final bill that emerged from conference committee was stripped of language that wouldhave made it a crime not to stay to the right, ashad been discussed. And the final bill would nothave allowed law enforcement to pull over driv-ers for failing to follow the provision. Drivers would have been asked, but not re- quired, to move to the right lane after pass-ing, under the final proposal. And the billwould have required the placement of a signevery 50 miles along freeways reminding driv-ers to move to the right lane after passing. \"I don 't see any reason why he would veto it,\" said Rep. David T omassoni (DFL- Chisholm), who sponsored the bill in theHouse. \"I thought this would be the type of bill he would sign. \" T omassoni said throughout the session that his goal was to obtain signs asking people tomove out of the left lane, and he was not push-ing for language that would have made it apetty misdemeanor to clog the left lane. V entura said he vetoed the bill, in part, be- cause of concerns about Twin Cities freewayswith left exits and similar problems. Later, theadministration agreed to have the Transpor-tation Department post signs asking driversto stay right on portions of interstate outsidethe metro area. Sen. Dick Day (R-Owatonna) sponsored the Senate version of the vetoed bill. HF3091/SF2484*/CH425trict, may not exceed 95 percent of the salary of the governor. The bill would have provided an exemption for public hospital administrators, pharma-cists, and psychologists to exclude them fromhaving to comply with limitations on compen-sation. In his veto message, Gov. Jesse Ventura said the exemption is not necessary because there isalready an existing process for public employersto request exemptions on a case-by-case basis. He continued by saying the Department of Employee Relations and the Legislative Coor-dinating Commission 's Subcommittee on Employee Relations have responded positivelyto exemption requests that demonstrate thatan employer is competing in a national or re-gional market and would have problems at-tracting or retaining employees if forced tofollow statutory salary limits. \"The current exemption process works and should not be circumvented with broad ex-clusions in statute, \" V entura wrote. Rep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake) and Sen. Mark Ourada (R-Buffalo) sponsored the vetoed bill. HF3629/SF2385*/CH448 Tourism centers vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed a $750,000 appropriation for the Departmentof Trade and Economic Development withinthe omnibus transportation finance bill. The money, a grant to the Upper Minnesota Valley Regional Development Commission forthe Minnesota River Tourism Initiative, wouldhave been used to plan and design travel infor-mation centers in west and central Minnesota. \"We do not believe it is cost-effective to place three new travel information centers in suchclose proximity, and feel that any new tourism-related appropriations would be better spentimproving actual tourism destinations like trailsor parks, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message. That was the only item vetoed from the $602 million transportation funding package. HF2891*/SF2678/CH47932 May 19, 2000Reflections The end of a legislative session always gives rise to a wellspring of mixed emotionsfor members and staff alike. The build upto and the final hours before closing are notunlike a high school or college graduation.Long-time compatriots may never be seenagain, even though heartfelt promises aremade to the contrary. When new staff, like pages, arrive at the Capitol, they are nervous, unsuspecting,and don 't know anyone. But the common- ality of their work and long hours bindthem together as good friends and acquain-tances that make for great billiards tourna-ments and Karaoke competitions afterwork. New lawmakers begin their service in a freshman class and develop lasting friend-ships as committee members, by sharingliving quarters, and as House chamberseatmates for many terms. The closenessand camaraderie among them or staffmembers is unparalleled. Near the end, session becomes a state of mind. It 's like being in a hospital waiting room, agonizing and guessing what theoutcome will be for a loved one undergo-ing serious surgery. Legislators may askthemselves, \"Is the governor going to vetomy bill? \" \"Will I have time enough after the last hour of session to get to California formy wedding? \" \"Am I too burned out to face another election campaign? \" For lawmakers and staff alike, session re- minds one of Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture. It begins very slowly and quietly. In themiddle, things build up to a loud crescendo.And at the end, carillon bells ring and can-nons roar every few seconds to close outthe impressive piece. What may start out slow and calm, ends with intense 16- to 24-hour workdays forrevisors, researchers, or legislative referencelibrarians who spend a lot of time probingthe archives for obscure information re-quested by writers and fact finders. As lawmakers make tough decisions, staff members support them with a wide rangeof tasks. Many duties include financial re-visions by fiscal analysts, fielding phonecalls from constituents, printing thousandsof documents, and minute-to-minutestrategizing by caucus staff. All of it isintense \u2014 down to the last minute before adjournment. This 81st Legislative Session adjournedunlike any other. Even though opposing party leaders in the House and Senate ex-pressed strong emotions early in the cham-bers, they came to a unique decision ofsensitivity, while still holding those strongfeelings. Their ultimate goal was to get somecrucial laws passed for the well-being of thestate. The lawmakers set a plan to move billsacross the governor 's desk without veto. Just in case, they also saved themselves three days in the 120-day legislative periodto try and override any vetoes. After the handshakes, hugs, and the \"so long for now \" and \"goodbyes \" are said, those who remain may still experience emo-tional feelings. For some, they can be as simple as lov- ing the quiet hallways and empty elevators.A few miss noisy meetings, while others feelguilty for working only 40 hours in a week.Many long to be as far away from the capi-tal city as possible \u2014 like Abu Dhabi, for example. Such is the emotional roller coaster ride of being involved in a process that \"gets in your blood. \" Somehow, the agony and exhaustion of it all always leads to a pro-found respect for the institution. \u2014 L ECLAIR GRIER LAMBERTBY MIKE DE LARCO Following weeks of talks between House and Senate leadership over what to do aboutthe controversial Profile of Learning, the Leg-islature passed a measure May 17 that wouldallow local officials to ease requirementsunder the show-what-you-know initiative. The House passed the bill on an 82-44 vote. The Senate vote was 46-17. Legislators also discarded a second proposal that would have allowed school boards thechoice between the Profile and a back-to-basics alternative proposed earlier in the ses-sion called the North Star Standard. The move to drop the North Star StandardAn elusive compromise A modest Profile of Learning bill finally won passage as the2000 session came to a close as an option for districts was merely the latesttwist in the Profile saga this spring. Last week,talks about fine-tuning the Profile delayedHouse votes on four important spending billsuntil wee hours of the morning May 10. A year ago, legislators failed to reach an agreement on how to improve the Profile, acompanion to the state 's other graduation requirement \u2014 the basic skills tests. The Profile has been criticized by teachers and school districts for excessive paperworkand problems with implementation. It was created to shift learning away from textbooks and lectures and move it in the di-rection of experiments, teamwork, research,and independent projects. Under the Profile, students are required to perform various tasks in core learning areasthat have practical applications for life beyondthe classroom. The \"fix-it \" bill passed by the House would allow teachers and school boards to vote on asite-by-site basis on the number of Profiletasks required for graduation. If a districtcould not agree on a number, the state 's re- quirement of 24 standards would apply. This year 's ninth- and tenth-graders would be excused from Profile requirements, underthe bill. Educators have said this session theywere worried that some students would bedenied diplomas because implementationproblems put completion of the Profile 's con- tent standards out of reach for some. Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) and Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel) are sponsors of the bill. The Profile bill (HF3618/SF3286*) now heads to the governor 's desk. LATE ACTION # # #Session Weekly 33BY CHRIS VETTER Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) can 't believe time has gone by so fast. When she enteredpublic life and ran for a Lakeland City Coun-cil seat, her youngest daughter was 2 years old.Now, that daughter, Jenna, is 16. Larsen has decided to not seek re-election to her House seat, which she has held since1994, to spend more time with her family.Prior to winning her legislative seat, she servedeight years on the city council, including fouryears as the city 's first female mayor. \"I really did some soul-searching, \" Larsen said. \"I think it 's time to put some normalcy in my life. \" When Larsen announced her decision to leave May 17,many legislators were sur-prised, even though Larsen hasbeen contemplating the movefor more than a year. Larsennoted that her district en-dorsed her last month. Larsen and her husband, Thomas, have four children, be-tween the ages of 16 and 23. Twohave left home; Larsen hopes tospend more time with the twostill living at home. \"Fourteen years \u2014 in my mind, that 's my own term limit, \" she said. But it will not be easy to leave, she said. \"I have loved doing this, \" Larsen said. \"I told my family I would stay as long as this is what Idid, and did not become who I am. \" Larsen said she never expected to become in- volved in state politics. Then, in 1994 legislatorsfrom her district approached her about runningagainst incumbent DFLer Rep. Pamela Neary. \"I didn 't know how anyone knew I was a Republican, \" Larsen said, noting that her city council is nonpartisan. After two months of discussing the idea of running, Larsen decided to give it a shot. \"Win or lose, I decided it would be a posi- tive experience, \" she said.The end of the road Local government issues and family call Rep. Peg Larsen back home after three terms in the House Among Larsen 's top priorities was to scale back the powers of the Metropolitan Council.She sponsored several bills to abolish orrearrange the organization, which she con-tends has too much power for a nonelectedbody. While her bills failed, Larsen argues that she won her case. \"The bill was to point out the Met Council is not accountable, \" she said. \"I worked to make that well-known. \" Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Cottage Grove), who represents a nearby district, co-sponsoredlegislation to abolish the Met Council. Markoagrees that the goal of curbing its powers has been successful. \"They should be partners, not facilitators, \" Marko said. When Republicans won control of the House in theNovember 1998 election,Larsen was named the chairof the House Local Govern-ment and Metropolitan Af-fairs Committee, which shesaid was a big honor. Legislators point to Larsen 's efforts for bipartisan support asone of her key attributes. \"She worked very hard to develop friendships on bothsides of the aisle, \" Marko said. \"She's a true lady with a heart of gold and she 's a hard worker. \" Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) worked with Larsen on the Local Government and Met-ropolitan Affairs Committee. \"She doesn 't look at party labels, \" Jennings said. \"She's the kind of legislator you don 't want to see go. It 's difficult to replace some- one of that caliber. \" Rep. James Clark (R-Springfield) said Larsen was an outstanding committee chair. \"Her door is always open. She goes out of her way to address the concerns of membersof the committee, \" Clark said. A significant measure Larsen sponsored wasa ban on amortization passed in 1999. The law prohibits cities and counties from setting adeadline for property owners to cease opera-tions that do not conform to zoning ordi-nances. The measure included an exceptionfor when municipalities try to close strip clubsor other \"adult \" businesses. Larsen and other critics said some local gov- ernments were exploiting the amortizationprocess to force out businesses without hav-ing to pay fair market value for their land. Ifthe local government set a deadline for a busi-ness owner to conform to a new zoning ordi-nance or move, potential buyers would haveno incentive to purchase a property until af-ter the deadline had passed, when the sellerwould have no negotiating power and theproperty value would plummet. Larsen said one of the most exciting mo- ments in her tenure was the first time one ofher bills became law. \"When I found out, and I got the letter from the governor, that was exciting, \" Larsen said. While Larsen is unsure what her future holds, it likely will involve managing urban growth. Shehelped found the Middle St. Croix Valley Plan-ning Advisory Board, which discusses the im-pact growth in one area has on other areas. Larsen, who earned a sociology degree from the University of Slippery Rock in Pennsylva-nia, has also worked as a special needs educa-tional assistant. She said she is happy with her accomplish- ments as she leaves the Legislature. \"I feel like I want to do something new and exciting, \" Larsen said. \"At this time, I 'm not sure what that will be. \" STEPPING DOWN Rep. Peg Larsen RepublicanDistrict 56B - LakelandTerms: 3Career notes: After getting her start on the Lakeland City Council, Larsenworked heavily on local and regionalissues at the Capitol. For the past twoyears, she has served as chair of theHouse Local Government andMetropolitan Affairs Committee. PEOPLE # # #34 May 19, 2000BY CHRIS VETTER Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Little Canada) did not plan to get involved with politics, but a hor-rible accident drew her interest to local issues. Broecker had witnessed a severe car acci- dent near her former home in VadnaisHeights, where one car broadsided the vehiclein front of her own. Broecker helped removechildren from the wrecked car. That prompted her to think the intersec- tion needed a stoplight. \"I knew I had to be proactive, \" she said. She ran for the Vadnais Heights City Coun- cil. She won and served eight years beginningin 1986. Signals were soonadded at the intersection. Her work on the council led to a fight for a legislative seat.Broecker ran for the Legisla-ture in 1994, defeating incum-bent DFLer Rep. Marc Asch ina close and nasty fight. Legalbattles came after the election. Now, after six years in the Legislature, Broecker, a sup-porter of term limits who oncepromised to stay no more thansix years in the House, has de-cided to step aside. \"It's been a huge honor to serve in the House, \" she said. \"I've learned a lot. For my family and I, it 's been a long 14 years (includ- ing service on the city council) of late-nightmeetings and rescheduled family events. \" Broecker has enjoyed working at the Legis- lature, but she misses the hands-on experienceof city council work. \"Down here, you lose a little bit of that close- connectiveness, \" she said. \"It's a little more broad, and you are dealing with the whole state. \" When other legislators talk about Broecker, they mention her friendship and her humor.Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound) said Broeckerknows how to break up a tense moment witha good joke.Self-imposed term limits A leader on crime and public safety, Rep. Sherry Broecker isleaving the House after three terms to return to her interestin local issues STEPPING DOWN Rep. Sherry BroeckerRepublicanDistrict 53B - Little CanadaTerms: 3Career notes: Currently the chair of the House Judiciary Finance Committee,Broecker was the sponsor of \"Katie's Law,\"a 2000 measure crafted in the wake of theabduction of Katie Poirier from a MooseLake convenience store. The law pre-scribes a variety of changes to protect thepublic from sex offenders.\"Always at the right moment, she knows how to make you laugh, \" Smith said. \"I like her. I consider her a friend. She 's an excellent chairwoman and a hard worker. \" Broecker doesn 't mind being thought of as a prankster. She laughs about the practical jokesshe and other members have pulled on legisla-tors. She mentioned a time when she purchaseda frozen turkey and placed it on a legislator 's desk during floor discussion on turkey stamps. \"If you can 't have a little fun, there 's no sense of being here, \" Broecker said. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) also has served alongside Broecker on judiciary and crime-related committees. \"She is a very good person to be around, \" Skoglund said. \"She was always inclusive in her decisions. \" Early on, Broecker was as- signed to the Judiciary FinanceCommittee \u2014 an area that she admits she knew relatively littleabout in the beginning. Shewanted to broaden her areas offocus, and that new focus be-came crime issues. When the Republicans won control of the House in the1998 election, Broecker wasawarded the chair of that com-mittee. She said she has tried to include all members of her committee in the de-cision-making process. \"You can sell what you are doing better when you have people with you that can helpsell the idea, \" she said. And she doesn 't hesitate when she says her favorite legislation is \"Katie 's Law, \" which passed earlier this year. The law toughens pen-alties for repeat sex offenders and begins fund-ing for a law enforcement information system. \"It was almost like it was back at the local level, \" Broecker said. \"It was a sincere, heart- felt law. \"Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), chair of the House Crime Prevention Committee, saidhe and Broecker have developed a valuedfriendship while working on crime-relatedissues. \"She has been dedicated to serving the criminal justice community and puts her heartinto helping others, \" said Stanek. \"On behalf of police officers, firefighters, crime victims,and public safety advocates, I thank her. \" Broecker sponsored disaster relief for north- ern suburbs hit by a tornado and a domesticabuse reduction project in Ramsey County dur-ing her tenure. She also co-sponsored failed leg-islation in 1997 that would have allowed taxcredits for people who donated to state colleges. She has also supported permanent tax cuts in the past two years. After six years in the Legislature, Broecker looks forward to new opportunities. \"I just felt it was time to prioritize my life, \" she said. \"For me, that 's my family. \" Broecker 's mother died a few months ago. She helped care for her mom during her lastfew years. In addition to her desire to focus on her family, including three sons age 19 to 25,Broecker is a believer in term limits. \"I said six years ago in my campaign bro- chures that I would only serve three terms, andI stand by that, \" she said. Broecker is not sure what will come next. She said a lobbying position is not high onher list. She looks forward to building a newhome on Forest Lake with her husband, Jerry. \"I don 't know what 's in store, \" she said. \"I'll put it in the good Lord 's hands and whatever will be, will be. \" PEOPLE # # #Session Weekly 35CHAPTERS 251 - 500 Exactly 3,256 bills were introduced dur- ing the 2000 Legislative Session \u2014 1,706 by the House and 1,550 by the Senate. Of those, 250 bills (and one resolution) were passedby both bodies during the session and sent to the governor. So what happened to the other 3,006 bills? Some were duplicates, some were folded into other bills, but most are dead, gone from the legislative process unlessthey are reintroduced next year. The bien- nium has ended, and bills do not carry over from one biennium to the next. And what happened to the 250 bills that have been sent to the governor? Most were signed into law, some are awaiting thegovernor 's action, and some were vetoed. Here 's a quick review of the governor 's veto authority during the second year ofthe biennium. Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it 's ready to be sent to the governor for consider-ation. The governor has several options when considering a bill. The governor can:FEBRUARY 1 - M AY 17 , 2000GOVERNOR'S DESK # # # Tracking new laws, vetoes sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which at the end of the bien- nium, results in a pocket veto. The timing of these actions is as impor- tant as the actions themselves. If a bill was passed by the Legislature and presented to the governor before the finalthree days of the session, the bill will be- come law unless the governor vetoes it by returning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the bills and files them with the secretary of state, but his signature is not required. If a bill is passed during the last three days of the session, the governor has a longer time to act on it. He or she mustsign and deposit it with the secretary ofstate within 14 days of adjournment or the bill will not become law. Inaction by the governor results in a \"pocket veto, \" and the governor is not required to provide a rea- son for the veto.Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto author- ity. This option allows the governor to eliminate the spending items to which heor she objects. As with all vetoes, the gov- ernor must include a statement listing the reasons for the veto with the returned bill.Here, too, the timetable is either 14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, or withinthree days after the governor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But because only the governor can call a spe- cial session of the Legislature, anythingvetoed after the Legislature adjourns is his- tory \u2014 unless it is re-introduced next year. After each session, a comprehensive sum- mary of all bills that were signed into law orvetoed is published. Y ou can obtain a copy of New Laws 2000 by calling or writing the House Public Information Office, 175 StateOffice Building, St. Paul, MN 55155-1298; (651) 296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550.

THE STATES50 Gov. Jesse Ventura recently vetoed a measure that promised couples a discount on their marriage license for obtaining pre-marital counseling, and abill creating covenant marriages has stalled in committee. In general, it's not been easy going for bills that aim to reduce divorces and shore up the institution of marriage. But our neighbors to the east in Wisconsin now have a state marriage counselor with funds allocated in 1999. One paragraph in the 750-page budget bill passed by the Wisconsin Legisla- ture authorizes one full-time position as part of the \"Community Marriage PolicyProject.\" The state marriage counselor will coordinate and assist communities in developing standards for marriages solemnized in Wisconsin by members of theclergy. The state official will team with local clergy members to develop thosestandards. The state also appropriated $105,000 for the project through 2001, and $60,000 per year afterward. It is set to be repealed in October 2003. The measure, which received the support of a national group called Marriage Savers, was sponsored by Rep. Scott Jensen, speaker of the Wisconsin StateAssembly. Marriage Savers advocates that couples receive a certain amount of pre- marital counseling and suggests that couples wait at least four to six monthsafter engagement before being married. The group also suggests that a mentorrelationship be established between couples married for many years and thosejust starting out. Overall, the group claims that divorce rates continue to climb at alarming rates and says communities need to take an active role in preventing divorcebecause of the societal and economical costs associated with it. (Divorce rates in Wisconsin have, in fact, dropped over the past 10 years, according to that state's Department of Health. The divorce rate in 1998 was 3.3per 1,000 people, compared to 3.5 nationally. It peaked at 3.7 in 1992, the sameyear the U.S. divorce rate was 4.8.) Critics of the program say it comes too close to the line separating church and state. The Marriage Savers Web site says that 119 cities in 37 states and Canada have adopted community marriage policies as of January 2000. (M.K IBIGER )State marriage counselor Wisconsin takes unusual approach to reducing divorce rate42 May 19, 2000 RESOURCES # # # Authors Each bill must have a legisla- tor to sponsor and introduce it in the Legislature. That legislator is the chief author whose name appears on the bill along with the bill's file number to identify it as it moves through the legislative process.There may be up to 34 co-authors from the House and four from the Senate. Their names also appear onthe bill.How a Bill Becomes Idea A bill is an idea for a newlaw or an idea to change an old law. Anyone can suggest an idea for a bill \u2014 anindividual, consumer group, professional association, govern- ment agency, or the governor.Most often, however, ideas come from legislators, the only ones who can begin to move an ideathrough the process. There are 134 House members and 67 senators.Legal form The Office of the Revisor of Statutes and staff fromother legislative offices work with legislators in putting the idea for a new law into proper legal form. The revisor's office is responsible for assuring that the proposal's formcomplies with the rules of both bodies before the bill can be introduced into the MinnesotaHouse of Representatives and the Minnesota Senate. General Register In the House, the General Register serves as a parking lot where bills await action by the full body. Bills chosen to appear on the Calendar for the Day or the Fiscal Calendar are drawn from the General Register. In the Senate, a different proce- dure is used. Bills are listed on the General Orders agenda. Senate members, acting as the \"commit-tee of the whole,\" have a chance to debate the issue and offer amendments on the bill. After-wards, they vote to recommend: passage of the bill, progress (delay action), or further commit-tee action. And sometimes they recommend that a bill not pass. From here, the bill is placed onthe Calendar.Calendar for the Day2 1 3 7In the Senate, bills approved by the \"committee of the whole\" are placed on the Calendar. At thispoint, the bill has its third reading , after which time the bill cannot be amended unless the entire bodyagrees to it. Toward the end of the session, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administrationdesignates bills from the General Orders calendar to receive priority consideration. These SpecialOrders bills are debated, amended, and passed in one day. A bill needs 68 votes to pass the House and 34 votes to pass the Senate. If the House and Senateeach pass the same version of the bill, it goes to the governor for a signature.In the House, the Calendar for the Day is a list of bills the House Rules and Legis- lative Administration Committee has designated for the full House to vote on. Members can vote to amend the bill, and after amendments aredispensed with, the bill is given its third reading before the vote of the full body is taken. The Housealso has a Fiscal Calendar, on which the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee orHouse Taxes Committee can call up for consideration any tax or finance bill that has had a secondreading. The bills are debated, amended, and passed in one day.8Session Weekly 43 Introduction The chief House author of the bill introduces it in the House; the chief Senate author introduces it in the Senate. Identical bills introduced in each body are called companion bills. The bill introduction is called the first reading . The presiding officer of the House then refers it to anappropriate House committee for discussion; the same thing hap- pens in the Senate.Committee The bill is discussed in one or more committees de- pending upon the subject matter. After discussion, committee members recom- mend action \u2014 approval or disapproval \u2014 to the full Houseand full Senate. The House committee then sends a report to the House about its action on thebill; the Senate committee does likewise in the Senate. Conference If the House and Senate versions of the bill aredifferent, they go to a conference committee. In the House, the speaker appoints three or five representa- tives, and in the Senate, the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration selects the samenumber of senators to form the committee. The committee meets to work out differences in the twobills and to reach a compromise.Governor Once the governor hasthe bill, he or she may:sign it, and the bill becomes law; veto it within three days; or allow it to become law by not signing it. During session, the House and Senate can override a governor's veto. This requires a two-thirds vote in the House(90 votes) and Senate (45 votes). The governor also may \"line-item veto\" parts of a money bill, or\"pocket veto \" a bill passed during the last three days of the session by not signing it within 14days after final adjournment.Floor The conference commit-tee's compromise billthen goes back to the House and the Senate for another vote. If both bodies pass the bill in this form, it is sent to the governor for his or her approval or disapproval. (If one or both bodies reject the report, it goes back to the confer-ence committee for further consideration.)4 5 9 11 10Floor After the full House or Senate accepts the committee report, the bill has its second reading and is placed on the House agenda called the General Register or the Senate agenda called General Orders. (A committee can recommendthat non-controversial bills bypass the General Register or General Orders and go onto the ConsentCalendar, where bills usually pass without debate.) After this point, House and Senate proceduresdiffer slightly.6a Law in MinnesotaMINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.
