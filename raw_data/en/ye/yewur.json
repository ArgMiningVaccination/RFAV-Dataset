Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic condition that results when the heart muscle is unable to pump blood as efficiently as is needed. [ High blood pressure ](/medical-topics/id/hn-1033009#hn-1033009-need-to-know) can cause congestive heart failure. Failure of the heart pump can also result from many other causes, such as severe [anemia](/medical-topics/id/hn-3562008#hn-3562008-need-to-know), hyperthyroidism, [heart attacks](/medical-topics/id/hn-1025008#hn-1025008-need-to-know), and [arrhythmias](/medical-topics/id/hn-1182007#hn-1182007-need-to-know) of the heart. Symptoms CHF leads to breathlessness, fatigue, and accumulation of fluid in the lungs or the veins (primarily in the legs) or both. Healthy Lifestyle Tips Even with severe disease, appropriate exercise can benefit those with CHF.1, 2 In a controlled trial, long-term (one year) exercise training led to improvements in quality of life and functional capacity in people with CHF.3 Nonetheless, too much exercise can be life-threatening for those with CHF. How much is \"too much\" varies from person to person; therefore, any exercise program undertaken by someone with CHF requires professional supervision. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to significantly increase the risk of CHF. The use of NSAIDs in one preliminary study was found to double the likelihood of hospital admission with CHF the following week. This likelihood increased by more than 10 times for patients with a history of heart disease.4 This study did not include people taking low-dose [aspirin](/medical-topics/id/hn-1088008#hn-1088008-001). [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. |Supplement||Why| | | 3 Stars Fish Oil 850 to 882 mg per day | | In a double-blind study of people with chronic heart failure, a combination of EPA and DHA for four years resulted in a small but statistically significant protection against death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. In a double-blind study of patients with chronic heart failure, supplementation with the fatty acids present in fish oil for an average of four years resulted in a small but statistically significant decrease in the number of patients who died or were hospitalized for cardiovascular reasons. The treatment consisted of 850 to 882 mg per day of a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (as their ethyl esters). In another double-blind trial, supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid improved heart function and decreased the number of hospitalizations in patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. | | 3 Stars Hawthorn 80 to 300 mg of standardized herbal extract two to three times per day with a doctor's supervision | | Antioxidant hawthorn appears to reduce symptoms and improve exercise capacity by increasing blood flow to the heart and the strength of heart contractions, and reducing resistance to blood flow in the extremities. Clinical trials have shown that standardized extracts made from the leaves and flowers of Hawthorn extracts are available in capsules or tablets standardized to either total | | 3 Stars L-Carnitine 500 mg two to three times per day with a doctor's supervision | | Supplementing with L-carnitine can improve heart function and exercise capacity and reduce heart muscle damage due to insufficient oxygen. People with CHF have insufficient oxygenation of the heart, which can damage the heart muscle. Such damage may be reduced by taking Most L-carnitine/CHF research has used a modified form of the supplement called | | 3 Stars Magnesium 300 mg daily with a doctor's supervision | | Supplementing with this essential mineral can prevent a deficiency that can lead to heart arrhythmias. | | 3 Stars Taurine 2 grams three times per day with a doctor's supervision | | Taurine, an amino acid, helps increase the force and effectiveness of heart muscle contractions. | | 2 Stars Arginine 5.6 to 15 grams per day with a doctor's supervision | | The body needs arginine to make nitric oxide, which increases blood flow. This process is impaired in people with CHF. It also has been shown to improve kidney function in people with CHF. The body needs | | 2 Stars Arjun Bark Extract 500 mg of bark extract three times per day with a doctor's supervision | | A small trial found that supplementing with a bark extract of arjun improved heart function and lung congestion in patients with severe CHF. A small clinical trial found that supplementation with a bark extract of arjun (Terminalia arjuna) improved heart function as well as lung congestion in patients with severe CHF. Patients in the study took 500 mg of arjun extract three times per day and began to exhibit significant improvement in heart function within two weeks; improvement continued over the course of approximately two years. The herb extract used in this study was concentrated but not standardized for any particular constituent. Commercial preparations are sometimes standardized to contain 1% arjunolic acid. Larger clinical trials are needed to confirm the results of this small study. | | 2 Stars Berberine 300 to 500 mg four times per day with a doctor's supervision | | Berberine has been shown to significantly improve heart function and exercise capacity and reduce the frequency of arrhythmias in people with congestive heart failure. Berberine is used in Asia to treat congestive heart failure. In a double-blind trial, supplementation with berberine (300 to 500 mg, four times per day) for eight weeks significantly improved heart function and exercise capacity and reduced the frequency of arrhythmias in people with congestive heart failure. | | 2 Stars Coenzyme Q10 0.9 mg daily per pound of body weight with a doctor's supervision | | CoQ10 enhances the production of energy in the heart muscle and has been reported to help people with CHF, sometimes dramatically. As is true for several other heart conditions, | | 2 Stars Hawthorn (Cardiomyopathy) 160 to 900 mg daily of a standardized herbal extract with a doctor's supervision | | Studies have found hawthorn to be effective for the signs and symptoms of early-stage congestive heart failure, the main complication of cardiomyopathy. Many doctors expert in herbal medicine consider | | 2 Stars Potassium Consult a qualified healthcare practitioner | | Potassium can be beneficial for heart patients, but talk to your doctor first. Several drugs for CHF may cause potassium retention, making extra potassium dangerous. Whole fruit and fruit and vegetable juice, which are high in potassium, are also recommended by some doctors. One study showed that elderly men who consumed food prepared with potassium-enriched salt (containing about half potassium chloride and half sodium chloride) had a 70% reduction in deaths due to heart failure and a significant reduction in medical costs for cardiovascular disease, when compared with men who continued to use regular salt. While increasing potassium intake can be beneficial for heart patients, this dietary change should be discussed with a healthcare provider, because several drugs given to people with CHF may actually cause retention of potassium, making dietary potassium, even from fruit, dangerous. | | 2 Stars Vitamin D Refer to label instructions | | In preliminary research, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in patients with congestive heart failure than in patients without it. In one study, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in patients with CHF than in patients without CHF (28% vs. 22%). In that study, heart failure patients who received vitamin D supplementation (usually 800 to 1,000 IU per day) had a 32% lower death rate, compared with heart failure patients who did not receive vitamin D supplementation. In a double-blind study of elderly people who had suffered a fracture, supplementing with 800 IU per day of vitamin D for 2 to 5 years significantly decreased the incidence of CHF by 25%, compared with a placebo. | | 1 Star Coleus Refer to label instructions | | Coleus contains forskolin, a substance that may help dilate blood vessels and improve the forcefulness with which the heart pumps blood.
