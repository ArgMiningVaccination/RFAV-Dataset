AAfij Abstract The thesis investigates particular micrological strategies o f resistance which have coalesced around the stigma o f the HTV virus in the context o f the AIDS crisis. 'Western' AIDS is a disease that has mainly affected homosexual populations; such micrological strategies have thus been mainly articulated by different factions o f the subculture. Homosexual behaviour has been systematically constrained. Homosexuality has been demonised by Christian discourse, criminalised by civil society, and medicalised by science. The thesis analyses the different systems of oppression that the homosexual body has been subjected to as a framework for the development o f the analysis of current strategies o f resistance to the stigma inherent in homosexual embodiment. The stigma o f deviant sexuality has been magnified by the advent o f the transmission o f a potentially deadly virus through the enactment o f (homo)sexuality. The thesis is both empirical as well as theoretical. Qualitative analysis techniques have been employed in order to investigate how specific micrological strategies o f resistance have colluded and interacted in the construction of individual identities largely forged around HTV. On a subcultural dimension both 'spontaneous' and 'conscious' resistance projects have been analysed not only on a symbolic level, but in relation to their particular role in individual processes o f identity construction. 'Spontaneous' resistance projects represent resistance strategies that emanate from the grassroots of the affected constituency whereas 'conscious' resistance projects constitute culturally or structurally elaborated strategies that have either emerged from or been appropriated by specific factions of gay community Table of Contents Chapter 1 ........................................................................................................................ 12 Positive Homosexualities: The Role o f Resistance in the Construction of Identity 1.1.-The Emergence o f the Medical Model 1.1.1.- The Wane o f the Religious Worldview and the Dawn of Individualism ................................................................................................................. 14 1.1.2.- The Shift in the Political Technology of the Body ................................. 15 1.2.- Appropriating the Meaning o f Homosexual Behaviour 1.2.1.- The Sin Against Nature: canon law and the penitentials ....................... 20 Sciences Strategies Resistance: resisting ............................... 1.4.- Homosexualities: perspective ......................................................................................................................... 29 39 2 42 Methodology of Research 2.1.-Theoretical Considerations ....................................................................................... 42 2.1.1.- Qualitative or Quantitative Research ........................................................ 42 2.1.2.- Basic Research why Grounded Theory?.......................................44 2.2.1.- Size o f Sample ............................................................................ 53 2.2.2.2.- Discovery o f a New Category: changing the Unit of Analysis .................................................................................................................. 53 2.2.2.3.- Biases ........................................................................................... 54 2.2.2.4.-Additional Dissident Interviews Issues ................................................................................ 56 2.2.5.2.- Questionnaires ............................................................................. 57 2.2.3.2.1.- Questionnaire Themes Based on Literature Review ....................................................................................................... 57 2.2.3.2.2.- Constructing Questions According to Standard Questionnaire Design Procedures .................................................. 58 2.2.3.2.3.- Copy o f Questionnaire .................................................. 58 2.2.3.3.- Interviews .............................................................. 58 2.2.3.3.1.- Pilot Interviews ............................................................. 58 2.2.3.3.2.- The Evolution o f the Interview Process: from Structured to Semi-Structured Interviews ....................................................... 59 2.2.3.3.3. - The New Category: how it emerged .......................... 61 2.2.3.3.4. - 'Doing' the Interview ................................................. 62 2.2.3.4.- Method of Transcription .............................................................. 65 2.2.3.4.1.- Issues o f Transcription ................................................. 65 2.2.3.4.2.- Process of Transcription...............................................67 2.2.3.4.3.- Description o f Transcripts ........................................... 68 2.2.3.4.4.- Example o f Transcription ............................................. 70 2.3.- Description o f Sample ............................................................................................... 70 2.3.1.- Recruitment Methods ..................................................................... 70 2.3.1.1.- Recruiting: where and how to get a hold o f the hard-to- reach samples ............................................................................ 70 2.3.2.- General Demographics of Interviews ............................ 73 2.3.2.1.- Demographics o f NUDIST Interviews ....................... 73 2.3.2.2.- The NUDIST Sample and HIV: symptoms, time of diagnosis, and therapeutic strategy ............................................. 75 2.3.2.3.- Demographics of Thematic Analysis Interviews 77 2.4.- Future Research: integrating paradigms ................................................................. 79 Chapter 3........................................................................................................................82 The Homosexual Body through Historv: Representation.

The Cartesian framework results in the assignment of different varnishes to the same phenomenon. As such, human disorders are layered into three dimensions: the physical and biological, or disease; the subjective, or illness; and the social, or sickness (Turner, 1995), However, the relationship between these dimensions is more intricate than might be immediately apparent, and is dependent on social and cultural factors.^ The power o f the biomedical model, the principal western paradigm that deals with malady, is established through medical discourse (Turner, 1995). In order to understand how the dynamics o f such a power relationship has played out in the context of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), we will see how multi-layered processes o f knowledge making have structured the epistemic contexts within which the fields o f knowledge o f the aetiology o f HIV/AIDS, and o f its treatment strategies, have been constituted.^ ^ For example, the acute infectious diseases, which plagued nineteenth century individuals, have been practically eradicated in industrial societies. However, the specific socio-economic characteristics of industrialised society have been responsible for the new 'epidemic' of long-term chronic disorders that now interfere with the optimal functioning of contemporary bodies. Another instance is the cultural trend of challenge to a hitherto indisputable medical authority. This trend can be illustrated by the increasing tendency of so-called dis-eased individuals to refute their categorisation as ill people by declaring to be 'well within themselves'. Despite whatever real physiological abnormalities such individuals might present, their challenge to medical definitions of normality suggest a socially constructed dimension to medical diagnoses (Taylor and Field, 1993). ^ Such processes of knowledge-making involve: the thematic organisation of certain concepts and statements; the legitimisation of some 'truth-claimers' rather than others; the assertion of certain statements as 'serious'; and the critical processes through which so-called 'serious' statements are assessed. As such, discursive formations' shape the possibilities for what can or cannot be conceived. 'Truth-games' are consequently dependent on the socio-historical configurations of a discursive field, which originate out of relations of power and knowledge (Rouse, 1994:93-94), 12 The 'epidemic o f signification' and the multitude o f discursive practices, which inscribe and contest the meaning o f Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and o f the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HTV), frame the experience of the HIV-diagnosed individual's health through a collection o f epistemologies (Treichler, 1988),The most immediate experience o f health, however, stems fi*om the materiality o f the body in its sick or healthy state. However, the deterministic impact o f an HIV diagnosis alters the individual's self-perceptions; parameters of medical technology have thus been established as the main determinants in the subjectivity and self-conceptualisations o f HIV-infected persons. As such, biomedicine specifies the HTV-positive body and alters its subjectivity, which becomes enmeshed with the medical schemata that has developed around the virus (Mechanic, 1974). Medical technology can be understood as an assemblage o f discursive and administrative techniques through which subjects are classified, ordered, and subjected to a complex process o f medical surveillance and management. In this sense HTV pathology, by intensifying the depth o f the medical gaze, has fostered new modes o f control. The 'positive' body represents a 'territorialized' biological entity upon whose surface and interiority these discourses (of knowledge), produced by the disciplines of the modem era, have been inscribed.^ As it is upon and through the territorialized surface o f the body that resistance occurs, new regimes o f power-knowledge, sites o f resistance and types of identity have as such emerged firom the AIDS crisis (Foucault, 1973; 1980). Medicine territorializes the bodies of those who 'are the subjects of care' (Fox, 1990:24). 13 1.1.- The Emergence o f the Medical Model 1.1.1.- The Wane o f the Religious Worldview and the Dawn o f Individualism The origins o f the practices, discourses, and ideologies that have shaped the biomedical model can be traced back to the Enlightenment. Technology and science inspired the 'Age of Reason' where commitment to individualism substituted religious worship, and social progress and scientific method became the new route to salvation. Gradually, the systematic observation and classification of the human body coalesced into a body o f knowledge, which postulated that the restoration o f human health could be achieved through the attainment o f the equilibrium of bodily fluids. However, even as the Enlightenment dawned, many people still resisted medical intervention; sickness was thought to be the will o f God (or o f the witch). If and when medical advice was procured, the treatment recommended resulted from the interpretation o f the patient's multi-layered self-report. Only in the nineteenth century, when medical technology produced the microscope and enabled the medical 'gaze' to penetrate deeper into the body, did the legitimacy o f the profession significantly improve. Surgeons were no longer seen as impure and polluted trades people but as experts whose 'truth-claims', substantiated by laboratories and academic training, were safeguarded by an expanded control of the regulation o f the 'healing' professions (Lupton, 1994).^ As such, medical knowledge came to be perceived as the superior way of objectively apprehending the materiality o f disease. 4 Dissection of bodies and contact with blood had stigmatised pre-Enlightenment surgeons and physicians (Pouchelle, 1990). 14 1.1.2.- The Shift in the Political Technology o f the Body Foucault (1979) analysed the new kinds o f knowledge(s) that modem practices o f power articulation and social control have produced. These modem techniques, which exercise continual and subtle coercion on individual bodies, are fundamentally different from the preceding forms o f power articulation. Ancient power was performed through public executions and military offensives. If spectacular displays o f violence effectively crushed our ancestors, modem articulations o f disciplinary forces subjugate through taming. This shift in the 'political technology' o f the body constituted the essence o f the change in the relationship between power and modem man,^ As such, the regulatory practices of surveillance and o f constraint extended through a range o f social practices: scholastic tests, medical examinations, psychiatric assessments, productivity charts, social surveys are all implemented in order to monitor, elicit, and document human behaviour. Such a plenitude of disciplinary mechanisms has replaced the exercise o f power based on 'relations o f sovereignty' with far-reaching networks that constantly re-enact and reproduce power relations (Rouse, 1994:93-97). ^ The medical gaze, for example, was institutionalised and inscribed in social space with the new forms of hospitals that emerged in France in the eighteenth century. The principle behind the new architecture was that of the problem of the visibility of bodies. In hospitals, for reasons of hygiene and contagion, 'a surveillance which would be both global and individualising while at the same time carefully separating the individual under observation', posed specific difficulties for this system of centralised observation. However, the power of the pervading 'gaze' was epitomised in the process of re-organisation of prisons, which took place in the first half of the nineteenth century. The central figure in this process was Bentham's invention, the 'Panopticon' building. This new form of prison was characterised by a perimeter building in the form of a ring. In the centre of the building there was a tower fi*om which an overseer could observe the movements of the inmates in their cells, which had windows facing the inside as well as the outside of the building. In the 'Panopticon' the principle of the dungeon was reversed as daylight, and the gaze of the observer, was much more apt to regulate and to know the activities of the imnates. Such an optical innovation, based on the principle of visibility, constituted a new technology of power (Foucault, 1980:147). 15 Medicine stands alongside education, the law and penology, psychiatry and social work, as one of the disciplines of the modem era, both a realm of expertise and a way of literally disciplming the bodies of those who are the subjects of those experts (Fox, 1990:24) 'Discursive fields' originate out o f relations of power and knowledge; however the 'power/knowledge nexus' is constrained by language as 'for Foucault we know or see what our language permits, because we can never naively apprehend or know \"reality\" outside o f language' (Turner, 1995:11). Semiotics, the science o f signs first developed by the linguist de Saussure, recognised the multifaceted dimension o f signs and how they may be organised into culturally constructed codes. These culturally mediated codes and systems firame the constitution of identity inasmuch as the establishment o f meaning by language 'is embedded in social and political settings and used for certain purposes.' It is in the relationship between the structuralist notion of semiotics and the poststructuralist concept o f discourse that we can begin to apprehend the role o f language in the constitution o f 'reality'.^ Discourses are intertextual, relying on other texts and related discourses to produce meaning, and contextual, grounded in specific historical, political and cultural configurations (Lupton, 1994:17-18). Discourse produces social practices as representation o f phenomena is intrinsically related to how we act upon them. Each and every 'discursive field' delimits the possibilities of what can or cannot be said by ruling out alternative paradigms o f thought and preserving particular distributions o f power. As such, discourse may have an effect similar to that o f ideology. As Treichler (1988:35) argued when writing about AIDS ^ Discourse is understood as 'a pattern of words, figures of speech, concepts, values and symbols... a coherent way of describing and categorising,..(which) gather(s) around an object, person, social group... providing a means of \"making sense\" of that object, person, and so on' (Lupton, 1994:17-18). 16 Science is not the true material base generating our merely symbolic superstructure. Our social constructions of ATDS (in terms of global devastation, threat to civil rights, emblem of sex and death, the \"gay plague,\" the postmodern condition, whatever) are based not upon objective, scientifically determined \"reality\" but upon what we are told about this reality: that is, iqjon prior social constructions routinely produced within the discourses of biomedical science (Treichler, 1988:35) In the seventeenth century 'oppressive' forms o f power began to be substituted by 'productive' ones (Foucault, 1980a). Power ceased to be a unidirectional force imposed from above and became a net-like organisation sufrusing all systems o f social regulation. As such, power came to engender a multiplicity o f relations other than domination. Enlightenment discourses did condemn the abusive character o f feudal systems o f punishment, but penal reform was really occasioned by an expanding capitalist system whose requirements for punishment demanded a more dependable and efficient regime (McKay, 1994). Hence, the normalisation of health parameters constituted the medical dimension o f the historical process o f rationalisation and standardisation, which promoted the control and surveillance o f our collective and individual materialities. A proscribed normality grounds the discursive field that frames the rationalisation o f society; thus the possibility o f 'innumerable healths of the body' is denied (Nietzsche, 1974, quoted in Turner, 1995:207). It is within such a context that we see the emergence o f a 'bio-pohtics o f populations whereby the state, through its various local and national agencies, constantly intervenes in the production and reproduction o f life itself (Turner, 1995:210). 17 A t the structural level medical power is constituted through ideologies and practices that maintain its plausibility structure. If we adopt a political economy perspective, the hegemony of allopathic medicine can be regarded as the result o f the perceived superior validity o f its 'truth-claims' amidst the power struggle o f the various interest groups in their quest for power and dominance,^ According to this view, the power o f the medical profession is sustained by the state apparatus, which regulates the industry through a system of licensing and legal support. It has been argued that the medical profession, by individualising the root o f illness rather than recognising its political and socio-economic genesis, is an accomplice o f capitalistic ideology (Navarro, 1976; Waitzkin, 1984; Baer at al, 1986), As such, m\u00e9dicalisation depoliticises 'the social structural roots o f personal suffering' by relying on an esoteric body of knowledge, which, by remaining inaccessible to the great majority o f patients, dogmatises the profession, and assures its continued dominance (Waitzkin, 1984:339), However, if we adopt the notion o f 'productive' power the medical encounter does not necessarily constitute a 'subjugating force', but represents 'a strategic relation which is diffuse and invisible' as well as 'vulnerable to resistance'. The relationship enacted in the medical encounter is thus 'closer to the idea o f a form o f social organisation by which social order and conformity are maintained by voluntary means' (Lupton, 1994:111). ^ The three dominant approaches in the sociology of health and illness are functionalism, the political economy perspective, and social constructionism. All schools regard medicine as a tool for the moral control of society, but functionalists regard such control as benevolent whereas the political economy perspective considers it to be malevolent Social constructionists reconceptualise the veiy notion of the power that is being deployed, and emphasise the dualistic nature of tiie relationship between institutions and individuals socialised to accept norms of behaviour and patterns of thought. However, the 'disciplinary 18 Foucault's earlier writings had conceptualised the body as a passive entity utterly inscribed by discourse. However, in his later work Foucault attempted to redress his previous ontological model o f the body, which had rendered it unable to articulate any resistance (Martin, 1988), As such, the passive body o f the Panopticon was replaced by a reflexive self engaged in the construction of a personal ethic: 'a living, speaking, reflexive subjectivity implies the capacity to resist,' This resistance is framed 'upon this notion o f something beyond and irreducible to discourse' as personal identities are not a priori entities but the result o f 'a battlefield, in which difference and opposition are the means by which identity and the boundaries of others become discernible' (Fox, 1990:41- 44). However, discourses on health require a thinking subject who is capable of agency. There is consequently a double movement implicit in this notion: the definable entity 'health' and a subjectivity positioned in relation to it. The person is dissociated from his or her health; as such the individual is able to directly influence its own health. On the other hand, as 'health' is a fundamental component o f the individual, the former can radically influence the latter. This Cartesian conceptualisation o f the body/mind has fi-amed the emergence o f the notion of the guilty victim o f HIV, Although the homosexual, like the drug addict or the whore, is a victim o f AIDS, his/her lifestyle (or his corrupted agency) is responsible for it (Fox, 1990). character' of the sociology of health and illness, which has been constructed as the empowering discipline in opposition to health care as the controlling one, should be acknowledged (Fox, 1993). 19 1.2.- Appropriating the Meaning of Homosexual Behaviour 1,2,1 T h e Sin Against Nature: canon law and the penitentials Canon law, the legal system o f the Christian ehnrch, dates back to the beginning o f the second century C,E, Since then, the Christian church, through its canons and the mechanisms used to enforce them, has played a key role in enunciating and defining the norms o f sexual behaviour within Christian communities, particularly among members o f the Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican branches o f Christianity, From their onset Canonical rules were markedly concerned with the moral and disciplinary problems arising fi-om sexual attractions and desires, Christians, like pagan Romans, were expected to be monogamous; unlike their pagan contemporaries, however, married Christians were also expected to remain sexually faithful to their mates, to refrain firom divorce, and to observe restraint in their sexual behaviour within marriage whilst avoiding entirely any sexual intimacy outside o f it, Christian writers soon began to justify their canonical rules and other teachings about sex by arguing that these rules were grounded either in divine revelation or in human reason, or in nature or natural law, Christian justification o f Canon law was a response to the criticisms put forward not only by pagan and Jewish critics, but also by unorthodox Christian critics whom mainstream Christians denounced as heretics (Payer, 1984; Salisbury, 1991), Despite having existed for almost for ten centuries, canon law only developed into a systematic intellectual discipline during the twelfth century. The appearance o f the Decretum, authored by Gratian in about 1140, equipped canonists with their first analytical textbook, which remained the basis for the teaching o f canon law in the universities and schools throughout the Middle Ages, However, the book's 20 influence on Christian teachings spanned a much longer swath o f time. The DecreUm, where Gratian explained that sexual pleasure was a disturbing influence in human life, a temptation that distracted Christians from the goal o f salvation, and an instrument that the devil regularly used to entice souls into hell, continued in use among Roman Catholics until the beginning o f the twentieth century (Bullough, 1982), Much earlier than Gratian the most influential writer on Christian sexual ethics had been St, Augustine o f Hippo, who was bom in the middle o f the fourth century C,E, and lived to be almost eighty-years old, St, Augustine developed an elaborate rationale for the basic tenets o f Christian sexual morality whereby human sexuality, like death, was a direct consequence o f Adam and Eve's original sin. In pre-fall paradise, postulated St, Augustine, sexual feelings and relations were radically different from the sexuality o f post-paradise humans. In paradise sexuality had been an entirely rational and bland affair that brought none o f the sinful orgasmic bliss humans began to experience after their progenitors fell from divine grace. As such, expounded St, Augustine, sex constituted both a punishment we all must bear for our ancestral parents, and a depraved temptation that if indulged in would lead us straight to hell. As such, the early Christian period was sufiused by the idea that sexual activity should only be engaged in for the continuation of the species; otherwise celibacy and virginity should be de rigeur. To a certain extent this radical rejection o f sexual pleasure was a reaction to the dominant ethos o f Greco-Roman culture where the sexuality o f the citizen could adopt multifarious forms, including same- sex acts (Brooke, 1989), 21 The anti-sex exhortations o f the early Church became solidly entrenched within Christian culture through the penitentials, i,e, handbooks for confessors, which from the beginning o f the sixth century began to be produced by spiritual authorities. Penitentials dealt with all possible categories o f sin, and penitential officers prescribed distinct penances in accordance with what was deemed appropriate for each particular sinfijl situation. The penitentials put the ascetic sexual norms into writing: during Lent, Pentecost, and Advent married couples must abstain entirely from sexual relations; intercourse between married persons was grievously sinful on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays throughout the year; sexual activity during the wife's menstrual period, during pregnancy, and after pregnancy so long as the child nursed at the mother's breast was also a serious offence. Naked sex or daytime frolicking, as well as positional experimentation, were vehemently proscribed (the 'missionary' was the only sanctioned position). Non-marital sex, whether social or solitary, heterosexual or homosexual, voluntary or involuntary, was likewise abhorrent. It was only during the eleventh century that penitentials began to abandon then- general approach to sin to focus on the sexual nature of most sinful acts (and especially o f homosexual acts). However, if the adepts o f 'contra naturam' acts were demonised even religious officials had to submit to the sexual ascetism o f the time: clerics had to renounce marriage and sex as a condition o f ordination.* Whereas earlier spiritual writers and some church authorities had long praised clerical cehbacy and encouraged all clergymen to embrace it, celibacy had previously been required only o f monks and nuns * The prohibition against sodomy extended to any individual who engaged in it. Medieval canonists and theologians condoned as 'natural only marital intercourse conducted in the missionary position. Intercourse in any position where the woman was on top canonists regarded as 'unnatural' sinee it subverted normal power relations between the sexes. Church authorities vehemently rejected all anal or oral sexual practices, which were considered beastly and radically unnatural. 22 who lived in religions eommnnities. Now a vow of celibacy was required for ordination (Brundage, 1987). 1.2.2.- The M\u00e9dicalisation of Homosexualitv The concept o f 'sodomy' arose in the Middle Ages, According to medieval theology, sodomy constituted 'the exact reversal of the lawful way o f having sex' (Hekma, 1989:433). 'Sodomites' transgressed the traditional boundaries that had characterised the nature o f most classical homosexual liaisons where their educational character was reflected by the exclusively 'active' role o f the older man towards his pupil. Such 'transgression' became central to the modem Western conception o f homosexual identity and role precisely because 'sodomy' is the very act that constitutes the symbolic centre o f gay identity, and which acts as a crystallising force on male homosexual desire' (Coxon, 1996;72-74).9 The m\u00e9dicalisation of homosexuality accompanied the wider processes o f secularisation and rationalisation o f society culminating in its classification as a psychiatric disorder when the World Health Organisation was established in 1948. Since the 1970s homosexuality has been undergoing a process o f normalisation. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual o f Psychiatric Disorders in 1973, and in Britain it officially stopped being regarded as mental illness in 1993 (Greenberg, 1988; David, 1997). However, that contemporary gay identity sex still echoes ancient Judeo-Christian attitudes that 23 conceptualised the enactment of same-sex (male) desire as an abominable sin was evident at the onset o f the AIDS crisis.*\u00ae The AIDS crisis has remedicalised the homosexual act in terms o f unsafe sex. Anal intercourse constitutes the most likely route o f HIV infection. As such, the relational aspect involved in the 'enactment of homosexuality' through sexual behaviour has been overlooked by HTV prevention strategies (Dowsett, 1996). Homosexuality has been reduced into moralistic and homophobic distinctions of supposedly meaningless 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' practices. This one-dimensional view o f sexuality, stemming from a simple rational choice model, precludes a wider understanding of rationality that must include 'longing and love as motives for action' (Watney, 1990:145). 'Safer sex absolutism' labels any unprotected sex as 'relapse', and blames it on 'depression, a sense o f fatality or inevitability, lack o f motivation to remain healthy, survivor's guilt, grief and trauma'. Such claims go against the evidence o f demographic studies of so-called 'relapsed' men, who attribute none o f these reasons to their unsafe behaviour (Rotello, 1998:118).* * The official discourse on gay (safer) sex creates a climate o f intolerance that once more m\u00e9dicalis\u00e9s and vilifies same-sex desire. Moreover, by stigmatising those who 'fail' to maintain 'new fantasy norms o f how gay men are meant to behave', such discursive practices inhibit the development of collective community values essential in the sustenance o f safer sex over time (Jones and Ridley, 1997:18). \u00ae Data from Project SIGMA indicates that 92% of gay men in England and Wales have ever engaged in anal sex. However, gay men's sexual behaviour is taken up in the three acts of masturbation, fellatio, and anal intercourse roughly in a 6:2:1 ratio (Coxon, 1996). * \u00ae In the beginning of the AIDS crisis a large percentage of the public perceived AIDS to be God's punishment, and blamed homosexuals for their sinful lifestyle (Seidman, 1995). * * The reasons given by men who engage in unprotected sex include a desire to enhance pleasure, the effect of drugs or alcohol, or being 'swept away by passion'. Younger gay men cited the following reasons: 24 1.2.3.- Homosexualitv and the Other' Sciences Attempts to appropriate (homo)sexual meaning were enacted first by the discourses of religion; then medical science and the law, and most recently, the social sciences. After Kinsey (1948,1953), whose work suggested that sexuality be conceptualised as a continuum, new social models of homosexuality appeared. In particular, the discourses of the social sciences as well as the counter discourses of the new sexual movements came to regard homosexuals as a persecuted minority (Hooker, 1965; Hoffinan, 1968). Despite the significant influence o f sociological perspectives, as well as the labelling theory o f Becker (1963), Goffinan (1968), and Schur (1971), in shaping interpretative firameworks concerning (homo)sexuality, they all accepted the view of homosexuality as a 'basis o f individual and social identity' (Seidman, 1996:8). Such post-war deviance theories modified the theoretical perspective that had characterised deviance as an inherent property of the individual, or of a particular act, to that of a specific historical status occasioned through social oppression. Such theories o f homosexuality provided 'a distinction between homosexual behaviour, universal in its manifestations, across time and cultures, and the specific historical and social forms in which it was organised' (Weeks, 1998:133). With the emergence o f the 'social constructionist' perspective in the 1970s, the argument that homosexual (and heterosexual) identity was a social and historical creation was put forth for the first time. Despite its challenge to essentialist notions of homosexuality, social-constructionism contributed to a model of lesbian and gay subcultures that analogises them to ethnic minorities. These studies looked for the 'sense of youthful invulnerability, a belief that AIDS is the plague of an older generation, and a dread of growing old in a culture that prizes youth and beauty' (Rotello, 1998:118). 25 social factors that produced a homosexual identity, rather than assuming the naturalness o f the condition (Seidman, 1996). The inadequacy of the concept of homosexuality as an ethnic group was highlighted by its inability to prevent the backlash against homosexuality spawned by the AIDS crisis. The hostility to homosexuality 'legitimised' by AIDS is evident in media constructions o f the 'general public', or the 'family'. This mediatised family identity, constituted through 'the active work of selecting and presenting, o f structuring and shaping: not merely the transmitting o f already-existing meaning, but the more active labour o f making this m ean\\ is more 'likely to include your dog than your homosexual brother or sister' (Hall, cited in Bersani 1996:203). Such a heteronormative context - whose degree of homophobia has varied according to the specific cultural, social, historical, and institutional background - fiumes the master discourses o f science and medicine through which HTV/AIDS, and homosexuality, are given meaning. As such, the subtle shift fi'om safer sex as protected sex to safer sex as non-penetrative sex took hold. If, as Bersani (1196:222) noted, the 'rectum is a grave' it is because: the masculine ideal... of proud subjectivity is buried...Tragically, ADDS has literalized that potential as the certainty of biological death, and has \u00dcierefore reinforced the heterosexual association of anal sex with self-annihilation originally and primarily identified with the fantasmatic mystery of an insatiable, unstoppable female sexuality 1.3.- Micrological Strategies o f Resistance: resisting appropriation 26 Insalubrious notions, be they o f sin, crime, or disease are intrinsically linked to modem homosexual identity. The scientific encroachment onto the homosexual body has elicited, surveyed, probed, and constrained its behaviour. The advent of AIDS has only crystallised such time-honoured inclinations upon a transmissible entity (HIV). As such, the power of scientific discourse is strengthened by a (contested) virus even if the plausibility o f (AIDS) science is being increasingly questioned by contemporary 'risk- society' (Beck, 1992).*^ Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the AIDS crisis in the western world persists in being a disease that disproportionately affects homosexual men. Hence it is the 'positive' body, now collapsed with the 'gay' one, which is elicited, surveyed, probed, and constrained. As such, science is justified in its surveillance o f the diagnosed. The gay/positive body is thus simultaneously an 'inverted', 'diseased', 'sinful', and 'criminal' entity. Never before has the homosexual body been cloaked with all its potential burdens. Still, it tenaciously endures; it resists 'normalisation' and refutes 'docility'. As a result, the 'gay' body is currently engrossed in a process o f resistance, o f transformation, o f transcendence of the (loaded) self. Stigma-neutralising strategies that have attempted to alleviate the pressure o f living with a failed masculinity precluded Gay-LiberatioiL^^ln this thesis 1 engage in an analysis of three contemporary 'micrological strategies o f resistance' articulated as challenges to the The 'World AIDS Day' celebration, for example, has never featured homosexual AIDS as one of its yearly themes. The 'Dissident Movement' constitutes a collective of scientists who question the science and the scientific practices that have established that AIDS is caused by HTV. For a full discussion of the movement and related issues see c h ^ e r six. Recently HTV transmission has been criminalized in court cases in the US and in the UK. 27 disciplinary forces which first demonised, then criminalized, and finally medicalised the homosexual body (McWhorther, 1999). However, before analysing contemporary resistance projects I shall introduce my argument in chapter three by film ing it against a socio-historical presentation o f homosexuality, and the strategies o f resistance that have surrounded its more ancient manifestations. In chapter four I shall describe what I have classified as a 'spontaneous' resistance project inasmuch as it first emanated from the grassroots o f the affected constituency in an unplanned, unstructured way. As such, in chapter four I argue that the 'gay-circuit' phenomenon constitutes a micrological strategy that refutes the notion that the gay body must be reduced to the ailing AIDS body. In chapter five and six I shall present analyses o f what I call 'conscious' resistance projects inasmuch as they constitute culturally and/or structurally elaborated strategies that have either emerged fi'om or been appropriated by specific factions o f gay culture. In chapter five I analyse the construction o f what I term the 'queer' spiritual discourse, an elite- produced resistance project whose theological cultural production aims to overturn religious definitions o f homosexuahty as inherently sinful. In chapter six I provide an analysis as well as a description o f the 'Dissident Movement', a social movement organised around the questioning of the scientific procedures that have established the truth o f AIDS. In the concluding chapter I present the analysis o f my empirical research where I attempt to describe how 'micrological' strategies of resistance collude and interact in the construction o f identities of HIV infected individuals. The methodology o f such research is presented in chapter two. These strategies were: passing (adoption of a pretended heterosexual identity), minstrelisation (the cross-gendering associated with camp), and capitulation (self-hatred and shame of the damaged self) 28 1.4. - Contemporary Homosexual Identity: gay and positive Since the advent o f AIDS homosexually-identified individuals have engaged in processes o f re-evaluation and reconstruction of their pre-AIDS selves. Hence, micrological resistance projects constitute important variables in the context o f identities that are not only physically but also symbolically related to HIV. However, identity is a universal social phenomenon and as such influenced by a multitude o f factors. In order to analyse specific identity processes it is necessary to take into consideration the wider frame in which they are embedded. Below I briefly describe the theoretical perspectives on identity that informed the empirical, qualitative study I conducted. 1.4.1.- Becoming Gav: the interactionist perspective From the early 1950s until the mid-1970s conceptualisations of homosexuality in the Anglo-Saxon world had been grounded in the notion that such a form o f sexual expression is an 'essential' phenomenon recognised through time and history. Through such a prism, homosexuals were seen as constitutive o f an ethnic minority with their own culture and political interests. The formation o f homosexual identities served as the basis for the process o f community development, as well as for the legitimisation of homosexuality, which began to take place after the Stonewall riots. Inasmuch as homosexuality was understood as a unitary identity grounded in a common experience and set o f values it reflected characteristics o f the modernist project. However, the 'meta\u00ad narrative' o f the homosexual experience referred only to the experience o f white middle- class Anglo-Saxon homosexuality. Homosexually identified individuals who did not (Levine, 1998-21). 29 recognise their experience in such totalising versions o f homoeroticism later challenged these normalising notions of homosexual identity (Seidman, 1995). The term 'coming out' denotes the transformational process through which individuals acquire identity by actively engaging in 'historically specific communities and discourses' (Petersen, 1998:106). As the 'key' ritual of contemporary gay culture once the individual 'comes out' he or she publicly reveals the centrality o f same-sex desire as a basis for self-identification (Herdt, 1992). Another reading may suggest that rather than as a process o f admission o f a deviant sexual orientation coming out is better understood as a process o f self-labelling (Plummer, 1975). When the homosexual body declares its deviance it subjectively pledges alliance to socially constructed norms that surround homosexuality. As such, some sort of cognitive construct results firom the reciprocal relationship between the homosexual body and its social context: gay is not sexual preference, it is identity. Some writers have objected to the application o f labelling theory to gay identity on the basis that gay identity is the result o f an internal condition, i.e. sexual orientation rather than the outcome of the external acts of authority. Instead o f the rejection o f labelling theory as an explanatory framework for homosexuality, an approach that 'can best be described as a non-deviant labelling theory', which is based on a theoretical perspective that assumes that the gay role is not really deviant, has been developed (EhiBay, 1987:123). Plummer's (1975) interactionist account o f the process o f homosexual-identity-acquisition constitutes the departing point for such non-deviant approaches to the homosexual label. Subsequent refinements o f Plummer's model have Plummer's model argues that the adoption of the homosexual role starts with the stage of 'sensitisation', when the individual makes a connection between his homosexual tendencies and the realisation that there is 30 discussed how the commitment to the gay role may be attenuated, and further roles adopted (Cass, 1979; Troiden, 1979). Yet, a positivist bias that points to an internal condition as the source o f a gay identity has remained in interactionist accounts o f the adoption o f a gay identity (Coleman, 1982). The specification o f homosexual individuals, which Foucault claims took place in the final decades o f the nineteenth century, is not undisputed. Many authors disagree with Foucault's view, and argue that 'examination of earher history shows conception of homosexual persons, a homosexual species even... (and) that it is intellectually dishonest to treat homosexual categories as uniquely social/historical/arbitrary' (Murray, 1989:467- 468). This kind o f essentialist perspective assumes that interiority precedes identity, and that identity, although it allows the formation of community, pre-exists community. Historical data does demonstrate patterned social behaviour concerning homosexuality. If early homosexual acts were devoid of specific embodiment why were there words such as 'sodomite' or 'bugger'? If there were only homosexual acts, without self-conception, why would these terms have appeared? It is also argued that social constructionists attempt to dodge the issue o f ancient previous expressions o f (essential) homosexuality through the concept of 'role'. Role, which as a concept is opposed to the notions of 'essence' or 'se lf, points towards the multiplicity of positions an individual can adopt. As such, contemporary gay identity is deemed to result firom the evolution o f the a special category of similar people in the wider society. The second, which is termed 'signification', represents the individual's self-categorisation as a homosexual. The third stage is that o f'stabilization'; in this consolidating stage the homosexual identity becomes fixed and one's life becomes organised around it (Plummer, 1975). 31 homosexual role, first embodied by the seventeenth century British 'molly' (McIntosh, 1968). 1.4.2.- HIV Identities: a social identity perspective Modem identity is constituted through a 'reflexive project o f the se lf. As such, identity construction is an ongoing process enacted through revision and reordering of biographical narratives selected fi'om a multitude of available alternatives (Giddens, 1991). However, encounters with 'fatefiil moments', those times 'where a person learns o f information with fateful consequences', threaten the 'protective cocoon' that normally prevents individuals fi'om drowning in the ontological maze o f contemporary society. Such ontological crises may be met with a return to traditional sources o f authority, but they can also engender processes o f 'reskilling' and empowerment (Giddens, 1991). HIV diagnosis most definitely constitutes a 'fateful moment'. Although the great majority o f the HIV-diagnosed deal with the break of their 'protective cocoon' through the traditional authority o f medical science, a few have preferred to rely on other types of knowledge in trying to grapple with the meaning o f their condition. In order to arrive at a nuanced understanding o f how individuals diagnosed with HTV/AIDS come to 'reskill' their transformed identities, it is first necessary to review the development o f the social processes which have shaped the organisation, representation, and containment o f homosexual behaviour throughout history. My analysis o f the identity reconstmction processes o f HTV-infected individuals is based on the notion that identity is more than who you say you are inasmuch as the possibilities 32 for self-definitions are delimited by what you can say you are. I have adopted a social identity perspective whereby socially determined categories enable, or disable, the self- evaluations through which individuals come to understand and interpret themselves (Tajifel, 1981). A fundamental assumption o f my argument is that social identity is embodied. It is upon the human body that identification is articulated as our biological containers convey our similarities as much as our differences; in fact 'social identification in isolation firom embodiment is unimaginable.' Identity is not only a self-applied label, which represents the individual in specific social situations, but also an indicator o f the social category such a label refers to. Identities are thus constructed through an 'intemal- extemal dialectic o f identification' (Jenkins, 1996:20-21). Social identity theory examines how the organised set o f self-perceptions an individual holds about him or herself is related to the socio-cultural environment. Such a perspective also takes into consideration that identity as a cognitive construct may also affect the social structures that have shaped it (Cass, 1984; Cox and Gallois, 1986). SocW identity theory demonstrates how self-categorisation implies a dialectic articulated between individual and society. Identity is always a process: a 'becoming' as much as a 'having been'. As such, those who identify as belonging to a certain social group or category adopt the normative behaviours and the values associated with such groups. However, individuals always retain aspects o f identity (attitudes, values, behaviours, traits) that are thought to be unique and which ultimately differentiate them firom all other individuals - including those with whom they may share some sort o f communal belonging. This dimension o f the identity construct, the personal identity, always grounds 33 the multiple social identities an individual can simultaneously posses. The development o f personal, or individual, identity is a function o f primary socialisation processes that take place during infancy and childhood. For that reason, primary identities such as 'selfhood, human-ness, gender, and under some circumstances, kinship and ethnicity' are less easily abandoned and/or modified after they have been ascribed (Jenkins, 1996:21). 1.4.3.- HIV Identities: the postmodern perspective Other cultural and social trends have had a significant impact on the reappraisal o f the concept o f identity, including homosexual identity. The 'velocity' o f life in the beginning o f the twenty-first century stems firom the ever more sophisticated technological developments, which have transformed our perceptions o f space and time. Such a transformation has also significantly altered the ways in wiiich human beings understand and constitute themselves. The 'acceleration' o f life is a process that has accompanied the rise o f human progress since ancient Greece. As such, the 'political phenomenon of acceleration' is fundamental for an understanding o f history; we have evolved from 'the velocity o f the predators, of the cavalry, of railways, o f ships and maritime power' to 'the velocity o f dispatching information' (Armitage, 1999:35). The peak o f such a historical process o f acceleration, which has been fiumed in terms of 'information revolution' and 'globalisation', has annihilated modem perceptions o f time.^^ For the technical rationality that formed the basis o f the modem age time was a cyclical, but linear phenomenon. More importantly, Judaeo-Christian notions coloured the modem understanding o f time: time began with the genesis o f the Earth and would end with the These processes are more concretely ej\u00e7erienced in the nations of the developed West. 34 heavenly salvation that would befall all human beings before their world turned to dust (Melucci, 1996:8). Today, however, many o f us exist in multiple time/space configurations; the modem model o f time fails to grab the contemporary experience o f it. Moreover, 'multiple and discontinuous time reveals its nature as a cultural artefact that is entirely constructed within everyday social relationships' (Melucci, 1996:16). What is also apparent is that the 'salvation' promised by outmoded conceptions o f time, where the end o f linear time implied the coming o f the saviour, is unlikely to materialise. Not even secular versions o f the salvation myth - the modem fictions of technology, science, rationality, development, and economic growth - have any lasting credibility. If all we can expect in a more or less distant future is catastrophe and ecological collapse, our experience o f time reaches epic levels o f fragmentation: Linear time yields to an experience of transitions without development, to a movement between disconnected points, a sequence of fleeting moments whose meaning is entirely grounded in the present point of time (Melucci, 1996:9) The onset o f AIDS coincided somewhat with the beghming of the academic debate about 'postmodemity'. Such debate, which analysed the social processes introduced above, was initiated with the publication o f Jurgen Habermas' (1983) Modernity - an incomplete project and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. Although both authors agreed that modernity implied notions o f universality and unity - Lyotard's 'meta-narratives' - they disagreed on the current state of the 35 cultural and social environment. For Habermas modernity was still unfinished, but Lyotard argued that we had entered a new period - the postmodern \u2014 and that modernity had been buried with the atrocities of the Holocaust. As such, postmodemity was characterised by different stmctures o f knowledge where totalising narratives were substituted 'by smaller and multiple narratives which seek no universahsing stabilization and legitimation' (Hutcheon, 1989:24). Another academic debate that took into consideration the changes in the cultural environment, but was narrower in its focus, was that o f 'Queer Theory'. 'Queer Theory', articulated in the eighties, challenged the assumption o f a unified homosexual identity and argued that (gay) identities are multiple and unstably constituted through the intersection of several identity components. Such argument contested the 'very telos of Western homosexual pohtics' (Seidman, 1996:11). The modem project had unchained individuals from traditional identities, and transformed pre-modem processes o f identity constraction. Rather than inherit self\u00ad categorisations, the modem individual had to achieve an identity \u2014 a process articulated in the shape o f strived-for life projects (Bauman, 1997). Identity construction processes o f contemporary individuals differ fi'om their modem ancestors inasmuch as a stable identity must be forged through the institutionalised radical doubt that characterises the postmodem condition. Such ingrained environment o f uncertainty has been occasioned by the plurahty o f available discourses, which has followed the demise o f modem certainty (Giddens, 1991). As such, the self-reflexive constmction o f contemporary identities reflects the consciously active nature o f the identity constmction processes engaged in by the self. As Melucci (1996:9-12) has argued: 36 Establishing an equilibrium between the different Vectors along which our identity is constructed becomes progressively more difficult, and there is an increased likelihood of identity crisis, as a result of the inability to maintain a coherent spatio-temporal definition of ourselves In this fundamentaliy risky and unstable current social environment (late-modem; postmodern) the apparently increasing narcissistic preoccupation with the body is in fact veiling much deeper existential questions. The quest to control and shape human biological processes and forms reflects the final demise o f an * enchanted world' where flesh was subordinate to gods, not mortals. Moreover, such quest reflects the inherent risk o f a contemporary existence that has lead to the 'therapeutisation o f life' (Melucci, 1996). If identity construction processes o f contemporary individuals are self-reflexively performed, then self-categorisations are the conscious outcome o f individual cognitive processes. Such processes are constituted by and through the characteristic plurality of discursive practices', and must result in coherent constructs 'even if such coherence must be continually open to revision.' Failure in achieving coherence results in an 'ontological insecurity' that reveals the chaotic void obscured by the imagined solidity o f our daily interactions in the social world (Giddens, 1991). Although it may be argued that the religious or spiritual individual may suffer less from 'ontological insecurity' as his or her worldview may impose metaphysical meaning on what secularly is perceived as chaotic, the fact is that on the public level a 'disenchanted world' can only produce feelings o f 37 a new type of uncertainty - not limited to one's own luck and talents, but concerning as well the future shape of the world, the right way of living in it, and the criteria by ^ i c h to judge the rights and wrongs of the way of living (Bauman, 1997:21) Despite the fragility of 'postmodern' ontological security, it must be achieved for the continued existence o f social life. The 'protective cocoon', established early in the life o f the infant through its relationship with its caretakers, is a necessary (even if illusory) condition o f human embodiment. The 'protective' bracketing o f the 'cocoon' does allow us to carry on with our daily lives without much consideration to all the potential danger that constantly surrounds us. Yet, when one's friends are diagnosed with a terminal disease or one's community is decimated by a tidal wave, the frailty o f such illusion is dramatically brought to the surface. The more indirect the 'brush' with events that disrupt the integrity o f our 'cocoon' the more rapidly and comprehensively it can be restored, and routine life regained (Giddens, 1991). As such, an HTV diagnosis constitutes a 'fateful moment' inasmuch as the 'ontological security' o f the diagnosed individuzd is severely challenged and his or her 'protective cocoon' shattered. Giddens (1991:112-113) defines fateful moments as: those when individuals are called on to take decisions that are particularly consequential for their ambitions, or more generally for their future lives. Fatefiil moments are highly consequential for a person's destiny...fateful moments are times when events come together in such a way that an individua) stands, as it were, at a crossroads in his existence; or where a person learns of information with fateful consequences 38 1.5. Challenging H\u00e9g\u00e9monie Discourses When GRID (Gay Related hnmune Deficiency) was in June o f 1981 first identified in members o f gay communities in the United States, homosexually identified individuals were once again linked to notions of intrinsic sickness (Epstein, 1996). Despite the initial debate on the aetiology o f the new syndrome, which was renamed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in July o f 1982, it was postulated to be a viral disease. As such, the syndrome's appropriation by the 'germ school' o f the bio-medical model soon followed (Dubos, 1959). However, and despite the institutionalisation o f the biomedical scheme o f AIDS, several competing knowledges and meanings continue to threaten the hegemonic discourse o f biomedicine. Such sites o f resistance have been articulated through authentic knowledge(s) based on personal experience, and through 'reverse' scientific discourse (Foucault, 1981). These various subjugated positions challenge hegemonic discourses, and foster the proliferation o f difference by countering normalising strategies o f power. The rejection o f pre-ordained 'diseased' or 'sinful' identities by individuals doubly stigmatised by the labels homosexual and HIV-positive suggests that HTV/AIDS diagnosis may be used in productive ways that challenge the internalisation o f effects of power o f disciplinary society. Such a perspective informs my analysis o f how an HIV/AIDS diagnosis produces new self-understandings. Foucault (1981; 1990) was interested in the techniques o f power (self-surveillance, self-confession) through which subjectivity comes to be acquired. The analytic conception of subjectivity in Foucault's genealogical work is often presumed to disallow for an account o f agency dynamic enough to produce individual freedom and 39 self-determination.^^ It is argued that bis idea of the subject as a result of power relations not only destabilises agency, but also fails to provide a template for its development within the power webs o f modem societies (Alcoff, 1992; Norris, 1993; Heaphy, 1996). Yet, Foucault was not the first to argue against the notion that human interiority pre\u00ad exists networits of power. However, the concession that the interiority o f subjects is historically contingent, and as such can not be given any analytical priority, does not mean that subjects never exercise any power. It does mean that subjects must be explained with reference to power networks rather than power netwodcs be explained with reference to subjects. Human interiority, which arises from power-effect relations, is not an illusion incapable o f agency. If subjectivity is constituted by and through subjugating relations of power, and as power is not an entity but a network o f events, our identities are thus dependent on certain configurations o f power relations. The notion that Foucault does away with agency is misguided; our existence as subjects (a subjection which implies its conscience in the formation o f self-identity) presumes varying degrees o f subjection to configurations o f power/knowledge which can and ought to be resisted. As such, when power networks shift identities, which are dependent on a specific set o f power relations, may either undergo change or even collapse or disappear (McWorther, 1999).^\u00ae We shall soon turn to the social production o f such resistance projects and he 1^ Genealogy is a 'history of the present specifically concerned with the complex causal antecedents of a socio-intellectual reality.* Although genealogy affirms the existence of social realities, it acknowledges their historicity, and their socially constructed nature (Gutting, 1994:12; McWorther, 1999). 1^ Before him both Nietzsche and Heidegger had argued the displacement of subjectivity (McWorther, 1999). For Foucault (1981, quoted in McWorther, 1999:78) 'power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is ttie same name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.* As such, power produces social structures, personal identities, laws, systems of drought, and so on. 40 identities that emerge through and across them, but not before I proceed to expidn the methodology through which I empirically investigated the subject. 4\u00ce Chapter 2: M ethodology of Research 2.1.- Theoretical Considerations 2.1.1.- Oxialitativc or Quantitative Research I set out to investigate issues around the main research question I had initially postulated. However, in what appears to be typical of many research projects (at least those o f a doctoral nature) through the development o f the research the direction o f my focus significantly changed with the discovery o f a fundamentally important new category. These processes will be explored in subsequent sections of this chapter. At this point suffice it to say that despite the change o f focus o f the research, the methodological design I had charted did not need to be altered. Yes, I was now covering an area I had not initially envisioned, but the core substance o f my investigation remained unchanged: I still wanted to discover if and how HTV infected individuals restructure their lives after the 'fatefiil moment' o f the diagnosis (Giddens, 1991). Yet, I had not anticipated the slant from which I would endeavour to understand the multilayered social processes that comprised the life-restructure. Research methods constitute techniques for the collection and analysis o f data, and have traditionally been dichotomised into either quantitative or qualitative project designs (Harding, 1986; Oakley, 1997,1998). Such binary understandings o f research methods associate quantitative methods with 'hard' values such as science, objectivity, measurement, and empiricism; qualitative methods are associated with 'soft' values such 42 as subjectivity and interpretivism (Westmariand, 2001). These two methods are generally viewed as inherently incompatible due to the presumed incommensurability o f the ontological paradigms that frame them. However, regardless o f which epistemological paradigm each research method is lumped under, all social science research attempts to grasp the embodied processes that underlie social phenomena. Analogously, subscription to either epistemological perspective does not translate into unadulterated objectivity even if 'real' knowledge has traditionally been measured by its objectivity, reliability, and its validity. Both quantitative and qualitative methods construct data, and as such are subject to biases. The positivistic paradigm is employed to uncover frmctional relations between operationalised variables whilst the qualitative viewpoint focuses on describing and understanding the structure o f multilayered social phenomena. Either approach brings distinctive q u ^ tie s to the research process. Grounded Theory (GT) constitutes a research methodology which can be succinctly defined as a 'general method o f comparative analysis'. To put it simply, GT represents a methodology that claims to answer the question o f 'what was going on in an area' through the elaboration o f either a substantive or formal theory (Rahmat, 2000:2). GT can be apphed to both qualitative and quantitative data, and it is particularly effective in exploring 'uncharted territory' (Glaser and Strauss, 1974; Stem, 1995). Quantitative methods recognise the facticity o f social phenomena but their analytical processes albeit precise are reductive inasmuch as many facets o f the phenomenon are simplified by their operationalisation. On the other hand, qualitative methods treat phenomena as whole systems in a holistic approach which, in searching for 43 patterns through the incorporation o f as many episodes as possible, attempts to grasp the different structural elements o f the process. Hence in my endeavour to apprehend the social reality of HIV positive individuals I adopted a research method (GT) whose flexibility allowed for creativity. Without the productive insights which arose from both data immersion and the creative processes I engaged in with the data, the research would not have generated any relevant theoretical formulations about the phenomenon being investigated. 2.1.2.- Basic Research Design: whv Grounded Theorv? A sociologist ffom the University o f Chicago, Anselm Strauss, and another sociologist from Columbia University, in New Yorit City, Barney Glaser, developed grounded theory in die late 1960s (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). Both schools emphasised the empirical dimension o f social research. The principle objective o f GT is the conceptualisation o f a theory to explain how a population may resolve a main concern. GT is developed around the following fundamental criteria: generality, relevance, validity, modifiability. Whereas a number o f qualitative data analysis (QDA) techniques produce conceptual descriptions o f the phenomenon being studied, GT is concerned with building conceptual theories. In endeavouring to build a theory GT looks way beyond description towards the conceptualisation o f latent patterns and categories (Glaser, 1978). In grounded theory 'all is data\"; not only 'what is being told, how it is being told and the conditions o f its being told, but also all the data surrounding what is being told' (Glaser, 2001:145). As such, in GT the role o f data is not description but interpretation; the objective is to collect the 44 data, code it, and then analyse it. The final result ought to be abstraction o f the data, not accurate description o f the information collected. It has been argued that much o f the data obtained through GT techniques is of 'a constructivist approach (that) recognizes (that) the categories, concepts and theoretical level o f analysis emerge from the researcher's interaction within the field and questions about the data' (Charmaz, 2000:13). However, Glaser (2003) argues that the yielding of data that is biased or misinterpreted is more probable through other QDA methodologies than through GT, The focused in-depth interview is a technique often used in QDA methodologies. Although GT interviewing also includes in-depth interviewing, the principal strategy o f GT interviewing is constituted by a 'passive' approach to listening. The 'passive' approach is less likely to constitute a dynamic interplay between the interpretations o f interviewer and interviewee than is in-depth interviewing. As such, when the interview guide 'forces and feeds interviewee responses then (the data) is constructed to a degree by interviewer imposed interactive bias (Glaser, 2002:3), In my research this pattern o f 'directed' passive hstening was systematically attempted. Although I did direct the interviewees to explore the content areas I was interested in, mostly respondents talked freely and were unencumbered by a schedule o f questions. It was only after the emergence o f the new fundamental category during theoretical sampling that some o f my questioning became at times more probing. It should not be claimed indiscriminately that constructivism applies to all kinds o f data. 'Interviewer imposed interactive bias' can be limited if the passive, non-structured 45 interview technique o f GT is observed. If GT is correctly articulated through competent comparative methods and adequate theoretical sampling then the end result will generate theoretical concepts which are as free o f subjective contaminants as a humanly produced theory can be. Clearly any human endeavour may contain some sort o f personal bias and/or interpretation inasmuch as it is a hwnan activity; but the collection, coding, and interpretation of data can be rendered highly objective if enough cases o f the phenomenon being studied are observed and care is taken to eliminate bias. Corrections can then be conceptualised into categories which are sanitized from personal projections. As such, 'validity of data' and 'reliability o f method' can be ensured. In the subsequent sections 1 will develop such issues in greater detail as they applied to my own research process. 2.2.- Sampling Design 2.2.1.- Sampling: a complementarv approach In the initial phase o f the research 1 determined that my population o f interest was HIV- infected homosexual m en who resided in London. How these men decided to identify themselves (gay, queer, post-gay) was not in itself relevant, the relevant factor was whether their sexual behaviour was primarily homosexual. The primary goal o f the research was to discover if and how HTV infected individuals restructure their lives after the diagnosis, and hence to understand the different sets o f conditions that affect the phenomenon of becoming an individual for whom HTV infection comes to constitute if not the primary vector o f identity at least one o f its most fundamental components. The objective of the research was not to generahse the results to the population o f HTV- 46 infected homosexual men in London, rather that each interview would be analysed taking into consideration the presence or absence o f the categories and concepts that would arise from data immersion. The theoretical formulations developed from this research do not attempt to generalise but to specify; that is, these theoretical formulations apply under a certain set o f conditions, which through specific interaction/action, produce certain outcomes/identities. If such conditions were to change, had I studied, say, the identity construction processes of HIV-infected children in the Afiican nation of Zambia as opposed to homosexual men in London, my theoretical formulations would certainly have differed. In the early 1980s, when the 'gay syndrome' began to emerge and the hypothesis of GRID (Gay Related Immune Disorder) was postulated, the (then) so-called AIDS 'victims' (mostly homosexuals and drug users) were not considered a population worthy enough to justify significant funds for scientific research. From the first homosexual cases in 1981 until the identification o f an 'AIDS' virus in 1984 neither medical nor political institutions seemed very interested in a disease that seemed to affect only marginal segments o f society. The result was that many AIDS 'victims' turned to the New Age and Holistic Health Movement for help.^^ Two decades into the health crisis and HIV/AIDS have been mostly appropriated by the medical system; yet I was interested to see if some remnants o f the initial role o f the New Age still lingered. As such, I had hypothesised that the therapeutic/medical component of the coping strategies adopted by positive gay men in order to deal with HIV/AIDS was related to their 21 This topic will be further explored in chapter six. 47 religious/spiritual cosmologies.^^ A number of questions exploring this area were included in the questionnaire. The second set o f relationships I wanted to test concerned the respondents' views o f a once widely-circulated theme early in the health crisis, especially before there were any significant allopathic tools, i.e. 'combination therapy'. This theme related to the work o f early-crisis New Age AIDS 'healers', who entertained the idea that the new disease stemmed fi*om a lack o f self-love, and that its healing was fimdamentally related to transformations o f the 'inner se lf (Hay, 1984,1988). The logic was that through its disease-causing properties HIV/AIDS prompted the previously damaged self to enter into a quest for multidimensional healing that might not ever have been engaged in had the disease not manifested. HIV/AIDS constituted thus a 'blessing in disguise'. In order to explore respondents' reactions to such a theme I directly asked them in the interviews if they agreed with the statement that 'HIV is a blessing in disguise'. Somewhere in between the beginning and the middle o f the process o f data collection a 'revolutionary' new category emerged; its appearance demanded that the research follow a different path. As such, one of tiie first changes that had to be made concerned sampling procedures. More specifically, I hypothesised that those individuals who subscribed to a type of religiosity/spirituality that is described as self-religion would be more likely to shun orthodox therapeutic regimes, and opt for alternative ones. Self-religions are characterised by 'various synthesis of mind cure, psychotherapy, eastern religious ideas, and aspects of the human potential movement and humanist psychology, (they) combine and highlight major cultural themes: the psychological, the religious, the meaningful, and the perfectibility of man'. These movements, which are concerned with 'the exploration of the self and the search for significance ... attach great importance to positive thinking' (Heelas, 1998:69). Such type of metaphysical perspective places the self at the core of the mdividual's spiritual dimension, and bestows upon him or her divine quality. 23 See chapter seven for a discussion of the issues of therapeutic treatment as well as HIV as a blessing in disguise. 48 2.2.1.1.- Theoretical Sampling The initial goal o f my research project was to test some theoretically hypothesised relationships as well as identify, develop, and relate concepts that the data would reveal. My initial sampling plan was 'theoretical' sampling, in the sense that it was a sampling procedure that takes into consideration concepts that have proven theoretical relevance to the emerging theory. Theoretical sampling is employed when the 'process o f data collection is controlled by the emerging theory, whether substantive or form al... (and the) criteria are theoretical purpose and relevance' (Glaser and Strauss, 1974:45-48). By 'theoretical relevance' it is meant that concepts are significant because they are repeatedly present or absent when comparing incidents, and because they have earned the status of categories through the coding process. In the initial phase of data collection I was interested in uncovering as many potentially relevant categories as possible, and was unsure as to which of the emerging concepts would turn out to be theoretically relevant dimensions (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). Although I had anticipated that the research might uncover unknown concepts, and that constant revision and comparison would lead to the demise o f a number o f assumptions derived from theory and from observation, I had not envisioned my encounter with part of the HTV-diagnosed constituency of the 'Dissident Movement'. Until one o f my interviewees turned out to be a so-called 'AIDS dissident' I had never come across any organised scientific movement tiiat challenged the scientific processes involved in establishing the aetiology o f AIDS much less an individual whose identity seemed to have been organised around the reverse scientific discourse on AIDS. It was my own 'fateful' moment in the research process, and one that also required a fundamental restructuring of the investigation I was undertaking. 49 2.2.1.2.- Purposive Sampling The most fundamental change I had to implement once the 'dissident' category had emerged related to the unit o f analysis o f the research. The analysis would now have to be implemented between HIV-infected individuals whose HIV-disease cosmology was significantly different and not, as previously planned, between infected homosexual men and infected heterosexual women. Now if I were to be able to have access to this hidden population o f dissidents another sampling technique, called 'purposive' sampling, was necessary. As such, I purposefully procured persons and sites that would allow me to tap into this hidden populatioiL The sample was thus purposive inasmuch as I actively procured the inclusion o f 'dissidents' as they represented a fundamentally different, and comparatively very rare, process o f identity reconstruction. 2.2.1.3.- Link-Tracing Sampling Link-tracing or chain-referral sampling, also known as 'snowball' sampling, are techniques utilised in order to access 'hard-to-reach', or 'hidden' populations Wald, 1992; 1996). 'Hidden' are characterised by their generally 'covert' behaviour and 'elusive' sampling characteristics (Bell et al, 2003). These populations are often constituted by disenfranchised and disadvantaged social groups, such as young unemployed males, drug users, people with AIDS and other stigmatising conditions such as rare deformative diseases and anorexia, criminals, prostitutes, homeless people, and as my research has uncovered, dissidents. The logic o f using such sampling procedures in my research is 50 supported by the fact that not only are homosexual men difhcult to reach (as the proportion o f 'out' gay men is small in comparison to those 'hidden' populations o f men who have sex with men and who may not be highly gay-identified), but the fact that positive homosexual men constitute an even more indistinct population. The amalgamation o f homosexuality and HIV infection when added to the highly stigmatised anti-establishment posture towards HIV diagnosis embodied by AIDS dissenters yields an almost invisible population. 'Snowball' sampling constitutes a technique for locating research subjects whereby the names of new potential research subjects are referred to the researcher by each respondent. 'Snowball' sampling constitutes an element o f the wider link-tracing methodologies that use the social networks o f identified respondents in order to expand the researcher's possible contacts. The method is also used in order to obtain more data on a particular research question. However, particular combinations o f number of links and/or distinct referral chains allows the researcher to decide whether the generation o f more substantial data about a particular sample or the possibihty o f inferences about a wider hidden population is the focus o f the research. The assumption which underlies these models is that a 'link' exists between the initial sample and others in the same target population (Thomson, 1997; Berg, 1998; Vogt, 1999). To successfully embark on this sampling procedure the researcher must consider the possibility o f hostility and/or 'fatigue' amongst marginalised groups, and how one is meant to tackle it (Moore, 1996). Another advantage o f employing link-tracing methodology in this piece o f exploratory 51 research is that it imbued the researcher with characteristics o f being an 'insider', and allowed for entry into settings that may otherwise have been 'off limit'. Despite the recent trend towards increased sophistication in methods o f error estimation and sampling frame, there are several problems involved in using snowball sampling. Issues concerning the representativeness of the sample constitute one of the main shortcomings o f chain-referral methods because o f the non-random nature o f respondent identification. This was not an issue I was concerned with since the subjects o f my exploratory research constituted subsets o f a 'population whose membership is not readily distinguished or enumerated based on existing knowledge and/or sampling capabilities' (Wiebe, 1990:5). As such, the impossibility o f a n a priori definition o f my sample precluded the consideration of probabilistic sampling. In this situation, sampling, much like coding, emerges through the process o f data collection. Grounded theory studies are concerned with representativeness of concepts, not generalisibUity to population. However, inasmuch as qualitative research is concerned with the validity, the reliabihty, and the apphcability o f its results it also contains a strand o f objectivity (Boyatzis, 1998). What should also be clear is that even quantitative methods can never produce a purely objective study; humans, unlike computers, can never process all information without some degree o f subjectivity. In any event, the nature o f my research question, where subjective processes are fimdamentally imphcated in the reconstruction o f the self, constituted an explanatory situation where qualitative design represented the sqjpropriate choice. My goal was to have access to the hidden populations of dissidents as well as o f HIV-infected gay men in order to explore the experiences o f the marginal 52 groups I was studying. As such, snowball sampling was used in conjunction with the techniques o f theoretical and purposive sampling. The goal o f this complementary sampling strategy was thus to include as many instances o f the units o f sampling and achieve as much density and saturation as practically as possible, 2.2.2.- Sampling Issues 2.2.2.1.- Size o f sample In order to identify potential categories involved in the process of identity reconstruction after an HIV diagnosis I initially conducted sixty-seven interviews: fifty-four homosexual men and thirteen heterosexual women. Although a few more interviews with women would have increased the density o f female interviews, I was satisfied with the level o f saturation I had achieved in the female category. The subset of HIV-positive (non\u00ad dissident) men started producing new categories, and as the relationship between their categories seemed to be well established and validated, I stopped sampling them. As far as the dissident subset I interviewed as many as I could possibly find within the time and accessibility constraints I had to identify this hard(er) to reach population. 2.2.2.2.- Discoverv o f a New Category: changing the Unit o f Analvsis As I explained in earlier sections the discovery o f the category of AIDS Dissent' constituted a turning point in the research process. It was at this point o f my 'field work' that I really understood the dynamism of the interviewing process. The data were not a 53 feebly static collection o f concepts, but a much richer fabric o f different, sometimes disparate, experiences o f embodying an HIV diagnosis. Before the emergence o f the new category o f AIDS dissidence the sample o f the research project had been divided into two subsets: heterosexual HIV-infected women and HTV- positive homosexual men. The logic was that these two subsets would be compared in terms o f how their identities were constructed. Once I came upon the new category the sampling design was modified. Now one subset was comprised o f HIV-infected homosexual men whose cosmology o f HIV/AIDS corresponded to the conventional, allopathic model (orthodox), and the other subset was composed o f HTV-infected individuals whose cosmology o f HIV/AIDS corresponded to that articulated by all or some of the elements o f the Dissident Movement (dissident). O f the eleven individuals who constituted the dissidents only one was a (heterosexual) female, the remaining ten individuals were all male homosexuals. As such, the main criterion for comparison became the HIV/AIDS cosmology inasmuch such disparaging cosmologies coalesced around very distinct identity (re)construction processes. 22.2.3.- Biases Another issue that needs to be considered when implementing a qualitative research project is the fundamental question o f the validity o f the sample, and the consequent quality of the data (Van Meter, 1990). As qualitative samples \u2014 in the case o f my research a combination o f theoretical, purposive, and link-tracing techniques - are not randomly drawn they are likely to be somewhat biased and as such not allow for generalisations. 54 Link-tracing techniques, for example, depend not only on the subjective choice of respondents but also over-emphasise cohesiveness in social networks as they tend to include interrelated individuals (Griffiths et al, 1993). The problem with interrelated networks is that 'isolates' will be overlooked (Van Meter, 1990). The generation of a large sample may partially address the issue of bias in link-tracing techniques. My sampling strategy attempted to create a large sample o f the two subsets. Yet, I only really succeeded in reaching a larger (comparatively) number o f 'orthodox' individuals whereas the identification o f 'dissidents' produced much poorer results (not only because they are hard(er) to reach but because their number is very small). Despite such problems, the complementary methodology o f the research enabled me to not only identify, but also study the lifestyles o f two distinctively marginalised groups with as little bias as was possible for a research project o f this scope and nature. 2.2.2.4.- Additional Dissident Interviews Increasing the number o f dissident interviews from the original nine to eleven was not an easy task. Managing to find the nine initial dissidents had proved to be a difficult enterprise; a hard-to-reach population indeed. However, as in the nine initial dissident interviews only one was female, and since the objective was now to compare between dissidents and non-dissidents in order to increase the homogeneity within the two sub\u00ad samples, and increase validity o f comparison, I asked a particularly important member o f the movement to refer me to another possible male respondent. By then I had gained the trust o f the Dissident Movement's most prominent articulators and o f some o f its 55 members; as such, I was able to generate a couple o f additional interviews through the access not only to the movement's 'gate keeper' but through my own 'knowledge o f insiders' (Groger at al, 1999). Snowball sampling was thus invaluable and showed its efficacy in obtaining respondents when they are few in number, and when the research context requires an element o f trust. However, it should be noted that the small sample of dissident individuals may not approach the theoretical rigour o f theoretical saturation dictated by a GT approach where sampling is exhausted only Wien no additional data is being found. In an ideal scenario I might have been able to locate further dissident respondents in order to exhaust the saturation o f my data; in the context o f this research project saturation ended where plain impossibility started, 2.2.3.- Data Collection 2.2.3.1.- Ethical Issues Prior to the interviewee's participation the research project was hilly explained. Respondents were assured that the interviews would not only be completely confidential, but that if results were ever published names and biographical details would be modified to guarantee anonymity. Respondents were also told that it was their prerogative not to answer any question if they so desired, and that they could terminate the interview at any time. None o f the participants refused or felt they should not answer any particular question. Once the participant was fully aware o f the issues, and indicated that he or she was willing to participate, the interview commenced. 56 2.2.3.2.-Ouestionnaires 2.2.3.2.1.- Questionnaire Themes Based on Literature Review The nature o f the research questions signified that the process o f data collection would touch upon some highly sensitive areas. As such, the data would best be obtained through personal interviews. The method envisaged for data collection was thus semi-structured interviews. The objective o f building a questionnaire at the beginning o f the research process was to ensure that the interview would be centred on topics which might play a fundamental role in the development of identity, and on issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. To avoid the potential 'construction' of data the questionnaire served simply as a general guide to the outline and the structure o f the interview topics, not as a schedule of questions. Hence, I developed a series of open-ended and close ended questions covering the content areas, viiich I had devised from the literature review. Such content areas provided me with a beginning focus to start collecting data. Although the 'passive' approach to interviewing was maintained, interviewees had to be coached towards responding the topics as laid out in the interview guide. However, the initial topics were provisional ones, many o f which were later revised or abandoned whilst new ones emerged (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). The main focus of the research was the interaction between HIV/AIDS and identity. Therefore, the composition o f the interview guide covered the following five areas; identity, sexuality, diagnosis, health, and religion. The final part o f the questionnaire was where the respondent engaged in self-evaluative thinking; the objective here was to bring all the previous elements together and wrap up the interview in terms o f the meaning o f 57 the experience o f disease. The scope o f the interview was allowed to widen if particular relevant areas emerged in individual interviews. 2.2.3.2.2.- Constructing Questions According to Standard Questionnaire Design Procedures Standard questionnaire design procedures were followed (Johnson, 1975; Judd et al, 1991; Kvale, 1996; Silverman, 1997). Issues such as the role o f the wording o f questions, as well as the sequencing of questions from the simplest to the most complex or probing, were taken into consideration so that the data collected would not be influenced by the manner in which questions were asked. 2.2.3.2.3.- Copv o f Questionnaire A copy o f the questionnaire is provided in Appendix A. 2.2.3.3.- Interviews 2.2.3.3.I.- Pilot Interviews Initially I endeavoured to follow the order o f the interview topics as I had laid them out in the questionnaire. However, the first few pilot interviews revealed that the interview situation was best utilised if I allow respondents to talk as freely as possible even if, or most fimdamentally, and perhaps especially if, they deviated from the devised topics. Despite the respondents' fireedom and my passive approach, I was the one guiding the interview. As such, I ensured that in each interview the content areas were always 58 covered. Ultimately the direction o f the exchange was always guided by me; yet, each interview proved to be a different experience with its own rhythm and cadence. Pilot interviews were conducted on individuals who had been located through advertisements in the HIV press, more specifically in the magazine 'Positive Times'. These advertisements yielded a poor response; only three interviewees were located in this manner. These three interviewees were asked to refer me to a couple o f individuals whom they knew to have also received an HIV diagnosis. Another three interviewees were found in this way. The six initial interviews produced a large amount o f data, and some new concepts emerged from studying and comparing the material I had collected. Further advertisements produced no response. 2.2.3.3.2.- The Evolution o f the Interview Process: from Structured to Semi- Structured interviews Despite the plethora o f approaches towards qualitative interviewing, the methodology can be basically classified into three distinct techniques: structured, unstructured, and open- ended (Fontana and Frey, 2000). Interviews can be simply described as 'a conversation between two or more people where one or more o f the participants takes the responsibility for reporting the substance o f what is said' (Powney and Watts, 1984:2). With the objective o f reducing interviewer bias in an encounter that constitutes an interactive and dialectic social relation, general norms on how to tackle the process have been established (Goode and Hatt, 1952; Kalekin-Fishman, 2002, Fielding, 2002). In order to increase reliability and validity in qualitative interviews the researcher is 59 supposed to maintain emotional distance towards the interviewee. The researcher should not reveal any feelings or whatever other standpoints he or she might hold related to the research; and no knowledge should be shared (Goode and Hatt, 1952; Westmorland, 2000). However, such tenets have been questioned not only by feminist approaches to sociology (Oakley, 1981), but also by specific theoretical orientations (Spradley, 1979; Silverman, 1985). In sum, interview techniques have been adapted by interpretivist sociologists and feminist researches to be more participant-fiiendly (Dubois, 1983). Such innovations have been integrated into mainstream sociological research textbooks (Burgess, 1984). Still, no consensual definition o f interviewing exists (Kalekin-Fishman, 2002 ). The principal outcome o f conducting the pilot interviews was the realisation that the data collection process I had designed was not as efficient as it could be. The questionnaire, or interview guide, I had formulated constituted a semi-structured interview o f mostly open- ended questions. The pilot interviews were supposed to have followed a sequential order o f exploration from areas o f a general nature towards more focused and sensitive topics o f inquiry. That was the plan, but the reality was indeed quite different. To follow the questionnaire proved to be wrong; not only was the physical presence of the questionnaire a hindrance to the relaxation o f both the interviewee and I, but also in formulating questions in such a prescribed way the 'distance' between the respondent and the researcher was magnified. The first two pilot interviews felt rigid and artificial. It was clear at that point that I would never elicit the necessary trust relationship that was required in the interview context unless I completely changed not only the way but the 60 manner in which I was asking my questions. Hence, after the first two pilot interviews I decided to adopt a much more unstructured approach to the interviews. For the future dozens o f 'conversational face-to-face interactions', where through in-depth probing I would try to improve knowledge about HIV-centred identities, I adopted an 'unstructured-in-depth' approach. My role as interviewer was to guide the direction o f the respondents' utterances, to allow for an enlargement o f the scope o f the interview when particular relevant areas were revealed, and to probe revealing categories that were emerging from the data (Wengraf, 2001). Below I describe the process in further detail. 2.2.3.3.3.- The New Category: how it emerged Almost half-way through the data collection process I came upon an individual whose HIV/AIDS cosmology was of a very different nature from the ones I had so far encountered. Some conceptual categories were emerging from the data, but nothing as radical as that had surfaced. Here was an HTV-infected individual whose belief system ran drastically counter to the conventional medical wisdom on AIDS, and the biosocial processes that are deemed to cause it. He had been referred by a previous interviewee, an ex-lover. This individual identified himself as an AIDS dissident, and organised his identity very much around the existence of a scientific critique o f the science surrounding AIDS. At this point, after analysing our long interview, I realised that if there was a community o f such people then they certainly constituted a very significant group. Numerically they might be relatively small but in terms o f enriching the understanding of 61 identity construction and HIV diagnosis they could be very significant indeed.^^ These HIV-infected individuals constructed their post-diagnosis identities in what appeared to be a radically recalcitrant, maybe revolutionary, context. Not only did this discovery change my sampling design but it also fundamentally changed the prism through which my data would be analysed. 2.2.3.3.4.- 'D oing' the Interview The nature o f my research required that a considerable amount o f trust developed between my respondents and I if I really wanted to obtain revealing and sincere responses from them. This was true with both sampling subsets but especially with the dissidents; the great majority o f the latter were obtained through an initial contact with the movement's most prestigious 'gatekeeper' in Britain. With positive women, a 'fatigued' group, I was not as lucky (Moore, 1996). Perhaps the fact that the researcher is himself a gay man, and the fact that positive women may feel neglected in a health crisis that in the West has been appropriated by gay men, in this case constituted not an advantage but a hindrance. After ethical issues had been explained and confidentiality assured the interview commenced. The method o f empirical data collection was audio-recorded 'lightly- structured in-depth' interviews (Wengraf, 2002). In the unstructured format the researcher had chosen for the interviews some kind o f rapport-establishment was procured before the actual 'interview' started (even if my tape recorder was turned on as This dissident community is a loosely organised network of individuals mainly connected through publications that spans the principal swath of the Anglo-Saxon world (United States, United Kingdom, and 62 soon as it could be done without offending the interviewee). As such, 'interviewer' questions, rather than 'theoretical' ones, would be asked and an informal, relaxed atmosphere hopefully created. As such, and quite often, especially if the context o f the interview was the respondent's home, the dialogical interaction flowed in a very organic manner without any distinction from the initial 'chatting' and the 'interview' per se. Usually respondents talked at length about their situation, their views on their situation, and all the social processes their situation had engendered In preparing for an interview the researcher took into consideration issues of 'presentation' (which clothes I wore). Another important consideration was the importance o f trying to attune to the respondent's general cultural factors (ethnicity, age, social class, for example). An interview with a middle-aged orthodox solicitor requires a different set o f sociolinguistic postures than does an interview with a thirty-something unemployed orthodox man who deals drugs. Also fundamental was to know which 'language' to use depending on to which sampling subset did a respondent belong: interviewing 'dissidents' required a complete set o f new knowledge(s) inasmuch as their conception o f HIV/AIDS was based on the tenets o f the Dissident Movement (Spradley, 1979). These procedures were followed in order to assure that the rapport the researcher developed with the respondents was substantial. The interviewing process took almost two years from m id-1997 to 1999. A typical interview lasted about ninety minutes; some lasted longer some were shorter. The longest interview lasted approximately three hours, and the quickest about one hour. After the Australia). 63 interview was finished and 1 had departed from the interview context I made comments into a small tape recorder (a dictaphone); these comments constituted my field notes. A significant percentage o f the interviews were conducted in interviewees' homes, many were conducted within the premises o f the institutions o f the HIV- service industry, a small number in bars and pubs, and one was conducted in a hospice. If interviews were conducted in public places without privacy the researcher made sure that there were no other individuals within the hearing range o f the interview. The geographical scope o f my sample extended from the centre o f London to its outer edges. The interviews explored emotive and deeply personal topics; not surprisingly some o f the respondents became occasionally distressed and tearful. Many interviews constituted open, frank, even emotionally saturated interactions. A number o f sociological theorists disagree with the (increasingly challenged notion) that for research to be objective the researcher can not in anyway be involved in the subject o f his/her research interview. I, as the researcher, agree to disagree. My respondents were aware o f the fact that I am a gay man, and as such have also been affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis even if not in a life-threatening way. Had I maintained an artificially distant posture my interviews would not have been more objective, they would have elicited poorer data. Proximity and equality towards the interviewees, especially in research projects that deal with deeply personal matters, can only yield richer, more significant data (Oakley, 1981; Finch, 1984; Greed, 1990). 64 2,2.3.4.- Method of Transcription 2.2.3.4.1.- Issues o f Transcription The most important factor to take into consideration regarding the transcription o f the data is which CAQDAS (computer assisted qualitative data analysis software) is going to be used in the analysis. Such a decision should be taken in the early stages of methodology design so that consistent transcription that is in accordance with the specific requirements o f the software is performed. In order to maximise the management o f my research data, I employed the computer package QSR NUDIST (Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing). NUDIST enables one to make connections between codes, develop categories, formulate and test propositions concerning the data, and engage in interactive enquiry through processes o f system closure. I decided on NUDIST because the objective o f data analysis through NUDIST was to develop categories and to organise the large amount o f data that had been collected. I wanted to have as much flexibility as possible in my capability for coding and retrieving, as I needed the fireedom to reorganise conceptual categories. As such, NUDIST4 functioned as a tool in helping the management o f the data as well as the creation and exploration of provisional categories in the earlier stages o f theory building and data analysis (http://www.qsr.com.au). Coding was an essential part in the process o f analysing and thinking about the data as it provided the 'link between data and conceptualisation* (Bryman and Burgess, 1994:5). Concepts 'are the basic unit o f analysis in the grounded theory method'; thus, coding was the first step I undertook in order to understand the data that began to emerge (Strauss 65 and Corbin, 1990:63). Although I had an initial scheme o f concepts and categories derived from the literature and observation, which was informed by some theoretical insight into the field of identity as well as in terms of HIV as a social and bio-physical problem, new categories began to emerge as soon as I went into the field. Categories are classifications of concepts that are derived from comparing concepts to one another; when they appear to pertain to a similar phenomenon concepts are grounded together under the more abstract notion of category. The conceptual framework was often rethought and modified after encountering a new piece o f information or after an interviewee described a new account o f how he or she developed coping strategies in order to deal with HIV/AIDS. In choosing the program, I took into consideration that my data were going to be collected through individual, in-depth interviews; that it would be collected from one source only (the interviewees); and that it wouldn't be strictly organised but 'free-form' (i.e. unstructured interviews and field notes). NUDIST was, however, not the only CAQDAS I used in order to analyse the data. Several authors have discussed a multitude of methods to analyse respondents' talk about their experiences Mahrer, 1998). 'Thematic Analysis' constitutes one such method; one that focuses on the exploration and analysis of the identifiable themes and patterns that emerge from the interviews (Taylor and Bodgan, 1984; Benner, 1985; Leininger, 1985; Boyatzis, 1988). The f the new sampling unit occasioned the rethinking o f the analysis process. The strategy hence became to focus on the richness of the content of identity restructure processes that could be yielded from conducting thematic analysis on five dissident and five orthodox 66 interviews. The goal of honing in on ten interviews was to explain 'how different ideas or components fit together in a meaningful way when linked together' (Leininger, 1985: 60). As such, it was decided that the CAQDAS better suited to the task was HAMLET (http://www.soton.ac.uk/~apb/hamlet95.pdf), which is available for no cost on the Internet. The pragmatic process of thematic analysis starts with data collection, followed by the identification of patterns and then the identification and ascription of all data to the patterns that have been recognised. Transcription guidelines differ from NUDIST to HAMLET particularly in what concerns the conventions through which chunks of data can be made c o d e a b l e . 2 5 As a result, I had to go back to original word processed transcripts to adjust the coding conventions to the requirements of HAMLET and prepare the ten interviews for thematic analysis. Once the modifications had been made the next step was to combine the patterns into themes and sub-themes so that a clear and comprehensive panorama of the respondents' experience could be drawn. The 'drawing of the panorama' constituted the theory-building sage of the research and will be described in chapter seven. 2.2.3.4.2.- Process of Transcription Transcription constituted a long, arduous process. I personally transcribed all the interviews through listening and re-listening to each recorded tape. On average an interview occupied two double-sided sets of one-hour cassette tapes. Each thirty minute For example, in QSR NUDIST the 'text unit', i.e., the codable 'chunk' is defined by the hard return. As such, line breaks of the 'save as text' option result in text units that correspond to the lines of the text; for variable codable segments hard returns can be inserted, as the researches sees fit, in order to reflect contextual brakes. In HAMLET codable chunks can be words (fixed context units, collocation within a span), characters (variable contexts) or sentences (as normally punctuated). For this research project the 67 side took anything from ninety to one-hundred-and-twenty minutes to transcribe. The speed o f the transcription depended on the speed o f the respondent's speech, its clarity, the quality o f the recording, the amount o f words included in the respondent's utterances, and the interference o f background noise in the recording. At the end o f the data collection process I had seven-hundred pages of single-spaced transcript. 2.2.3.4.3.- Description o f Transcripts In this section my objective is to home in on the ten transcripts that were used for thematic analysis, and provide a lexical description of each file. The tables below indicate the size of the files, their word counts, their type/token ratios, as well as the distinction between interviewer and interviewee's word counts for each file. Type/token ratios indicate the complexity o f an interview by dividing the number of unique words identified in the transcript by the number o f its total words (Popping, 2000). The word counts of both interviewer and interviewee specify the total number o f words uttered by each. The specification o f separate files for words uttered solely by interviewees reduces potential biases that might be present if the interviewers' words were also included when text analysis is performed codable chunks in QSR NUDIST were line brakes, and in HAMLET sentences as normally punctuated (Wiich in practice meant respondents* uninterrupted utterances). 68 Orthodox Transcripts Size o f File Word countType/Token RatioInterviewees word countInterviewer word count Interview 1 109 kb 10184 0.176 9437 747 Interview 2 129 kb 13518 787 Interview 3 100 kb 9392 Interview 4 0.147 9101 Transcripts Size o f File Word Count Type/Token RatioInterviewees word countInterviewer word count Interview 1 88 kb 7931 673 Interview 2 88 kb Interview 3 84 kb 9433 Interview 4 74 kb A.- Example of Full Transcription See Appendix B. 2.3.- Description of Sample 2.3.1.- Recruitment Methods 2.3.1.1.- Recruiting: where and how to get a hold of the hard-to-reach samples The subjects o f the research project epitomise the notion o f 'hard to reach' populations. Their stigma is multifaceted and compounded: they are homosexual; they are infected with the HTV virus; and some o f them, to top it off, have adopted a marginalised ideological position. During the pilot phase of the research advertisements recruiting participants were placed in 'Positive Times', but only three respondents were located in this way. Further advertisements in 'Positive Times' produced nil results, as did a number o f notices posted in the HTV clinics o f Ealing, St. Mary's and St. Barth's hospitals in London. Consequently, in order to recruit HIV-positive individuals, who subscribe to the biomedical model I mainly relied on the institutions o f the AIDS service industry. The AIDS service industry can be defined as 'the private-sector non-profit organisations devoted exclusively to AIDS work.' Although the idea o f an 'industry' runs the risk o f over-generalising and over-simplifying particular differences, these institutions do assume similar policy directives and reproduce material conditions 'that construct AIDS 70 as a particular kind o f problem and legitimate only a limited set of solutions and administrative structures' (Patton, 1990:13-14). As these institutions are elemental in reproducing the biomedical model of HIV/AIDS they were used in order to locate HIV- positive individuals likely to have embraced the biomedical model o f HIV/AIDS. I worked closely with two major statutory institutions of the local HTV/AIDS service industry: the 'Globe Centre' in East London and 'Body Positive' in West London, Both institutions provide legal advice as well as social, moral and emotional support and free access to alternative and complementary therapies to HIV-infected men and women. In order to access the orthodox subset 'gate keeper' figures o f the 'Globe Centre' in East London and o f 'Body Positive' in West London were fundamental. The researcher established a trusting relationship with one key figure in each institution, each the main 'gate keeper' o f their constituency and through their assistance was able to locate a significant amount o f respondents. Individuals who are regular attendees o f AIDS service institutions are likely to represent a specific constituency of highly-gay-identified HIV-infected men. As such they constitute the 'tip o f the iceberg' o f a much bigger infected population 'lurching' underneath. My sample was thus biased inasmuch as the great majority o f 'orthodox' respondents were found in this way. Advertising in the HTV press as well as link-tracing techniques were implemented in order to increase the representativeness of the sample. However, recruitment through advertising yielded very low response levels and although the link-tracing technique produced comparatively better results, most o f the respondents found in this manner were recruited through interviews which originated in the 71 institutions o f the AIDS service industry. Nevertheless, the link-tracing technique did lead the research to the dissident subset as the referees were specifically asked to refer other HTV-infected individuals whom they knew firom contexts other than the service industry (such as sexual partners, friends, or colleagues). The journal 'Continuum' constitutes the main forum o f the 'Dissident Movement' in the U.K. The publication appears four times a year and has approximately four-hundred-and- fifty subscribers in the UK. 'Continuum' serves as a focal point for dissidents to articulate their unconventional ideas. 'Continuum' also organises the so-called 'occasional meetings' that serve as a focal point for dissidents to meet and derive some support fix)m each other. Similarly to the institutions o f the AIDS service industry; 'Continuum' is fundamental in the production and maintenance o f 'dissident' identities. Accessing the dissident subset was only possible through the relationship 1 established with one of the journal's most respected figures. After the mutuMly trusting coimection had been established with this individual 1 was granted easy access into the group's meetings; 1 was allowed access to all their information and publications; and was introduced or referred to a number o f dissident-identified individuals. Except for the interviewee who introduced me to the dissident category, all other dissident individuals in my sample were recruited via 'Continuum'. The recruitment was implemented through personal communications with the staff of 'Continuum' as well as through the occasioiml meetings 1 was allowed to attend. The magazine provided me with firee advertising space to recruit interviewees, but these advertisements, vdiich ran in three subsequent volumes, produced no response. As such, although the representativeness o f my sample would 72 have definitely benefited firom a larger sample I was unable to locate any more respondents. 2.3.2.- General Demographics of Interviews 2.3.2.1.- Demographics o f NUDIST IntervieAvs This section provides some basic demographics about the whole sample in terms of gender, ethnicity, educational level, employment, welfare benefits, and religious affiliation.^^ Gender No. o f Individuals Male 54 Female 13 Ethnicity No. o f Individuals White 58 Other 9 Many respondents refused to claim welfare benefits even if they would have been entitled to them.

In terms of symptoms of HIV disease the respondents were classified according to their own accounts o f what symptoms or diseases associated with HIV they had experienced.^^ Asymptomatics were defined as those who presented no symptoms of HIV disease. Mildly symptomatic respondents were classified as those who presented the relatively minor ailments usually associated with HIV disease. Severely symptomatic respondents comprised those who had been diagnosed with opportunistic infections (OI) and as such had also been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. The category of asymptomatic could be over reported as some of the respondents who claimed mild symptoms, or AJLC. (AIDS-related-complex), could have underplayed their condition in the same way that a number of respondents who had been diagnosed with an OI told me that they preferred to refer to themselves as 'positive' rather than as having an AIDS diagnosis. For a fuller discussion on issues of what defines an AIDS diagnosis, refer to chapter six. 75 Symptomatology No. o f Individuals Asymptomatic 11 Mild Symptoms 13 AIDS 43 Symptomatology was fiirther classified in relation to HlV-identity.

The selection process o f these interviews was based on their richness o f content (not representativeness) inasmuch as if taken on a whole they contained all the categories which were deemed relevant in the construction o f identity after an HIV diagnosis. Three other factors were taken into consideration. Firstly, as there was only one female dissident in the dissident subset, female interviews were not considered for thematic analysis so that comparison criteria would not be influenced by gender. Secondly, I decided on orthodox interviews from the later stage o f the interview process as they contained data on orthodox perception o f the Dissident Movement. Thirdly, all orthodox thematic analysis interviews are o f individuals who present (mild or strong) symptoms, whereas in the dissident subset one o f the interviews is of an individual \\dio claims to be asymptomatic. My logic was to analyse interviews of individuals who have experienced some level o f disease, not just a diagnosis o f infection, as the process o f identity reconstruction in such cases is more likely to have been fully 77 undertaken. In the dissident subset I included an asymptomatic individual since only five o f the respondents had developed symptoms, one o f which was the female interviewee.

Quantitative and qualitative research, recent additions to the many dimensions that compose the 79 contemporary ^reality' o f (social) life, are hrnnanly constructed analytical tools concerned with understanding the 'social reality' o f which they (both humans and social science) are part. Whether research is conducted from a positivistic or constructivist perspective it is bound to be influenced by the values o f its perpetrators. As long as social research continues to be implemented by social beings, the human hictor and its corresponding biases will remain present. However, the collateral consequences o f the human factor in social research can be amehorated through the increasing range o f competent technical subterfuges that the social sciences, in their positivistic search for the achievement o f objectivity in its purest form, continue to develop. As such, even if research is 'not a clear cut sequence o f procedures following a neat pattern, but a messy interaction between the conceptual and empirical world, deduction and induction occurring at the same time' (Bechhofer, 1974:73), it can and ought to be sanitized. The official discourse o f the patriarchal society characteristic of modernity, which under the grasp o f 'masculine' utopias founded on the myth o f the unbounded potential of science, framed the birth and development of social science in the nineteenth century. As such, the positivistic stance o f social research was occasioned by the socio-historical background o f the era in which it emerged. Social science was biased at birth. As the modem gave way to the post-modern (or late-modem) new values began to surface, and new techniques for interpreting reality appeared. 'Deconstmctive' analysis, for example, a post-modern technique primarily employed in literary analysis demonstrated how Pythagorean-originated dichotomies have permeated the construction o f (male) knowledge o f nature as the (female) object o f knowledge (Lloyd, 1984). It has been 80 argued that the positivistic approach is thus incompatible with the emerging post-modern paradigm (Graham, 1983; Mies, 1983). However, history shows us that the lessons o f the past should never be ignored even as one constantly adapts to the ever-changing, ever- moving present. Changing times require the integration o f new and traditional forms of knowledge and knowledge production. The potential complementarity o f the traditionally antagonistic paradigms o f positivism and constructionism should be recognised, and their amalgamation promoted. As such, a new ontology that accommodates both traditions, what some are already calling 'Constructivist Realism', will be able to successfully take social research into the new century (Cupchil^ 2001). 81 C hapter 3: The Homosexual Body through History: Representation, C ontainm ent and Resistance I caught myself foolishly imagining that gays might some day constitute a community rather than a diagnosis (Edmund White, 1988) 3.1.- Ancient Homosexual Histories 3.1.1.- Pre-Historic Homosexualitv LaBarre (1984) has suggested that homosexuality can be traced all the way back to the Palaeolithic Age (500.000 - 10.000 BC).^* According to this view, our Old Stone Age ancestors believed that semen carried the life force. The brain, which produced the \u00e9lan vital, dispatched it to the testes via the spinal cord. The qualities o f virility, courage, and prowess were thought to be contained in semen. As such, cannibalism, headhunting, and ritual pederasty were the practices that allowed the acquisition o f masculinity. Such theory may be supported by the well-known Palaeolithic ritual practice o f extracting the brain from the head. However, most anthropological research regards cannibalism, and headhunting, as practices devoid o f any symbolism: the goal was simply to eat (Greenberg, 1988). 82 3.1.2.- Classical Homosexualitv In the ancient world homosexual behaviour was a widely diffused practice, which was enacted according to strictly defined norms. Homosexuality was mainly organised around two principal axes: the 'transgenerational', which was characterised by the older partner assuming the masculine (active) role; and the 'transgenderal% whereby one o f the partners assumed the gender associated with the opposite sex. The former was most famously rampant in classical Greece, but it can still be found today in indigenous populations o f Brazil and New Guinea. The latter was quintessentially exemplified by the 'berdache'. The 'berdache', the native-American male or (less frequently female) individual who laid claim to the gender o f the opposite sex, entered into sexual relations with members o f his (or hers) own biological sex. 'Transgenderal' homosexuality, which is often associated with shamanism, has also been documented between Central and South American Indians, in parts o f the East Indies, Africa, Siberia, Vietnam, Burma, India, Korea, the Nepal Himalayas, and among the Maori in New Zealand. Also in the ancient civilisations o f Central and South America was homosexual behaviour widespread. Archaeological evidence has shown that institutionalised homosexual roles existed in the societies o f the Incas, the Mayans, and o f the Aztecs (Greenberg, 1988).29 Despite the regularity of homosexuality in classical Greece, there were no words to denote homosexual (or heterosexual) individuals (Greenberg, 1988). The great Greek Several Stone Age depictions of sexual relations between males have been found (Greenberg, 1988). The missionaiy Father Pierre de Gand reported that sodomy, involving children as young as six, was universal among the Aztecs (Greenberg, 1988:163-165). 83 philosopher Plato, who was bom in Athens around 427 BC, together with his disciple Aristotle (384-322 BC), 'laid the foundations o f most branches o f speculative and natural philosophy' (Davies, 1997:110). Plato wrote a series of 'dialogues' in vdiich he critically analysed philosophical ideas, and discussed the issue of homosexuality. In Lysis, Phaedrus, and Symposium, Plato discussed homosexual love as a force both educative and aesthetic. In Symposium the general ambisexuality o f classical Greeks was explained. In classical Greece homosexual love was represented as an elevated kind o f love. Its customary social pattern involved a teenager boy, or a younger man (known in Greek as the eromenos, or 'beloved'), \\riio was pursued by an older man (an erastes, or 'lover'). The homosexual relationship o f the ancient Greeks was comparable to the heterosexual norm in which the man assumes the dominant role. The younger male would yield only after a period o f courtship. Women were completely excluded from public life, and spent most o f their lives within the confines o f the 'female' parts o f the household. As such, boys and young men constituted the only possibility for objectification in classical Alhens. Despite their sexual nature, the main point o f such homosexual liaisons was their educative fimction. Not unlike the pederasts o f the Stone Age, the erastes impregnated the eromenos with the masculine virtues o f courage and honour. As soon as the eromenos reached maturity the relationship ought to become platonic (Jowett, 1991). However, homosexual liaisons between adults did take place even if they were less conunon, and were not severely stigmatised (Greenberg, 1988). Only after Athens became a republic was there a shift in the attitudes concerning such relationships. Plato's fiiend Socrates, 'the best erastes (lover) o f all', was executed on charges o f corrupting Athenian youth. A 84 disillusioned Plato left Athens, and only returned in 387 BC when he founded the Academy 1991). Despite the educational fimction o f homosexual relationships in classical Greece, the archetypal homosexual liaison o f antiquity was that o f class-structured master-slave relations, and prostitution. Greece herself was a slave-owning society where social status determined sexual activity. Such unequal relations were neither defined by the kind o f sexual practices exchanged nor by the age or gender o f the partners. Feelings and mutuality did not have to be taken into account: 'satisfection was mainly associated with the phallic pleasure o f the active male who imposed himself and his organ on its passive recipients.' Sexual power stemmed from a superior economic position, and men o f superior status 'ofren took it for granted that they could penetrate their inferiors at will; and inferiors included women, boys, servants, and foreigners' (Davies, 1997:126). Whatever its conceptualisation, the fact is that homosexuality was widely and permissively practiced amongst our classical ancestors. As the writer Diodorus Siculus wrote in the first century BC: (Celtic) men are much keener on their own sex; they lie around on animal skins and enjoy themselves, with a lover on each side...this isn't looked down on, or regarded as in any way disgraceful: on the contraiy, if one of them is rejected by another to whom he has offered himself, he takes offence (Diodcmis Siculus, and the Bcgiiming of Christianity Ancient Mediterranean life was fundamentally transformed by the development o f large cities, which became important administrative and religious hubs. Increased urbanisation disturbed the plausibility o f polytheistic religions centred around agricultural and fertility \u00dciemes. As such, the religious woridview o f Antiquity began to shift as the pagan polytheism o f moral and amoral deities was juxtaposed to the emerging dualistic notions o f good and evil. In addition, imperial expansion fostered a religious syncretism whose trans-national and monotheistic character undermined the basis that had supported the nmgic associated with cultic homosexuality. Political life also changed as a result of increased urbanisation, which demanded an amplification o f the governmental apparatus. Such developments limited the scope for popular participation in public affairs, and provoked a feeling o f alienation among the lower classes. Plato, who had earlier praised homosexual love, in his later * dialogues* changed his mind. His new opinion reflected the changes in the material conditions and symbolic systems o f classical society, Plato's ideal pursuits were Truth, Good, and Beauty; he was critical of lustful behaviour and surrender to animalistic passion. Although lust was not exclusive to the relationships o f the erastes- eromenos, Plato considered them more likely to succumb to it. In his last work. Laws, Plato concluded that sex should be procreative and limited to spouses. However, and although Plato came to refer to homosexuality as contrary to nature, he never considered it abnormal (Greenberg, 1988).^\u00ae Para Phusin was the term employed by Plato to denote the ^unnatural' character of homosexuality, but Boswell (1980) has noted that phusis had other meanings. Such a radical change in Plato's thinking is perplexing since until his final woik he had conceptualised sexual desire as almost exclusively homosexual. \u00ab6 It is within such a context of rapid social change that Christianity evolved from its roots within the Judaism o f Roman-occupied Palestine into a distinct religion. Early Christian writings and canon law were unquestionably disapproving of the 'paidiophthoros', or the erastes o f Athens. In the Old Testament God's law certainly condemned them to death. However, although in the New Testament they are 'denounced as transgressors of the natural order', interpretations o f several New Testament passages thought to refer to homosexuality remain open to question (Bailey, 1955:215).^^ In any event, by the latter part o f the first millennium Rome was the new Empire, and the Middle Ages had mostly superseded classical Antiquity. Despite the entitlement o f the Crown, in the emerging era the Church exercised d e jurisdiction over individuals who engaged in homosexual behaviour. Church functionaries of the Middle Ages may have been 'aware of the complexity of sexual behaviour and the difficulty o f assessing the morality o f sexual acts'. Still, the verdict was ultimately untouched: homosexual acts constituted 'peccata contra naturam'. Their enactment was a mortal sin (Bailey, 1955:154). Roman law, specifically the codifications of Theodosius and of Justinian, has profoundly influenced ecclesiastical canon law, and European systems of civil and criminal jurisprudence. As a result of C. Scantinus Capitolinus' conviction by the Senate in 226 Boswell (1980) suggests that what Plato meant was not 'unnatural* in the sense of contravention of some moral law, but in the sense of 'unrelated to birth' or 'non-procreative'. ^ 1 For example, in the first Epistle to Timothy the term arsenokotai is usually understood to refer to male homosexuality (Bailey, 1955; Scroogs, 1983). However, as Greek literature constantly referred to homosexuality, and since never once before had such a term been employed to denote it, it has been argued that the term might not at all refer to homosexuality (Boswell, 1980). 87 BC, 'Lex Scantinia' was passedP^ 'Lex Scantima' penalised homosexual acts, but scarce evidence exists o f actual punishment of such acts during the time o f the Republic, The next undisputed evidence o f legal measures against homosexuahty refers to the much later period o f Emperor Severus Alexander, in the beginning o f the third century AD, when male homosexual prostitution flourished in the Italian peninsula. Once Christianity had become the religion o f the Roman Empire, four edicts against homosexuality were instituted. The edicts of 538 and 544 claimed scriptural evidence to conclude that homosexual acts endangered the state inasmuch as the wrath o f God - in the form o f earthquake, famine, and pestilence - may be provoked. Yet, the 'sinners' themselves were not condemned, and the Emperor Justinian urged them to salvation through penitence. Although Justinian has been characterised as the most venomous of a series of Christian Emperors engaged in a crusade against homosexuality, he was in reality the only one who preoccupied himself with the salvation (as well as the punishment) of the oBenders. Justinian, however, was pivotal in shaping western Christian attitudes towards homosexuality. In appealing to the fate o f Sodom and Gomorra in his codification o f the law, Justinian inaugurated the deployment o f the 'reinterpreted' tale for legal measures against homosexuahty (Bailey, 1955).^^ Capitolinus was convicted of homosexual behaviour. However, it is unclear how 'Lex Scantinia came to pass (Bailey, 1955:64). The earthquakes and floods that devastated the eastern cities of Edessa, Anazarba, and Pompeiopolis in the East, as well as of Corinth and Dyrrachium in Europe in 525, are likely to have influenced die Emperor in his evocation of Sodoma in the edict 538. The plague that swept over Constantinople in 543 was certainly a factor in the edict of 544 (Bailey, 1955). The 'reinterpretation' of the story of Sodom and Gomorra is dealt with in chapter five. 88 3.1.4.- Homosexualitv in the Middle Ages The concept o f 'sodomy' arose in the Middle Ages. According to medieval theology, sodomy constituted 'the exact reversal o f the lawful way o f having sex.' Despite the multitude o f meanings applied to the concept, ranging from the specific act o f anal penetration to any waste o f semen, its core significance implied the impossibility of procreation (Hekma, 1989:433). The 'sodomite', who was not necessarily an exclusive homosexual, obtained sexual pleasure from the 'catamite', whom received gifts as valuable as positions in public office in exchange for his favours (Murray, 1989:469). Sodomites abounded during the Middle Ages. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, 'what might be called a gay subculture...a body o f gay literature o f the proportion and types... (which) had not been seen in Europe since the first century AD and would not be encountered again until the nineteenth', had been established.^\"* This medieval subculture did not reproduce classical models of homosexuality; it presented new forms of homosexual liaisons.^ ^ Its members, who developed a distinct argot, referred to themselves as 'Ganymede'. The medieval term, by alluding to Greek mythology, and by invoking notions o f cultural and personal superiority, is deemed to have attenuated the negative connotations associated with the 'sodomite' label (Boswel, 1980:243:251).^^ The application of the sociological concept of 'subculture' to medieval urban homosexual life is problematic. It has been argued that not only the argot of urban medieval homosexuals was not exclusively restricted to them, but also that if there was a subculture it was one based on die marginality of its membo^ (gamblers, prostitutes, drunkards, and sodomites) and not on their sexual preference (Greenberg 1988; Johansson, 1984). Most of the homophile poetry of the twelfth century expressed an innovation in homoerotic desire: that of religious functionaries (Boswell, 1980). According to Boswell (1980:251), Ganymede 'was the beautiful son of the king of Troy who was carried off by Jove to be a cupbearer in heaven'; the term is diought to represent die medieval counterpart of the contemporary gay. 89 In the twelfth and thirteenth century a renewed hostility towards homosexuality took place. Homosexuality began to be associated with religious dissident, heresy, and Islam. Although the Church was cautious in its response to the increasing animosity towards homosexual behaviour, by the year 1300 the relatively tolerant climate o f the previous two hundred years had been shattered. Repression o f homosexuality during this period is thought to have resulted from ecclesiastical efforts to establish sacerdotal celibacy, and from an augmenting morality suspicious of the luxury and excessive life-styles of the upper castes o f medieval society. By the end o f the thirteenth century the homophile literature of the previous three centuries, and the 'subculture' which had fostered it, had completely disappeared. The formidable dread o f homosexuality is evident in the secular and canonical laws, in the literature, and in the philosophy o f the late Middle Ages. More importantly, opposition to homosexuality ceased to be a critique o f a larger social element and became a condemnation o f individual sinners (Greenberg, 1988). After the death o f Todros Abulafia, the last Jewish homophile poet, in 1287 the voice of Europe's homosexual minority was stilled, not to be heard again for centuries, and not until the present century with the variety and profusion of the eleventh and twelfth (Boswell, 1980266) Yet, homosexuality did not disappear altogether; there is evidence o f urban social networks that continued to facilitate homosexual transactions (Hekma, 1989). 3.2.- Modem Homosexualitv 90 3.2.1.- Homosexuality in Early Modem Europe The study o f the history o f classical antiquity framed the understandings o f homoeroticism o f the early modem period. During the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries classical explanations o f Eros were redefined; (sexual) love in the context of heterosocial liaisons came to be understood as platonic love (Hekma, 1989). In the eighteenth century, however, Europe was shaken by the greatest cultural movement o f the early modem period.^^ As the Enlightenment rose, and impacted all areas of European life and culture, conceptualisations o f homosexual behaviour were also rethought in terms o f the movement's liberal ideas.^* The 'philosophes' pondered over 'Socratic love', or the 'crime o f nature'.^^ Its causes were deemed to be the shortage and inaccessibility o f women, and the widespread corruption of morals. The enlightened thinkers were unanimous in their opposition to the Judeo-Christian views on sodomy, and disapproved o f the barbarian death that might await its perpetrators.\"^^ Yet, their unanimity also extended to the condemnation o f homosexuality; 'prevention' was proposed as the best It is undeniable that Montesquieu (1689-1755), Voltaire (1694-1778), and Rousseau (1712-1778) - the 'trinity' of French writers known as the 'philosophes' - constituted the formative influence of the movement However, the enlightenment extended well beyond France. There was the enlightenment of the German-speaking world; there were the Scottish philosophers, notably David Hume (1711-76) and Adam Smith (1723-90); Galiani (1728-87), and Beccaria (1738-94). Moreover, many other names could be added to this list, and the geographical scope broadened to encompass Russia, the Habsburg Empire, Scandinavia and the Iberian peninsula (Munck, 2000). These liberal ideas were concerned with the development of a 'science of man'. The 'science of man' constitutes what we now call 'psychology, religion and ethics, parts of jurisprudence, sociology, political science, political economy, history and economics, together with the theoretical and philosophical basis for each of these areas (Munck, 2000:14). 'Socratic love' and the 'crime of nature' were terms employed by Voltaire and Montesquieu, respectively, to denote homosexual behaviour. Although several hundred executions of sodomites have been uncovered in Venice, Paris, London, and the Spanish cities after the colonisation of America, they do not justify the claims of 'gay genocide' invoked by some historians (Hekma, 1989). 91 strategy against it.^^ The relatively unknown Dutch Enlightenment philosopher A. Perrenot, for example, suggested a 'closely watched civil household' in order to halt homoerotic behaviour. By the eighteenth century the conceptualisation of sodomy, and the self-conceptualisations o f the sodomites, had undergone a fundamental change (Hekma, 1989:433). By the turn o f the nineteenth century three philosophical approaches towards homosexuality co-existed: the moral theology of sodomy, the enlightened vision, and the cultural history o f male Eros. Materially, homosexuality manifested itself in the self- aware sodomite subcultures o f the great cities of Western Europe. These had existed since the 1700s when the economic climate o f Mercantilism first spawned the appearance o f the 'coffeehouse culture' in England. By the beginning o f the 1800s, the coffeehouse had become an English institution catering for the specialised tastes o f different clienteles. The 'molly-house' - an offehoot o f coffeehouse culture - catered for those Elizabethan males interested not only in buggery but also in effeminate b e h a v i o u r . ^ 2 MoUy-houses fostered tiie emergence o f a 'new social role based on the fusion o f gender transformation and homosexuality', and changed medieval and Renaissance conceptions o f homosexuality not yet directly linked to effeminacy The beginning o f the shift firom ^1 D.A.F. Marquis de Sade (1740-1814), the libertine Enlightenment writer, was the most important exception to enlightened philosophical blinking on homosexuality. In 1772 he was sentenced to death for sodomising his male servant, and for (mistakenly) poisoning prostitutes with a supposed aphrodisiac. He was set free, however, soon after the French Revolution in 1790. His work. Philosophy in the Boudoir published in 1795, was one of the most fervent ^jologies not only for sodomy, but also for any oftier form of stigmatised sexual behaviour. For Sade there was no rational basis for the argument that any kind of sexual practice was against nature (Hekma, 1989). Not all 'Mollys' adopted feminine behaviour (Murray, 1989). Effeminacy had been previously associated with homosexuality in the context of the vices of the aristocracy (Greenbeig, 1988). 92 the medieval conception o f sodomy as a sinful act to that o f homosexuality as the property o f a distinct kind o f human being can be traced to the coalescence o f the new gender-bending identities of the Enghsh molly-houses (Greenberg, 1988). Yet, medieval notions o f 'purposive sex' lingered in the redefinitions o f homosexuality o f the nineteenth century, and shaped its subsequent conceptualisation as derangement or sickness (Weeks, 1990). 3.2.2.- The Criminalisation of Homosexualitv in England and Wales During the nineteenth century the laissez-faire doctrines o f Adam Smith and other classical economists were widely disseminated. These economic theories advocated as little government interference with the economic system as possible, and defended the fireedom o f all individuals to enter into any contractual agreements they desired. A corollary o f laissez-faire ideology was that individual fi:eedom could not only apply to the commercial sphere but should naturally extend to the personal level. Sodomites, a diverse group collapsed under the 'portmanteau' label, were quick to realise the potentiahties o f laissez-faire doctrines (Weeks, 1990).^ The French Penal Code o f 1791 had pioneered the recognition o f the logical extension o f the economic doctrine to bodily matters. As such, the Napoleonic Code paved the ground for the d\u00e9criminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults, which first took place in France in the beginning o f the nineteenth century. After France, d\u00e9criminalisation first followed in the ^ In England the precise meaning of the term 'buggery' was up for grabs. The term sodomite applied to 'buggers' as well to other individuals who engaged in non-procreative sexual practices 'from homosexual acts to birth control'. In 1817 a man had been sentenced to death for 'buggery' although he had only engaged in oral sex with a younger man. The criminal reforms of the 1820s, which marked the transition from the amateurish system of law enforcement of die eighteenth century to the professional police force in the nineteenth century, tightened the law on sodomy. In 1826 Sir Robert Peel abolished the death penalty 93 enlightened state o f Bavaria, and in its colonies (Hekma, 1989). Still, for much of the rest o f Europe and the world it would still take more than a century for homosexuality between consenting adults to become (largely) legal. Yet, despite continued prejudice and legal repression, homosexual subcultures did flourish throughout the nineteenth century, if not globally, at least in Europe (Greenberg, 1988). In England and Wales, where Enlightenment was slower to dawn, the death penalty for buggery was only ofhcially abolished in 1861; in Scotland, death for homosexuals caught in the act would continue to be sentenced until 1889.\"^^ If after 1836 the death penalty for sodomites was never put into practice, until then its execution had depended on the historical moment, the social class o f the sodomite, and on the degree o f public outrage caused by each specific case. In 1885 the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which had been initiated as a House o f Commons bill to rise the age o f female consent, was successftilly amended by the radical MP Henry Labouch\u00e8re. Section 11 of the amendment (simply) criminalized all homosexual acts, with the exception of buggery, whether publicly or privately committed. Buggery was to be penalised with a penal sentence between ten years and life. The 'Labouch\u00e8re Amendment', soon dubbed the 'Blackmailer's Charter', and the 'Vagrancy Act' o f 1898, permitted a large-scale prosecution of homosexual men.^^ Yet, in its oppression o f homosexuality the Acts o f 1885 and 1898 had an for over one hundred crimes, but excluded sodomy. After 1826 it was no longer necessary to prove penetration and emission of seed for conviction under sodomy charges (Weeks, 1990:13-14). The spread of dissent in the seventeenth century, coupled witii the revivalist movements of the eighteenth century, ensured that there was no single church in England. As such, there was no single agent against whom to rebel; a feet that has made an English enlightenment difficult to identify (Munck, 2000). The 1898 Act condemned also those \\^ o solicited or importuned for immoral purposes (Weeks, 1990). 94 unexpected effect: the 'creation of a community of knowledge, if not o f life and feeling, among male homosexuals' (Weeks, 1990:22). Eloth the 'Labouch\u00e8re Amendment' reveal the traditional linkage between homosexuality and prostitution, which was thought to result from male lust and upper class decadence. In the early 1880s the general disgust towards homosexuality had been stirred by a series o f scandals involving homosexuality and prostitution.\"^^ The alleged cover-up o f the Cleveland Street scandal o f 1889-1890, Wiich involved aristocrats, a homosexual brothel, and even perhaps the son o f the Prince o f Wales himself, seemed to give credence to such widespread feelings. However, only during the trial o f Oscar Wilde in 1895 did the popular loathing o f homosexuals really manifest. Such developments must be set against a European context o f renewed hostihty towards homosexuality, which had swept over the Continent (especially in the German Empire), after 1870. Although rooted in traditional rehgious belief, such antagonism significantly fashioned (secular) modem attitudes towards homosexuals (Weeks, 1990; David, 1997). 3.2.3.- The D\u00e9criminalisation of Homosexualitv in the Post-War Period It was not until the 1950s that the first effort to reappraise the legal situation o f homosexuality in Britain undertaken. Four centuries had passed since the 1533 Act o f Henry VIII had criminalised all acts o f sodomy. The process started with the examination o f the 'problem' o f homosexuality by the Moral Welfare Council o f the Such as that of the 1884 trial, and acquittal, of a brothel-keeper, Mrs Jeffiies. Jeffiies was supposed to have been acquitted due to her upper-class connections. In addition, noted The Sentinel^ during her trial the courtroom was filled with young men wearing 'patent shoes' (an assumed signifier of effeminacy) (Weeks, 1990:17). 95 Church o f England in 1952. The result was the 1954 publication o f The Problem o f Homosexuality: An Interim Report, which equated the sinfulness o f homosexuality to that o f adultery and fornication. Neverdieless the Council, and die Howard League for Penal Reform, pressed the Home Secretary to establish a Royal Commission to investigate the ancient laws regulating homosexual acts (Jivani, 1997). These efforts led to the Royal Commission publishing a report in 1957; the 'Report o f the Wolfenden Committee' concluded that the role of criminal law was not to impose particular types o f behaviour. As such, it was recommended that homosexual behaviour between men over twenty-one be decriminalised. Although the 'Wolfenden Report' did not legitimise homosexuality, it framed homosexual behaviour as an 'unfortunate condition' which, for the sake o f social decency, should be accepted (Weeks, 1990). The Report had no practical consequences, but led to the foundation o f The Homosexual Law Reform Society in 1958.^* The declaration of war in 1939 brought together homosexual men firom all comers of the Isles, and the blackout that ensued provided opportunities for indulgence in 'areas that had previously been taboo' The impact o f war on sexual behaviour had been such that once the allies had defeated Hitler, the Archbishop o f Canterbury called for a repudiation o f 'wartime morality' and a return to the values of a Christian life (Jivani, 1997). Since the beginning o f the Great War American and British servicemen were identified as the sources o f homosexual contagion. Homosexuality was thought to be an infectious The Society, a middle-class single-issue pressure group typical of the 1960s, had the support of the establishment. A letter, signed by a number of public figures, which called for the reform of the law appeared in The Times in March of 1958. In addition, and pohaps oddly, fifteen distinguished married women constituted the founding members of the Homosexual Law Reform Society (Weeks, 1990). As evidenced by the seventy percent rise in the incidence of venereal disease amongst the general population between 1939 and 1942 (Jivani, 1997). 96 condition, which was 'passed on' by infected adult men to uninfected boys or men. With the end o f the war the model o f the nuclear family was institutionalised in Britain, and in other capitalist nations. The decreasing importance o f religion in social life, which had been spurred by the rationalisation and secularisation processes o f modernity, occasioned the substitution o f the divinely attributed disapproval of homosexual behaviour for an apparatus o f control and homophobia,^\u00ae The emergence o f such a system o f control was intrinsically related to the growth o f competitive capitalism, which, in turn, had partly emerged as a consequence o f ascetic Protestantism.^^ Capitalism had sharpened the sexual division o f labour, shifted the relationship o f women and men towards production and consumption, strengthened gender stereotypes, and created the differentiated spheres o f public and private life. As such, the family was redefined as a mobile conjugal unit without the traditional extended kinship ties o f its patriarchal predecessor. Within the Calvinist ethos of work and postponed rewards non-procreational heterosexual sex came to be understood as wasteful; homosexual sex as a fundamental threat to the established order (Greenberg, 1988). In such a social context, the homosexual could only belong as an aberration. In the fifteen years following the outbreak o f the Second World War there was a five-fold increase in the number o f indictable homosexual offences. However, it was only under the shadow o f American McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s that homosexuals really came to the fore as political scapegoats. In 1938,956 British men had been prosecuted Homophobia may be defined as the socialised state of prejudice, hatred and fear towards the content, as well as the contenders, of same-sex desire (Rich, 1983). ^ ^ The connection between Puritanism and modem Capitalism was postulated by Weber (1930). 97 for homosexual offences, but in 1952, after American pressure, this number had gone up to 3,757 (Jivani, 1997). The media, enjoying its recently acquired freedom to discuss the subject o f homosexuahty, magnified the d\u00e9monisation of homosexuals by portraying them as traitors, corrupters, or 'carriers o f contagion' (Weeks, 1990). However, the emerging ci\u00fctural and social climate of the 1960s contradicted the ofhcial position on homosexuality. Its 'new hedonism' glorified sexual pleasure and sexual freedom. As such, male homosexual activities in England and Wales were finally, albeit only formally, decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act o f 1967. Still, the material consequences o f the law for homosexual individuals were minimal. The 1967 Act only decriminalised homosexual acts performed in 'private', and for adults over the age o f twenty-one. Moreover, the Act appUed neither to the merchant navy nor the armed forces, and defined 'public' as anywhere where a third person was likely to be present. The inability o f the Sexual Offences Act 1967 to achieve any substantial reform was partly a consequence o f the incapacity o f The Homosexual Law Reform Society to argue whether homosexuality was a legitimate manifestation o f human interaction. Despite such limitations, the work o f The Homosexual Law Reform Society did act as a stimulus to homosexual self-organisation. It fostered the emergence o f a new type o f social organisation, the homosexual-support-group, which encouraged the crystallisation o f positive homosexual identities. For most o f the 1940s and 1950s, and even throughout the 1960s, the policing o f public spaces had discouraged associational life in Britain. Yet, a homosexual subculture had evolved even if it had been organised by the most despised element o f homosexual culture: the effeminate, flamboyant men known as 'queens'. 98 There is limited evidence that within the subculture a masculinised identity was also taking shape. However, in the 50s and 60s the 'queen' dominated 'the social space which was the lifeline for many homosexually inclined men in post-war Britain.' As such, in cafes, baths, and clubs the origin o f a 'community', which would coalesce into a communal phenomenon in the 1970s, was beginning to come together.^^ Despite the increasing acceptance o f medical and psychological explanations o f homosexuality, as well as of the first signs o f a fixture 'community', the situation remained relatively repressive well into the late-1960s. The British medical Association (BMA), which had appended its memorandum on homosexuality with evidence o f the role o f Jesus in the cure o f homosexuality, and who represented the 'family' doctors o f Britain, considered the homosexual an enemy of the state'. As such, homosexual individuals, and bodies, were linked to 'an alien ideology' that undermined the basis o f democracy (Higgins, 1996:24-35). The most devastating effect o f such characterisations was the self-hatred and self-doubt that ultimately permeated homosexual consciousness (Weeks, 1990). As we have seen, it took an entire decade until the recommendations o f the Wolfenden Report had any legal impact in Great Britain. In the rest o f Europe the situation was similar. In (a previously enlightened) France, under the legislation o f the marshals Petain and de Gaulle for example, the 1960s and the 1970s were marked by hundreds o f arrests. In Western Germany, P aragr^h 175 o f the criminal code wrecked havoc on the lives of homosexuals; homosexual survivors o f Nazi extermination camps had to endure prison This is the time when a new type of gay club, the convivial coffee bars featuring the Italian coffee 'steaming Gaggia*, began to appear. This is also the time when the first tentative steps towards the establishment of a specialised press were undertaken; the magazines Timm, Spartacus, and Jeren ^ 99 sentences as long as six years. Still, despite the generally adverse conditions of homosexual life in the post-war period, homosexual identity, which in the 1950s had been synonymous with criminal identity, and in the 1970s would still be equated to social corruption, would soon begin to feel the transformative potential o f the gay liberation movement. 3.2.4.- The M\u00e9dicalisation o f Homosexuality The competitive markets of the Western economies o f the nineteenth century required the development o f particular human attributes. The disciplinary mechanisms embedded in the systems of power relations o f competitive capitalism rewarded 'competitiveness, foresight, discipline, and instrumental rationality*, and devalued 'emotional expressiveness, dependence and nurturance - traits that would have been dysfunctional in the competition.' Self -restraint, a personal articulation o f the capitalist ethos o f efficient capital usage, was evident in the preoccupation with sexual restraint. Ancient Greek medical conceptions were borrowed by nineteenth century medical writings. The classical notion o f semen as the 'material substratum' o f male virtues was used to prescribe as little sexual activity as possible. The goal o f such sexual restraint was to conserve the \u00e9lan vital, which ought to be expended in more productive activities. Even within marriage it was recommended that couples had sex no more than once a month, and ev ai then solely for procreative purposes. Surely, medical manuals do not reflect the real sexual habits o f the general populatioiL However, evidence suggests that although appeared throughout the 1960s in London. Outside of London, it was the ^little comers' of the better hotels tiiat would discreetly serve as public spaces for homosexuals (Jivani, 1997). 100 men o f the middle-classes may not have conformed to such puritanical ideals they thought they ought to and felt guilty when did not (Greenberg, 1988). The weakening o f strict gender divisions, and the accompanying increase in gender stereotypes, fore grounded medical speculation that homosexuality may be a case of gender deviance. As notions o f family organisation, gender roles, and sexual relations underwent major transformations hostility towards homosexuality burgeoned. At the same time that the 1870 Education Act widened the scope for female employment in England, medical professionals started to argue that unless biological differences between men and women were respected women's reproductive capacities would be impaired (Greenberg, 1988). Medical speculation on the fertility potential of women had little to do with science. It was part o f a concerted effort to resist the 'f\u00e9minisation o f culture', which threatened male supremacist ideologies and identities. Not surprisingly, the increasing potential for female participation in the capitalist system provoked the 'second crisis in masculinity' of modem history (Kimmel, 1987; Badinter, 1955). The outcome of such a crisis was 'an outpouring o f new natural science and social science work seeking to demonstrate women's ontological inferiority and close relationship to the animals and lower races' (Petersen, 1998:20).^^ Such a loathing o f the feminine frames the general despise towards homosexuality, and the gender-bending practices o f some homosexuals only confirmed the imagined threat o f the 'feminine' (Greenberg, 1988; Weeks, 1990; Young, 1995). However, the most significant process to have affected the conceptualisation o f homosexuality was the m\u00e9dicalisation o f society. 101 Prior to the dominance o f germ theory in the 1880s, European medical practice had been based on classical (Greek) medical traditions.^\"* The classical paradigm of health and illness viewed disease as the result o f natural causes. With the encroachment of Christianity, however, illness began to be increasingly seen as either divine punishment or divine lesson. As such, medicine assumed an explicit moral function. Medieval Europeans believed that the healing of the body could be achieved through the cure o f the soul. Rituals o f penance were prescribed as medical therapy. Although secular physicians participated in the treatment o f illness, their role was parallel to that o f the priest. The linkage between 'sinner/confessor' and 'patient/physician' is attested by the popularity of pilgrimage culture, a prevalent feature of medieval life, where the healing powers of religious relics constituted the main focus o f many pilgrims. Eventually, the Christian ethic o f asceticism, whose core derived from the seven deadly sins set out by Gregory the Great in the sixth century, appropriated the 'religio-medical management of the body' that had been inherited from medieval monastic practice.^^ Such appropriation sets the context within which the disciplinary practices o f modernity began to coalesce. If modernity would later be characterised by institutions, disciplines, and practices that regulated both the social and the personal, it is because ascetic Protestantism succeeded The 'first' crisis in masculinity occurred in France and England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the 'second' in Europe and the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. The 'third' crisis is the current one (Kimmel, 1987; Badinter, 1995). The humoral theory of disease was used in European medicine until the middle of the nineteenth century. This theoretical school, based on Hippocratic medicine, conceived the world in terms of four basic elements (fire, earth, air, and water), four qualities (heat, cold, diy, and dampness), four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), and four personality types (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). Illness was considered the result of an imbalance in humoral activity. As such, the restoration of health was achieved through a rebalancing of humoral activity through dieting, exercise, bleeding and rest (Turner, 1995). 102 in its quest for mastery over the human flesh. The rationalisation of western society ultimately secularised the human body, voiding it of its traditional role as mediator between man and the natural order. Such a process formally separated medicine and morality. Yet, despite medical categories eventually triumphing as distinctive forms of discourse, the ambiguity between medicine and rehgion continued to linger in modem medical practice (Turner, 1995). The Enlightenment emphasis on rationality and science bore on the shifting conceptions o f sexuality, but the ascendancy o f the medical profession in continental Europe since the beginning o f the nineteenth century played a much greater role. The prominence o f the medical profession was not a result o f its actual success in curing disease, but derived from its plans towards a social pohcy o f public health, and from its undisputed expertise o f the human body. The massive projects or urban reconstraction that took place in European cities in the middle o f the nineteenth century promoted the increasingly influential science. Urban life had always involved health regulation, but now the emphasis was placed on prevention and, consequently, social measures. The first example o f public health regulatory action was the regulation o f prostitution, which began under the Napoleonic regime (Hekma, 1989). The concurrent growth and professionalisation of the urban police force, as well as the encroachment o f the criminal justice system by forensic psychiatrists, contributed to the medicahsation o f sexuahty. These new scientific forces encroached on 'bodies and their pleasures' in an attempt to discover their hidden truths. That which was found to be irregular was thus conceptualised as unnatural, i.e. The 'seven deadly sins' are: vainglory, anger, envy, dejection, gluttony, fornication, and covetousness (Turner, 1995). 103 sick or deviant (Foucault, 1981; 1986). Before the 1850s, for example, the involvement o f the medical profession in the penalisation of sodomy had been limited to the diagnosis o f anal penetration; after that, doctors concerned themselves not only with the mental constitution o f (any) criminals but with their responsibility as well (Hekma, 1989). After the revolution o f 1848 the 'social question' became central in political discourse, and the distinction between public and private wilted (Hekma, 1989). As the various aspects o f social life were structurally differentiated and institutionalised, precise notions o f different categories o f disorder emerged (Turner, 1995). A process o f bureaucratic management o f entire populations o f sinners, criminals, as well as o f diseased and deviant individuals, took place. One o f the principal consequences o f such a new configuration o f power relations - 'bio-power' - was tiie containment, classification, and the secularisation o f disorder (Foucault, 1973). The asylum, the clinic, and the hospital became the medical perpetrators o f the much broader process of regulation and control engendered by the modem state. As such, m\u00e9dicalisation, and the late nineteenth century discourses on the loss o f empire and degeneration of the nation, fi*amed the construction o f a new type o f disordered embodiment: the homosexual (Bleys, 1996),^^ Sodomy was tiius personified, came to represent the essential 'inversion', the fundamental 'other', o f the principal nodes o f thought and knowledge o f modem Westem culture (Sedgwick, 1990). 3.2.5.- Science and the Homosexual The term homosexual was first coined by the Viennese writer Karoly Maria Benkert in 1867, and used for the first time in English in 1869 (Young, 1995). 104 Religious confession 'was first copied and then replaced by psychoanalytical investigations'. Through this process o f secularisation the human body was forced to give up its mysteries, and became open to the anatomical gaze (Turner, 1995:33). As such, a new field o f knowledge, a scientia sexualis, emerged and transformed sexuality into a 'natural' phenomenon to be studied by the scientific gaze. Early in the nineteenth century, the phrenological school o f psychology had developed an aetiology o f homosexuality that located its origin in the pathological excessiveness o f the brain's capacity for 'adhesiveness'. The notion o f 'adhesiveness' corresponded to the faculty of the human brain that was deemed responsible for fiiendship (Greenberg, 1988). A lth o u ^ physiological explanations o f homosexuality can be traced to classical Antiquity, the systematic questioning o f the role o f heredity in the aetiology o f homosexuality reflected the institutionalisation o f the medical paradigm. Interest in issues o f perverted sexuality was marked by a series o f pubhcations that appeared in the 1880s. These works, which defined the new condition of 'sexual inversion', reconceptualised non-procreative 'innate' firom 'acquired' h o m o s e x u a l i t y . I j j i g g 6 , to cite one o f the most influential 'inversion' theorists, the professor o f Psychiatry in Vienna, Richard von Krafft-Ebbing, published his Psycopathia Sexualis. A massive compilation o f unusual sexual behaviour and interests, the volume argued that 'antipathic sexual feeling' (i.e. congenital homosexuality) constituted a 'latent' form o f perverse sexuality. It 'developed under the influence o f masturbation, The writings of the German lawyer and writer Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, which appeared in the 1860s, preceded the 1880s trend by twenty years. According to Ulrichs, the 'third sex' resulted from an anomalous development of the originally undifferentiated human embryo, which produced eidier the 'Uming' (female mind in a male body) or the 'Dionmg* (male mind in a female body). It is important to note that what was inherited, however, was not homosexuality. Most anomalously developed embryos came from heterosexual parents; degeneracy was die inheritance. Ulrich's writings, which constituted the first modem attempt to 105 abstinence and otherwise^ and resulted from both acquired and congenital factors (Krafft-Ebing, 1886, quoted in Weeks, 1990:26). Krafift-Ebing's 'psycopathology', which was grounded on rationalist and biologist notions, finally translated into social practice the ideas o f the Enlightenment The publication o f Sexual Inversion by Havelock Ellis in 1897 first articulated the voice o f homosexual-liberation movement in Britain. Ellis, vdiose ultimate concern was the respectability o f homosexuals, argued that homosexuality was congenital but not pathological. The final version o f Sexual Inversion, with its elaborations on the distinctions between the inherent homosexuahty o f 'inverts' and the acquired homosexuality o f 'perverts', created a lot o f confusion.^* However, by asserting the normahty, or even the moral excellence o f 'inverts'. Sexual Inversion challenged stereotypes of homosexual behaviour that denigrated effeminacy (Weeks, 1990). In an effort to promulgate the scientific approach to the study o f sexuahty initiated by Ellis, the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology (BSSP) was founded in 1914. One o f its members, Edward Carpenter, who published extensively on homosexual issues, emphasised the spiritual side o f homosexuality.^^ Carpenter's most influential work. The Intermediate Sex (1914), made use o f anthropological evidence to show that homosexuahty was not only accepted in many 'primitive' cultures, but also regarded as characteristic o f highly evolved shamanic beings. Unlike Elhs, Carpenter was a support claims that homosexuality was congenital, were later instrumental in the development of the first homosexual-liberation movement formed in Germany by Magnus Hirschfeld (Greenberg, 1988). Havelock Ellis, who was not homosexual, was nevertheless sensitised to the spectrum of sexual differences by his own form of sexual variation: 'urolognia*. As such, Ellis was sexually excited by the sight of women urinating (Weeks, 1990). His work includes The Intermediate Sex (1908) and Intermediate Types Among Primitive Folk (1914). 106 homosexual, and the only member o f the homosexual-liberation movement to distinguish sex from procreation (Greenberg, 1988). The ideas o f writers such as Ellis and Carpenter disseminated the most progressive continental views on sexual matters.^^ The goal of such writers was the reformation o f public opinion o f homosexuality, which had been significantly shaped by Darwinian theories o f evolution that saw it as a symptom of degeneration.^ 1 In the early part o f the twentieth century Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud debated about the origins o f homosexuality. Although Ellis recognised that his tripartite division o f sexual preferences was hardly scientific, he stuck to it (Ellis, 1897). In Three Essays on the Theory o f Sexuality (1905) Freud had defined three types o f homosexuality: 'absolute'; 'amphigenic' (or bisexual); and 'contingent'. 'Contingent' homosexuals were those whose personal circumstances o f constrained heterosexual contact could lead them into (possibly fixed) eiyoyment of homosexual acts. Freud was suspicious o f a distinction between 'acquired' and 'innate' homosexuality. Freud's model o f sexual development, of the 'polymorphously perverse' infant who derived sensual pleasure from all parts o f its body, made homosexuality an element o f everyone's psychological history. Freud's psychoanalytic explanations removed a physiological basis for the manifestation of homosexuality. As such, Freud equalised the non-pathological status o f both homo and heterosexuality inasmuch as the two were deemed be a product o f family interaction. The prominent Continental voices were Karl Ulrichs and Magnus Hirschfeld (Weeks, 1990). American Darwinistic theories on homosexuality were inspired by the work of the Ttalian-Jewish physician Cesare Lombroso. In 1876 Lombroso proposed that criminals wa-e biological atavisms unable to adapt to the modem world. The American physicians James Kieman and Frank Lydston applied such ideas to homosexual!^ by recalling that the human race had evolved from primitive organisms, which were once 107 However, Freud's preoccupation with sexuality as the determinant o f every facet o f human behaviour meant that sexual orientation was not one o f many aspects o f human identity, but the key that unlocked its real, if uninherited, essence. Freud's psychoanalytic model o f sexual development implied that homosexuality fell short o f the normal standards o f psychosexual development. As such, the normative judgement of psychoanalytic theory did stigmatise homosexuality by equating sexual deviance to intrinsic pathology (Greenberg, 1988). Another psychological to have a significant influence on modem perceptions o f homosexuality was b e h a v i o u r i s m . ^ ^ Behaviourism rejected the psychological constructs o f Freudian theory, and postulated instead that behaviour was positively related to pleasure. Also known as 'Learning Theory', Behaviourism asserted that sexual choice was not instinctual (and homosexuality not pathological), but that it resulted firom regular encouragement. Behavioural therapy was consistently applied on patients who either wanted or were forced to change their sexual orientation. Following the recommendations o f the Wolfenden Report that medical 'treatment' ought to be made available to homosexuals, a series o f different behaviourist approaches were developed to 'cure' homosexuality. Such 'treatments' were widely used in the late 1950s and in the 1960s. They consisted o f aversion therapy, which included the use o f emetics and electro- hermaphroditic or bisexuaL In the United States Lombrosianism and degeneracy theory led to compulsory sterilisation for sex offenders, including homosexuals (Greenberg, 1988). Waters was one of the most influential proponents of behaviourism. Between 1913 and 1919 Waters adopted the position that consciousness was useless as an object of study. For him, thinking was a by\u00ad product o f'real' behaviour, such as physiological functions. Today, however, such a perspective has few (if any) advocates. Inasmuch as the only data psychologists can work with are observations and measurements of behaviours, they are all behaviourists. However, the psychological definition of behaviour is much broader and encompasses semantic aspects of language and communication as well as patient's self-reports of feelings and emotions. As such, psychologists take account of mental processes (Wright, 1970). 108 convulsive shock treatment; lobotomies; and even castration (Greenberg, 1988). The words o f a Peter Price, who underwent aversion therapy in 1963 to assuage his family's homophobia, capture the climate of shame and dishonour that such treatment entailed: And for seventy-two hours I was injected, I drank, I was sick. I went to the toilet in bed. I had no basin, no toilet facilities nothing. I just had to sit on my own vomit and excrement... What was going through my mind was not the fear of being gay; it was the fear of not coming out of this psychiatric wing alive (Jivani, 1997:123-124) In the 1940s Alfred C. Kinsey, famous for his two studies on human sexual behaviour, showed that one-third to one-half o f all American men had at least one orgasmic homosexual contact in the course o f their lifetime (Kinsey, 1948; 1953).^^ His research, which was based on the sexual lives of 18,000 American white men and women, suggested that the distinction between homosexuals and heterosexuals was impossible. Kinsey argued that physiological, psychological, or behavioural traits were incapable of explaining homosexuality. Its high incidence indicated that it was a type o f behaviour, not an identity. Despite Kinsey's critique, notions o f constitutional factors o f the supposedly unique bodily entity o f the homosexual continued to shape the 'scientific' theories that aim to contain it. In the 1940s medical science explained the genesis o f homosexuality through the specialised domain o f endocrinology.^ The theory o f Kinsey also found no distinction between 'true' (passive) and 'acquired '(active) homosexuality (1948:425-427). ^ In 1905 biochemical agents thought to control a variety of bodily fimctions were identified as 'hormones'. In the 1920s and the 1930s endocrinologists identified, and synthesised, specifically female and male hormones. These 'sex' hormones were conceptualised as gender's chemical agents. As such, it was hypothesised that heterosexuality resulted fi-om hormonal balance, and that homosexuality was, by default, a question of hormonal imbalance (Kenen, 1996). 109 homosexuality as a hormonal imbalance appeared as a 'theodicy' for the 'anomie' o f the institution o f heterosexuality, which was occasioned by the intersexuality phenomenon (Petersen, 1998).^^ By the 1990s homosexuality was first (briefly) blamed on a shrunken hypothalamus, and then on a 'sissy' gene (Le Vay, 1991,1993; Hamer et al, 1993).^^ As we have seen, constructions o f the masculine depend on time and context. As such, the usual convergence o f biologist and essentialist notions that have produced the idealised European and heterosexual masculine ideal o f Modernity has been challenged by the post-modern society o f mass consumption. Not only does the figure o f the 'new man' (Nixon, 1996) emerge as the re-woiked flagship o f masculinities, but the usual correspondence of masculinity with heterosexual object choice has been subdued in societies where tolerance for variant sexual self-identifications has increased (Petersen, 1998). 3.2.6.- The Gav Liberation Movement The defiant and proud style o f 'Gay Lib' marked the 'turning point in the evolution o f a homosexual consciousness'. Gay Liberation constituted a 'new type o f movement which stressed openness, defiance, pride, identity - and, above all, self-activity'. The tactics and goals o f the movement were deeply affected by the radical utopia o f the revolutionary year of 1968, as well as the by 'Black Power' and the New Left movements (Weeks, Ambiguities in physical sex led scientists to develop the theories of gender. Sex change technologies, which also developed in the 1950s, were \u00fbindamental in the enforcement of the gender binary through the material production of sex (Petersen, 1998). ^^The first to claim a neurological basis for homosexuality were the Dutch researchers Swaab and Hofinan in 1990. However, it was only when the distinguished neuroanatomist Simon Le Vay (1991) claimed that the brains of a small number of homosexual men who had died of AIDS were significantly different in size that the theoiy received worlwide attention. The methodological reliability of Le Vay's study was immediately contested both from within and without science (Weeks, 1996), 110 1990:185-186). Its symbolic marker was the Stonewall Riot, which erupted in Sheridan Square in New York's Greenwich Village on Friday June 27, 1968. It has been argued that the death o f the singer Judy Garland, an 'archetypal gay icon', whose funeral was held during the riots, marked the beginning of a new kind o f gay subjectivity (Jivani, 1997).^^ Whether Garland really did play any role in the liberation o f homosexuality is questionable. However, that the weekend long conflict was pivotal in the future development o f homosexual idaitity across the westem world is an undisputed fact. The immediate aftermath o f the momentous weekend was the establishment o f the New Yoric Gay Liberation Front. Soon after that gay liberation groups sprung up everywhere, including Britain and Europe (Greenberg, 1988). Although the Stonewall riots were a specifically American phenomenon, encouraged by the wave o f civil rights protests that had shaken the country during the 1960s, its echoes were soon felt in Britain's own gay brigade. The London Gay Liberation Front was estabhshed in the early autumn of 1970 at the London School o f Economics; in November the first ever British gay rights march took place in the streets of London (David, 1997). The revolutionary changes advocated by GLF were articulated around the notions of 'coming out' and asserting 'gay pride'; the idea o f a concerted, communal effort against oppression; and the identification and elimination o f the causes o f oppression rooted in the new concept o f sexism.^* The London GLF adopted the 'personal is pohtical' motto o f feminism, which inspired its Garland is deemed an 'archetypal gay icon' as she 'represented bravery through adversity, but that bravery was characterised by a passive stoicism' (Jivani, 1997:160-161), Initially the concept of sexism (prejudice against women), which had been adopted by British feminism after its development in the American women's movement, had little to do with the gay movement. Only later, in more radicalised feminist texts did the subject of female, and male, homosexuality appear (Weeks, 1990). I l l tactics. GLF s political action ranged from the 'zapping' o f hostile organisations to the staged celebrations o f 'gay pride' in public spaces. 'Gay pride' was asserted and celebrated in the small scale 'gay days' as well as in the massive celebrations of 'gay pride week'. The first 'gay pride' march, with 2,000 women and men marching down Oxford Street, was held in July o f 1972 (Weeks, 1990). The relative success o f the gay movement must be framed against both the economic prosperity of the post-war era, and the relative hedonism of the 1960s. However, as 'the last major product o f late 1960s euphoria', gay liberation had exhausted itself by the early 1970s. In 1971 the New York Gay Liberation Front had been substituted by the much more moderate Gay Activist Alliance. In London, although by 1972 the activities o f the GLF continued in fragmented form, by 1973 its office had closed. In other capitalist countries, such as Canada and Australia, the pattern would soon be repeated. The utopian ethos o f the 1960s, when confronted with the harsh economic climate o f the mid-1970s, and with the growth o f the 'strong state', seemed unexpectedly na\u00efve. In addition. Gay Lib's expectation that there was a 'mass force of revolutionary homosexuals willing and able to follow its lead' proved to be an illusion.^^ However, the influence that gay liberation would have in the development of homosexual communities 'are still being realised'. Moreover, gay liberation made homosexuality not only a political issue in the widest sense, but fundamentally changed the view that gay-identified individuals could construct o f themselves (Weeks, 1990:185-206) Tlie reasons for such difficulty will be elaborated in my discussion of gay community in chapter four. 112 3.3.- Homosexuality and AIDS In its weekly bulletin Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 30 o f June 5, 1981 the American federal epidemiology agency 'Centres for Disease Control' (CDC) first alerted the world about an impeding epidemic.^^ The report acknowledged that the five 'active homosexuals', who had contracted the very rare form of pneumonia Pneumocystis carinii (PCP), did not know each other and were not aware o f sexual partners with similar illnesses.^' However, the CDC ventured that it was likely that such outbreak was related to 'some aspect o f a homosexual lifestyle' (250-2). A few weeks later. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 30 reported a rare form o f cancer o f the blood vessels known as Kaposi's sarcoma (K S ).^ ^ Twenty-six young homosexual men in California and New York had recently been diagnosed with it (July 3,1981:305-8). Despite the fact that even as early as 1982 8% o f the 159 reported cases had occurred amongst exclusive heterosexuals, the complex of PCP/KS soon became popularly known as the 'gay cancer', or as 'Gay Related Immune Deficiency' (GRID) (Grmek, 1990; Garfield, 1995; Epstein, 1996). It was only as more symptoms and invading organisms were identified that the complex acquired the status o f syndrome. GRID was eventually substituted by the more neutral 'Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome' (AIDS) in July o f 1982. In 1983 the newly defined syndrome, which had by now been indelibly associated with ^0 It was the gay newspaper iV iew York Native (18/05/1981); in an article by physician Lawrence Mass entitled 'Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded', which first published a report on the mysterious illness. Pneumocystis carini is a protozoan that parasitizes numerous animals, and which is also often found in the human body. However, this ubiquitous protozoan only causes disease in individuals who show a compromised immune system. Until AIDS such individuals were normally newborns or adults under immune suppressive drugs (Grmek, 1990). 90% of Kaposi sarcoma's sufferers are elderly men of well-defined ethnicity: Jews (or eastern European descent; dark-skinned men fiom die northern Mediterranean; and certain black African tribes, mostly the Bantu). Unlike the highly malignant form of KS of these homosexuals, in these populations KS is a relatively benign, chronic disorder (Grmek, 1990). 113 stereotypical generalisations o f homosexual identity and lifestyle, had become a global 'epidemic' present in thirty-three countries. In July 9, 1982 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 31 reported thirty-four cases of AIDS amongst heterosexual Haitians living in the United States, only one o f whom with a history o f injection drug use. A week later Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 31 documented the first cases of PCP amongst haemophiliacs. From the series o f postulated etiological hypotheses surrounding the emerging health crisis, the viral one seemed to provide the best explanation for the appearance of AIDS in these distinct populations (Mass, 1982). However, it was acknowledged that 'a number o f superficially similar epidemics, each with its own primary aetiology', could be taking place simultaneously (Epstein, 1996:57).^^ In the years prior to the epidemic, the explosion o f venereal diseases among urban homosexual communities that had followed the ' sexual-liberation-as-personal-ethic' motto o f the gay liberation movement was well documented. Such medical hterature concluded that homosexuality per se was a risk factor in infectious disease, and warned clinicians o f 'the homosexual hazard'. Despite such a notion of inherent susceptibihty to disease, the intrinsic health o f the homosexual body had indeed improved (at least through the scientific eyes of the medical gaze). That the emerging syndrome o f immune suppression even caught the attention o f the Centres for Disease Control only attests to the fact that the bodies in which it was first detected had recently been defined as healthy. Despite the plethora o f sexual diseases embedded in the concept o f the 'homosexual hazard', (homo)sexuality had indeed achieved a status never previously ascribed to it. The other etiological hypothesis was the 'immune or antigen overload' theory, which attributed the syndrome to the excesses of the 'gay life-style' (Epstein, 1996:48). 114 Had AIDS been identified in pre-Stonewall homosexuals, it would have probably been assigned to the innate inferiority o f homosexuality. Still, it is easy to see how the conceptualisation o f GRID as a 'gay disease' reflected not the fortuitous initial discovery o f the syndrome among gay men, but vestiges of the m\u00e9dicalisation o f the homosexual body. Otherwise how can we explain the legitimisation of a social category of individuals as 'plausible victims o f a medical syndrome' (Patton, o the emerging 'gay disease' to the sexual voracity o f its victims. Homosexually-identified individuals were all reduced to sexual compulsives, who had 'multiple and firequent sexual encounters with different partners, as many as ten sexual encounters each night up to four times a week' (New York Times, 3 July 1981, A-20 quoted in Epstein, 1996:46). It is interesting to note the effect o f ideology on the normalising science o f epidemiology. In attempting to identify and contain a mysterious illness, this branch of science focused 'upon the most sensational markers o f homosexual difference'. As such, the numerous reported cases o f monogamous or sexually moderate homosexuals who were also succumbing to the new syndrome were duly ignored (Epstein, 1996). Such a configuration o f power/knowledge created the perception o f AIDS as the result of the inherent deviance o f homosexuality, and legitimised the notion o f the 'innocent victim' o f AIDS. In any case, whether AIDS is 'a nexus where multiple meanings, stories and discourses intersect and overlap, reinforce and subvert one another', or a narrative for the articulation of the homophobia o f the heterosexual mainstream, or both, the fact remains that blatant public neglect characterised the beginning o f the epidemic (Treichler, 1988:42-55). Consequently, 115 efforts to provide services for those suffering from the devastating syndrome, as well as to deal with issues o f public policy, had to first be devised by organisations from within gay 'communities'. Thus, the linkage between AIDS and homosexuality was solidified both within and beyond the affected communities (Epstein, 1996). 3.3.1.- The Health Crisis Todav 'Second Wave o f AIDS Feared by Officials in San Francisco' was the title of a front\u00ad page article, which appeared in the New York Times on December 11,1993. As early as 1989 there had been signs that increasing numbers o f American gay men were engaging in unprotected sex.^\"* The statistics contradicted the widely held belief that safe sex education had permanently altered gay men's sexual behaviour, and had curbed the spread o f the epidemic among gay communities. In the 1980s several studies had revealed that gay men across the westem world were behaving 'properly', and had substantially altered their sexual behaviour (the San Francisco Men's Health Study [Winkelstein et al., 1988]; the Macquarrie University study in Australia [Kippax et al., 1993]; Project Sigma in England and Wales [Davies et al., 1993]). However, in 1997 the American magazine for HTV positive gay men - POZ - published an article by AIDS activist Stephen Gendin who, inspired by a trend he had noticed in gay personal columns in the Internet, defended the right o f positive men to have unprotected anal sex with each other - what came to be known as 'barebacking' (Positive Times, 02/1998). In November of 1989 the CDC's Morbidity and M ortality Weekly Report revealed that gonorrhoea cases among gay men attending STD clinics in King County, Washington had considerably risen (Rotello, 1998). 116 In Britain, between 1990 and 1997, the number o f HIV infections classified under the exposure category sex between men' remained between 1,350 and 1,650. Yet, 1996 saw the highest rate o f infection since the beginning o f the epidemic: 1,706 cases of homosexually acquired infections (Public Health Laboratory Service - HIV/AIDS & STD Surveillance in the United Kingdom). Up until the first half o f 1999 35,011 people in the UK were estimated to carry the HIV virus; 16,430 o f those have developed AIDS. Homosexual men account for 68% o f the AIDS cases and for 58% o f HTV infections (Public Health laboratory Service AIDS Centre- AIDS/HIV Quarterly surveillance tables no.44). O f these, aroimd one third remain untested and, consequently, unaware o f their HIV status. The 1998 HEA report 'Life on the Scene' revealed that despite the high level o f awareness o f highly gay-identified men concerning safer sex campaigns, 36% o f them routinely engaged in unsafe sex (Pink Paper, 9/01/98). Attempts to 're-gay' HIV prevention, an effort initiated in 1992 by AIDS activists, have indeed resulted in more efficient allocation o f resources targeted specifically at gay men. However, re-gaying has had no impact on the observed increase in infection rates. Whereas the rate of heterosexual transmission o f HTV continues to grow most HTV infection in Britain occurs between gay men. As such, cases o f HTV among gay-identified individuals will continue to dwarf the total number o f heterosexual cases. It is estimated that by 2003 the number 117 o f gay men who know they are positive will increase by almost a third. In London, the projected increase in HIV infections is even gloomier: some areas o f the capital are expected to have up to 54% more people diagnosed with HIV by 2003 (Pink Paper, 18/05/2001), 118 C hapter 4: AIDS Pilgrimages: Danee, Sex, and Drugs as Resistanee Homosexuality did not constitute a society, just a malady, although unlike many other maladies it was a shameful one - a venereal disease (Edmund White, 1988) 4 .1 G av Tribes: a community? Homosexual acts have been documented since the early civilisations, but homosexual identities and subcultures only began to crystallise under the impact o f urbanisation in the late seventeenth century (D'Emilio, 1983; Weeks, 1990) The role o f urbanisation in the formation of modem homosexual subcultures is undisputed, but Greenberg (1988) has argued that social networks o f male homosexuality preceded the configuration o f proper subcultures. However, the notion that difiering social structures shape or disable the response to the bomoerotic feelings potentially present in human beings across history is uncontested. The cultural meanings attached to (bomo)sexual 'scripts', which are articulated through a dense network o f social activities and institutions, constitute an interdependent set o f relationships (Simon and Gagnon, 1973). We can confidently analogise the statement that 'each culture gives shape to a unique Gestalt o f health' to the realm o f sexuality (Illich, 1976:128). The 'spontaneous' resistance project I will be analysing in the present chapter, which emerged firom the grassroots o f the American gay subculture, was only feasible because organised gay communities had coalesced in the ^^'Essentialists', who view sexual identity as the cognitive representation of underlying biological differences, dispute this social constructionist perspective (Stein, 1992). 119 1970s. As such, I should introduce the subject of the 'circuit' by jframing it against my understanding o f how such a community should be understood. The 'homosexual role', which establishes clear boundaries between acceptable and impermissible behaviour and thus contains the 'deviance' o f those labelled as homosexuals, frames the developmental process o f modem homosexual identities (McIntosh, 1968). In Britain such role began to emerge as early as the 1600s, but it was not until the end o f the nineteenth century that it took its modem form (Weeks, 1990). Yet, the accelerating secularisation process that accompanied capitalism did not prevent the 'inverts' or 'umings' o f the 1860s from being conceptuahsed within an ideology heavily influenced by the taboos o f the Judeo-Christian tradition (Halperin, 1990; Katz, 1990; Weeks, 1990). The homosexual condition was identified, and the term homosexual coined, as doctors became the new 'licensed magicians' o f secularised society (Illich, 1976). This was also the time when the concept o f heterosexuality appeared as notions o f the productive and procreative body were de-emphasised in favour o f the consuming and sensuous one (Katz, 1990). The 'crisis o f masculinity', which occurred in Europe and in the United States at the tum o f the nineteenth century, sets the context within which both homosexuality and heterosexuality emerged as two opposite forms o f eroticism (Badinter, 1995; Katz, 1995). Almost half of the twentieth century was dominated by the psychoanalytic construct of homosexuality. It was not until the publication o f Kinsey's (1948) Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male that same-sex desire was represented as other than an aberration. 120 Concurrently with Kinsey new social models o f homosexuality appeared. These approaches regarded homosexuals as an oppressed and persecuted minority rather than as congenital freaks (Hooker, 1965; Hofhnan, 1968). Sociologists, prompted by the increasing public awareness o f homosexuality, began to study the subject (Seidman, 1996). Post-war deviance theories modified the theoretical perspective, which had characterised deviance as an inherent property of the individual, or o f a particular act, to that o f a specific historical status occasioned through social oppression. In addition to the sexual script perspective o f Simon and Gagnon (1973), these transformed theories were o f particular relevance to alternative constructions of knowledges o f (homo)sexuahty. As we have seen, in London the establishment of the Gay Liberation front (GLF) at the London School o f Economics in 1970 marked the British inauguration o f the gay liberation movement. Yet, it was not until the first wave o f gay affirmative politics (1968- 1973) had passed that the notion o f homosexuahty as natural, \\ ^ c h had been held by the homophile movement o f the 1950s, was abandoned.^^ The era o f 'social constructionism' thus dawned both in academia and in political activism. Foucault's (1981) 'constructed' homosexual challenged previous essentialist notions o f sexual orientation, and inspired a model o f homosexuality as an ethnic minority (Epstein, 1987; Seidman, 1996). As such, gay and lesbian individuals entered 'into a period o f community building, personal empowerment, and local struggles' (Seidman, 1996:8). Briefly, and according to a social-constructionist perspective, gender-neutral but deviant sexual acts once inherently stigmatising evolved into specific social identities, which later McIntosh (1968) and Altman (1971) defended a (social constructionist) view of homosexuality that differed from the (mostly essentialist) approach of the era. 121 coalesced into a complex cultural group. Subjective aspects o f human activity had been disregarded by the behaviourist paradigm that had dominated the social sciences until the 1950s. As such, ideas about culture only shifted after its definitions abandoned notions concerning patterns o f behaviour, actions, and customs and took into consideration aspects o f human activity such as consciousness, intention and meaning of behaviour (Irvine, 1996). Culture came to be theorised as the conjunction o f symbolic, non- biological aspects o f human society; the 'webs o f significance' (Geertz, 1973). That our last century witnessed the development of complex urban aggregations with an established array o f social institutions catering to 'metropolitan lesbian and gay identities' is unquestionable (Sinfield, 1998),^^ The institutional apparatus of such collectivities comprises gay and lesbian media; legal, lobbying and political groups; an internationalised calendar o f dance events; churches; travel agencies; health organisations; newspapers and magazines; holiday resorts; and even a gay and lesbian version o f the Olympic Games: the 'Gay Games'. But despite the relative institutional wealth, can we really attribute cultural status to these human aggregations? If oppression provides 'the conditions within which the oppressed can begin to develop their own consciousness and identity', then the labelling o f homosexuals as deviants encouraged the generation of a distinct social world (Weeks, 1990:33). However, the medicahsation o f homosexuahty was a reaction to the emanating groupings of individuals who were beginning to self-identify through sexual behaviour, not a fundamental component in their genesis ((Faderman, 1981; Chauncey, 1982; Irvine, 1996). There is 77 Sinfield (1998) concept o f'metropolitan' gay and lesbian identity refers to post-Stonewall identification processes of some homosexual individuals who inhabit post-colonial global centres of capital. In some non- 122 much discord in how to categorise such highly elaborated collectivities: a community (Murray, 1979; D'Emilio, 1983), an ethnicity (Epstein, 1987), a national identity (Duggan, 1992; Newton, 1993), a life-style (Bellah et al, 1985), or a culture (Altman, 1982; Bronski, 1984; Weeks, 1990; Herdt, 1992)? Some sort o f 'consensus that lesbians and gay men constitute a community with a distinct culture' appears to exist (Irvine, 1996:224). However, others have questioned whether a movement that has only been organised as a pubhc way of life for a quarter of a century, and whose members' subjectivities constitute interlocking sites o f 'gay' as well as a multitude of other deeply estabhshed cultural and ethnic affihations, 'can or should claim a cultural power anything like that o f a true ethnic, racial or linguistic people with centuries (or millennia) of history' (Browning, 1993:6). Perhaps, however, to judge the validity o f claims to cultural status by means o f tradition may be a misguided enterprise. Contemporary life transforms itself too rapidly and demands new configurations of relating and belonging; the narrative o f sexuality grounds 'all our disparate belongings'. The concept o f citizenship has been magnified by the inclusion of sexuality. As such, our attention is called to new concerns, hitherto marginalised in public discourse: with the body, its possibilities, needs and pleasures; with new sexualised identities; and with the forces that inhibit their free, consensual development in a democratic polity committed to full and equal citizenship (Weeks, 1998:37-38) The 'sad and lonely (individual) homosexual' o f the Wolfenden Report, whose protection was procured by such groups as the Homosexual Law Reform Society, characterised the western cities, these 'metropolitan' identities co-exist with traditional, local sex-gender systems (1998). 123 absence o f any conceptualisation of a homosexual community in Britain until the late 1960s. Despite the individualistic rhetoric of the Wolfenden Report and o f the Homosexual Law Reform Society, some form of community had begun to be articulated within the commercial sector much before the arrival o f the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) in the early 1970s. Although the gay hberation movement continued to exist throughout the decade, after the middle o f 1972 its activities were no longer conducted within the auspices of the GLF. Four reasons can be cited for the failure o f the GLF as a viable vehicle o f reform: first, GLF's sexism, which led the women in the London GLF to abandon the organisation and set up one o f their own; second, the rift between the activists and the feminists; third, the disparity between the realities o f 1972 and the organisation's idealistic aims; fourth, the clash between the utopian sociahsm o f the GLF and the non-politicised gays and lesbians o f the commercial scene (Weeks, 1990). Contemporary tensions were thus sown as communal identity was first articulated The passing o f Section 28 o f the Local Government Act 1988 represented the greatest menace to the articulation of homosexuality since the Labouch\u00e8re amendment o f 1885. By imposing heterosexuality as the only lawful and acceptable form of social relationship. Section 28 dramatically inflated the symbohc expression o f 'gay community' by undermining its geo-social boundaries. As such. Section 28 provoked the socio-political coahtion o f all the homosexual factions residing in the Isles (Cohen, 1985). Paradoxically, such artificial amalgamation bred the current crisis over the idea of an all-embracing 'gay community'. The tactical rhetoric o f communal homogeneity o f the anti-Section 28 campaign allowed for the inclusion o f all camps o f homosexual life 124 into the political arena, and dissolved the traditional boundaries between the commercial scene and its political and cultural counterparts. However, the radical activists, who had monopolised the control o f gay identity rhetoric since the time of Ihe GLF, could savour the evanescent condensation o f their utopia only for a fleeting moment. The instrumental myth o f the homogeneity of the homosexual population might have been a political necessity o f the early 1970s, but almost two decades later its moment had long passed (Woods, 1995). The identity crisis o f 'gay' demonstrated that as much as it may be possible to recognise behavioural signifiers o f gay culture, meaning systems within specific lesbian and gay communities are constructed along the differential axes o f race, gender and class: an intersubjective system o f symbols that may only be imperfectly shared. In her 1991 address to the 'National Federation o f Community Organisations' Jo Smith declared 'that there is no such thing as a Lesbian and Gay Community' (Smith, 1991:1). Burston (1998:4) recently reiterated that 'gay men living in Britain have too little in common with one another to ever be called a community.' Yet, lesbian and gay fives are articulated through 'a series of communal identities based on various elements (such as gender, sexual preference, geographic location, musical taste or class) which coincide in varying degrees under the nebulous label o f homosexuality' (Woods, 1995:9). However, it would seem that the increasing vinculum between homosexuality and specific types of consumption has overpowered all other self-identifying options.^* Such a hegemonic model o f homosexuality reflects the globalisation o f capitalism through an This concept of consumption includes not only goods, but also all of life's activities. As such, it is instilled with ethical and aesthetic significance (Chaney, 1996). 125 internationalised iconography o f masculinity, which is instantly recognisable in urban landscapes as distinct as those o f London or Rio de Janeiro7^ The hedonism o f the post- Thatcher dance-drug culture, alongside the commodification o f homosexuality via the commercialisation o f drugs and sex, has transformed utopia into lifestyle. The trouble with the transformation o f a 'subculture' into a 'lifestyle culture' is that the creation o f a self-conscious lifestyle highlights the contingency o f its living patterns, and impairs the plausibility o f defending one's fiindamental rights. In addition, this new hegemonic template offers none o f the advantages o f community (Woods, 1995), Although the boundaries between a 'gay' lifestyle and a sub-cultural system are blurred, specific forms o f speech and fashion, as well as values, have become constitutive o f a symbohc vocabulary that responds to the oppression of heterosexism (Chaney, 1996),*\u00ae But if it is necessary, as Jenkins (1983) has argued, for sub-cultural status to imply a deviant relationship to a dominant culture, and as the concept o f lifestyle stresses distinctions within a culture, then the lifestyle concept can be employed as a methodological tool for the understanding of the disparate coUectivities which, linked by their deviant sexuality, constitute the gay subculture. The manner in which the symbohc resources o f mass culture are appropriated denote power and articulate identity, and the importance of lifestyles 'lies in how we think about the most fundamental themes o f what it is to say that individuals are members o f The impact of American 'cultural imperialism' is clearly visible in representations of homosexual desire and identity within 'metropolitan sex-gender systems' present not only in 'capitalist heartlands of the West', but also in large cities across the world (Sinheld, 1998). 126 cultures'. In making the distinction between a 'way of life' and a 'lifestyle', Chaney (1996: 85-87) argued that the former is similar to definitions o f culture as a form of life associated with the patterns o f social order o f a stable community. The latter should be understood as local forms o f knowledge whose meaning and interpretation are inextricably embedded within the 'particular context of established ways o f life.' The gay subculture is composed o f members whose gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, occupation and age imply a multitude o f interlocking structural affiliations that can be strategically combined, fused and adapted. In the same way that 'gay' was a bourgeois discourse that made more sense to the middle classes but was nevertheless symbolically shared by working-class homosexuals, we must not reduce lifestyle to disposable income (Healy, 1996). As practices infiised with aesthetic and structural significance, lifestyles are not the monopoly o f the elites. In fact, much of the innovation in the appropriation o f symbolic goods and services arises amongst the disenfianchised enclaves o as different subcultural identities articulated through variant lifestyles. These distinct narratives are constructed in daily performances negotiated through a bricolage of possibilities, which can be inclusively or exclusively enacted, but must be filtered through the other cultural and subcultural affiliations (and limitations) o f each individual. 80 Weeks (1990) argued that the existence of a substantial gay argot indicates culture, and Bronski (1984) has discussed gay male sensibility in movies, theatre, opera and pornography. 127 These performances might signify a 'distancing' as much as a 'proximity' to other 'collective resolutions o f desire', but the central importance o f sex as constitutive o f the gay subculture must be acknowledged (Dowsett, 1996). The 'Queer' theorists of the 1990s, heavily influenced by French poststructuralism and Lacanian psychoanalysis, concurrently recognised the fragmentation o f the homosexual experience and the central role o f sex in its constitution.*' As such, the homosexual subject is deemed to reinforce the sexual cosmology of modernity as a system o f knowledge by turning the categories o f 'gay' and 'lesbian' into disciplinary forces. 'Queer', however, failed to reach any sizeable recognition outside of academia not only because o f the force o f the commercial scene and the assimilationists, but also for its lack of conceptualisation o f the social (Woods, 1995; Seidman, 1995). Contemporary individuals 'are not posited on a logic o f identity'; thus, the 'ambiance' o f our era stems from the fundamentally paradoxical situation occasioned by 'the constant interplay between growing massification and the development o f micro-groups'. If the mythical 'gay' community does materialise, as it has been painfully demonstrated by the AIDS crisis, it is because such 'micro-groups', or overlapping 'tribes' under the rubric o f perverse sexuality, partake o f a 'strong component o f shared feeling'. Such 'feeling' can materialise as a 'union for confronting together, in an almost animal way, the presence o f death, the presence at death', even if the identification of 'community ' is achieved 'through a diffuse union that does not require one's full presence for the other'. The 'neo\u00ad tribalism' proposed by Maffesoli (1996) envisions our megalopolises criss-crossed by *1 See the anonymous 1991 London leaflet 'Queer Now' and 'Fear of a Queer Planet\" (Warner, 1993). 128 networks o f individuals who share sentiments {aesthetic), bonds {ethic) and customs, and offer 'mutual aid, conviviality, commensality, professional support and sometimes even...cultural rituals...' These networks enable individuals to articulate their contingent identities - via such lifestyle practices as taste, music, fashion, manners, body-practices - and to rapidly coalesce into a collective subject whenever their 'being-together' is desired or threatened (Maffesoli, 1996:6-73), My analysis o f gay 'community', therefore, imphes a conceptualisation of identity as fluid and dependent on temporal, spatial, and situational parameters. Mass society - characterised by the 'conformism o f youth, the passion for likeness within groups or \"tribes\", the phenomenon o f fashion, standardised culture, up to and including the unisexualisation o f appearance' - is 'both cause and effect o f the loss o f the subject.' It is within mass society that urban individuals who engage in homosexual behaviour live, thus w^en the 'collective spirit' o f gay 'communnity' 'aptitudes, and individualities.' However, this 'community' continues to be 'the site o f real appropriation;' it is where 'both the loss of the individual and the reappropriation o f the person' take place (Maffesoli, 1996:64-66), Circuit: resisting Lifestvle o f the 'Circuit Queen' 129 The circuit queen is one o f the many sub-cultural identities o f the gay 'community'. As such, the circuit queen performs his identity through lifestyle practices that revolve around an international calendar o f gay-mega-dance-events: the 'circuit-parties'. Many o f the largest parties o f the circuit originated as benefits to raise money for the AIDS crisis, and it is widely believed that a great percentage o f those who firequent the circuit have received an HIV or an AIDS d i a g n o s i s . * ^ Andrew Sullivan, the HIV-positive-British- bom-Oxford-and-Harvard-educated former editor of the leading American political weekly New Republic, and analyst o f American politics for the English newspaper Sunday Times, observed in the New York Times Magazine (1996): On the surface the parties could be taken for a mass of men in superb sh ^e merely enjoying an opportunity to let off steam. But underneath, masked by the drugs, there is an air of strain, of sexual danger translated into sexual objectification, the unspoken withering of the human body transformed into a reassuring inflation of muscular body mass (quoted in Signorile, 1997:93) My argument is that the life-style o f the circuit-queen is suffused with significant (quasi) religious qualities, and that the circuit constitutes a 'spontaneous resistance strategy' that challenges the medical definition o f the AIDS body as a dying entity.*^ However, before proceeding with a discussion o f the quasi-religious aspects o f these mega-events, I shall briefly argue for the embodied nature o f the ekstasis experienced within the context o f the 'circuit'. I shall also discuss how the AIDS crisis has pushed the gay/positive body into a ritualised existence. Data to corroborate this statement would require further research. However, research conducted by Si^orile (1997), Lewis & Ross (1995) and my own participant observation point in the same direction. 130 4.2.2.- The Gay Body: magic and resistance The 'gold standard' o f human bodily classification has been the white, European, middle- class, heterosexual body. Masculinity, the 'bodily quality or condition that defines a person', is a construct linked to the adjustment o f medieval notions o f manhood to the emergence o f the new bourgeois society o f the end o f the eighteenth century.^ The questioning o f gender relations allowed by liberal democracy posed a threat to male hegemony, and prompted the abandonment of ancient notions that conceptualised the difference between the sexes as a simple matter o f degree. As the biological 'two-sex' model gained credence, the surface and the interiority o f the human body were increasingly differentiated in accordance with the emerging model o f distinct male and female bodies (Laqueur, 1990). As such, the fimdamentals o f the contemporary male body emanate firom the second half o f the nineteenth century, and are shaped by Darwinian notions that define it as vigorous, competitive, assertive, and muscular (Rotundo, 1993; Petersen, 1998), Gay Liberation stripped the unconditional association o f homosexuahty with gender deviance, and a process o f masculinisation ensued. If the sex-gender system o f 'metropolitan gay identity' has abandoned conventional notions o f gender hierarchy, such as those o f the Latin-American model where manhood is associated with the dominant role, residues o f a hostile ideology that conceptualises femininity, and passivity, as The term 'circuit queen' is widely applied 'to describe the average repetitive attendee, although few men will label themselves a circuit queen' (Signorile, 1997:33). Medieval notions of manhood such as chivalry and the institution of the duel lasted into modem times. The word masculinity only speared in the mid-eighteenth century (Petersen, 1998). 131 inferior still haunt. Yet, the stigma o f femininity is ultimately a consequence o f the dominance o f men over women, not o f 'straight' over 'gay' (Sinfield, 1998), The hyper\u00ad masculinity o f the (hard) muscular male body, heralded as the hegemonic ideal o f an American-dominated internationalised gay subculture, is the result o f the subaltern position o f (soft) femininity in mainstream society - even if masculinity is 'insecure o f its status and even its existence' (Heywood, 1997:171),^^ The male bodybuilder constitutes the very embodiment o f conspicuous and traditional masculinity. Competitive female bodybuilders also strive to embody masculinity in an attempt to dissociate themselves ftom 'femininity', and from 'immanent passivity' (Ian, 1994), However, the gay bodybuilder destabilises masculinity through the 'eroticisation o f gender sameness and by superinqx)sing 'authentic' masculinity onto the feminised body (Bordo, 1997:49), One o f the most astonishing sites o f a circuit party is the materiality o f thousands o f masculinised 'buffed' bodies intermingled and intertwined in a vast network o f (not so masculine) gestures and embraces. In his parody o f the masculine body the circuit queen transgresses conventional masculinity, subverts the traditional codes o f representation, and creates opportunities for narcissistic self- identification. This narcissistic self-identification may only denote a superficial level of association, as 'inside that body is a mind that harbours a past in which there is some scrawny adolescent or stuttering child that forever says, \" I knew you when...'\" (Klein, 1993:41), Thus the 'circuit', by constituting a forum for an articulation o f drag that subverts dress and associated gender roles, as well as poses and style o f bodily relation. 'Body fascism' is the term employed by members of diverse gay 'tribes' to denote the (sub)cultural 132 constitutes the site where the 'masquerade o f masculinity' is epitomised (Healy, 1996). However, another cultural imperative is fundamental in the gay worship o f muscularity. The inner quality of the self has been increasingly equated to its outer appearance; when health is a 'virtue' not only does the 'soft' body represent a sign o f moral weakness, but also the 'dis-eased' gay body surely constitutes a symbol o f personal degeneration. Loss o f self is one o f the most fundamental forms o f suffering in chronic illness (Charmaz, 1983). The stigmatisation, isolation, loneliness, frustration, and dependency processes triggered by the onset o f illness are perhaps masked, but not alleviated, by the 'new compulsive body-building' trend among gay men (Evans, 1988). The compulsive production o f the muscular (and, as such, perceived as healthy) gay body is enacted in the hope that the achieved strength o f its surface may function as a magical shield against the internal threat that the HIV virus represents. In their research o f the gay-dance-party institutions o f Australia, Lewis & Ross (1995) recognised the magical thinking involved in the process of 'tricking' the virus. In their sample o f sixty-three self-identified gay men who were regular patrons o f hmer-city gay parties, four reasons related to the obsession o f the body-beautiful were identified. Only one referred to issues o f heterosexual dominance: the ' straighter-than-straight' appearance enabled by a muscular body provides a 'passport' between the dominant culture and the gay subculture. The other three motives related to the production o f a muscular physique were concerned with HIV/AIDS: a healthy and muscular body disguises a positive diagnosis; a muscular appearance enables self-denial concerning one's own status, and allows for the possibility imperative of the muscular body. Signorile (1997) has argued that 'body fascism' is equivalent to some forms of racism. 133 of misleading a potential sexual partner into believing that one is healthier than one appears; the possibility to 'trick' the degenerative and infectious capabilities o f the virus. Especially before the discovery o f HIV, AIDS-risk was equated to group membership. With the identification o f the virus in 1983 the homogeneity o f gay men as a risk-group was broken. 'HIV status' simultaneously specified individual identities into HIV- positives and HTV-negatives. As such, the division between the (positive) gay men who 'posed' a risk, and the (negative) men who were 'at-risk', took place. With new developments in drag therapy, the division between gay men has become more nuanced. In terms o f potential threat o f contamination, positive individuals who have trouble keeping up with their drag regimen, or 'non-compliers' (read: 'very-risky), are compared to positive individuals Wio have taken anti-retroviral treatment, or 'drag-naive' (read: 'not-so-risky') (Flowers, 2001).*^ However, and most importantly, simply by belonging to a group affected by the only modem plague that 'affronts all technical values', a gay man is 'polluted' irrespective o f his individual health status (Shilts, 1987). As such, to the 'general public' (unfamiliar with the nuanced issues o f anti-HIV therapy) separate individual identities continue to be collapsed into the unified identity o f group membership. 4.2.3.- The Positive Bodv: ritual and resistance Individuals who feil to comply with the requirements of a HAART regime are deemed more likely to develop drug-resistant strains of the HIV virus. As such, they present a bigger threat as they may infect others with strains of the virus that are resistant to the treatment 134 The coming out' process precedes any genuine engagement in other sub-cultural rites.^^ It is an event that modifies gender behaviour and identity, and places same-sex desire in the core o f the homosexual person's identity. Full participation in the gay community can be achieved only through the process o f coming out, which is considered the 'key' ritual o f gay culture (Herdt, 1992). Oftentimes coming out is linked to a migratory process. A great number o f homosexual individuals feel that it is necessary to migrate (or even immigrate) in order to create the social space necessary for the construction o f a gay identity.*^ Only post-Stonewall generations have been able to profit from a community whose political and economic power has been translated into gay and lesbian institutions. As such, this process o f identity development that has accompanied the formation o f the gay and lesbian cultural system of recent decades is a transformational process constitutive o f a genuine rite de passage. Coming out constitutes a 'collective initiation rite, a public coming-of-age status-adjustment transition into the adult gay community' (Herdt, 1992:31). Coming out can be seen as a 'technology o f the se lf, a process through which the body is inscribed (Foucault, 1988). The self-disclosure entailed in the coming out process has two conflicting effects: the reinforcement o f community and an increased individualisation. In coming out one does not simply renounce the old identity, but forges a new one. The The term 'coming out' was first employed amidst the homosexual subculture in order to denote the moment in which an individual became an integral member of the subculture. It was a term that parodied the more acceptable ritual of social recognition accorded to the debutante, and that had none of Ihe contemporary metaphorical associations with the closet (Chauncey, 1991). A survey conducted by 'Gay Men Fighting Aids' revealed that 77.1% of gay men who live in London have grown up outside of the capital (G<y Times 03/1997), 135 double movement embedded has been recognised in Rose's (1989:240) analysis o f the self-confessional event: In confessing, one also constitutes oneself. In the act of speaking, through the obligation to produce words that are true to an inner reality, through the self examination that precedes and acconq)anies speech, one becomes a subject for oneself. Confession, then, is the diagram of a certain form of subjectification that binds us to others at the very moment we affirm our identity AIDS has bestowed new meaning upon the coming out process. In his research on the processes o f initiation and socialisation o f urban gay youth in the American Midwest, Herdt (1992:21-35) compared the coming out experiences o f four different cohorts. The first cohort dated from the turn o f the century to the 1930s. The second cohort extended from World War II to the Stonewall Riots, whereas the third cohort comprised the 'sexually-liberated' generation o f post-Stonewall activism. The fourth cohort, beginning in 1982, was characterised by the onset the AIDS epidemic. In juxtaposing these different experiences, or 'pathways o f adjustment across cultural epochs', Herdt concluded: where early cohorts lived closeted and in fear, suffering such huge psychosocial costs as the alcohol abuse associated with the bar culture of that generation, and where the third cohort is now besieged frontally with the death and grief of AIDS, today's youths - wimess to these preceding life-styles - are in response developing an alternative cultural reality and friture life course Heterosexual sexuality does not need to come out as the major institutions o f society sanction its development. The coming out event results from a process o f self-acceptance 136 required only o f those individuals whose sexual orientation is stigmatised by the social environment. Sexuality has become fundamental in contemporary identity-construction processes (Foucault, 1981). In this light the closet became a place o f terrible darkness, in which the negation o f the body was interpreted as the annihilation o f the innermost expression o f self. Only out o f the closet could selfhood be re-appropriated, if not gained for the first time. Van Gennep (1960) argued that all rituals o f social transition follow the same tripartite pattern. First there is the stage o f 'separation' from secular and everyday relationships, which is followed by the 'liminal' (transitional) period. The process ends when, afrer a new status and cultural knowledge has been achieved, the individual returns to secular relationships. Occasionally, the liminal phase may detach from this tripartite ritual structure, and in its independent existence will constitute an autonomous 'state o f transition'. This 'state o f transition' is populated by members who are 'betwixt and between' normal social roles, and close to some transcendent and sacred core o f moral and social value (Tumer, 1967). Van Geimep's (1960) tripartite scheme o f rituals o f social transition can be applied to provide a fuller understanding of the transformation implicit in the coming out process. The severance and withdrawal from usual social roles experienced by the homosexual person, when he or she recognises his or her 'differenceness', illustrates the initial phase of separation described by Van Gennep (1960). This stage o f identity construction, which has been described as the 'self-suspicion' phase in the construction o f a gay identity, is characterised by introspection, anxiety, and alienation from family and friends (Weinberg, 1983). Although the basic structure o f the coming out process can 137 be considered universal, its shape - according to age, social, ethnic, and geographical variables, as well as cultural era - can vary greatly.*^ A thirty-year-old father who comes to recognise his homosexuality will experience the liminal phase o f his coming out differently from a teenager who seeks help within the established institutions o f the gay community. In order to acquire a gay identity, the initiate needs to traverse the liminal stage o f the coming out process. In this liminal period he or she will exist in 'timeless ritual space outside normative society, and will unlearn previous belief systems and behaviours (Van Gennep, 1960:75). The 'relearning process' refers to the possibility, enabled by ritual, for previously held ideas and beliefs to be unlearned so that new social roles can be performed satisfactorily (Van Gennep, 1960). The relearning aspect o f coming out is fundamental for the successful adaptation into the new moral world o f gay culture. After coming out, the gay person experiences a new sense o f self. The new self inhabits a different moral world where different social roles are performed, new relationships enacted, and new environments inhabited. Moreover, in being reincorporated as new selves into a subculture within the wider society, and by publicly adopting gay-identified social relationships, initiates are reborn into a new selfhood that can be achieved only through the death o f the old (even if the degree of such 'death' varies according to each individual). In many cases the coming out process may lead to literal social death as parents, fiiends and family reject the new gay-identified individual. However, the death Seidman et al (1999:9-11) argue that as the notion of 'coming out' is inseparably linked to the idea of the 'closet', and that as the latter presiqjposes a narrative which constructs 'gay individuals as suffering a common fate in a society organised around normative heterosexuality', they may need to be rethought as gay and lesbian (and bisexual) identity in contemporary America has been normalised and routinised. 138 o f the old self does not translate into a new identity that is free from the stigmata o f homosexuality. Societal oppression and internalised homophobia may continue to scar the development o f the gay-identified person. Functioning in society as an openly gay male or female requires much more than the mere unlearning o f secrecy, it demands rejection and symbolic reinterpretation o f the homosexual stigma. It is because sexuality has come to be placed 'in a more and more distinctively privileged relation to our most jprized constructs o f identity, truth, and knowledge' that such a rite de passage becomes so crucial, and entails much more than simple modifications in self-identity (Sedgwick, 1990:42). AIDS has created a new form o f subjectivity for the homosexual. The legal necessity, the moral obligation, the sexual imperative o f 'HIV-disclosure' discourse has constituted a new type o f subjectivity for the diagnosed individual.^\u00ae The crossing o f the boundary 'seronegative' vs. 'seropositive', 'healthy' vs. 'diseased', shares the same tripartite structure as that described by Van Gennep (1960). Whereas in mainstream society the diagnosis o f a serious illness m i^ t cause profound isolation, the widespread rate of infection within gay communities may soften the initial reaction to an HIV diagnosis. The liminal phase o f coming out about one's HIV diagnosis (to him/herself and/or to others) is characterised by the ambivalence o f the individual towards his or her reality as an officially dis-eased individual. The typical development of the syndrome contributes for a liminal phase that can be particularly long, as the first occurrence o f an opportunistic See chapter seven. 139 infection might not occur for a long period from diagnosis.^ ^ In addition, periods o f disease may be altercated by long stretches o f apparently good health. As such, asymptomatic HIV infection is understood through biomedical explanatory frameworks that present themselves as a metaphysics o f an otherwise imperceptible condition. The departure from tiie land o f the living, which characterises the initial phase o f the HTV- coming-out process, culminates in the inclusion o f the initiate into the land o f the dying, or the 'reincorporation' phase o f the HIV-coming-out process. Regardless o f the stage o f development o f HIV infection, when an individual comes out to the world as an HIV carrier, his or her old self must be shed, as the reincorporated self is ultimately understood to be a dying one.^^ Such a process o f reincorporation is often reinterpreted from the privileged position o f 'enlightenment'. Discourses o f salvation, rebirth, and biography, which are employed in order to make sense o f an HIV diagnosis, serve as important symbolic and narrative reference points between the positive body, the tainted self, and mainstream society. Homosexual identity was first 'spoiled' by its classification as a mental handicap. Although removed from the list o f mental illnesses by the American Psychiatric Association in 1972, the change in the official conceptualisation o f homosexuality affected its 'actual' component much more than its 'virtual' one (Garfield, 1995; 91 Opportunistic infection (O X ) constitutes an infection in an inunune compromised person caused by an organism that does not usually cause disease in healthy people. Many of these organisms are carried in a kUent state by virtually everyone, and only cause disease when given the ^opportunity' by a damaged immune system. 92 The laboratory parameters used to monitor the progression of HTV disease, especially T-cell count measurements, present the HTV-infected individual with a picture of gradually diminishing health that will ultimately result in the total collapse of the immune system. See ch\u00eeqjter six for a more detailed analysis of 140 Gof&nan, 1971). With the onset o f AIDS, which we ought to reczdl was first named G.R.I.D. (Gay Related Immunological Disease), to the deeply discrediting attributes prescribed by the dominant culture to disqualify gay men firom social legitimisation was added the stigma of a fetally contagious illness. Consequently, the current knowledge and development o f a gay identity is deeply embedded within the larger AIDS cultural agenda. AIDS might seem to be invariantly fatal, but its expected fatality can develop so gradually and slowly that its carriers find themselves existing in a liminal space where the boundaries between living and dead, diseased and healthy, are deeply confused and unbearably prolonged. People in crisis often create life-reinforcing celebrations involving the use o f music, dance, and intoxicating substances. As such, ritualised behaviour often emerges among a subculture in crisis. In addition, the loss o f confidence in mainstream healing institutions to control or prevent communities fi*om being affected by deadly diseases is one o f the major contributory factors for the evolution of such rites during times o f plagues (Zoja, 1989). The liminality inherent in an HIV diagnosis, when combined with the stigmatisation o f homosexuality, and added to the urban and 'culturally plural' character o f homosexual communities, has produced a rich collection o f contemporary ritualised behaviour. It is thought that only within the institutions o f urban marginal groups can contemporary society still provide for some limited participation in genuine ritualistic behaviour (Hanna, 1987). Perhaps 'limited' is too narrow a term. these tests, and chapter seven for how the perception of such tests impinges upon the subjectivity of the diagnosed. 141 Duridieim suggested that social groups perform rituals so that common values may be renewed, social bonds strengthened, and communal conceptions reaffirmed (Durkheim, 1955). Rituals have been present in all human cultures. Ritual as a ^symbolic mode of communication o f \"saying something\" in a formal way, not to be said in ordinary language or informal behaviour' describes an 'extraordinary event involving stylised, repetitive behaviour' Hanna, 1987:129). Rituals are characterised by ' ^repetitive behaviour that does not have a direct overt technical effect'. Private rituals are those conducted and observed solely by one person whereas public rituals are performed for at least one other person. Public rituals can be defined as those aspects o f certain customs that 'have no direct technological consequences and which are symbolic'. Public rituals 'say something about the state o f affairs, particularly about the social conditions of those taking part in the ritual' (Helman, 1996:9). Rituals have two principal fimctions. The expressive fimction communicates the basic values o f the culture in a dramatised language. It can be understood only within a specific cultural and social context, and only by those initiated and conversant in the culture's vocabulary. The creative aspect o f ritual creates and re-creates the inner and outer boundaries o f a society, and provides the categories through viiich men perceive reality (Turner; 1969). Processes o f industrialisation and modernisation have fimdamentally shaken the prominent role of ritual. In traditional societies rituals served as the main vehicle o f social renewal, cohesion, and protection against threatening dangers. The process o f western 'disenchantment' culminated in a modem existence where the important social, psychological, and symbolic dimensions traditionally fulfilled by ritual were instead 142 carried out by the nation-state. As civil religion came to substitute the institutionalised kind, pluralistic societies looked to 'flags, coinage, anthems, uniforms, monuments and ceremonies' to provide their members with a sense o f shared identity and belonging (Smith, 1991:16-17), More recently, however, political and social deterioration, as well as globalisation, have contributed to the decline of civil religion as an alternative focus for value consensus, Eliade (1959) has argued that the disappearance of genuine initiation rituals fundamentally distinguishes the ancient from the modem world. Yet, as we shall see, the amorphous character o f contemporary society, unable to provide a clear focus of identity, seems to have reawakened the ancient desire for initiation (Barker, 1992), Contemporary human beings, at least 'queer' ones, may not be that different from their ancestors after all, 4.2,4.- The Wider Context: rave culture Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was first synthesised in 1912 and patented two years later by the German pharmaceutical company Merck. The drag was never marketed and only reappeared in 1953 under the code name 'E 2q)erimental Agent 1475' when the US army tested its potential (on animals) as a chemical weapon for the Cold War, Unlike LSD, which had also been tested by the American military, MDMA did not make it into the streets and only resurfaced in the mid-1960s when it was resynthesised by drug researcher Gordon All\u00e9s and a biochemist from the University o f California at Berkeley, Alexander Shulgin. Inefficient as a weapon MDMA was deemed suitable for therapeutic use. However, this 'penicillin for the souT was only utilised by a few 143 experimental therapists.^^ In the 1970s the drug became known as 'Adam', a reference to the keeper o f the Garden o f Eden before his original sin, but by the 1980s it had been renamed 'Ecstasy' due to the new name's supposedly greater market appeal (Saunders, 1995; Collin, 1998), In the United States MDMA was made illegal in 1985, but only after a long battle had been fought by its supporters - a 'collective o f psychologists, researchers and lawyers' who claimed the drug's 'healing potential should not be lost to the therapeutic community ' (Collin, 1998:33). In Britain, an amendment to the 1971 Misuse o f Drugs Act had criminalised MDMA much before its use became widespread (Collin, 1998). Whether as a tool for self\u00ad enlightenment or as a hedonistic enhancer, or both, widespread use o f Ecstasy in Europe did not happen until the mid-80s. Followers o f the Indian guru Bhagwan Rajneesh, and the hedonistic 'crowd' that used to rock the Balearic summers o f the notorious island o f Ibiza, introduced the drug into the Continent (Saunders, 1995). The combination of Ecstasy and 'House Music' sparked the 'most vibrant and diverse youth movement Britain had ever seen'. Such movement reached within into deep country and spread without national borders; its political and cultural effects were felt 'in music, fashion, the law, government policy and countless other areas o f public and private life' (Collin, 1998:4).^^ The roots of 'rave culture' date back to the early-1980s and are to be found RD Lalng was one of the therapists who reported the positive effects of MDMA during therapeutic sessions. Despite its illegality, there are reports that MDMA is still used by bodi psychotherapists and unqualified therapists in the United States, Germany and Denmark (Saunders, 1995). House music originated in black, gay clubs of Chicago in the 1980s. Afi^o-American 'gays' are doubly discriminated not only by mainstream America, but also as homosexuals are 'prevented fi^om expressing their own identity within their own communities. This contributed to a powerfiil, pent-up fiustration which found its release in the clubs, the only place where they could be themselves...the club became church, bedroom and family' (Collin, 1998:17). DJs who experimented with it in Ibiza brought House music to 144 both in the warehouse parties o f the 'rare groove funk and hip-hop fraternities', and in the coastal holiday camps which hosted hedonistic weekends for the working class 'Soul Mafia' (Collin, 1998:72). However, it was not until the summer o f 1989 when Ecstasy met 'Acid House' that 'rave' culture took Britain by storm. As such, 'rave' culture may offer a polysemous forum for the questioning of gender relations, the reassertion of community, the seeking o f the religious, or it may simply constitute a site for the production o f pleasure and desire (Saunders, 1995). 4.2.5.- The Circuit British 'rave' culture, which had been inspired by the black, gay clubs o f Chicago, was later reimported into the United States where white, heterosexual Americans would create their own 'rave circuit'. A reverse but analogous process happened to the 'subterranean' and 'marginalised' gay 'rave circuit' that had developed in the United States (Collin, 1998:277-278). In the 1990's a global network o f gay mega-dance-events - 'the circuit' - flourished in Canada, Australia, the United States, and Europe.^^ In the urban gay neighbourhoods of American life in the 1970s the term 'circuit' had been used to denote 'the institutions that together compose the gay ghetto, especially its social, sexual, and recreational scenes' (Levine, 1998:49). The transformation undergone by the circuit in England (Saunders, 1995:205). In Britain, 'House Music' metamorphosed into 'Acid House' (Collin, Some of that now comprise 'the circuit', such as 'Mardi Gras' in Australia, which dates back to 1978, existed well before 'rave culture' crystallised into its internationalised form. However, such events have been added to the calendar o f'the circuit' and increasingly marketed to and attended by its 'consumers'. Another example is the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (vhose roots can be traced back to the turn of the twentieth century) that has seen some of its 'gay balls' abandon their traditional format and music (samba) in favour of not only Anglo-American music but also environments that reproduce the setting and atmosphere of circuit parties. However, the bulk of 'circuit' events take place in the United States vdiere it is estimated that there are fifty parties a year, generating around five million dollars in ticket 145 the 1990s reflects not only general processes of economic and cultural globalisation (as well as comparatively easy access to air-travel) but also the relative political emancipation experienced by urban gay communities during the 1980s. Sadly, that which increased the visibility and relative clout o f such communities was also what was decimating it. AIDS grants the circuit its singular character: I love circuit parties, the costumes, the men. It's the place where I mourn the friends I've lost. When a good anthem comes on we go: Oh remember him, diis one is for Nick. James threw Paulo's ashes all over me at the Black Party. I thought it was coke up my nose, but James screamed, no it's Paulo! I've done so many ashes; the ashes have been saved for the next party. We get rid of them gradually, in different parties. The next one will be at Trade on the Bank Holiday in August. It's a nice idea, because it keeps the party going... it keeps die thought. Most queens are full of life, silly bastards. It keeps their memory going, if they are a fun person... As I said James and I had a number system: I was number 23. Poor George came number one. You can't be serious about it, you can't... (Interview #12)^^ Secularisation has decreased the role o f religion in public areas o f Western hfe, but since the 1950s both immigration and the appearance o f new religious movements (NRMs) have vastly increased the British repertoire o f rehgious belief and practice.^^ The type o f mystico-religious experience that I propose the circuit constitutes does not present any answers to fundamental questions o f existence, but is evocative o f the type o f popular sales. In addition to the 'circuit', a network of 'minicircuits' - 'the 'hot boy night-club parties' - has developed in the last few years in urban centres around the US and Europe (Signorile, 1997). Only four members of my sample had ever attended a circuit event. See chuter seven. NRMs is an umbrella term utilised to denote a plethora of organisations emerging in Britain since die 1950s, which offer answers to questions of a religious, spiritual, or philosophical nature. Although some of these organisations originated in Britain (the Aetherius Society, the Findhom Foundation), most have been imported fr-om the East or North America (Barker, 1992). 146 religiosity that existed before the institutionalisation of faith. If we are to understand how these sites perform religious roles we must abandon Christian notions o f religion defined by * interiority* and 'salvation', and realise that much like the ancient 'cult of saints and various other forms of superstition', these events deal with '\"immanent transcendence\" - another way of describing the puissance which binds together small groups and communities.' Communal life and survival is the focus o f these sites (Maffesoli, 1996:58- 59). Dance has traditionally been one o f the major institutions o f western gay culture, but the circuit is a phenomenon o f a globalised subculture in the shadow o f an epidemic. The ritualised combination o f sex and drugs as symbols to combat the stress o f knowledge o f imminent death has been used by many different cultures. The fundamental themes of life and death constitute the building blocks o f initiation rites, and often involve the use of dance, sex, drugs and music (Zoja, 1989). Such a combination has often served as liberation pathways from the bondage o f the dominant culture's 1988; Zoja, 1989; Reanney, 1991; Douglas, 1991; Garber, 1992). The inability o f the establishment to provide a solution to the AIDS crisis, and the subculture's subsumption, function as psychological incentives for high levels o f drug consumption. Circuit parties can involve tens o f thousands o f participants who engage in a weekend-long marathon o f dance, music, drugs and sexual behaviour.^^ The transformed environments created within these institutions - with the use o f lights, music, sets, special effects, costumes, crowds, and drugs - contribute to the feeling of suspended The main party is usually preceded and followed by smaller events. 147 reality and allow for the temporary abandonment o f everyday inhibitory constraints. The circuit may provide opportunities for the achievement o f physical and spiritual ecstasy, as well as positive reaffirmation o f self-identity and {sub)cultural values, articulated through sexual behaviour and consumption o f mind-altering substances.^^ Moreover, the promotion o f some o f these parties by AIDS organisations legitimises the practices o f drug consumption and multiple sexual encounters as individuals are enticed to attend these parties 'for the cause' - their pilgrimages 'are all in the line o f duty and in Miami and Zurich, the 'Black Party' in New York, or the 'Black and Blue Festival' in Montreal are circuit events which supply social space for the expression not only o f explicit homosexual behaviour but also for 'immanent transcendence.' Lewis & Ross (1995) have noted that the 'Mardi Gras' and 'Sleaze Ball' parties in Australia might perform the same symbolic functions as do the Christian celebrations o f Easter and Christmas for the religiously-identified. Moreover, the social functions they accomplish are similar to those o f the temples o f institutionalised religion since their members attend its ceremonies in order to transform and escape reality. The secular context o f these sites fimnes the 'For many gay men, rave culture is an incredibly powerful form of communal escapism which enables them to get away from the pressures of today. The combination of clubbing and designer drugs has, fw example, been strong enough to help us find a release fi' om the reality of AIDS' (David Meech in Gay Times o f9/1994, cited in Saunders, 1995:183-185). 100 Efforts to establish a gay-mega-party in London have so far been unsuccessful (the Red Party only ran fi-om 1994 to 1997). However, the gay club Trade, part of the 'minicircuit' and the first nightclub in Britain to be allowed to remain open for twenty-four hours, provides opportunities for weekly 'pilgrimages'. In a recent (08/08/98) Channel Four documentary Trade was compared to a 'church'. 148 experience o f the sacred on the psychological level, but spiritual language is often employed to translate the subjective experience of the transcendence o f the self. Whilst for most communities mourning is an infrequent transitional period during which social life is suspended - and a time where the deceased and the grieving constitute a special group located between the world of the liv ii^ and the world o f the dead - it would appear that circuit queens have been unevenly affected by the AIDS crisis. If these events continually attract a disproportionate percentage of HIV infected individuals it is because these unfortunate men can never be fully reintegrated into the world o f the living, and need to continually employ psychosocial mechanisms to remember the deceased members o f their community and reassert their own lives: In ways similar to those of these men, many others talk of the circuit as offsetting the tragedies \u00dciey experience, particularly with regard to AIDS. They literally look to the circuit as part of their mourning process, as a psychological remedy to the epidemic (Signorile, 1997:90-91) Recent research suggests that some gay men might be actively procuring HIV infection as an act o f solidarity with their fellows, and as a way into the AIDS system. However, it is more likely that the limitations o f safer sex campaigns outlined above, as well as the misguided impression that new anti-retroviral therapies may constitute a cure for the syndrome, represent the most significant factors in the continued spread o f HIV l\u00aei Continuum, vol4 (5) (1997:22-25). More recently a number of websites and internet discussion groups for 'Bug-Chasers' (as these individuals are known) have appeared. 'Bareback.city.com', which claims a membership of forty-eight thousand, and 'bareback.com', serve as virtual communities for those who want to be infected by those willing to purposefully infect (so-called 'gift-givers) them (Freeman, 2003). My 149 infections amongst 'men who have sex with men'. The circuit and its related events may contribute to the spread o f HIV infection, but the gay 'dance-drug' culture does provide gay men with positive images about self, and opportunities to transcend the negative social, physical and psychological consequences o f an HIV diagnosis (as well as plenty o f free condoms). 4.3.- The Pilgrimage: dancing for salvation That circuit parties constitute a highly ritualised social institution is certain. Although it is widely recognised that post-modern pilgrims often voyage beyond the boundaries of exphcit religion, can we really affirm that the 'circuit' constitutes a genuine pilgrimage culture (Morinis, 1992; Reader and Walter, 1993)? If it does then this particular manifestation o f pilgrimage is indeed characterised by some very remarkable configurations. Pilgrimage is a complex socio-cultural institution occurring outside o f the usual, and normally fixed, social realms (Morinis, 1992). Because pilgrimage is such a multidimensional social phenomenon, universal denominators are tenuous and one should think more in terms o f unifying themes. A brief conceptualisation o f the phenomenon o f the circuit within theoretical fiameworks o f traditional pilgrimage culture grounds the insight necessary for the realisation that this unusual form o f pilgrimage can indeed be characterised as a post-modern expression o f an ancient practice. The theoretical perspective on pilgrimage developed by Victor Turner (1969; 1978), which is in direct opposition to functionalist theories that favour the integrative function own research has also revealed that some gay men view HTV infection as a way into a specific 'life-style' made possible by the wel6re system and the relinquishment of fiill-thne employment (see chapter seven). 150 o f pilgrimage, was based on studies o f Christian pilgrimages. For Turner pilgrimage is about communitas, that is, the creation o f a temporary social space where the main relational basis is grounded on equality. Divested of social roles, individuals exist outside the normal parameters o f society in a liminal space that fosters spontaneity and bonding. Such 'anti-structural\" interpretation is essentially the reverse o f the functionalist approach, which deems pilgrimage as a phenomenon that reasserts the social order and reiterates cultural and national identities. Nevertheless, one could reasonably employ the functionalist framework to argue that the circuit represents celebrations that reaffirm (sub)cultural values by creating and reiterating a sense of (sub)cultural consciousness. Arnold van Gennep's (1960) work on initiation rites, rites o f passage, and their transitional character, is reflected in Turner's conceptualisation o f pilgrimage culture. As we have seen. Van Gennep identified the tripartite nature of ritual characterised by a process o f separation, transition and reincorporation. In the context o f pilgrimage culture such tripartite structure is distinguished by the separation stage, which is characterised by the pilgrim's departure from profane society; the liminal phase, composed o f a two-tier process o f 1) transition within-the-profane-to-the-sacred and 2) transition-within-the- sacred-to-the-profane, and which represents the actual pilgrimage; and the final stage o f reincorporation within the profane, or secular society (Cnrairine and Morinis, 1991). Turner's (Werbner, Morinis, 1984; Sallnow, 1987). Fieldwork 1979), Morocco (Eickelman, 1976), Nepal (Messerscmidt and Sharma, 1981), North India (Van der Veer, 1984), the Peruvian Andes (Sallnow, 1981), and in West Bengal (Morinis, 1984), have all 151 refiited Turner's theory. Instead such research has pointed towards the integrative character o f pilgrimage (Bade and Sallnow, 1991). The invalidation o f Turner's model by these studies suggests not the uselessness of his conceptualisation, but the inherent limitation o f a structuralist model in grasping the multidimensionality o f the phenomenon. In order to overcome the simphstic dichotomy embedded in the structuralist foundation that frames the Tumerian approach, which favours the subversive character o f anti-structure; and the frinctionahst explanation, which highlights the role o f pilgrimage in reiterating the social order, we must view pilgrimage 'not merely as a field o f social relations but also as a realm o f competing discourses ' (Bade and Sallnow, 1991:5). In this light. Turner's theoretical effort should be understood not as an empirical description o f pilgrimage but as one o f the many competing discourses attempting to grasp it. Or, as has argued Morinis (1992), pilgrimage's wealth o f content impedes its analysis from a unified and recurrent factor. Besides the empirical evidence against the experience o f communitas. Turner's (1969) theory has also been proven flawed in its contention that pilgrimage is an experience articulated on the collective level. In fact, it has been demonstrated that pilgrimages are highly individualistic practices that covet a direct connection with the divine (Morinis, 1992). However, the applicability o f Turner's theoretical framework (or discourse), when one considers that 'transcendence' and the 'divine' are experienced through the relationality o f a collective o f individual sexualised bodies, seems remarkably suitable to the analysis o f the circuit as constitutive o f a genuine pilgrimage culture. If communitas involves the creation o f an egalitarian bonding between individuals outside of, freed 152 from, the normal structures o f society, and the formation o f a temporary community and field o f social relations that appears as an alternative to the normal structures of society, then in the context o f these mega-parties a sense o f communitas is indeed achieved (Turner, 1969). Circuit queens enter into a great variety o f social and sexual relationships taking place in anti-structure - the out o f time and out of space environment created with the aid o f music, drugs, decoration, costumes - and replace normal social ties by a temporary but intensive bonding in which the individual directly experiences a sense o f belonging, and an affirmation o f sub cultural values. The psychosocial boundaries created by die physical protection provided by these institutions against the homophobic prejudice o f mainstream society is enhanced by the communal use o f illegal drugs, shared behaviours, and bodily practices that reinforce groiq) solidarity. Pilgrimages taking place within the realm o f popular culture are often related to death and heroic figures. Whilst temples, shrines, and straightforward conceptions of the divine are not essential elements o f popular pilgrimages, the sacred potential o f the profane world is revealed in the transformation o f secular sites into quasi-religious locales. These sites provide not only a focus for the crystallisation o f cultural identities that may transcend any national boundary, but also promise a potential glimpse onto the transcendent. The circuit provides its pilgrims with the opportunity to engage in ritualised emotional cathartic processes and siqyplies them with a route to a liminal world where their tainted social personas may be cleansed, renewed, and healed. Access to the sacred is achieved through remembrance o f the dead and o f the dying heroes, who constitute a significant percentage o f the pilgrims. The individual nostalgia o f the post-modern world is 153 exponentially magnified within the AIDS crisis (wherein the untimely death of members o f so-called 'risk-groups' reaches epidemic proportions), and the longing for what might have been (and for what was in the pre-AIDS past) is thus articulated on the collective level. These pilgrims simultaneously enact the role o f mourner, actor and observer. The sacred in the secular world is marked by a fluidity that permits individuals to impose culturally demarcated meanings upon pilgrimage sites, which can accommodate a plurality o f discourses and practices. Functioning as a 'religious void' such polyvalent ritual spaces, which contain pilgrims as a social body, traditionally derive their power from the contrasting discourses o f miracle and sacrifice. 'Miracle' discourse focuses on the potential for the dramatic healing o f incurable disease whereas 'sacrificial' discourse, by converging on the doctrine o f the physical resurrection o f the untainted body o f the redemption, challenges the traditional boundaries between the physical and the spiritual and sanctifies suffering (Bade and Sallnow, 1991). Healing miracles, a major focus of traditional Christian pilgrimage centres, has become increasingly obsolete with the advent of allopathic medicine. However, allopathic medicine has largely failed the circuit q u e e n . Thus the forefi-ont position o f 'miracle' discourses in his pilgrimage culture. In this light, however, not only the dead but also the dying heroes o f AIDS come to embody both contrasting discourses. If in traditional pilgrimage culture individualised diseased bodies represent a proximity to the sacred realm, performing a mediating role betweoi the ideal and the human, the circuit embodies liminality per se. The circuit reflects the diseased state o f an entire subcultural enclave. 154 Popular pilgrimages are deemed to have accompanied the relative cultural shift characteristic o f contemporary religious expression in which after-life salvation has been gradually substituted for 'in-life' emotional fulfilment (Reader, 1993). In the context of the circuit, acute concerns for survival frame the idealised motive of the perfectly healthy dimensions o f the gay body: its lived, its political, and its social elements. It is the pursuit o f the coveted ideal that defines the sacred journey (Morinis, 1992). Even if the traditional hardships, which characterised sacred voyages o f the past, have been eliminated by the accessible and efficient modes o f transport o f the modem age, the heretical ideal at the centre o f this pilgrimage culture is today more demonised than in ancient times. The very experience o f the circuit offers stigmatised and diseased bodies opportunity to embody (even if only briefly) the ideal o f multidimensional health, and/or its utilisation for instrumental goals. The healing o f the lived body - our material physicality - represents the pilgrim's hope that the experience o f pain, suffering, and illness might be alleviated not only by the magical shield o f a muscular body strong enough to 'trick' the virus, but also by the celebration o f his very embodiment. Such a celebration is enacted during these pilgrimages through sexual behaviour, and the sheer physicality o f these dance marathons. The procurement o f the healing o f the political body is articulated through the resistance against moral norms that these pilgrimages represent. The poUtical body represents the body both as an instrument o f power and as the site o f struggles over power. The circuit provides an arena where 'domesticated bodies' resist internalised 'technologies o f power' (Foucault, 1979; Although 'combination therapy' was initially claimed as a 'cure' for AIDS, recent studies have shown that between 30% to 50% of patients will experience failure of the treatment within one year of initiation 155 Could it be then that these pilgrims are, by assuming the chronic (even if ultimately fatal) sick role, protesting against the social controls imposed upon them by the mainstream society that engulfs them? Illness may be a highly expressive political act, but it is often ineffective due to the inability o f the diseased to make their voices heard (McGuire, 1996).^\u00ae^ However, even if illness as political resistance represents but a palliative, it can at times occasion healing by the mere articulation o f social and political contradictions. The social body, the physical cradle of metaphorical meanings, is dictated by dominant ideologies, socially compelled and religiously legitimised, which have the potential to inflict negative self-images, alienation and suffering. Moreover, as in the case o f the 'non-innocent' victim o f HIV infection, such ideologies can rob the individual o f the validity o f his own expaience: infected gay men are responsible for their fate due to their own behaviour. The circuit provides its pilgrims with the opportunity to ritually realign and reinterpret body metaphors. In the process of positive re-identification with the gay body, in all its freedom and nakedness, the circuit queen is permitted a metaphorical recontextualisation o f his social body and experiences a feeling o f wholeness and healing: It was the first time I ever felt proud of being gay.. .that huge space filled with all these beautiful, strong, powerfiil men. (Interview #51) In order to understand the nature o f healing we need to distance ourselves from the Cartesian dualism o f allopathic medicine, and conceptualise the self as a unitary (Pink PapcTf 01/05/1998). See chapter six. 156 phenomenon constituted by the intermingling of body, mind, and society. We should regard the body as a biological entity shaped by cultural directives. This organic being, who functions on the physical, cognitive and symbolic levels o f social existence, is compounded by equally significant social and environmental contexts upon which the body/mind act and are acted upon. Within such a perspective the circuit could be understood as the 'body/mind/self experiencing a spiritual transition in an emotionally and socially shared cultural practice, which is simultaneously an intense physical, mindful and socially meaning-laden joumey' (McGuire, 1996:113). This perspective would suggest that circuit parties do not simply symbolise an idealised nirvana o f health and equality, but that the actual dimensions o f the unitary self are actively engaged in resisting and transforming powCT structures. 'Conscious' or 'unconscious' pilgrims circuit queens might be, but determinedly engaged in the ritualistic process of transcending a reality they wish were otherwise (Bowman, 1993). 1\u00ae ^ In the case of HIV disease, however, patients have significantly impacted processes of 'knowledge- making* concerning their disease (Epstein, 1996). See chaptCT six. 157 C hapter 5: Q ueer Spirituality; Resisting the D\u00e9monisation of the Homosexual Body Nothing that is of us can be alien to our theology (Collins, 1979) 5.1.- The Spiritual Discourses o f the Queer The pluralism encountered in the industrialised societies o f the so-called developed world extends to most facets o f social life. If alternative religious cosmologies continue to occupy a subjugated space in relation to the universalistic claims o f the Judaeo-Christian tradition embedded in the capitalist system, the (post-modern) climate o f the emerging century is one o f challenge to traditional secular and religious discourses. However, despite being conducted from a multitude o f subject positions, contemporary inquisitions o f mainstream social structure and practice are nevertheless ultimately homogenised by their encapsulation within the paradigm o f traditional heterosexuality. In Britain, the replacement o f the rehgious by the medical model o f homosexuality was widely accepted by the late 1950s (Weeks, 1990). Two decades later, the onset o f the AIDS crisis revealed how easily the relative ^safety' that secularisation had apparently bestowed iqx)n the homosexual body could be replaced: homosexuality once again met with the wrath of God (or, at least, o f some o f His most zealous followCTs). Such adverse social context reveals the persistent heterosexism o f mainstream society, which frames the development o f the theological reinterpretations o f the e^q^erience o f homosexuality that constitute the theme o f this chapter. 158 In the present analysis I shall describe the 'conscious\" resistance project that 'Queer Spiritual Discourse' (QSD) represents Under the umbrella term o f Q SD 1 describe the two main perspectives around which this elite-produced resistance project has based its cultural and theological production. Such perspectives 1 have termed 'Queer Theology' and 'Gay Soul'. The two perspectives diverge inasmuch as each approaches the problem o f the religiously defined axiom o f the inherently sinful homosexual body from different theological paradigms. Queer Theology constitutes a queor hermeneutics o f the Bible; conducted mainly by gay theologians, ministers and scholars within the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Queer Theology should be understood as an attempt to uncover 'subjugated knowledge', and to reinterpret biblical texts accordingly.^\u00ae^ On the other hand. Gay Soul reflects the religious pluralism o f western societies and conducts its resistance effort from within a melange of other religious systems that mainly borrow fiom the New Age as well as Eastern and Aboriginal tradition. However, these categorisations constitute definitional strategies that attempt to neatly delineate social phenomena that often overlap; they should be understood not as exact translations o f complex social realities, but as analytical tools. Despite the ftmdamental differences in cultural content, both Queer Theology and Gay Soul merge on the level o f their goals. Hence, QSD constitutes a 'ndcrological' resistance project with the objective o f not only challenging the traditional religious d\u00e9monisation o f the homosexual body, but invalidating it. 104 jjje polysemous ambiguity of 'queer' (rather than the fixedness o f'gay') enables the continual deconstruction of identity; as such it more aptly captures the kind of spiritual discourse that I will be analysing. 1\u00ae 5 sucii reinterpretation is conducted within a 'contextualising' fiamework, which, by rejecting any universal claims of truth, recognises that truth is a relative concept and tiiat biblical interpretation can only be conducted in relation to specific historical and cultural contexts. 159 5.2.- Liberation Theologies The modem social processes o f pluralism and secularisation have enabled traditionally oppressed social groups to assert their own world-views, and to rationally challenge the institutional and religious cosmologies o f their oppression. Radical challenges to traditional readings of the Bible have been conducted, and minority-specific hermeneutics o f the Holy Book proposed: feminists, Latin-Americans, blacks firom Afirica and North-America, gays and lesbians have all been engaged in challenging religious legitimisation o f patriarchal, eurocentric, and heterosexist systems o f social organisation. As such. Liberation Theology emerged in the 1960s in Latin America where specific cultural and socio-economic configurations propelled local theologians to conduct a radical reflection on faith. As a source o f theological production. Liberation Theology constitutes a coherent form o f religious discourse surrounding issues o f human liberation. However, Liberation Theology is not only a set of doctrines but constitutes a social movement with anarchic tendencies. As a social movement. Liberation Theology subjugates its doctrinal aspirations to the social and proposes the mobilisation of disenfiranchised constituencies for collective action aimed at producing effective social change. Despite cultural and social differences. Liberation Theology can be used as an umbrella term to describe unique and distinct theological efforts o f varied oppressed cultures in different societies. Such localised liberationist theologies find their differenti^d matrices overshadowed by the commonality o f their main themes, and the similarity o f their social expectations.^^ Liberation theologies that may cut across a myriad o f 106 South African Black Theology, for example, was in its origins minimally affected by Latin American Liberation Theology. However, as a social movement the Black Theology of South Africa has been constituted through the interplay between its internal cultural and socio-economic conditions and the external influence of the Latin American situation (Kretzschuman, 1986). 160 specific cultural experiences of socio-economic oppression all endeavour to contextualise biblical texts, and provide multi-cultural, gender polyvalent basis for identification with the Holy Book. Black churches reject any interpretation o f Scripture that legitimates racism, while Latin American priests are silenced for defending a socially engaged interpretation o f the Bible; a queer hermeneutics o f the Bible finds in the stories o f Ruth and Naomi, and David and Jonathan, the two finest examples o f committed love. The emergence o f an institutionalised gay subculture in the 1970s substituted the 'impoverished cultural unit' (Simon & Gagnon, 1967:183) that had represented gay life before the 1960s, where threats o f impeding sanction limited 'cultural and structural elaboration' (Levine, 1992:73). This improved social situation replaced the self-loathing social netwoiks whose primary social fimctions had been the facilitation o f sexual contacts and the management o f stigma (Humphreys, 1979). It resulted from the social movements of liberation o f the Sixties whose origins can be traced to the relative moral loosening o f the Roaring Twenties (Greenberg, 1988). Consequently, 'impoverished cultural units' across the western world were replaced with the establishment o f a multitude o f cultural, social and economic institutions attended by gay-identified individuals undergoing a process of relative socio-political enfranchisement. Such developments, along the same lines o f feminism and other emancipationist movements, provided the ground upon viiich QSD could begin to be formulated. As such, it can be argued that such a discourse is fimdamentally embedded within the wider cultural movement o f debunking oppressive meta-narratives o f so-called universal religious systems. A queer slant on Liberation Theology rejects the homophobic and heterosexist 161 ethos o f the Judeo-Christian tradition, and forsakes notions that equate the AIDS crisis with divine punishment, QSD does constitute an integral element o f liberation theologies, but its effect in terms o f creating social change may not be analogised by some o f its most successful relatives. More research is needed to assess the role o f such a resistance project in the lives and subjectivities o f ordinary gay individuals.^\u00ae^ 5.3.- Queer Terror* and the Theoloev o f St. Aclred Homosexual practices are very rarely mentioned in the Bible; much more numerous are the references to adultery and heterosexual fornication. There are five undisputed Biblical passages that refer to homosexual acts between males: two o f them are found in the 'Holiness Code' o f Leviticus (LEV. xviii. 22; LEV. xx. 13); the other three in the New Testament (ROM. i. 27; 1 COR. vi. 9-10; 1 TIM. i. 9-10). There is one passage, which occurs in St Paul's Epistle to the Romans (ROM. i. 26-27), that refers to female homosexuality. In addition, there are two passages which could be directly referring to homosexuality; one upon which 'homosexual significance by marginal reference' may be imputed; and, finally, six passages Wiich, when translated into English, have assumed (not necessary) homosexual connotations. There are also the stories o f 'Sodom and Gomorra', and of 'Gibeah', upon which 'tradition has inqx>sed a homosexual interpretation based on a priori considerations' (Bailey, 1955:29). It is, however, the See chapter seven for an analysis of my research as it relates to issues of the queer spiritual discourse. 162 story o f Sodom and Gomorra in Genesis 19:1-28, which has been traditionally interpreted by religious and political institutions as the most legitimate proof o f divine acquiescence to the exclusion of homosexuals firom the portals o f heaven. The story is well known. When Lot parted firom his uncle Abraham, he decided to settle in the infamously wicked city o f Sodom, which neighboured Gomorra. The story tells how God, unhappy about the evil reputation o f the twin cities, sends two angels to investigate the reality o f such a claim. If true, the cities must be destroyed. Abraham, who had interceded with God for the sake o f his nephew, accompanied the angels to the gates o f the city. There, Lot met him and the angels. Lot urged them to accept his hospitality, and had the angels and his uncle stay in his house for the night. Upon hearing about the unusual visitors the people o f Sodom and Gomorra, an unwelcoming bunch oblivious to ancient hospitality rules, beset Lot's house in order to 'know' them. Unsuccessful, the enraged inhabitants threatened them with violence and even rape. Horrified, but appeasing. Lot offered his own daughters to the eager mob. But Sodom and Gomorra wanted angels, not girls, and they refused Lot's bid for human sacrifice. These coveted angelic creatures responded by blinding their aggressive hosts. The next morning the visiting angels, angelic mode regained, rescued Lot and his family. Soon after that, God overthrew the twin cities with brimstone and fire fi-om heaven. Sodom and Gomorra were no more. Sodom and Gomorra is but one o f many texts o f terror* which have been used not only to terrify gay individuals across the globe, but also for political and religious 163 discrimination. However, Queer Theology employs Foucauldian genealogical methods to uncover 'subjugated knowledges', and comes up with a reinterpretation that reveals the role o f the heterosexist power system that has imbued the construction o f the Sodom and Gomorra myth with homophobic elements. According to the queer reinterpretation, before the first century witnessed the Jewish philosopher and bibhcal commentator Philo o f Alexandria offered his imagination upon such text, it had had no previous association with homosexuality. The acts o f bestiaUty and homosexual behaviour described by Philo o f Alexandria are not directly referred to in Genesis 19, and the only possible linkage o f the text with homosexuahty appears to be the use of the Hebrew vfor\u00e0.yadha. Yadha, which can be employed to express multiple meanings, is usually understood as 'to have thorough knowledge o f ; however, it often signifies the intent to 'examine the credentials o f visitors'. In its less utilised form yadha implicitly conveys sexual intercourse (Swicegood and Perry, 1990:340). In the context o f the tale o f Sodom and Gomorra, yadha is employed in order to signify the wish o f their people for Lot to reveal his angelic guests so that its citizens may 'know' them (Wilson, 1995). Traditionally it is claimed that the term signifies a demand fi*om Sodom's citizens, the sodomites, to engage in coitus (Bailey, 1955). Such 'knowing' might indicate an intention to rape the angels o f destruction; an act of physical violence and not one o f homosexual behaviour. 'Anal phallic penetration' was the customary ritual o f welcome to trespassers o f ancient societies, performed in order to ^98 In her book 'Texts of Terror' (1984) Phyllis Trible first used the expression in order to describe biblical passages that justified violence toward women. Subsequently, Robert Goss in 'Jesus Acted Up* (1993) identified analogous texts for gays and Leviticus (Swicegood and Perry, 1990). 164 demonstrate subjugation (Dover, 1978). This fact illustrates the oppressiveness of traditional biblical interpretation that understands in an act o f heterosexual male dominance committed against men and women alike, the divine condemnation o f same- sex relationships engaged in by mutually consenting, self-identified gay individuals living in contemporary society. In addition, further complications of an argument that asserts that Sodom and Gomorra constitute a condemnation o f homosexual behaviour are highlighted by the fact that, besides Lot's offering o f his own female offspring for such 'knowing', the subjects o f such potential violence were angels who traditionally escape gender classifications. Even ifyadah were indeed employed to convey some sort of sexual innuendo, it would be difficult to justifiably equate the condemnation of rape with the sinful nature o f all other non-violent homosexual acts and relationships (Wilson, 1995). Radical reinterpretations o f biblical texts conducted by feminists and gay individuals regard the revival o f the concept o f friendship, expressed in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, as the main relational basis between God and humanity. The doctrine of the Trinity in classic Christian theology constitutes the foundation o f the act o f creation, and is understood by Queer Theology as vahdation of gay relationships, not heterosexual ones, as the ideal representation o f God's love. ^ 1 \u00ae As God's nature is expressed through coimectedness with each member of the Trinity, 'Be firuitful and multiply' (Genesis 1:22- 28) comes to signify not the articulation o f love confined to heterosexual parameters of 109 Qay theologian Robert Goss, for example, sees no difference between the rapes of Genesis 19 and the rape of the concubine in Judges 19:92 (Goss, 1993). 165 the family unit but its quzditative and quantitative expansion (Cleaver, 1995)J ^ ^ W ithin this framework fnendship is viewed as a form of social relationship, which abandons the hierarchic^ forms o f relating characteristic of patriarchal Christianity, in order to favour values o f equality and mutuality. Such 'theology o f friendship' is traced back to the work o f the twelfth century Abbot of Rievaulx, St. Aelred, who challenged the dualistic division o f flesh and spirit espoused by the traditional Christian view o f 'platonic friendship'. His work De Spirituali Amicitia (On Spiritual Friendship) reflects the liberal stance o f an ancient member o f the Church, one o f many 'uncovered' homosexual ancestors, who could express his views without fear o f condemnation by rehgious authority. A tolerant Church and State are supposed to have allowed Aelred to permit the development of 'particular friendships' among his monks whom, within the limitation of celibacy vows, were encouraged to physically express their affection for each other (Wilson, 1995). Queer Theology argues that the sanctioned celebration o f same-sex spiritual and physical relationships by a medieval monk dismystifres the equation o f homosexuahty with sin (or disease), and lends a gay face to the image o f God. As such, the 'theology o f friendship' presents contemporary gay individuals with a relational model. ^ Interestingly, the demands o f some gay and lesbian individuals to have their relationships acknowledged ^ The heterosexual person is deemed unnatural as his or her relational models are conditioned by societal approval. Only gay relationships are constituted through the expression of truly divine qualities, and not as a result of external programming (Gearhart, 1974). 1 ^ ^ Theologian R. Cleaver understands Genesis (1:22,28) to suggest that love should expand from couples to groups (Cleaver, 1995:66). i Aelred's Spiritual Friendship describes the importance of intimate friendships in developing a spiritual life. Aelred, who permitted die physical demonstration of affection among his monks, is generally considered by queer theologians to have entered into homosexual relationships (Cleaver, 1995). 166 through the legalisation o f same-sex marriage are deemed to be an internalisation o f the hierarchical relational modes o f heterosexuals. In contrast, a relational mode that emphasises friendship, 'expressed and nourished sexually % is regarded by Queer Theology not only as the most favoured contractual basis for homosexual relationships but also as one of the greatest lessons gays and lesbians can teach humanity (Stuart, 1992:8).I\u00ef3 5.3.2.- Was Jesus 'Queer'? The 'theology o f friendship' is ultimately embodied in the life o f Jesus Christ, who is deconstructed by a queer hermeneutics o f the Bible o f an imposed asexuality, the social purpose o f which is the promotion o f 'a moral/political dualism that subordinated women and denigrated sexual pleasure' (Goss, 1996:69). Moreover, Christian discourse about God promoted the idea o f an apathetic divine entity stripped not only o f pleasure and desire but also o f any passion (patheid). * A queer reinterpretation of christological discourse endeavours to refocus the story o f Jesus through the lenses o f his basileia vision (Schussler-Fiorenza, 1989). God's reign {basileia) was the symbolic marker o f the divine liberation o f the people - the destitutes, the persecuted, the children and the outcasts who would inhabit the kingdom of Heaven (Perrin, 1976; McDonalds and Chilton, 1987). As such, Jesus is viewed as a radical political creature whose tactics o f ^ D The political analogy of this theological perspective regards marriage as contrary to the main objectives of die lesbian and gay movement, i.e., die validation of many forms of relationships within the context of a liberalised gay identity. In addition, state intervention in private relationships would not only extend the scope of the 'gaze', but also increase the sexual oppression of gay and lesbian individuals who would continue to choose to engage in sexual relationships outside of the institution of marriage. Apatheia: 'Apathy is a form of the inability to suffer. It is understood as a social condition in which people are dominated by a goal of avoiding suffering that it becomes a goal to avoid human relationships and contacts altogether* (Soelle, 1975:36 quoted in Goss, 1993:65). 167 basileia proposed a completely different vision of power relations (Goss, 1996).^ In addition, the notion o f an apathetic God is rejected through the reinterpretation o f Jesus as an individual whose divinity is expressed through the sensual experience of his humanity. The asexuality of Jesus has also been questioned hy contemporary mainstream theology: because 'Jesus lived in his body, as other men do', he is deemed to have had sexual and emotional urges similar to those of other human beings (Driver, 1965:241). Yet, the sexualised Jesus is delimited by heterosexual relational modes as his sexuality is placed within a framework o f heterosexual marriage.* Queer Theology reclaims Jesus' sexuality as a reflection o f the divinity o f same-sex desire. The argument towards the homoerotic nature o f some of Jesus' sexual feelings was first articulated in the late 1960s by the Anglican canon Hugh Montefiore (Montefiore, 1969).* The debate surrounding a gay-identified Jesus was appended by the Episcopal priest, Malcom Boyd, for whom Jesus' androgynous character epitomises 'gay spirit' and the expression o f liberated sexuality, and followed-up with accounts of the homoerotic nature o f his relationship with Lazarus (Williams, 1992; Wilson, 1995; Goss, 1996). Such interpretation challenges traditional readings o f the Bible that regard John (son o f Zebedee), and not Lazarus, as Jesus' 115 Jesus' egalitarian ethos is well illustrated by the following biblical passage in Luke 22:24: 'For which is the greater, one wiio sits at the table, or one who serves? Is it not the one ^ o sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves' (Goss, 1993:74). * *^ Phipps (1975) has claimed that scriptural evidence supports his argument that Jesus was married. Meier (1991) has challenged d\u00fbs view. * *^ Neewsweek August p.83. * Advocate [December 4,1990 (90)]. 168 traditional christological discourse, which by emphasising the superiority o f an asexual male figure immaculately conceived legitimises oppressive structures based on gender stereotypes, and rejects notions o f physical and sexual pleasure. As Christianity came to pervade Roman civilisation, the ancient Greco-Roman techniques o f self-mastery were transformed into austere mechanisms of social control that abominated pleasure and disdained the body (Foucault, 1986). The notion o f the apathetic God was thus diffused. These two building blocks o f traditional christological discourse (a spiritless and asexual male God) legitimised a system o f social relations and institutions based on patriarchal and authoritarian values. Maleness came to be associated with 'superior rationality, spirituality and authority, whereas femaleness was considered inferior and associated with emotions, embodiedness, and sensuality' (Goss, 1996:67). Queer Theology disrupts notions o f biblical validation o f such social systems by proclaiming that it is in Jesus' practice o f basilea, as well as in the expression o f his divine sexuality grounded in fiiendship, that evidence is to be found o f a radically political personage whose social utopia was much closer to the egalitarian values of 'gay spirit' than to the oppressive norms o f heterosexual society, 5.3.3. Ancient Queers: the historical evidence Effective revaluation of same-sex relationships within biblical texts can only take place if their existence can be demonstrated. Historical evidence, revealed by the historian John Boswell and utilised by the proponents o f Queer Theology, seems to suggest that in Europe religious ceremonies that celebrated same-sex unions date back to 400 BCE, and 169 existed throughout the Middle Ages (Boswell, 1994).! 1^ In the Greco-Roman world there were four broad types of same-sex relationships: male slaves who were exploited by their male owners; homosexual concubines, whose main purpose was the sexual fiilfilment of the master before his heterosexual marriage; and homosexual lovers, who could (or could not) consummate their relationship into a legal and spiritual bond that represented the same-sex alternative to heterosexual marriage (Boswell, 1994).120 In his analysis, Boswell asserts that the modem stereotypes of Greco-Roman homosexuality are faulty historical constmcts, and that the range o f homosexual relationships extended far beyond 'formal, brief interactions between an older \"lover\" and a \"beloved\" who is always considerably younger and generally somewhat passive. That this was the cultural myth, at least in fourth-century Athens, is beyond doubt.' Moreover, and perhaps most surprisingly, same-sex relationships between males were inextricably enmeshed with the military and democratic apparatus o f such societies, which idealised love between two men as the most 'stable' and 'heavenly' o f all human liaisons (Boswell, 1 9 9 4 :5 7). ^21 Despite the advance o f Christianity, which overshadowed all other ancient religions in Europe, social stractures and relational modes continued to be largely defined by ancient custom and religion. Although eroticism and sexual love were notions contrary to the emerging religion, the sexual abstinence o f the devout Christian was considered futile by 1 The Vatican and the Eastern Orthodox Church have refuted such evidence. ^20 Classical antiquity saw four broad types of heterosexual relationships: use, concubinage, marriage, and romance (Boswell, 1994:29). i21 The stability of homosexual love between males was proposed in the Hellenistic debate Affairs o f the Heart. It would appear that the Hellenistic debate was influenced by Plato's Symposium, which characterises heterosexual relationships as vulgar, and their same-sex counterparts as heavenly (Boswell, 1994:74). 170 the pagans, and morally questionable by the JewsJ^^ It took Christianity one thousand years to substitute priestly celibacy, monastic community life, and voluntary virginity (even within marriage) for the biological family as the ideal o f human existence. Consequently, marriage did not become a domain o f church affairs until the tenth century, and only after the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 did the church declare it a sacrament requiring ecclesiastical involvement (Boswell, 1994), In the East, however, marriage had become a public liturgical function for some time before 1215, The earliest Greek liturgical manuscript, Barberine 366, contained four types o f ceremonies celebrating sacramental union, one o f which consisted o f a 'prayer* for uniting two m e n , ^23 Barberini 366 is not the only example o f a ceremony celebrating the union o f same-sex citizens from societies that existed before the twelfth century. The monasteries o f Paris, Petersburg, and St, Catherine on Mount Sinai; the Greek basilian monastery o f Grotaferrata; and the Vatican all celebrated the union of same-sex coiq)les. These ceremonies continued throughout the sixteenth century and across the entirety o f the Christian world, and were featured in some o f the oldest Greek liturgical manuscripts known. Yet, after the twelfth century, and for reasons not well understood, Western Europe was swept by an increasingly negative attitude towards homosexuality. However, even as late as 1526, the Ottoman sultan Suleiman granted his same-sex partner, the count o f Siebenburgen, the governance o f half o f the city o f Budapest (Boswell, 1994). The difference between pagan and Christian attitudes is illustrated by the small number of vestal virgins, and by their reduced obligation towards virginity. In addition, pagan virgins were offered by their parents as children and did not enter freely into virginhood. Only marginal movements within Judaism, such as the Essenes, practised sexual abstinence. Rabbinic Judaism obligated reproduction (Boswell, 1994). 1^^ The other friree ceremonies for sacramental union contained in Barberini 336 were: two separate 'prayers' for heterosexual unions, and a ceremony for heterosexual betrodial (Boswell, 1994). 171 Despite the influence o f Boswell's work in the articulation o f Queer Theology as a resistance project, the openly gay historian has been accused o f being an 'advocacy scholar' Wiose 'pro-homosexual' research does not stand the scrutiny o f mainstream historical method (Weeks, 1980; Wright, Mark, Critics have found issue with almost all of Boswell's arguments. In his 1994 book Same-Sex Unions in Premodem Europe Boswell endeavoured to set the context o f religiously legitimised unions o f same-sex couples in ancient times. Boswell starts by showing that marriages in Greco-Roman antiquity constituted loveless dynastic arrangements in Wiich all members o f a household were thoroughly subordinated to a fiee-bom male. In addition, as the sexual needs o f free men were often not fulfilled within the marital environment it was quite common for satisfaction to he sought outside o f the blessed union. For that a whole assortment o f concubines, slaves, and other lovers o f either sex were easily available. The norm o f classical homosexual relationships was that o f an older man taking an 'active' role in the education o f his younger, 'passive' boy. However, homosexual relationships between equal adults were not necessarily disapproved of. In fact, as Plato suggested in Symposium, homosexual relationships between two free men might constitute the highest form of friendship. 1 ^4 It has been argued that several o f Boswell's translations in Same-Sex Unions in Premodem Europe are wrong, and that as a 'tendentious' historian he conveniently 172 ignored the context o f tiie ancient texts he examined (Brooten, 1996; Marie, 1997). Amongst many examples there is the apparent misinterpretation o f a Greek regulation for monks which, had it been correctly translated would invalidate a central notion o f Boswell's argument concerning the similarity between heterosexual and same-sex ceremonies. As such, the term adelphopoiesis is deemed wrongly translated; it does not mean 'same-sex' union, but a ceremony for ' b r o t h e r - m a k i n g , i25 jt does appear that the Church, especially the Eastern Churches, did officially approve and regulate the ceremony o f adelphopoiesis, and it may have been the case that the ceremony of adelphopoiesis was used at times to bind together pairs o f men who had homoerotic relationships. The contention is with Boswell's claim that adelphopoiesis was officially approved by the Church as a 'same-sex union' for homosexual liaisons between m e n . ^ 2 6 Not everybody disagrees with Boswell's work (Duberman, 1980; Moore, 1981); whether one agrees or disagree the important point for my argument is that Boswell's research has been widely influential in the construction o f a theology that resists the idea that to be gay is to be a sinner. 5 .4.- Gav Soul: resisting homophobia 124 Although Boswell provides several examples of such relationships, he fails to mention that elsewhere, both Plato and Aristotle, insist that homosexual activities should be forbidden in an ideal community (Scroogs, 1983). 125 The correct translation should have been 'Monks are forbidden from sponsoring children at baptism, serving as the best man at a wedding, or taking part in a rite o f, but Boswell's version reads 'Monks must also not select boys at baptism and make same-sex unions with them' (Boswell, 1984:29; Norton, 2002:46). 126 Confrary to Boswell's claims, there is evidence that in the Balkans, where the ceremony persisted after dying out elsewhere, an adelphopoiesis celebrated several kinds of 'brother-making' unions: between a man and a woman, between several men simultaneously or between one man and several others serially Norton, 2002). 173 Whereas Queer Theology tends to emphasise the similarity o f the metaphysical dimension o f the human condition o f homosexuality, the theological efforts I have identified as Gay Sou/ are articulated outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition. The dimensionality o f traditional religion that allows for the unity o f Queer Theology is not analogised in the plethora o f spiritual discourses characteristic o f the 'religious supermarket' o f the pluralistic societies o f the West. Thus, Gay Soul is usually articulated within an assemblage o f specificity that renders a unifying analysis o f the spiritual experiences o f homosexual men and women simplistic and erroneous. Moreover, extensive work on lesbian spirituality, which has been heavily influenced by feminist theology and hermeneutics, has been conducted e l s e w h e r e . ^27 Another clarification that needs to be made is that the focus o f my analysis is not the countless spiritual practices of urban gay men, but the recurring themes observable across the realm o f spiritual techniques and practices in Wiich such individuals engage in. Until recently, spiritual self-questioning in gay communities was not really prolific. However, the AIDS crisis has given it considerable impetus as many o f the members of the subculture, besieged by death and suffering, have sought answers for their predicament in the spiritual realm. 5.4.1.- Reclaiming the Shamanic Past By proposing the notion o f a separate spiritual identity. Gay Soul shifts the hierarchical patterns o f social interaction between gay selves and mainstream society by positing that only through the realisation and appreciation o f the unique attributes o f an essentialist See, fO T example, Geariiart and Johnson (1974). 174 spirit can gay-identified individuals realise their full human potential. In this process o f spiritual and social re-empowerement, contemporary homosexual identity is linked to a mythological past enchanted by spiritual predecessors embodied in the gender-bending, homosexual individuals o f traditional societies upon whom shamanic powers were once bestowed (such as the nadle, 'the changers' of the North American Indian tribe Navajo). The shaman of traditional societies occupied a specialised role that was conferred upon him or her afier profound experiences o f 'sickness, dreams and ecstasies' had been endured. Such individuals were initiated into rituals where techniques o f the sacred were learned, and special status as spiritual guides and agents of transformation thus achieved (Eliade, 1964). Gay Soul argues that only the gay-identified individual is able to partake, on a (sub)culture-wide level, in the shamanistic inner journey o f symbolic death and rebirth. Such transformation is e?q)erienced twice: first in the 'coming-out' process whereby the old, specious social self sheds its skin in order for the rectified, self-identified gay individual to be (re)bom; second, in the fimdamental association o f AIDS with the subculture's identity, the shamanistic journey is experienced both on the individual level and on the socio-cultural dimension through collective representations o f the health crisis. Generally, the deep experiences o f pain and alienation internalised during the process o f growing-up as the 'other', in conjunction with the unparalleled levels o f stigma and suffering occasioned by AIDS, endow gay individuals with a 'knowing' that is unique and exclusive to their (sub)culture. Gay Soul rescues gay individuals from patriarchal damnation and unrepented death by bestowing upon them a luminous quality of being, an 175 \"otherness' that accentuates the gifts o f compassion, empathy, healing, interpretation and enabling (Thompson, 1987). More specifically and expressly modelled on the figure of the Native American shaman berdache, the quasi-religious group Radical Faeries was established in 1979. The berdache was usually a man who exhibited feminine behavioural traits. However, the less firequent instance o f the female berdache, a woman who presented masculine behaviour, also existed. The philosophy o f the Radical Faeries focuses on the transformative role that gay individmds perform inasmuch as they constitute a third gender. Its founder Harry Hay is the same man who established the first American gay political organisation, the Mattachine Society, thirty years earlier. Gay persons are separated firom the rest o f society not only by their deviant sexuality but also by the intensity o f their own human and spiritual experience: thus, they occupy a liminal social position fix)m which to enlighten the rest o f society. The inherent liminality o f homosexuality - produced by its location somewhere in between, as well as beyond, mainstream sexual identifications - is intensified by an epidemic that places gay bodies at the very firontier of life and death. It is not only the soul of the gay individual that finds salvation but its repository as well. Despite, or perhaps as a result of, the gay body's continual association with sin and disease. Gay Soul repeatedly and emphatically presents it as the sacred repository o f divine essence. As such, the gay body fimctions as a metaphor for the subculture's proposed earthly mission of saving the planet through mediating, restructuring and reinventing the social structures which regulate the relationship between the physical and the social body. In linking the secular process o f 'coming-out' to an inner process o f shamanistic spiritual discovery, Gay Soul contends 176 that philosophical and metaphysical answers to the condition o f being gay cannot be answered solely with reference to the social level. Sexual self-acceptance, within the context o f 'safer-but-free' discourse o f the AIDS generation, represents the only pathway to the integration o f flesh and spirit without which the social and spiritual potential o f the gay self cannot be realised Salvation is thus articulated both on the personal and society-wide level. 1^^ In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic cultural gay discourse preached safe sex and the reduction of sexu^ partners and encounters (if not monogamy) as the most efficient preventimi against HIV. Such discourse has been subtly transformed into one of 'safer sex' (the parameters of what constitutes 'safe' sex have not only been widened but also questioned) without its pairing with a reduction in sexual activity. 177 Chapter 6 AIDS Dissent: Resisting (Re)m edicalisation I'm afraid you've got an alternative illness (NB) 6.1.- AIDS Activism: setting the ground for future resistance In his book Impure Science, Epstein (1996:14-19) analyses the social processes through which the opposing knowledges and 'truth-claims' about HIV and AIDS have been constructed. In attempting to delineate the 'pathways' through which certainty has been established, and how the nexus knowledge/power has been articulated in the context of the American health crisis, Epstein argues that knowledge about AIDS has emerged out o f 'credibility struggles'. Scientific credibility - 'the capacity o f claim-makers to enrol supporters behind their argument, legitimate those arguments as authoritative knowledge, and present themselves as the sort o f people who can voice the truth' - has been problematised by the poUtical nature o f HIV/AIDS. Multilateral 'credibility struggles' have broadened the spectrum o f potentially plausible pathways, as well as the range of pertinent truth-claimers, and thus muddled the boundary between 'scientific' and 'folk' knowledges to the point where 'the very mechanisms for the assessment o f credibility' are being questioned. Competing cultural narratives that often overlap, subvert and/or reinforce each other surround acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). These multiple stories, constructed and compounded upon that traditionally meaning-laden entity, the body o f the male homosexual, have generated an 'epidemic o f signification' (Treichler, 1988). As such, the synchronous dispute over the biological, social, moral and 178 etiological dimensions o f AIDS can be grouped into two main areas o f contest: causation and treatment. In the beginning o f the AIDS crisis networks o f local initiatives and political action groups emerged within 'gay communities'. Such grass-root organisations played a very important role in the unfolding o f the (localised) epidemic inasmuch as they constituted die only source o f support for those first affected by the syndrome. Moreover, in their strongly critical stance on governmental and media attitudes these organisations provided a basis for the development o f AIDS activism, or the AIDS Movement. AIDS activism constitutes the ground for what has been called 'politics o f treatment', i.e. the contested political, socio-economic, and scientific processes, through which allopathic anti-HIV treatment has found its way into the bodies o f HTV-diagnosed individuals. Although this politics o f treatment was not the first in challenging medical authority, no other group o f treatment-activists has ever been able to achieve such a degree o f modification in the politics and methodologies o f scientific research and practice. AIDS activism has altered the conduct o f clinical research by changing the 'ground rules for the social construction o f belief through the questioning o f the processes via which medical trials are interpreted. As such, AIDS activism has occasioned a relative but substantial modification in the stringent rules o f the American 'gatekeeper' federal body Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Epstein, 1996:181-329). The resistance project embodied by such a 'politics o f treatment' represents a highly successfiil initiative inasmuch as it has not only fimdamentally altered processes o f 179 scientific research, but has also simplified access routes to allopathic treatment. By resisting established norms o f scientific conduct, the HIV-positive activists o f the AIDS movement have achieved unparalleled successes in producing significant social change. As such, these individuals have been able to directly benefit firom the articulation o f their desired goal of 'drugs into our bodies now' (Epstein, 1996). In the present chapter I shall focus on another 'micrological' strategy o f resistance. The Dissident Movement also concerns itself with scientific issues around HIV/AIDS, but its transformative goals go well beyond issues o f easier access to treatment. The dissident movement claims that the scientific procedures that have established the truth(s) about AIDS rest on shaky ground. Consequently, the movement constitutes a radical initiative that challenges the very scientific notions vHhich have constructed the knowledge(s) o f HIV and AIDS. However, it is important to note that as a sociological analysis the present chapter makes absolutely no claim on the scientific credibility or veracity of either the medical or the dissident 'truth-claims'. My goal here is simply to analyse the social processes through which such claims are accepted, rejected, or contested. 6.2.- Is it Cancer? Is it GRID? No. it's AIDS: Wiat a difference a name makes The contraction o f the severe pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii by five 'active homosexuals', announced by the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 30 on the fifth o f June o f 1981, rang the first alarm bells o f the impeding AIDS crisis. These five men had a lot in common: they all lived in the American state o f California; they were all young (twenty-nine to thirty-six years old); they all suffered firom candidiasis; 180 they were all infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV); they all used 'poppers'. 1^^ One of them was an intravenous drug user, and three o f them showed a significant depletion in their T-lymphocyte population (in the other two, lymphocyte population had not been studied). 1 3 \u00ae Three o f these individuals had been patients of Joel Weisman, a Los Angeles physician whose clientele was mainly composed of gay men. Since late 1979 Dr. Weisman had noticed a marked increase in cases of a mononucleosis-like syndrome among his gay patients. Such a syndrome was characterised by fever, weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes. These patients also suffered from diarrhoea, and from oral and anal candidiasis. Initially, Weisman thought his patients were suffering from cytomegahc disease, which since 1956 had been linked to CMV. Although it was known that 94% o f the Californian homosexual community was infected with CMV at the time, the widespread virus only caused fatal lesions in immunologically impaired newborns. There was no effective treatment for the mononucleosis-like syndrome, but Weisman's patients had so far recovered spontaneously (Grmek, 1990). In February o f 1981 one o f Weisman's patients did not spontaneously recover from the fevers and the dianfroea, and was hospitalised in the immunology division o f the University o f California at Los Angeles (UCLA) hospital. Once this patient had been hospitalised, it was found that his lymphocyte profile was severely damaged; PCP was Candidiasis is fungal disorder of the mucous membrmies. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that belongs to the herpes virus family; die great majority of American homosexuals had been infected by it before the onset of AIDS (Grmek, 1990). 'Poppers' (a reference to the sound of breaking made when the original medicinal ampoules were cracked open) are nitrites, a salt or ester of nitrous acid, that were first used to dilate blood vessels in the treatment of angina. 'Poppers' were (and still are) widely used as aphrodisiac inhalants. The sale of 'poppers' has been banned in the USA, but in the UK and Europe it continues to be widely available (Shenton, 1998). ^30 See discussion of T-lymphocyte cells CD4 and CDS in 6.4.2, 181 also diagnosed. Soon it was discovered that another four gay men, with exactly the same diagnoses o f Weisman* s patient, had been recently hospitalised in the Los Angeles area. The severity o f the disease frightened the doctors (and the patients). Despite the intensive treatment directed mainly against the PCP, two o f them rapidly died, and the other three showed no signs of recovery. The first 'active homosexual' died in March o f 1981. He had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1978, and treated successfully with radiotherapy. Yet, at autopsy no trace o f Hodgkin's disease was found. Had the ante mortem diagnosis been wrong? What indeed had caused the fierce death o f such a young man? The CDC report 30 speculated that as 'the occurrence o f pneumocystosis in these five previously healthy individuals without a clinically apparent underlying immunodeficiency is unusual' there must have been 'an association between some aspects o f homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through sexual contacts and Pneumocystis pneumonia in this population.' Infection by CMW was hypothesised as the most probable etiologic cofactor (quoted in Grmek, 1990:5). As soon as 1979 the rumour that a 'gay cancer' was spreading among the homosexual communities o f New York and San Francisco began to spread. Dr. Linda Laubenstein of the haematology division o f New York University's Medical Center had, in the fall of 1979, diagnosed Kaposis's sarcoma (KS), a rare form o f skin cancer, in a young homosexual man. Soon after that another case, again in a young homosexual man, was recognised in the Brooklyn Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center. Interestingly, both patients had fiiends in common. By March o f 1981 eight cases o f an aggressive form o f this sarcoma had been identified in three New York hospitals. Still, the 182 appearance o f eight cases in two years in a city as huge and diverse as New York would not necessarily raise many eyebrows. Until then KS had been a relatively benign chronic disorder that invariably afflicted mostly (90%) older males o f specific ethnicity. However, these eight cases were completely anomalous: they were acutely malignant (of the first eight diagnosed individuals four were already dead), and they were all in homosexuals. In San Francisco, the first diagnosis o f KS was made in April o f 1981. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 30 o f July, 4 1981, entitled 'Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis pneumonia among homosexual men - New York City and California', informed the medical community that since early 1979 KS had been diagnosed in twenty- six men, twenty in New York and six in California. O f these twenty-six men eight had died in less than two years; twenty-five were white; six suffered firom pneumonia (PCP pneumonia in at least four); four firom toxoplasmosis o f the central nervous system; one firom cryptococcal meningitis; twelve tested positive for CMV (the other fourteen had not been tested); and none of them was heterosexual (Grmek, 1990). Initial medical theorising about the syndrome had been finmed by the notion that it was not an infectious disease. The first time such a model was proposed was in an article published in the New York Times on July 3,1981. In his 'Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals', Dr. Lawrence Altman, medical reporter for the newspaper, first articulated what would arguably become the most common theme in mainstream media coverage o f the syndrome. A highly sexualised life-style, or a sexual promiscuity responsible for a succession o f sexually transmitted iofections, seemed to be the strongest 183 link between male homosexuality and the disease.!^ 1 The plausibility o f the 'immune- overload' hypothesis was grounded on the appearance o f the syndrome (mainly) among homosexuals. 1^^ However, the implicit assumption that the new disease was essentially associated with (homo)sexuality related to the notion that the promiscuity o f homosexuals was inherently linked with (the) illness. In addition, the notion of a 'homosexual hazard' in disease causation, as well as the reported increase o f drug use among gay men, was deemed sufhcient to explain why the syndrome was taking hold o f such a social group at that specific time.*^^ As such, the 'immune overload' model, grounded on the normalising fimction o f an epidemiological science that ignored heterosexual cases o f AIDS, was initially favoured over the hypothesis o f a single infectious agent. The problem with this hypothesis, also known as 'antigen overload', was that it did not explain why the apparently new syndrome had not affected homosexuals o f other eras. Moreover, by concentrating on the health hazards of gays in the 'fast lane' the 'immune overload' hypothesis failed to extend its aetiological fiameworic to include other, soon to be significantly affected, 'risk-groups'. The 'promiscuity paradigm' would have seriously detrimental consequences not only for the public perception o f homosexuals, but also for ^ At this point, lesbians' exclusion from the syndrome was deemed to be the result of a sexuality much less 'promiscuous' and much more contained than that of their male counterparts (Epstein, 1996). One of the central voices of the 'immune overload hypothesis' was the community doctor Joseph Sonnabend, whose practice in New York's Greenwich Village focused on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases of male homosexuals. Such a bombardment to the immune system, in conjunction wifri drug abuse, was deemed to be the cause of the immune collapse observed in the affected homosexuals. (Epstein, 1996). 133 See 6.S.3.2. for a discussion of die notion of the 'homosexual hazard*. 184 the self-conceptualisations o f homosexuals themselves (Epstein, 1996)J^^ The 'immune- overload' hypothesis lost ground when, in the December 10, 1981 issue o f the New England Journal o f Medicine, Gottlieb et al described the appearance o f the disease in two exclusively heterosexual males; in one o f them CMV had been found in the sperm. It was hence hypothesised that repeated reinfection with CMV was the cause of destroyed immune ftmction. However, as it was a well-established fact that most American homosexuals were infected with CMW this hypothesis was also inadequate in explaining the syndrome. A cofactor, 'the veritable cause', had to be the culprit. Another aetiological model for the disease was thus proposed: a multifactorial model where equal weight was given to the role o f infection, drug use, and genetic p r e d i s p o s i t i o n . G 5 The diagnosis of the syndrome in heterosexual individuals (8% of total cases) suggested a role for blood in the transmission of the infectious agent. It seemed increasingly plausible that the infectious route was similar to that of the hepatitis-B virus (Grmek, 1990:15).*^^ The notion that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was probably transmitted by a viral agent through the blood system was strengthened by the Chapter seven explores the issue of how such conceptualisations affect the construction of the homosexual identity within the context of my empirical data. This multifactorial model, however, could not explain what kind of chemical substance homosexuals were more exposed to. 'Poppers' was utilised by many, but no evidence existed of the role of nitrates in the destruction of the immune system. Also, it was equally difficult to explain how repeated reinfection could exhaust the immune system; the notion that semen, when inserted into the rectum, might act as an immunosuppressant was first proposed (Gmerk, 1990). 136 The term virus was first employed in the nineteenth century to 'describe any substance capable of multiplying within an organism and making it sick.' It was applied to all pathogens. In 1903 Emile Roux published a review of the nine pathogens known which were 'infiamicroscopic'. The term virus, subsequently only applied to these 'so-called invisible microbes', refers to pathogens that can reproduce like other like forms when in contact with appropriate living cells. As such, viruses are fundamentally different fi' om bacteria. Bacteria live off their host, but have their own metabolic and reproductive mechanisms. Viruses are absolute parasites, which reproduce through foreign cellular elements (Grmek, 1990:49-50). 185 identification of the syndrome in haemophiliacs in the summer o f 1982. Haemophilia constitutes a rare hereditary bleeding disorder. Factor VIII, the blood-clotting agent injected in haemophiliacs to treat their condition, is filtered to remove bacteria, fimgi, and protozoa. With all the known pathogens removed firom factor VIII the causal agent could only be a virus. A viral hypothesis for AIDS had been favoured fi' om the beginning, and the notion that an animal virus had become pathogenic to humans seemed plausible. It was hypothesised that pigs brought firom Angola by Cubans might be responsible for AIDS, but AIDS patients tested negative for these agents. Whatever was causing AIDS nobody knew but the fiightening fact was that by late 1982 the syndrome had begun to spread among heterosexuals. However, most such heterosexuals belonged to the 'Five-H Club'; an unenvied collective composed o f Haitians, heroin addicts, haemophiliacs, and hookers. As such, so far AIDS really afflicted only 'marginal' groups, stigmatised a priori by deviant behaviour, ethnicity, or genetic flaw.^^^ The discovery o f HIV would not happen until 1984 but by May o f 1982 the CDC issued a protocol hypothesising that the new syndrome was a sexually transmitted viral infection. The causative agent was postulated to be 'a common virus producing new effects as a result o f certain environmental factors, or one o f several novel agents, e.g., mutant or recombinant strains o f human or animal pathogens' (Grmek, 1990:32). 137 CMV had seemed as the most likely culprit, but also the Epstein-Bair, which causes mononucleosis and Burkitt's lymphoma in Africans virus, had been suspected (Grmek, 1990). The problem with the attribution of AIDS to infection with CMV, or with Epstein-Barr, was that bofri were well-established viruses with well-known pathological manifestations. Such a fundamental change in their disease-causation properties would virtually amount to the birth of a completely new virus. 138 In 1982 researchers from the University of Miami noticed that a number of Dade county residents presented the symptoms of AIDS. None of these individuals were homosexual, or addicts; they were all, however, Haitian. Later it was established tiiat many such Haitians had entered into homosexual relationships not by personal preference, but due to economic necessity (Grmek, 1990). 186 In the beginning o f 1982 the 'gay cancer' had been identified in fifteen American states, by the end o f that year AIDS had become a global 'epidemic' present in thirty-three countries (Garfield, 1995). The public perception of the syndrome had evolved from a disease o f poorly regarded minorities to a potential threat to mainstream society. The first allopathic therapeutic response would not emerge until two years after the discovery of HIV in 1984. Consequently, for the first three years (at least) o f the health crisis AIDS patients and the possibly at-risk population o f the 'worried-well' had to look elsewhere for at best a 'cure', at worse a 'palliative' (Hay, 1984). 6.3.- Holism and AIDS: beginning to resist the medical model 6.3 .1 - The Role of AIDS in the Advancement of Holistic Medicine The anthology o f aetiological speculation surrounding the looming prospects o f the AIDS threat was abruptly brought to a halt in 1984. That which the religiously-inclined had interpreted to be the prophesized juggernaut o f doomsday was in fact just a virus. However, simple as that virus might have been its isolation did not translate into a relatively efficacious treatment until the development of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) twelve years later, 'Innocent victims' of the disease, i.e., recipients of blood timisfusions and newborns infected in utero, were excluded from such undesirable membership (Grmek, 1990:32). 1^\u00ae Only with the introduction of HAART in 1996 did the medical system finally devise a 'truly important' therapy for HTV and AIDS (Standish et at, 2002: xiii). 187 The first Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiretroviral drug for HIV infection was Zidovudine (AZT). The actual benefits o f AZT were highly contested, and many critics argued that AZT was not only worsening the disease but hastening the deterioration o f the immune system and causing death (Hodgkinson, 1996; Epstein, 1996).^^' Treatment with AZT and AZT-like drugs (known as nucleoside analog drugs) remained the mainstay o f HTV medical treatment until the development o f antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996J^^ ART involved the combination o f two or three drugs in the treatment o f infection; an increase not only in the quantity o f the ingested drugs but in their quality as well. A newly developed antiretroviral class o f drug, the powerful protease inhibitors (PI), had been developed and was used in the new 'combination therapies', conamonly referred to as 'drug cocktails'. ART soon evolved into HAART, a 'cocktail' o f as many as four different types of antiretroviral drugs, which should be AZT emerged out of the effort by the American National Institute of Health, the so-called VirusCancer Program of the 1950s and 1960s, to develop a chemotherapy to fight cancer. AZT, invented in 1964 under the VirusCancer program, was one such drug. When AZT was tested on cancer-ridden mice it failed to cure the cancer, and fijither research on the compound was abandoned. The drug, however, did destroy all the rat's healthy growing tissues, and they all died fi*om extreme toxicity. AZT, a DNA terminator, suffocated aU cells, cancerous or not When HTV was identified, the drug was rediscovered in the shelves of its manufacturer. Burroughs Wellcome. The political pressure of AIDS activism for a quick solution facilitated the FDA approval of AZT without the enactment of its usual stringent scientific procedures (Cohen, 1987; Lauristen, 1990). The claim that AZT actually caused death remains controversial. However, AZT does cause anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and serious gastrointestinal complications (Standish et al, 2002). Moreover, symptoms attributed to HIV infection can be caused by consumption of AZT (Kremer et al, 1996). AZT, also called retrovir or azidotfaymidine, is used to block the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which the HTV virus is thought to use in order to convert viral genes in DNA messages inside the nucleus of white cells. Ahhougfi the inefficiency of AZT in treating HTV infection was suggested by the highly contested Concorde trials, many remained unconvinced of the drug's harmfulness (Hodgkinson, 1996; Epstein, 1996). Critics argue tiiat AZT is a highly toxic drug absorbed through the DNA gamma-polymerase into the energy centres of a// body cells, the mitochondria. In addition, AZT is perceived amongst many HIV- infected individuals to be highly toxic, and to have been responsible for many of the deaths attributed to AIDS. 'Combination therapy', which uses a combination of new protease transcriptase inhibitor drugs has been heralded as a new cure. Since 1995 'improved therapeutic regimes and developments' have allowed the shift fi-om the monotherapy of AZT to the 'combination therapy' of protease inWbitors. As such, the 'management and monitoring' of HIV patients has undergone fundamental changes. The new approach, unlike reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT, blocks HIV protease, which is used by the virus in 188 taken before the development o f any symptoms. The medical system's inability to deliver a substantive palliative to the greatest health threat of modem times for the fifteen years that lapsed between 1981 and 1996 caused a serious questioning o f orthodox medicine as a universal model o f healing. Hence, the 'void' that opened when medicine failed was, to a certain extent, filled by the alternative or complementary medicine paradigm. These unorthodox medical systems did not claim to be able to heal AIDS; what they claimed to offer was a comprehensive approach that would concentrate on the 'healing' o f the 'person' rather than the 'cure' o f the 'patient'. The new medical system, moreover, offered hope when the 'HIV=AIDS=death school of thought seemed endemic in conventional medical settings', and acceptance at a time when most AIDS patients were treated as pariahs (Standish et al, 2002:1). As such, many HIV-infected individuals searched for salvation, and resisted the demise o f their allopathically-condemned lives, in the hands o f 'holistic' healers whose very existence was a direct outcome o f the New Age Movement. 6.3.2.- The New Age: a time for healing The New Age Movement constitutes a blend o f pagan religions. Eastern philosophies, and occult-psychic phenomena. The movement's ultimate goal is the transformation of the self and, consequently, o f society as a whole (York, 1995). As an international social movement the New Age emerged in the late 1960s. However, this modem movement is more adequately conceived as the latest manifestation of the 'cultic miUeu'. The 'cultic assembling virus particles from building blocks made inside cells. However, resistance often occurs and 'combination therapy' is often also ineffective (Batsis, 2000:22). 189 milieu' bloomed with the Enlightenment, especially after Protestantism and the first major movements o f religious sceptical thinking had destroyed any plausible remnants o f medieval magic. Such metaphysical and occult traditions have traditionally accompanied Christianity (Campbell, 1972; Melton, 1991). The scientific thought o f the eighteenth and nineteenth century provided fertile ground for the 'cultic milieu', whose leaders eagerly adopted enlightened ideas o f natural law and evolution to create a new alternative spiritual cosmology. Modem New Age metaphysical practices, whose western genesis can be traced to the ascendancy o f Eastern religion and transpersonal psychology in the 1960s, trudged on to become a successful movement that reflects non-conventional forms o f religiosity. These unusual expressions o f religiosity are articulated through loosely connected networks of ideologically related groups and organisations. ^ The decentralised movement is concerned with ecological issues, holism, empowerment politics, and new understandings o f education and o f citizenship. Yet, the New Age's primary focus is the transformation o f the self through healing. New Age transformation comes in the form of healing: healing o f the body, mind, of relationships, as well as o f the effect o f spiritual traumas. These unorthodox healing modalities are often procured after the failure o f physicians o f the more culturally Examples of early metaphysicians whose work was heavily based on scientific ideas include Swedenborgianism, Mesmerism, and Theosophy. Emanuel Swendenborg, one of Sweden's leading scientists, the first to hypothesise the nebular origin of the universe, analysed the relationship between the material and the spiritual word through his occult practice of Swedenborgianism. Mesmerism was the creation of the Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer who attempted to articulate a scientific model of a healing power stemming from sacred spiritual energy. The Theosophical Society, founded at the end of the nineteenth century, combined the latest scientific findings and the principles of the metaphysical movement in order to elaborate a pseudo-scientific world cosmology (Melton, 1991). More than ten million Americans draw on resources provided by the New Age movement. In Britain there are at least thirteen New Age publications whereas in the United States at least one hundred such magazines exist (Heelas, 1996:113). 190 accepted variety, be they medical doctors or psychiatrists. As the New Age Movement developed, it accepted into itself a concurrently developing movement that was taking a fresh look not only at traditional alternative healing arts, but at the possibility o f treating conditions with which orthodox medicine and Freudian psychiatry were having the most difficulty. Many o f these alternative medicines had 'a common ideological base and shared common beliefs with the New Age Movement, hence their merger seemed logical' (Melton, 1991:169). As such, the central idea which linked the holistic health movement and the New Age was the notion o f self-responsibility. The individual self is understood as entirely responsible for his or her actions, and for the necessary steps in order to achieve a transformation, an improvement, a healing o f one's life.^^^ The New Age might have started o ff as a utopian movement typical of the 1960s whose long-tenn influence might have been analogised as an ephemeral spiritual Woodstock; yet, its offshoot has had a considerable effect in altering notions o f health throughout the western world. 6.3.3.- The Growth o f Holism Since the 1970s 'many holistic health methodologies have enjoyed a marked increase in acceptance among the established medical community' (Melton, 1991:170). Holism had The notion that the individual is responsible for his/her own disease contains the possibility for the healing of disease as long as the person correctly modifies whatever patterns of behaviour, and/or removes the physical blockages, which are impeding the presence of health. Especially in the early years of the health crisis this was a very encouraging perspective to AIDS patients who had been left with no clue not only about what caused the disease but also on how to palliate it. On the other hand, the same notion of self-responsibility could also mean that gay men were responsible for their plight due to their inherently warped characteristics, and as such deserve their fate. The work of Louise Hay, a spiritual healer from Los Angeles who wrote the immensely popular book 'You Can Heal Your Life*, attracted a great following of gay men in the late 1980s. Her approach offered AIDS victims and what she called the 'worried weU* the hope lhat by changing thought patterns healing could occur. At the same time. Hay's work also attracted a lot of criticism for 'blaming the victim* (Hay, 1984). 191 been a debated concept within the philosophy o f science much before the holistic health movement, spumed by a number o f serious books on the emerging concepts o f health, emerged in the late 1960s (Dubos, 1968; Montagu, 1971; Carlson, 1975). The emergence o f these new (in the West) conceptions o f health translated into the appearance o f a number o f holistic health centres whose foundations arose from the free clinic movement o f the 1960s.^'*^ The first holistic health centre, modelled on the Greek healing temples of Aesculapius, the Greek god o f healing, was founded in California in 1958. In Britain, the ground was also fertile for the evolution o f the holistic health movement; in 1959 the Westbank Healing and Teaching Centre was founded in Scotland and the Naturopathic Research Group established in England. In 1974 an organisation dedicated solely to the research and development o f natural therapies, the Healing Research Trust, was started in Surrey. The turning point for the movement, however, was the founding o f the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA) in 1978 (Melton, 1991:169-173). The evolution in western conceptions regarding * alternative' medicine reflects the unexpected process o f enfranchisement that such non-western systems underwent in the 1990s. In the 1970s and 1980s these disciplines were mainly provided as an alternative to conventional health care and hence became collectively known as \"alternative medicine'. The medical system initially viewed such systems o f healing as an exotic and primitive moil o f notions which would stand no ground under the scrutiny o f scientific methods. However, as an increasing number o f patients - especially HIV patients - continued to resort to these obscure systems o f healing, the initial disdain which characterised most of Holistic health clinics differed from free clinics inasmuch as the latter were physician-centred and the former client-centred. The client-centred approach enabled patients to pick and choose among all the 192 the attitude o f western medicine evolved into a more positive stance o f co-operation As such, HIV physicians, whose many patients were also avid consumers of 'alternative' or 'holistic' medical systems, became increasingly aware o f the many benefits bestowed upon their patients by these previously unfamiliar healing systems. Thus 'alternative' medical systems began to be utilised in conjxmction with what now became known as 'complementary' medicine, a term that developed as the two systems began to be used alongside (to 'complement') each other. Such relational shift, where the understanding of 'complementary' or 'alternative' medicine (CAM) has evolved from the subjugated relation between unconventional and conventional healthcare to a categorisation of the unconventional disciplines themselves, has produced what is now viewed as a legitimate system o f healing.Hence the emerging integrative medicine movement was spawned.The full integration o f holistic and allopathic medicine - the 'integrated care model' - is currently still just a vision (or a mirage rather). However, that such a possibility can even be envisioned attests to the influence o f the New Age movement where a legitimised CAM represents the movement's most fiintful derivative (Melton, 1995). available treatments (Melton, 1991). N7 7 0% of HIV-diagnosed individuals in the United Status use some form of alternative medicine to treat their HTV disease (Standish et al 2002;xiii). One in five people in the UK use some form of complementary medicine (Wright, Johnston, and Bennet; 2003). 16% of GPs in Britain say that they have prescribed some type of complementary medicine in their careers (Wright, Johnston, and Bennet; 2003). 149 The motion towards integrative medicine has been thrust forward by health consumers who are beginning to demand that many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices be included in conventional health settings, be they within the parameters of a nationalised health service like the NHS or privately organised and paid for like in the US. However, as an emerging movement the goals of the integrative medicine movement are fer from being neatly defined. Does integrative medicine aim at providing patients with multiple modalities, or should it constitute a collaborative effort between two 193 6.3.4.- Holistic Health and AIDS: practicing what it preaches Holistic or alternative medicine is grounded on the essential principle that dis-ease is a product o f some kind of imbalance in the three dimensional structure that constitutes a human being: the physical, the emotional, and/ or the spiritual dimensions. Patients are viewed as people not as a collection o f impersonal symptoms. As such, living systems constitute a gestalt and no disease can be reduced to its physical symptoms. Holistic medicine became a buzzword for any therapeutic technique which did not fit the mechanist conception o f the human body espoused by western medicine. To be truly holistic a therapeutic strategy must include a combination o f practices which address the physical, emotional, and spiritual requirements o f each particular individual. Founded on the conception o f human beings as an integral component o f nature, and o f a nature constantly engaged in a flux o f rebalancing and regeneration, holistic medicine argues that dis-ease will take hold when nature and its processes are warped. Analogously, if the 'life-energy' or 'vital energy' is blocked or tainted by unnatural antigens or products, as well as by emotional or spiritual distortions, health may only be re-established once these physical or ethereal blocks have been cleared. Blockages are removed through a plethora o f techniques, many o f which come together in 'naturopathy', a holistic system Wiich uses healing practices limited to natural means. Such techniques and their associated remedies - be they nutritional substances, body manipulation, psychological techniques. independent fields? Another issue is that by fusing with conventional medical practices and settings CAM might be appropriated by a medical system that functions under a completely different set of assumptions. 194 or spiritual healing - are conceptualised not as direct healing agents but as agents of the universal life force. In the first years of the epidemic AIDS victims (as they were then called) 'dropped like flies'. Their deaths were painful and their physical deterioration ghastly; the social ostracism they encountered then is unimaginable today. So-called 'innocent' victims, such as children or haemophiliacs who had not acquired the disease through (homo)sex, were submitted to much prejudice. Children were barred from school, dying patients were refused medical treatment, and landlords expelled their sick tenants. Gay men in particular, whose presumed promiscuous nature had apparently triggered the spreading disease, were exposed to magnified intolerance as they were considered guilty' o f their own predicament. In the early years o f the health crisis medical and governmental agencies showed very little interest in a disease that seemed to only affect disenfranchised sections of society. The alternative medicine community responded to AIDS in a different way. Some within such community traditionally distrusted the hugely profitable pharmaceutical companies and their expensive drugs whereas others questioned the idea that a virus caused the syndrome. The important factor in the evolution o f the close association between HTV and complementary medicine was that many desperate patients looked towards the alternative medical paradigm for some sort of solution to their problem. At a time when people with AIDS faced bigotry and rejection from most factions o f mainstream society many New Age therapists, AIDS healers, or alternative therapists were willing to provide AIDS patients with more than potentially Holistic medicine includes dozens of alternative therapies and medical systems such as: Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, macrobiotics, osteopathy, hydrotherapy, psycosynthesis, gestalt therapy. 195 beneficial compounds such as Chinese herbs; they treated the victims like people and gave them hope. In a typically holistic perspective it had been postulated that as gay individuals had such internalised levels of hatred it was not surprising that they should have been so disproportionately affected (Hay, 1984). The only way to heal oneself from AIDS would thus be through 'inner work'; only when the spirit was mended could health be physically manifested. Such a multidimensional model proposed to treat AIDS victims by focusing not only on their physical well-being but also, perhaps mainly, on their emotional and spiritual dimensions. Alternative therapies constitute non-invasive, gentle techniques where individual attention is given to each patient. These techniques attempt to balance the individual's vital energy by creating a safe environment where the patient, with the help o f the practitioner, may be able to access his/her own healing powers. The momentum o f CAM in the last decades is directly related to its mobilisation around the AIDS issue. The fundamental fact to remember is that during the first years o f the AIDS crisis the holistic health movement constituted the most important tool to resist the medically-imposed model o f AIDS=death. The subsequent discovery o f HIV and the consequent medical appropriation o f the meaning o f AIDS changed all that. Yet, the m\u00e9dicalisation o f AIDS did not cause the demise o f CAM in the context o f the needs o f people living with HTV. In fact, had the AIDS crisis never occurred, the current initiative to integrate the medical system and the holistic paradigm might have never emerged (Standish et al, 2002). Jungian therapy, herbalism, homeopathy, therapeutic touch and many o\u00fciers. 196 6 3 .5,- The Gentle Approach: docs it 'rcallv* worit:? The 'Bastyr University's Alternative Medicine Care Outcomes in AIDS' (AMCCA) represents the most comprehensive American investigation o f the use o f holistic medicine among HIV-positive Americans to date. One-thousand-six-hundred-and-sixty-six HIV- diagnosed individuals who self-identify as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users were studied between 1995 and 1997. Such individuals reported using a total o f one-thousand-four-hundred-and-ninety-two CAM therapies for HTV disease. However, a staggering low number o f these therapies have been clinically evaluated: forty-five randomised clinical trials have ever been conducted, and within these trials only twenty-four o f the one-thousand-four-hundred-and-ninety-two CAM therapies for HIV disease have been appraised.'The close relationship between AIDS treatment activism and the holistic health movement helped to occasion the mainstreaming o f a small number o f CAM therapies which are now prescribed by allopathic physicians, covered by insurance companies, and offered free o f charge at the National Health Service.In addition, in 1992 the National Institutes o f Health (NIH) in the United States established the Office o f Alternative Medicine (GAM) to scientifically study alternative medicine. Despite the fact that the GAM opened ten research centres in the United States between 1994 and 1997 (including the Bastyr centre), and that the use o f CAM is widely diffused among the infected population, the fact remains that the scientific community's ignorance This data refers to studies published in peer-reviewed journals which had an abstract in English despite the country of publication. Only some of these studies were also placebo controlled (Standish et al, 2002). '^2 The most common CAM therapies to have been mainstreamed are Chinese Medicine (including herbs), some forms of body manipulation such as therapeutic touch, and nutritional medicine. 197 o f the potentially adverse or beneficial effects of CAM therapies in HIV disease still lingers Medical research on AIDS faces many obstacles. If the research approach is allopathic there are several complicating factors: the putative causative agent (HIV) is thought to be mutable; there are several contributory factors to the pathogenesis of AIDS; and immune supportive therapeutic strategies are debatable inasmuch as there is much controversy surrounding the coimection between presumed immunological targets and the appearance o f disease. Even greater difficulties are faced in the determination o f CAM's efficacy in HTV disease since CAM's underlying holism blurs the dimension^ boundaries typical o f allopathic medicine. CAM research is further hampered by structural elements (such as the relative scantiness o f literature and funding), but CAM's intrinsic logic of individualisation, holism, and combination constitutes the greatest hurdle for its evaluation fix>m a clinical perspective. In addition, 'replicability' - the hallmark o f the scientific method - requires that a clear specification o f whatever is being tested be articulated so that the studied substance and/or procedure can be described, stabilised and generalised. However, the definitions, qualities, and parameters o f most CAM practices, practitioners, and substances have not been standardised and are thus not fitting for generalisation. Moreover, in evaluating non-material interventions, which characterise many CAM systems (e.g. acupuncture), not only might controls be difficult to select if a blind experiment is the goal but also placebos may be very problematical to define. The initial euphoria caused by the apparent success of combination therapies in the late 1990s overshadowed the interest in CAM therapies and research in HIV disease, but the number of HIV-positive CAM users did not significantly diminish. Once the adverse effects of HAART began to emerge the interest in CAM rebounded as these side-eflfects needed to be tackled (Standish et al, 2002). 198 The fact that many CAM practitioners tend to use a combination o f substances and/or therapies in their practices significantly obscures issues o f standardisation, clinical indications, therapeutic targets, and potential toxicities. Despite such difficulties in establishing the scientific validity o f many CAM therapies, some clinical trials have indeed shown the efficacy o f particular CAM approaches. One o f the most thoroughly researched CAM practices within the context of HTV disease has been Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), whose modalities include dietary therapy, massage therapy, heat therapy, exercise, meditation, and acupuncture. A number o f completed controlled trials o f Chinese Medicine have all demonstrated the efficacy o f TCM in treating symptoms o f HIV infection (Burak et al, 1996; Cohen et al, 2000; Weber at al, 1999). In addition, nutritional ^jproaches to HTV disease have also been clinically evaluated to demonstrate the positive effects o f such approaches in maintaining health (Muller, 1992; Grimble, 1997; Allard et al, 1998). In addition, integrative treatments for HIV disease are already being implemented with considerable success (Kaiser, 1993). As such, the utilisation o f CAM in the treatment o f HTV disease continues to increase as their difficult- to-scientifically-prove dimension is contrasted to personally experienced benefits. 6.4.- The Appropriation of the Meaning o f AIDS An American study found that over 90% of 120 experienced and credentialed providers of CAM in the context of HTV disease claimed that their therapies 'were \"somewhat\" to \"very effective\" at all disease stages and on all disease measures, including symptom management (96%), maintaining quality of life 199 6.4. h - The Discovery o f HTV: a surreptitious appropriation The turning point for the medical appropriation of the syndrome came in April o f 1984. Aetiological speculation was extinguished almost overnight with the announcement made by the US Health Secretary that the National Cancer Institute (NCI) oncologist Robert Gallo had identified the probable cause o f AIDS. Gallo claimed to have isolated a new virus, which was said to be the third human variant o f the cancer-causing retrovirus family, which he had discovered in the 1970s. The new virus was named HTLV-III.*^^ The 'collaborative' role o f the French Pasteur Institute was briefly mentioned (Epstein, 1996). However, American science could not bask in its glory for too long. A year after the announcement, a US Department o f Health and Human Service's Office o f Research Integrity (ORI) investigation declared Gallo guilty not only o f scientific misconduct, but also o f making false statements in published scientific papers (Shenton, 1998).'^^ The work o f the Pasteur Institute's chief o f viral oncology. Dr. Luc Montaigner, had been somehow 'appropriated' raising or maintaining CD4 lymphocyte levels (66%), slowing progression to AIDS (69%), and extending survival (73%)' (Calabrese and Werner, 1998:281-287). Howard Temin and Satoshi Mizutani, two biologists from the University of Wisconsin and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology respectively, won the Nobel Prize in 1975 for their discovery that the transcription of RNA into DNA was possible. Until then it was thought that DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein; it was not thought \u00dciat the mechanism could operate in the opposite direction. A virus genome usually integrates into the genome of the host in the form of DNA. In the search for a viral cause of cancer, it was hypothesised that die viral genome, once inserted into the genome of the host, would constitute an oncogenic sequence. As such, cell division rather than viral reproduction would take place. However, in the 1960s this hypothesis ran into a stumbling block: the viruses thought to cause avian sarcoma virus and feline leulaemia (animal cancers) were filled with RNA, not DNA. The discovery of the two American biologists demonstrated that RNA viruses, with the help of a specific enzyme known as reverse transcriptase, can be transformed into DNA and then penetrate the nucleus of a cell. The name retrovirus stems from this inverse C2q)ability of some such pathogens (Grmek, 2000). The initial verdict was subsequently dropped as the Department's appeal board, not its scientists, redefined the criteria for scientific misconduct (Shenton, 1^8). Gallo's history of 'appropriation' of other people's work dates back to the 1970s. Just as Temin and Baltimore discovered reverse transcriptase, Gallo was researching a group of related enzymes, called DNA polymerises of blood cells. Gallo immediately understood that the new discovery could aid him in his efforts to establish a connection between viruses and cancer. 'At that time, only the retroviruses causing 200 In 1982 Montaigner and his team had been able to show the presence of reverse transcriptase, the enzyme which is thought to characterise retroviruses, in samples o f a lymph tissue from a gay male with chronically swollen lymph glands, a condition known as 'lymphadenopaty syndrome' Lymphadenopaty Syndrome was believed to be a precursor to AIDSJ^^ Montaigner had informed Gallo o f his discovery before the simultaneous publication o f a paper from the former, and two papers by Gallo, in the same issue o f Science (220) o f May 1983. Gallo had offered to abstract Montaigner's paper, and in doing so claimed that the virus discovered by the French team of scientists, which was named LAV, was a 'C-type retrovirus' similar to Gallo's previously isolated HTLV. In fact, what Gallo had actually 'discovered' was a virus with a 99% degree of genetic similarity to the French LAV: a matter o f accidental contamination or purposeful misconduct (Epstein, 1996; Maggiore, 1996)? In his Science paper 'Isolation o f Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)', Gallo had claimed that the leukaemia virus HTLV he had previously identified was responsible for causing AIDS. In 1984, in another May issue o f Science, Gallo and his American collaborators published the paper 'Frequent Detection cancer in animals were known, and all ambitious oncologists dreamed of finding a human oncogenic retrovirus.' Gallo and his collaborators tried for five years; in 1980 one of Gallo's colleagues, Bernard Poiesz, isolated such a retrovirus. Gallo soon published Poiesz's (a trainee at the NCI) findings as mostly his own. During the decisive period of his trainee's discovery Gallo was travelling, and absent fi-om tiie laboratory (Grmek, 1990:56). 158 jjje evidence that reverse transcriptase (RT) is constituent of a retroviral particle has been challenged by the dissident critique. Some of its proponents claim that as the presence of RT is proven indirectly, and as other cellular DNA polymerases can also produce RT, this hypothesis cannot be ascertained (Papadopulus-Eleopulus et al, 1996). 1^^ Lymphadenopathy can appear as the result of a broad range of causes such as the flu, mononucleosis, lymphoma, and HTV infection. It is characterised by swollen, firm and possibly tender lymph nodes. 201 and Isolation of Cytopathic Retroviruses (HTLV-III) from Patients with AIDS and at Risk for AIDS'. In this paper Gallo completely abandoned the notion of a leukaemia virus, and referred instead to a new 'discovery'. After having been unable to find HTLV in AIDS patients and, perhaps more significantly, after having received a sample o f LAV from the Pasteur Institute, Gallo suddenly changed his rhetoric and 'discovered' yet another virus: HTLV-III. In his 1984 Science paper Gallo was not only claiming someone else's findings as his own, but he had also subtly renamed and reclassified the entire family o f viruses, which he had identified in the 1980s as the leukaemia-causing 'human T-cell leukemia viruses' (HTLV-I and and its assumed related leukaemia cousins, were all reconceptualised as 'human T- lymphotropic retroviruses'.^^\u00ae The press announcement made by the US Health Secretary, which had proclaimed to the world the efficacy o f President Reagan's scientists, and established HTLV-III as the causal factor in AIDS, had disregarded the usual standards o f scientific procedures. None of Gallo's scientific hypotheses had been peer-reviewed and his 'findings' had yet to be independently replicated (Epstein, 1996). A 12-point investigation from the National Institute of Health's Office o f Scientific Integrity found Gallo guilty o f scientific misconduct, and accused him of hampering research efforts. These charges were, however, later withdrawn through a series o f legal efforts. Yet, the Human Retrovirus Subcommittee of the International Committee o f the Taxonomy o f Viruses discarded Gallo's HTLV-III, and re-baptised the virus in 1986 (Epstein, 1996; Shenton, 1998). After accusing Gallo o f stealing its virus, the Pasteur 160 Yhe name was a reference to the lymphocyte depletion observed in AIDS patients. 202 Institute sued the U.S. government in 1985. The dispute was only resolved when the presidents o f both countries, Jacques Chirac and Ronald Reagan, met in Frankfurt to sign the 1987 agreement whereby the two nations conceded in splitting the royalties for the antibody tests (US$ 35 million by 1994) (Shenton, 1998). In 1989 the Chicago Tribune published an expose of Gallo's science, and concluded that Gallo had obtained HTLV-III from the Pasteur Institute either by 'accident or theft'. Soon after that Montaigner's laboratory asked for a renegotiation o f the 1987 agreement, and for US$20 million in reparation. The 'doctrine of specific etiology', developed from the work o f Pasteur and Koch, demonstrated that specific germs produced specific diseases in the human body. Later this model was extended beyond infectious diseases, and disease was explained by the lack o f a specific element such as a vitamin or a hormone. Despite the achievements o f such theory, it has rarely provided a complete account o f the causation o f disease (Dubos, 1959). Epstein (1996) performed a content analysis o f scientific articles dealing with the isolation of HIV in seven major journals during the period 1984-1986, the pivotal years as far as the institutionalisation o f the HIV hypothesis is concerned. Epstein wanted to verify the notion that 'by repeatedly citing each other's work, a small group of scientists quickly established a dense citation network, thus gaining early (if ultimately only partial) control' o f the meaning o f AIDS (Treichler, 1992:76 quoted In Epstein, 1996:81). He concluded that by 1986 '62% o f the articles cited Gallo to make unqualified claims, and only 22% did so in conjunction with qualified claims.' Epstein also observed that 'expressions o f doubt or scepticism - let alone support for other hypotheses - were 203 extraordinarily rare throughout this period'. 'Serious doubts' were voiced in passing, or in 'short letters to journals'. 1^^ Nevertheless, and despite Gallo's 'discovery' having become established fact 'simply because it's true', it institutionalised the viral aetiology o f AIDS and framed the subsequent treatment research and strategy by the anti-retroviral model (Treichler, 1992:76). Yet, the isolation, the discovery, the harmfulness, and even the very existence of the HFV virus continue to be disputed to this day. The medical appropriation o f AIDS was firmly established with the discovery o f HTV. As new antiretroviral treatments slowly emerged they subsumed the significance o f the holistic medical systems that had been serving the needs o f people living with HTV and dying o f AIDS for over a decade. In addition to their health-producing function, these alternative paradigms had also served as resistance strategies against the medically established 'truths' surrounding AIDS. Despite the orthodox advances in its quest to find a cure for AIDS, medicine is still far from a real solution. As such, the holistic paradigm o f CAM continues to resonate with many individuals whether in a complementary or absolute role. In addition, a new resistance project has been gaining increased momentum. Although the origins o f this emerging micrological strategy can be traced back to early in the health crisis, only recently has it begun to constitute a problem for the mainstream institutions that deal with the problem o f AIDS. This resistance project, which bases itself on the original 'immune overload' model o f AIDS, is thus framed by holism. However, such a resistance project questions the core knowledge(s) o f AIDS not 1^1 In a letter to the medical journal JAMA^ published in September of 1984, Arthur Ammann called for a ^cautious appraisal., .(as) there is no historical precedent for believing that a single infectious agent is capable of abolishing a normal immune system* (quoted in Epstein, 1996:83). 204 through the language o f an 'alternative' paradigm but through the very language which has established these knowledge(s) in the first place. 6.4.2.- The Orthodox View on AIDS: first things first The dissident critique has posed a series o f challenges to the scientific knowledge that constructs the phenomenon o f AIDS. Such challenges have been articulated firom the same biomedical perspective, and within the same scientific language, with which the orthodoxy asserts that HIV is the cause o f AIDS. As such, the dissident critique utilises 'reverse discursive practices' in order to credibly challenge science. I have no intention (or ability) o f engaging in the scientific merit o f either argument. Furthermore, my argument is a sociological one and as such totally pervious to the assumptions o f either medical model. However, failing to briefly sketch the main points o f contention between the orthodoxy and the dissidents would greatly impoverish the present argument. As such, I attempt to describe a certain amount o f medical data only inasmuch as it is a necessary framework for the further development o f the analysis o f the social processes that surround the construction o f scientific (un)certainty associated with HIV/AIDS, and the resistance it has sparked. Hence, in order to provide a firamework for the dissident critique I shall briefly describe the orthodox view on AIDS. It could be said that I am basing my argument on 'contested' and partial scientific evidence, as I do not offer the orthodox rebuttal to the dissident critique. Yet, as I have already mentioned, this chapter is not on the merits of the science o f AIDS, and I am not claiming that the dissident view is the correct one. However, dissidents argue that the orthodoxy has continually failed to answer any o f their challenges. Although the reasons for such alleged failure remain open 205 to speculation, the orthodoxy has justified it on the grounds that any public engagement with dissident theories risks their legitimisation (Hodgkinson, 1996; Epstein, 1996). Most o f die information on the AIDS 'epidemic' developed in this section has been gathered from the United Nations programme on AIDS {UNAIDS), and from the National AIDS Manual {NAM), Britain's leading publication on HTV and AIDS. This data represents the official view. As such, it is endorsed by the World Health Organisation {WHO), by the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre and the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health in Britain, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {CDC) in the United States. Moreover, this view is supported and reproduced by all leading AIDS service and advocacy organisations and by all o f the established representatives and institutions o f medical research and science around the world. The human immune system has evolved over millions o f years; it operates in part through the independent circulatory system known as the lymphatic system. This system is composed o f organs and tissues such as the bone marrow, the thymus gland, and the spleen, which together create our main immunological weapon: white blood cells. Some o f these cells directly attack invading organisms (cell-mediated immunity), and others act by producing antibodies (humoral immunity). Our immune system is capable o f both non-specific and specific immunity. Non-specific immunity constitutes the more basic function o f the system as it deals with a range o f common microorganisms that constantly challenge the health o f our bodies. The cells responsible for non-specific immunity are 206 called phagocytes, 'eating cells' that literally swallow invading antigens (foreign bodies). On the other hand, specific immunity can, to a certain extent, cope with uncommon organisms through the production o f immune globulins (commonly known as antibodies), i.e. key proteins produced by cells to deal with antigens. A range o f cells known as lymphocytes carries out specific immunity, the dimension of the immune system that deals with HTV infection. Lymphocytes are classified as B-cells, responsible for producing antibodies to defend the body against bacteria and other foreign antigens, and as T-cells, which are in charge o f cell-mediated immunity. Although antibodies can effectively cope with the fioe-floating viruses circulating in the bloodstream, most viral infections occur within the host's cells without the pathogen fireely roaming the circulatory system. Antibodies cannot reach within cells; for that to happen cell-mediated immunity, where T-cells identify and destroy the body's own infected cells, is necessary. T-cells are divided into CDS cells (cytotoxic T cells) and CD4 (T 'helper') cells. CD4 cells do not act directly upon the destruction o f infected cells but are essential for optimal immune fimction. CD4s can be directly infected by HIV, or depleted in indirect ways. CD4 depletion has been considered to be the most harmful effect o f HIV infection responsible for 'paralysing normal immune responses and leaving the body prey to opportunistic infections' (King, 1994:31-45). LAV III') was first isolated by French scientist Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, a female member o f Luc Montaigner's team o f scientists at the Institute Pasteur in Paris in May o f 1983. From 1986 onwards the virus has become widely known as 'The Human Immunodeficiency 207 Virus', o r HTV. HIV is present in blood, semen, vaginal fluids, saliva, breast-milk; it is mainly transmitted through unprotected anal or vaginal sex, blood to blood contact, and from mother to baby during the course o f pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding. Several cases o f 'HTV-free AIDS' were reported at the 8th International Conference on AIDS in Amsterdam in 1992, but 'strictly speaking, a person who does not have HIV infection cannot have AIDS, because HIV is part o f the case definition o f AIDS. If somebody is hnmunosiq)pressed but does not have HIV, they do not have AIDS ' It is expected that the vast majority o f HIV infected persons will eventually develop AIDS (UNAIDS fact sheet: 1-5). Although there are several reported cases o f HTV-infected individuals who have not developed AIDS fourteen years from infection, generally a few years after infection the immune system begins to show signs o f stress (Buchbinder et al, 1994). Initial infection is usually followed by a transitory flu-like illness, which is immediately attacked by the immune system, before a period o f variable dormancy sets in.'^^ xhe HIV diagnosis is based on tests for the antibody; in Britain the ELISA test is standard whereas in other countries a confirmatory 'Western Blot' must follow a positive ELISA. Second-generation ELISA tests have been improved in order to reduce the possibility of the false positive reactions, which had occurred in the earlier generation o f tests. The improved ELISA tests employ firagments o f highly purified laboratory-cultivated HIV proteins (synthetic peptides) deemed to produce reliable HTV antibody reactions. However, the likelihood o f the Western Blot producing false positive results is one o f the reasons the test is not used for confirmatory purposes in the UK (King, 1994). 162 initially thought that the virus remained inactive for many years, but recent research has suggested otherwise (Ho et al, 1995). 208 Surrogate markers, i.e. laboratory tests employed to monitor disease progression, unlike clinical evidence o f disease, indicate the statistical likelihood that an HIV-infected individual will develop an opportunistic infection and/or progress to a full-blown AIDS diagnosis. Constant surveillance o f the functions of the immune system is 'motivated by the underlying benefit o f early intervention or prophylaxis', and to help doctors decide when to prescribe treatment drugs. Although the CD4 count is 'not a straightforward, unambiguous reflection of the healthiness of the immune system... (as) the counts can vary on a number o f factors'; it constitutes one o f the main surrogate markers of progression o f disease. More recently, however, the role o f CD4s as immunological markers, as well as parameters against which to measure the efficacy o f antiviral treatments, has been questioned (King, 1994; 40-45). Such modification in the conceptualisations o f surrogate mariners are related to new technological developments (viral load technology) which can measure the levels o f virus found in lymph nodes and in the blood system. As such, 'viral load' measures have been favoured over clinically observed immunodeficiency and/or the presence of opportunistic infections as markers of disease progression. The main goal o f antiviral treatment has thus become the reduction o f levels o f HIV in the body, which can now measured by the new technology. Reduction in 'viral load' indicates whether combination therapy is working or not. 163 virological tests include p24 antibody and antigen, HTV culture, SI/NSI phenotype, and DNA/RNA amplification. The retrovirus HIV consists of a single stranded RNA \\^o se viral envelope protein, gpl20, adsorbs to the surface of both CD4 cells and monocytes. Viral entry and uncoating subsequently occur whereby the enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT), duplicates the single-stranded RNA into double stranded DNA. Viral integration into the host DNA proceeds, causing the transcription and translation of HTV genes. 209 6.5.- The Dissident Movement 6.5.1. The Dissident Critique and the Dissident Movement: a close relationship The 'Dissident Critique' is comprised o f a series o f specific challenges to many o f the scientifically established truths that have framed the appropriation o f the meaning of AIDS by the medical system. The critique has been articulated firom within the bio\u00ad medical orthodoxy by a number o f scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. The work o f 'dissident' scientists is supported and disseminated by dozens of lay organisations around the globe. Many o f these loosely connected institutions have been set up exclusively and autonomously to engage in the propagation o f such ideas, and to achieve the overturn o f the medical model o f AIDS as it is currently constructed. Despite the unstructured linkages among these organisations, a broader movement that functions through this loosely connected array o f dissident organisations has coalesced.^ As such, the appearance o f an emerging social movement organised around the arguments o f the 'dissident critique', the 'Dissident Movement', began to take place Chronic infection and ultimate cellular destruction will ensue in these cells, contributing to the progressive destruction of CD4 cells (King, 1991). 164 Such organisations are: Academy of Nutrition Improvement (Nagpur, India); ACT UP San Francisco; ACT UP Hollywood; ACT UP Toronto; Alberta Reappraising (Eugene, Oregon); AMG (France); Continuuum magazine (London); The Forum Africa (FDASA); Fundacion Arte y Ciencia (Colombia); Health Education AIDS Liaison (HEAL) Network (New York City, Denver, Hartford, Portland, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Washington DC', Hawaii, Toronto, Uganda); International Forum for Accessible Science (IFAS Switzerland); Joint Action Council Kannur (JACK); New York Rethinking AIDS Society (NYRAS); and Students Against the HFV Causes AIDS Hypothesis (SATHIVCAH). 165such coalitions have resulted in some unlikely partnerships. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), whose activities started in New York City and are today articulated in many chapters throughout the United States and abroad, constitutes the most public direct-action group of AIDS activism. ACT UP 'shares the most basic characteristics of a new social movement, articulates a mix of instrumental, expressive, and identity-oriented activities (Gamson, 1989:351-360). Although the majority of the chapters of ACT-UP accept and disseminate the notion that HIV is the cause of AIDS, and contest the 'politics of treatment' of the health crisis, recently a few ACT-UP chapters have associated themselves with the 210 in the 1990s. The movement's institutions are densely interconnected in their efforts to transform the political, economic, and socio-cultural relationships that characterise the global problem o f AIDS. As a social movement the ^dissident movement' functions within the emerging 'embryonic global public sphere', which provides a forum and a voice for non-state global actors (Devetak and Higgott, 1993;491).The system of relationships in which the movement is embedded is characteristic o f 'network society' (Castells, 1996), which is increasingly substituting the nation-state as the main focus of civil loyalty and fostering the evolution o f 'cosmopolitan politics' (Vertovec and Cohen, 1999). However, despite the 'transnationalism' of the movement, the social resistance they articulate is delimited by the socially structured discursive spaces through which dissident individuals navigate. Transnational politics still maintain traditional axes of discrimination (Guamizo and Smith, 1998:3-34). For reasons o f space, I shall describe only, and briefly, three o f the most relevant dissident organisations o f the Anglo-Saxon world. I begin with the 'mission statement' of one Britain's most vocal representatives: At the 12* World AIDS Conference in Geneva, 1988, it was concluded at an official meeting that such a virus as 'HTV' has not been isolated and may well not exist At the onset of the 'epidemic', the hysteria that resulted from the linking of sex, death and 'an infectious virus' created a climate where to question the 'fects' was considered reprehensible. Many of those ^ o dared to do so were silenced or ridiculed. Since the growth of the orthodoxy, those who question have also had to contend with the weight of vested interests. Continuum is a unique forum for those in the scientific dissident critique. As such, these ACT-UP chq>ters have moved beyond simply challenging the appropriateness of allopathic HIV treatment to question the causation of the syndrome. 211 community challenging the orthodoxy and those whose lives have in some way been touched by the hypothesis (continuum.com) The first issue o f Continuum: changing the way we think about AIDS was published in London in October of 1992. Continuum began as a newsletter whose objective was to encourage 'those affected by an HTV diagnosis to empower themselves to make decisions about care and treatment choices'. Continuum's founder was Jody Wells - a man who had refused to take anti-viral medication despite having lived with an HTV diagnosis for many years. Today, Continuum is a voluntary organisation, run (mostly) by HIV- diagnosed individuals, which relies on (approximately 500) subscriptions and donations for its survival. Through its four annual issues, and occasional public meetings. Continuum functions as a forum for the dissemination o f 'information we believe is necessary for the fuller understanding o f HIV, AIDS and hnmunity' (continuum.com). Reappraising AIDS, the US published monthly pamphlet o f 'The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal o f the HTV/AIDS Hypothesis', is another important forum for dissident ideas. This collective o f 'medical scientists, physicians and other professionals from around the world encourage a serious reappraisal o f the HTV -causes-AIDS model', and believe that they 'have identified solid scientific reasons to conclude th a t... HIV may be entirely harm less... (and that) ... people diagnosed with \"AIDS\" may be sick not firom HIV infections but from other factors' (Reappraising AIDS, 09/1999:4). 166 jo jy Wells eventually died from complications usually associated with AIDS. 212 Another major organisation dedicated to alternative views on AIDS is Health-Education- AIDS Liaison (HEAL), which was founded in New York City in 1982 in order to provide information on alternative and holistic approaches to AIDS. Today, in addition to HEAL chapters in twenty-three American cities, HEAL has expanded its activities and educational programmes to include Mexico, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Uganda. HEAL chapters are separate and independent organisations which nevertheless share similar goals, mission statements, guidelines, and objectives. Whilst HEAL does not officially endorse any particular view. The 'mission statement' o f such organisation reads as follows: After more tiian 15 years working with AIDS and AIDS related problems, HEAL is of the opinion that the whole thrust of AIDS 'testing', research and treatment urgently needs to be reconsidered. HEAL believes that safe, healthy, responsible behaviour can be promoted without terrorism and disinformation (rethinking AIDS website) The co-operation between these institutions is enacted in their publications, through virtual discussion groups, mailing lists, and occasional international meetings. Dissident organisations have generated a great deal o f literature that reproduces the scientific papers of the 'dissident critique', which would otherwise only reach the tiny minority that reads scientific or academic journals. In addition, a plethora o f books, videos, and tapes that deal with dissident issues have also been published. Another important site for dissemination o f dissident views is the Internet. The role o f the institutions o f mass media in the interpretation and adjudication o f scientific controversy is undoubted. The filtering o f scientific information as well as the construction o f public images of scientific 213 I certainty concerning HTV/AIDS have been ascertained by the overwhelming majority of the institutions o f the mass media. However, as dissident organisations have their own media vehicles, a certain degree o f destabilisation of mainstream information on AIDS has been achieved. Such destabilisation, and the circulation o f dissident information, contravenes traditional 'top-down' models of expert knowledge dissemination. As such, dissident publications, as well as dissident Internet sites, are constitutive o f the critique. In the articulation o f the 'dissident critique' the 'dissident movement' employs a mix of constitutionally sanctioned and disruptive and confrontational action. The most important constitutionally sanctioned action o f the 'dissident movement' is the organisation o f the 'Dissident Conference' alongside the International AIDS Conference, the most important biennial meeting o f the AIDS establishment.'^^ The first time a 'Dissident Conference' took place simultaneously to the mainstream international event was during thel 1^ International AIDS Conference, which took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from June 2 8 * * * to July 3^^ o f 1998. The Geneva conference represented an important milestone for the 'dissident movement' as it was the first time that some o f their views were presented in the most important international forum for HTV/AIDS.However, constitutionally sanctioned action does not preclude disruptive and confrontational action. On the steps that led participants into the Geneva conference the Spanish dissident group Cobra, staged The International AIDS Conference is organised and sponsored by the multinational pharmaceutical companies that manufacture HTV drugs, such as Glaxo-Wellcome. The linkages between pharmaceutical con^ianies and die International AIDS Conference, however, go beyond simple sponsorship. A covert collaboration between the pharmaceutical company Dome and an activist group that aggressively lobbied for greater access to Crixivan, an anti-HTV drug manufactured by Dome, was revealed during the 12* International AIDS Conference in Geneva. During the 13* International AIDS Conference in Durban the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, which manufactures the anti-HTV drug Nevirapene, funded an activist group to lobby for greater access to its drug (SAPA 13/06/00). 214 a hunger strike to protest 'the institutionalisation of the HIV virus on the basis of inadequate scientific evidence' (Continuum (4) 6:21). The latest dissident conference 'Making Sense: Alternative Views on the Origins and Causes of AIDS in Afiica' took place at the end o f August 2000.^^^ The proponents o f the dissident critique want a reappraisal of AIDS science - not the abandonment o f the scientific method, but what is thought to be the appropriate and necessary review o f the science surrounding AIDS.^ Such a critique has been articulated beyond the scientific community by the organisations o f the 'dissident movement'. The grassroots o f the movement is composed o f HIV -diagnosed individuals who attribute their well-being to their disbelief in the bio-medical paradigm o f AIDS. * Such individuals are the ones who keep the loosely connected network of dissident institutions functioning, usually on a voluntary basis. However, it is important to understand that such institutions began to coalesce after (and around) the work o f the scientists who comprise the 'dissident critique'. Despite the proximity o f the 'dissident Dr. Eleni Papadopulus-Eleopulus, of the 'Per\u00fci Group', presented her views on the unreliability of HIV tests. See 6.5.3.1. In this conference, which took place in Uganda a month after the mainstream International AIDS Conference had been held in South Africa, the delegates called for the suspension of HIV testing and an immediate halt to the provision of anti-retroviral drugs to HIV positive pregnant and breast feeding women (South African Guardian 17/09/00), The dissident critique bases its arguments on the narrowness of the biomedical paradigm. Yet, in their use of ^reverse discourse* these sceptics demand ftiat scientifrc principles and methods be followed. This is particularly evident in their critique of the failure of the orthodoxy to foUow Koch's postulates. 1^^ Most biomedical research into HTV/AIDS focuses on the efficacy of allopathic anti-retroviral treatment in reducing viral load or augmenting CD4 counts (see below). Fewer studies concentrate on the reasons why some individuals, despite having been infected with HTV for over a decade, do not seem to develop the syndrome. These supposed unusual (or abnormal) individuals, who contradict the biomedical notion that HTV should invariably lead to AIDS, are classifi\u00e9 as 'long-term survivors' or 'non-progressors*. What these studies have found is that 'long-term survivors' share one thing in common: they have never used anti-retroviral drugs to deal with HTV infection (Hogervorst al, 1996). 215 critique' and the 'dissident movement', the former should not be collapsed with the latter as the 'critique' constitutes a scientific endeavour not a social movement. 6.5.2.- The Dissident Movement as a Genuine Social Movement Post-modernist accounts o f social reality have described the substitution o f meta\u00ad narratives for the contingency and specificity o f social structure and action. In a theorisation that reflects such perspective a distinction between 'old' and 'new' social movements has been postulated. The debate o f whether 'new' and 'old' social movements constitute a fimdamental break, or are better conceptualised as a continuum, has been extensively argued elsewhere. Such distinction, however, seems increasingly sterile: 'the continued theoretical investment in gnawing again and again on this bone of contention is producing rapidly diminishing returns' (Cohen and Rai, 2000:4-10). As such, my goal here is not to argue for the inclusion o f the dissident movement in either categorisation but to demonstrate how such a resistance project can indeed be looked at fi-om the perspective o f an emerging movement. A social movement is characterised by three basic features. It must constitute an organised attempt to change social structure; be composed o f 'culturally degraded' and 'politically oppressed' individuals stripped o f 'any real influence over the major decisions that affect their lives'. In addition, social movements make use o f tactics that simultaneously include 'disruption and confrontation with co-operation, legality, and consensus building'. The 'dissident movement' firlfils all such criteria. As a social 172 P ot a detailed discussion see Hannigan (1991), Zhakzadeh (1997), and Porta et al (1999). 216 movement it is attempting to change social structure; its constituency is mostly comprised o f 'culturally degraded' individuals; and its tactics simultaneously include 'disruption and confrontation with co-operation, legality, and consensus building' (West, 1993:29). Still, there is an essential difference between being a social movement and being a successful social movement. The success o f social movements is directly connected to their ability to secure and manage resources as well as to 'the social networks from which movements draw human and material support' (McAdam, 1982:36). Whether the 'dissident movement' will have any success in changing social structure can not be ascertained. The movement's material resources are negligible and its social networks are not richly elaborated. Any social movement represents an act o f social resistance. Whereas the target o f change desired by the dissident critique is not specifically the state, 'nation-states' are implicated inasmuch as their institutions support not only the AIDS establishment and its industry, but also the scientific processes that have established that AIDS is an infectious disease. The network o f loosely connected organisations o f the 'dissident movement' remains largely unelaborated in terms o f organisational and material resources. Most dissident organisations are under-funded, and staffed on a voluntary basis. Such lack of institutionalisation resonates with the marginal position o f any counter-cultural movement, but also reflects the complexity o f the different sets of relationships between dissident science and dissident groundwork. Although scientists o f the 'dissident critique' are intimately connected to the genesis and the articulation o f dissident ideas, they are not officially affiliated with the 'movement'; they are affiliated with mainstream institutions 217 , such as hospitals or universities. It can be argued that despite the process of disenfranchisement that some scientists associated with the 'dissident critique' have ! suffered as a result o f their production o f and public engagement with dissident views, they still lend their remaining prestige and social connections to it. However, most o f the individuals responsible for the organisation, the political activity, and the dissemination o f dissident information are representatives o f a segment o f society known as 'nonelite' (McCarthy and Zald, 1977). The nonelite is constituted o f people who 'in their daily lives lack substantive political clout, social prestige, or personal wealth, and whose interests are not routinely articulated or represented in the political system (Zirakzadeh, 1997:4). However, 'social movements amount to far more than individual participants, formal movement organisations and material resources...and many scholars now favour approaches which give priority to the cultural content and ethos o f movements' (Zirakzadeh, 1997:4-5). As such, scholars are increasingly searching for concepts 'which adequately reflect the diffuseness, fluidity and indeterminacy which supposedly characterize today's social movements.' Notions o f 'collective action' and 'mobilization' increasingly juxtapose the concept o f social movement (Melucci, 1996; Beckford, 2000). The 'dissident' movement then constitutes a social movement indeed. 6.5.3.- The Scientific Controversies 218 6.5.3.1.- The Perth Group: HTV has not been isolated The National AIDS Manual (NAM) publication 'HIV & AIDS Treatments Directory' states in its 1994 issue that: Usually HIV infection is detected by an HTV antibody test. The first test to be done, usually on blood, but possibly on saliva is an ELISA.. .Since this test can sometimes be positive even when someone is not infected - a 'false positive' - a second test called the Western Blot is done, This can confirm an ELISA.... (However) the likelihood that some people will falsely test positive for m v antibodies by the Western Blot method is widely known amongst virologists and is one reason why the test is rarely used for confirmatory puiposes in the UK... (The Western Blot) relies on a subjective judgement of the intensity of the bands of antibody which form in response to particular antigens...so false positive results are possible with this mediod just as with any other laboratory test (King, 1996:2-31) In the Western Blot there are about ten HIV proteins located at different spots on a paper strip; once serum is added some o f the spots on the paper strip will darken. A positive result is defined by a certain combination o f such darkened bands, but the definition o f the required combination for a positive result varies according to national frontiers. Whereas four bands are required in Australia; in Canada and the United States three bands are sufficient; and in Africa only two are necessary (Turner, 1996).'^^ In addition. Diverse phenomena may produce a false positive ELISA: vaccinations (hepatitis B, tetanus, flu); organ transplants; viral infections such as heipes simplex I and II; ATDS-defining diseases like tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium; underlying conditions (haemophilia) and behaviour (receptive anal sex) often associated with AIDS patients may all produce false positives (Johnson, 1996). Semen is a foreign protein which, when accumulated in the blood through receptive anal sex, might produce a positive result in HTV tests (Papadopulus, 1992). Recent generations of ELISA tests have, however, been vastly improved. 174 jjjg US's FDA has relaxed its requirement of tiiree reacting bands for a positive result as in the first licensed kit of the Western Blot less than half of AIDS patients tested HTV positive. Production processes 219 the 'subjective judgement' implicit on the interpretation of the Western Blot has been shown to be informed by a priori cultural categorisations which defy scientific objectivity- According to Britain's Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), 'an accurate diagnosis' should be achieved through the juxtaposition o f clinical specimens to a range o f \"risk-factor\" information on fifteen categories including sexual orientation and national origin' (Continuum 4 (3):2). The potential ambiguity of the Elisa and Western Blot tests has been acknowledged by the medical orthodoxy. However, the so-called 'Perth Group', a team o f medical scientists firom the Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia, has made a much more radical claim (Turner, 1998:38).^^^ In the June 1993 issue o f Bio/Technology the Perth Groiq) argued that the Western Blot test used to confirm an HIV diagnosis could not be relied upon at all. The Australian scientists argued that test was flawed in the four essential dimensions of a scientifically viable antibody test.'^^ A couple of years later the Perth Groiq) articulated another astonishing claim; the scientists argued that there is no proof that HIV exists inasmuch as HTV -identification processes have not followed the for the test strips are not standardised; variations occur not only between different manufacturers but also within lots from the same manufacturer (Hodgkinson, 1996). The team's main scientists are Dr. Eleni Papadopulus-Eleopulus, Dr. Val Turner, and Dr. J. P^adiraitrou. 176 According to the Perth Group, Western Blots are unreliable tests because of: 1. The lack of a source of HIV-specific antigens (as HTV has never been isolated these tests employ complex procedures that involve a series of assumptions in determining a positive result); 2. Cross-reactions producing 'positive' results on the test; 3. The impossibility of reproducible results across different laboratories due to the interpretative framewoik of die test; 4. The inability of the test to measure up to the 'gold standard' of scientific testing reliability, i.e., an independent method of ascertaining the infection, which the test is deemed to identify (Hodgkinson, 1996), 220 accepted method o f retroviral isolation (Papadopolus-Eleopolus, 1997)J^^ As antibodies are never disease-specific, an accurate antibody test can only be devised if viral isolation has been accomplished. Viruses are only capable o f multiplying when inside a host cell, but through an electron microscope they are observable as independent particles constitutive o f a unique stretch o f genetic material (the virus genome). The procedures for isolation and purification of virus genomes, which developed out o f the work o f American scientists experimenting with malignant muscle tumours in chickens in 1911, were standardised between 1940 and 1970, and reiterated at a 1973 meeting o f the Pasteur Institute (Rous, 1911; Papadopulos- Eleopulus, 1997). Briefly, unpurified biological material made up o f various biological particles is spun through a density-graded centrifiige, which bands the similar particles at characteristic densities - the higher the density, the lower its 'banding' in the test-tube. This procedure isolates and separates the different particles at characteristic density bands, and enables scientists to photograph the isolated particles in an electron microscope. If the photographic images o f these isolated particles resemble the viral particles observed in hosts' cells then a virus may have been identified.*^* The 1973 Pasteur Institute meeting established that photographing at the 1.16 band o f density gradient was essential for retroviral isolation. The Perth Group argues that the Most claims of 'isolation' were based on the detection of reverse transcriptase (RT), which alongside protease and integrase constitute the three enzymes involved in the replication of HTV. Originally thought to be exclusively associated with retroviral activity, it has been subsequently demonstrated that all cells are capable of RT (Hodgkinson, 1996). *78 This simplified explanation of the procedure is sufficient for the puiposes of this analysis. 221 photographs o f virus particles published by Gallo and Montaigner were not o f viral particles at the 1.16 band, the density that defines retroviruses. In March o f 1997, researchers from the US National Cancer Institute and from Franco- German groups did publish the first photographs o f HIV in the correct density gradients (Gluschankok et al, 1997; Bess et al, 1997). However, the authors o f these studies stated that the great majority of the 'banded' material which appeared in their photographs was non-viral. In addition, argued the Perth Group, it seemed that the few retroviral particles that had been photographed could not be described as retroviruses unless the very definition o f retroviruses was changed. According to the Australians, all electron microscope photographs o f HIV ever published are of non-purified cell cultures and may contain 'cellular debris' which resemble, but are not, retroviral particles (Papadopulos- Eleopulus, 1997). The orthodoxy responds with the argument that HIV cannot be detected by conventional molecular biology techniques due to its inactivity (only one in anything from 10,000 to 100,000 lymphocytes of infected people is actively replicating the virus). For the Perth Group, on the other hand, HIV has never been isolated and as such it may not exist. If HIV does exist, then it is in 'a very different category from most other viruses for which diagnostic testing has been developed' (Hodgkinson, 1996:256). In a 1997 interview Dr. Luc Montaigner admitted that the sample from which his initial claim to HTV isolation originated did not 'contain particles with unique retroviral morphology' (Tahi, 1998). 1^\u00ae This argument is defended on the basis that these photographed particles, which contain from 50% to 750% more mass than retroviral particles, violate the definition of retroviruses that takes into account a 'fixed amount of RNA and protein' (Papadopulus-Eleopulus, 1997). 222 6.5.3.2. - AIDS: toxic or infectious disease? The institutionalisation o f the HIV hypothesis did not undergo the usual processes o f scientific validation and reproduction. The 'moral panic', which characterised the beginning o f the AIDS crisis, is one of the contributory factors to the relaxation o f the strict scientific criteria normally required before a hypothesis may be declared a proven scientific fact (Epstein, 1996). In addition, as a result of the close association between gay lib and the motto o f sexual hberation, sex stood at the centre o f the newly articulated gay identity. A monocausal, microbial model for AIDS removed the potential for blame and guilt that a life-style disease might have provoked, and allowed for the reaffirmation o f sex-positive attitudes through the invention of 'safe' sex. However, as the new syndrome rapidly spread across the world it seemed increasingly plausible that the culprit was a transmittable virus. Yet, the hypothesis that behind each affected 'risk-group' there was a separate epidemic, each with its unique etiological causes, was never completely discarded. In the 1970s the gay liberation movement encouraged a sexualised lifestyle across a number o f large American cities. The enactors of this 'liberated' gay life-style developed a hitherto unheard o f level o f venereal diseases. As such, the medical profession identified the 'homosexual hazard', i.e. inherent characteristics o f the homosexual personality which led to an increased likelihood o f contracting some types o f disease such as 'gay bowel syndrome'. S u c h conceptualisations echoed recently outdated ideas of homoerotic behaviour as mental disorder as well as the more ancient notions o f 223 homosexuality as personal degeneration. Much before AIDS, and soon after it officially lost its status as a mental illness, homosexuality came to be considered a 'risk factor' in the causation o f biological disease. As such, GRID constituted the 1980s' version of medicine's traditional regulatory efforts towards homosexual behaviour. Hence, images of amyl-nitrite-inhaling-homosexual-predators (who had 'as many as ten sexual encounters each night up to four times a week'), devouring antibiotic drugs as prophylactics against the parasitic consequences of unbounded sexual pleasure, came to embody popular notions o f homosexuality at the onset of the crisis (Epstein, 1996:46). An article that appeared in Cancer Research in March of 1987, posed the first credible challenge to the theory that HIV was the cause o f AIDS (Dues berg, 1987).^^^ Its author was the German-bom scientist Peter Duesberg, a member of the faculty o f the Department o f Molecular and Cell Biology at the University o f California at Berkeley, Duesberg was one o f the pre-eminent experts on retroviruses; he had mapped their genetic structure, and co-discovered the first known oncogene. In 1971 Duesberg was named California Scientist o f the Year; in 1986 the National Institute o f Health awarded him with the special research grant 'Outstanding Investigator Award', and he was elected into the National Academy o f Sciences (NAS) - the premier congregation of America's top scientists. In his Cancer Research paper Duesberg argued that HIV could not be the Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a relatively common condition, which causes the intestines to be over sensitive. In the 1970s it was hypothesised that gays had a particular form of the disease associated wiA lifestyle and sexual behaviour. ^ Other challenges to the HIV hypothesis, which had mainly been articulated through the New York gay newspaper Native since 1983, had &iled to achieve any credibility. Oncogene theory arose within the 'War on Cancer' climate of scientific research of the 1970s. This theory, which has been subsequently challenged on many levels, argued that certain genes within each 224 causal factor in AIDS due to the disparity between the estimated number o f infected individuals, and the people who actually had AIDS (for example, in the US the ratio infected/sick was 0.3, and in Africa less than 0.01). Duesberg argued that HIV was harmless as it was only present in one o f every ten thousand to one hundred thousand T- cells o f HIV positive individuals. As such, the T-cell depletion observed in AIDS patients would be more than offset by the natural rate of T-cell regeneration. In order to determine if a specified infections agent causes a certain disease it is usually required that the 'Koch's postulates' are met.^^^ The postulates require that the causal agent be found in all cases o f the disease, and that the agent be isolated from a carrier and grown in pure culture. In addition, when the culture is injected into a laboratory animal the animal must contract the disease; and then the causal agent must be found in the diseased animal (Epstein, 1996). Duesberg argued that the Koch's postulates have not been met. First, HIV antibodies can only be found in 80% to 90 % o f AIDS patients. Secondly, argued the scientist, out o f the 80% to 90% o f AIDS patients who do test positive for HIV in only 10% can the actual genetic material o f the virus (rather than antibodies to it) be found. Thirdly, as undisputed evidence o f experimental or accidental injection o f HIV as causative of disease in animals or health care worker has human cell caused cancer. Linked to oncogene theory was the idea that retroviruses contained genes that could turn normal cells into cancer cells (Epstein, 1996). ^ Robert Koch was the nineteenth century German microbiologist who first identified the cause of tuberculosis (Shenton, 1998). 185 Duesberg has argued that even patients with full-blown AIDS fail to demonstrate appreciable levels of active virus: 'There is no report in the literature describing the virus ever to be active in a patient, only in cell culture' (quoted in Hodgkinson 1996:138). 225 never been ascertained - the fourth postulate remains untestedConsequently, Duesberg argued, HIV itself is harmless and constitutes but one o f the multitude of infections present in AIDS patients (Dues berg, 1988). Dues berg's alternative aetiology o f AIDS, the 'risk- AIDS hypothesis', was first articulated in 1990. In his view, which incorporated and expanded the notion o f 'immune overload', AIDS resulted firom malnutrition, recreational drug-abuse, the long-term immunosupressive effects o f antibiotics, pathogens present in transfused blood, and the potentially carcinogenic anti- HIV drug AZT (Shenton, 1998).^^^ The Perth Group has also defended a non-infectious model for AIDS (Papadopulus, 1997).^^^ 6.5.3.3. - The Haemophilia Puzzle Scientists began injecting HIV-infected cell cultures into chimpanzees as long as fourteen years ago, but no animal has yet developed an AIDS-like condition (Continuum (5) 5:3). The dissident argument finds support in experiment conducted by Ter-Grigorov et al (1997) 'A new transmissible AIDS-like disease in mice induced by alloimmune stimuli, the only animal model similar to human AIDS', tiiat suggests a *non- infectious modus operandV for the of AIDS (Papadopulos-Eleopulus, 1997:31). ^ *7 The 'risk-AIDS hypothesis' was first articulated in the pages of the right-wing American publication Heritage Foundation Policy Review. Duesberg, who provided no sources for his data, appears to have borrowed many of his assumptions about the life-style risks of homosexual life from the 'homosexuality as a health hazard' literature of the 1970s (Epstein, 1996). If Duesberg had initially maintained that HTV remained inactive even in patients dying from AIDS, he later changed his mind. Duesberg came to believe that HIV did become active but that the appearance of antibodies was an effect rather than the cause of their immune deficiency. Consequently, campaigns to promote safe sex and sterile needles were misguided efforts in dealing with a 'toxic' syndrome, and as such could potentially foster the spread of the disease by focusing attention on condoms rather than on the inherent danger of the risk factors (Shenton, 1998). The 'Oxidative Stress Theory,' first developed to determine what makes a cell cancerous, argues that cardiovascular disease, cancer and ageing are caused by perturbation of the cellular redox level and its oscillations. Alterations in the cellular redox occur when the quantity of free radicals (molecules with an unpaired electron that take electrons from other molecules) that tiie bo(fy has to cope with exceeds the availability of antioxidants. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules created in tiie body, which in excess can damage tissues and cell structure. They are formed as by-products of the body's normal cell metabolism, but are also produced by environmental hazards such as air pollution, cigarette smoke, food additives, radiation, and chemicals. Free radicals, which are associated with disease, are combated by humanly produced antioxidant enzymes and by antioxidant nutrients. Antioxidants help protect the body by neutralising excess free radicals, and tiius help reduce their damaging effects. The Pertii Group has extended 'oxidative stress theory' to explain AIDS as a result of oxidative stress caused by semen received through receptive anal intercourse; nitrites; recreational drugs; the blood-clotting Factor VII used in haemophilia; antibiotics; and antiviral drugs such as AZT, 226 Haemophilia is a rare hereditary bleeding disorder treated with the injection of the blood- clotting agent Factor VIII, which is necessary for blood coagulation. The conviction that haemophiliacs have turned HTV-positive through injection o f infected Factor VIII has legitimised serious litigations across the world. By 1990 well over one thousand individuals had claimed compensation for having been infected in Britain. In France and Japan health officials have been put in jail for allowing the administration o f HIV- infected blood to haemophiliacs (Johnson, 1995). Numerous studies have demonstrated the apparently definitive association between HIV and AIDS in haemophiliacs (Becherer, 1990; Hassett, 1993; Gjerset, 1991; 1994; King, 1998). not everybody agrees. Although the role o f HTV in haemophilia had been questioned as early as 1988, it was Peter Duesberg's challenge to the idea the HIV was responsible for causing AIDS in haemophiliacs that prompted the greatest controversy (Papadopulus-Eleopulus, 1988; Duesberg, 1988). According to Duesberg (1988), haemophiliacs with or without HIV were equally immune deficient, and both groups developed the diseases associated with AIDS Duesberg argument noted that 75% out o f the 20,000 haemophiliacs residing in the US tested positive for HIV antibodies and, as over the five previous years 2% (300) o f them had developed AIDS, the risk for an American haemophiliac to develop AIDS amounted to 2% each year. However, according to the postulates o f the HIV-AIDS hypothesis, the virus was latent firom one to ten years. As such, 'at least 50 per cent o f the 15,000 HTV-positive American haemophiliacs would have developed AIDS or died from AIDS' by the time his article was published in 1992. Yet, according to the evidence presented by, a 2% annual risk o f developing AIDS indicated that an average 227 haemophiliac would have to wait twenty-five years for HIV to produce its associated illnesses. The median age o f American haemophiliacs had increased from 11 years in 1972 to 20 years in 1982 and to 25 years in 1986 despite the fact that, since the development o f HTV tests in 1984, HTV appeared to infect over 75% o f the American haemophiliac population. It was possible, then, Duesberg concluded, to make the argument that HTV had in fact increased the lifespan o f haemophiliacs (Duesberg, 1989:201-77).i^9 An epidemiological study o f British haemophiliacs, the 'Oxford Haemophilia Study' published in Nature in September o f 1995, established that in the period 1985-1992 there were 403 deaths in HTV-positive haemophiliacs. The death rates from HTV-negative individuals would have predicted only sixty deaths; thus, 85% o f the deaths in the HTV- positive group were caused by HTV infection. The Perth-Group, however, and along the same lines as Duesberg, disagreed with the study and wrote a paper that refuted the evidence presented by the Oxford study. The publication o f the Perth paper, which was vetoed by Nature but published in the dissident journal Continuum, concluded that out of the 403 deaths o f the Oxford study 235 deaths were merely assumed to be o f AIDS (Papadopulos-Eleopulos, 1995). No evidence substantiated that these deaths had actually been caused by HTV infection. In addition, the Perth Group also argued 'that what has been called HTV infection in haemophiliacs is not caused by an exogenous retrovirus to which haemophiliacs have been exposed to but by the administration o f Factor VIII preparations' (Eleopulos-Papadopulos, 1995). This was suggested by the fact that some 189 Duesberg also argued that, according to CDC statistics, the rate of development of AIDS-defining illnesses observed in wives of haemophiliacs was too small to corroborate the hypothesis that HTV was 228 haemophilic children who present no risk factors, and whose carefully controlled factor VIII has systematically tested negative for HIV antibodies, become HIV-positive. A positive antibody test in haemophiliacs, hypothesise the Australian scientists, results from the amount o f foreign protein in Factor VIII. In its original formula factor VIII contained 99% o f impurities and only 1% of clotting factor. The quantity (dose-related) and time (age-related) o f Factor VIII product administered to each individual would be the other two relevant variables in an HTV diagnosis in 1872 by the Viennese dermatologist Moritz Kaposi, in males living across the Habsburg Empire. However, by the middle o f the twentieth century KS was reported to be common among elderly men o f tropical Afiican, Sicilian, and Ashkenazy Jewish descent (Christie, 1996).'\u00ae' But now, at the end o f the twentieth century, KS was attacking homosexuals; so far it had killed eight out o f the twenty-six first diagnosed (Epstein, 1996). KS is a cancer o f the blood vessels, which develops internally as well as externally. Its characteristic purple lesions, which appear throughout the surface o f the body, became the most identifiable stigmata o f AIDS, the visible confirmation o f the physical and moral degeneration o f its bearers.'\u00ae^ The harrowing skin lesions caused by KS made visible the inherent 'hazard' o f being a homosexual. KS materialised the imagined linkage o f fortuitous appearance o f disease sexually transmitted (Shenton, 1998). '\u00ae\u00ae When given improved versions of Factor VIII (which contained 99% clotting factor and 1% impurities and cost twice as much as the 'dirtier' version), the health of haemophiliacs improved dramatically (Shenton, 1998). For a series of other studies supporting this argument see Hodgkinson, 1996. '\u00ae ' For reasons yet to be discovered KS is fifteen more times common in men tiian women (King, 1996). 229 with the perceived cultural-ethnic properties o f its victims. Yet, the medical theories that supported the notion o f putrefying lesions as the sign o f intrinsic rot were disputed almost as soon as they were proposed. If KS were indeed caused by an infectious agent why had there been no cases o f KS amongst haemophiliacs? The largest UK study of AIDS among haemophiliacs did not identify one single case o f KS, and an American study revealed that, o f the thirteen HTV- positive children with KS, all (but one) descended from African populations where KS is endemic (Beral, 1990; Darby, 1995). The epidemiological classification o f KS identifies four main types. There is the sporadic KS of Sicilian men and Ashkenazy Jewish males, which usually appears in relatively old age. There is the endemic (and mostly ubiquitous) KS of tropical Afiricans between the ages o f 2-15 and 25-45, the iatrogenic KS of organ transplant recipients who have been given immunosuppressive drugs, and the epidemic KS of gay men from 1980 onwards. Yet, in the words of Gallo's team published in Science as early as December o f 1984, 'the absence o f detectable HTLV-3 sequences in Kaposi's sarcoma tissue of AIDS patients suggests that this tumour is not directly induced by infection o f each tumour cell with HTLV-3' (quoted in Hodgkinson, 1996: 360). Simply, because HTV is not found in the cells o f KS lesions, it cannot directly cause KS. Once it was firmly established that HTV could not directly cause KS, it was hypothesised that HIV's immune suppressive effect was its indirect cause. However, the laboratory In the Hollywood Aids-epic 'Philadelphia' the sight of the protagonist's body, covered with KS lesions, epitomises the suffering caused by AIDS, 230 abnormalities (alterations in T4 and T8 cells) that defined the immune suppression thought to be caused by HTV infection were also found in (HTV-negative) heterosexuals. In the latter, as well as in HTV-positive and HTV-negative homosexuals, these immunological abnormalities were also associated with a wide range o f causes such as blood transfusions, infections, and antibiotics. In 1988 the U S's military Walter Reed Army Institute o f Research decided to drop KS from its list o f AIDS-defining illnesses: In our system the presence of opportunistic infection is a criterion for tiie diagnosis of AIDS, but the presence of Kaposi's sarcoma is omitted because the cancer is not caused by immune suppression (Redfied and Burke, 1988:262). Two years later, a team o f scientists fixjm the CDC proposed a new hypothesis: a yet unidentified sexually transmitted agent caused KS in persons with AIDS (Beral, 1990). The Perth Group disagreed, and argued that it was inconsistent with the current knowledge o f other neoplasms (tumours) to assume that KS is exceptional by having a single cause in all individuals. Again the Australians proposed an alternative etiological model to explain the stupendous rise o f KS amongst AIDS patients (20,000 times more likely to appear in AIDS patients than in the general population). KS was attributed to different oxidising agents in the various affected groups. Once more the dissident notion that the complex o f diseases associated with AIDS has a toxic rather than infectious genesis was reiterated (Papadopulos-Eleopulus, 1992). In a 1994 meeting o f the American National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), dozens o f HTV-firee cases of KS among gay men were reported (Hodgkinson, 1996). Today, all HTV/AIDS experts, including Gallo, accept that HIV has no direct or indirect role in KS (Christie, 1996). 231 However, KS when found in an HTV-positive patient still produces an AIDS di^nosisJ^^ 6.5.3.5.- An Epidemic in the Western World? Since the beginning o f the health crisis the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have revised the definition o f AIDS four times. Whereas in 1983 two diseases comprised the syndrome by 1985 the CDC had declared that another eight diseases should be added to the list, and included specific reference to HTV as a pre-condition o f AIDS. In 1987 the spectrum o f diseases that constituted the syndrome was expanded even further to a total o f forty-two diseases. Again, in 1993 the disease spectrum was broadened with the addition o f pulmonary tuberculosis, cervical cancer, and recurrent bacterial pneumonia, or a CD4 count o f less than 200.^^\"* All the diseases that comprise AIDS had previously existed, none are new diseases. It is widely believed that the four redefinitions o f what constitutes AIDS have been necessary adjustments that reflect the developing epidemiological nature o f a syndrome whose scope is continually increasing (King, 1998). However, some have argued that what these redefinitions actually do is disguise the fact that the 'epidemic' is in fact Maggiore, 1996; Shenton, 1998). The 1993 redefinition, broadened to encompass individuals who may have no actual disease (even if they have a depleted T-cell count), doubled the number o f American In its factsheet about skin cancers CancerBACUP, the UK's leading cancer information service, states that 'AIDS-related KS is the commonest and most quickly developing form of the disease' (canceibacup.org.id:). 232 AIDS cases overnight Before the 1993 redefinition, AIDS cases had actually levelled off in all risk groups. However, after the redefinition 'more than half o f all AIDS cases reported for 1996 (62%) were among people meeting the non-illness criteria for AIDS.' If the first (1983) AIDS definition had continued to be employed, by 1996 AIDS would only have afflicted 8,200 new Americans. According to the CDC's latest available AIDS data, the HIV/AIDS Suryeillance 1998 Year-end Report, the number o f 'persons living with AIDS' (or AIDS prevalence) was 270,841 in 1997 (www.cdc.gov). Although there is no data to inform us how many o f those people actually have any manifestation o f disease, if the 1996 proportions above were kept unchanged only 102,920 individuals would have actually been sick with one (or more) o f the forty-five diseases which comprise AIDS. Interestingly, the US's National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD) defines a rare disease as any that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans (www.rarediseases.org). Moreover, in every year through 1994 AIDS prevalence fell below 200,000 (Maggiore, 1996). Current official estimates calculate that 34 million people are infected with HIV worldwide, o f whom 24 million are in sub-Saharan Africa (Durban Declaration, 2000). Official 1996 statistics estimated that 21 million adults were living with HIV/AIDS, and that while heterosexual intercourse accounted for more than 70% of such infections homosexual intercourse was responsible for between 5%-10%. Transfusion o f HIV- infected blood or blood products was deemed to account for 3%-5%, and drug-use for European countries have adopted the 1993 CDC definition, but have excluded the less-than-200-CD4 criteria. 1^^ An individual's CD4 cells can vary greatly within a 24-hour period according to a variety of different fitctors, and are not predictive of AIDS (King, 1994). 233 5%\"10% (UNAIDS website). In the western world, however, AIDS has not significantly spread beyond the so-called risk-groups. In the US, for example, 94% o f all AIDS cases remain confined to gay men and IV drug users. Michael Fumento's The Afyth o f Heterosexual AIDS first challenged the notion that AIDS was 'going firom heterosexual to heterosexual to heterosexual through intercourse, was epidemic among non-drug- abusing heterosexuals' (1990:14). Fumento showed that only 'about nine tenths o f 1 percent' o f all AIDS cases in the US was accounted for by 'whites who are thought to have become infected through heterosexual intercourse'. Fumento argued that heterosexual transmission is usually associated with being the sexual partner of an IV drug user. As such, an even smaller percentage o f these cases belonged to the white middle-class.'^^ AIDS cases in whites thought to have become infected through heterosexual intercourse (not excluding those exposed to 'high risk partners') account only for 6% o f all AIDS cases. Moreover, if we include only the cases of white heterosexual transmission, without evidence o f 'high risk partners', that percentage will drop to 0.3% (PHLS, 9/1998 - Table 1). As such, the 'de-gaying' o f the epidemic might have been a benevolent tactic to secure funding to research a disease remote firom mainstream society but its unanticipated effect was the ultimate triumph of politics over science. Indeed, it is the triumph of politics over reality, with what is \"right\" or \"correct\" determined not by what is scientifically right or correct, but by whatever happens to f\u00eet a specif\u00eec agenda and whatever is socially acceptable. It shows the ability of the state, the media, and various special interests to shift an entire nation's perception - indeed of several nations - of the spread of the disease (Fumento, 1990:14) 196 jjje great majority of IV drug users come from the lower classes (Fumento, 1990). 234 Epidemiology is a normalising science; it reinforces 'unexamined notions of normality to measure and classify deviations from the norm / This normalising function underpins the fabric o f the epidemiological data used to classify HIV-infected persons under specific 'exposure categories' constructed through 'hierarchical representation' (Epstein, 1996). As it is often difftcult to establish the route through which an individual has become infected with HTV where there has been exposure to HTV infection by more then one route, allocation to the summary categories used in these tables is based on a judgement as to which is the most probable route. Those exposed to infection, for instance, both through sex between men and injecting drug use, are usually allocated to the summary category of sex between men because of the greater fiequency of HTV infection in that group in the UK (Public Health Laboratory Service AIDS Centre, 1998) Hierarchical representation 'de-emphasizes and underrepresents every patient characteristic except homosexuality'; it highlights the moral function o f medical science, Wiich in 'its statistical misrepresentation o f reality' presumes the most 'sinful' to be the most 'dangerous'. In the US, for example, it is estimated that 25% o f gay men with AIDS are also IV drug users. This 25% figure, which is equivalent to 19% o f the totality o f US AIDS cases, ends iqj classified under the 'homosexual-exposure' category rather than the 'IV-drug-use category'. If such cases were classified under FV drug use, and were added to those o f heterosexual TV drug users (17% of total AIDS cases), the percentage of American AIDS cases attributable to IV drug use would rise to 36% o f the total (Lauristen, 1993:57-63). 235 6.6.- Suppressing Resistance The veracity and exactness o f the information produced by the 'dissident critique' and the 'dissident movement' is not the concern of this analysis. So far my goal has been the introduction o f the movement's cultural content, its ethos, tactics, resources and constituency. The highly counter-cultural ethos o f the dissident movement makes it an obvious choice for counter-resistance strategies from the mainstream institutions which it attacks. It is thus not surprising that the movement has encountered significant opposition. 6.6.1.- Suppressing Dissent Information Publicly relevant engagement with the dissident critique often has significant consequences. Michael Fumento's The Myth o f Heterosexual AIDS was one o f the first expos\u00e9s o f the political manipulation o f the health crisis. The controversial message o f the book was an elaboration o f an article, which Fumento had written for the New Republic magazine in 1988. In it Fumento criticised AIDS lobbyists and health educators for exaggerating the risks o f the epidemic, and denounced conservative politics for using the epidemic to promote their own political agenda. The book's main message was that AIDS posed no threat to the 'general population'. The publication o f this article cost Fumento his job as an AIDS analyst for the US Government's Commission on Human Rights (Hodgkinson, 1996). 236 Robert Root-Bemstein, who was associate professor o f physiology at Michigan State University, was the second youngest recipient ever to receive the five-year Mac Arthur fellowship. The fellowship, known as the 'genius grant', is awarded to unusually promising experts o f various fields. In April o f 1990, Root-Bemstein's Tetter-to-the- editor' was published in the Lancet. In it Root-Bemstein entertained several hypotheses: AIDS may not be a new disease; AIDS might be caused by other factors besides HTV; HIV may constitute an infection that takes hold o f previously immuno-supressed individuals. Such ideas occurred to him as a result o f his research which demonstrated that before 1970 around 20% o f all Kaposi's sarcoma cases fit the pattern that was generally believed to have arisen only after the appearance o f HIV. Bernstein's 1993 book Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost o f Premature Consensus, which argued for the ftmdamental role o f co-factors in the development o f AIDS, was totally ignored by the lay and scientific press in the UK. Neville Hodgkinson, the Sunday Times ' science correspondent, was criticised by the mainstream media for the mere fact o f having reviewed Bernstein's book. This review marked the beginning o f a series o f articles reporting on dissident views, which Hodgkinson began to publish in the Sunday Times in 1993. In the end, Hodgkinson's reporting on dissident ideas cost him his job as well (Hodgkinson, 1996:206). The television production company 'Meditel' first got involved in the questioning o f the scientific validity o f the HTV/AIDS hypothesis with the documentary AIDS: The Unheard Voices. The Channel 4 documentary, which centred on an interview with Duesberg, explained the scientist's critique o f the HTV/AIDS model. Three years later, the Meditel 237 team produced another documentary. The AIDS Catch, which was shown in the 'Dispatches' series on Channel 4 in JuneJ^^ The film expanded on the ideas o f the first documentary, and reported on Duesberg's 'risk-AIDS' hypothesis and its radical corollary: that AIDS was not an infectious, sexually transmitted disease. The AIDS Catch also featured the first interview in which Luc Montaigner revealed his doubts about HIV's harmfulness without the presence o f co-factors. The controversy caused by the documentary was tremendous. Despite protests fixmi Channel 4 and the Independent Television Commission, the BCC found that the program had been unfair in its treatment o f the subject The BBC, however, stated that although it could not discuss the scientific arguments. Meditel went on to produce AIDS in Africa in 1993. This film challenged the idea that heterosexual AIDS in Afirica was rampant, and suggested that it was the availability o f international funding for HTV that encouraged the classification o f other illnesses as AIDS. In 1994 Meditel produced yet another controversial documentary. Diary o f an AIDS Dissident, where viewers o f Sky News were shown efforts o f the AIDS establishment to siqypress dissident publications. Meditel's last documentary - H IV Testing (1998) - which had been commissioned by Channel 4 's news editor Jim Gray to be aired during the 1998 World AIDS Day was, however, altogether banned at the very last minute due to pressure firom the medical profession (Walker, 1999). The AIDS Catch received the Royal Television Society Award for the best international current affairs documentary in 1987 (Hodgkinson, 1996). The Independent published a letter of protest, which was signed by several of the UK's leading figures in the fight against AIDS. David Lloyd, Channel 4's commissioner of the two Meditel documentaries on AIDS, replied by arguing that these two forty-minute documentaries represented the only television broadcasting time which had ever been dedicated to the dissenting opinion in Britain. The drugs manufacturer, Burroughs-Wellcome, and the AIDS organisation, the 'Terrence Higgins Trust,' took Meditel to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC). 238 Meditel's 1990 documentary The AIDS Catch prompted the first serious rebuttal of Duesberg's work. By then Duesberg had argued not only that HTV was harmless and not sexually transmitted, but also criticised the reliabihty o f ELISA tests and o f the main therapeutic drug used in the treatment o f HIV infection (AZT). The publishing o f a two- page commentary in Nature, which followed the broadcast o f The AIDS Catch in the beginning o f 1990, was pivotal in the National Institute o f Health's refusal o f Duesberg's application for renewal o f his five-hundred-thousand-dollar-a-year \"outstanding investigator' grant. However, although Nature' s commentary constituted the first effort fiom the orthodoxy to respond to Duesberg, it was deemed to be \"an emotive \"commentary\" a scientific rebuttal' (Hodgkinson, 1996:167; Epstein, 1996). Duesberg fought for the following two years to have the NHI decision reversed, but his efforts were fmitless. Since then every single one o f his peer-reviewed grant applications to federal, state, or private agencies has been withdrawn; and his once automatic access to prestigious academic publications has been severely curtailed. 6.6.2.- Suppressing State Dissent One o f the most recent supporters o f the \"dissident movement' is South Afiican president Thabo Mbeki. In his \"Letter to World Leaders on AIDS in Afiica', which was posted to heads o f state around the world on April 3 * ^ ^ , 2000, Mbeki wrote: In an earlier period in human history, these (dissidents) would be heretics that would be burnt at the stake! Not long ago, in our own country, people were killed, tortured, imprisoned and prohibited from being quoted in private and public because the established authority believed that their views were dangerous and discredited. We are now being asked to do precisely toe same 239 thing that the racist apartheid tyranny we oppose did, because, it is said, there exists a scientific view that is supported by the majority, against which dissent is prohibited. The scientists we are supposed to put into scientific quarantine include Nobel Prize Winners, members of Academies of Science and Emeritus Professors of various disciplines of medicine (SAPA, 05/05/2000) South Africa's AIDS prevention campaigns were initiated only after the African National Congress took over from the apartheid government in 1994. Such delay has been deemed responsible for South Africa's exorbitant number of HTV-infected individuals: 8,200,000 people. In face o f such alarming statistics, President Mbeki embarked in a research effort to familiarise himself with the problem of AIDS. He is reported to have spent a great deal o f time browsing the Internet for information on AIDS (SAPA, 05/05/2000). The results o f Mbeki's research efforts led him to announce, a few months before the 13^ International Conference on AIDS was to take place in South Afnca, his intention to ^rpoint an international advisory panel o f experts to critically appraise the established medical model o f AIDS. Mbeki could not have foreseen the uproar his decision would cause. Mbeki assembled an advisory panel constituted of eleven 'dissident' and twenty-two 'orthodox' experts on AIDS. Mbeki's scheme envisioned a two-tier process where the participants would first meet to establish the terms o f the debate. The actual debate, where the participants were siqjposed to prove or disprove at least some o f the conflicting ideas, was to take place through a special closed Internet forum for the subsequent two months. After the debate had been concluded the participants would meet again in order 240 to finalise their results. Such meeting would take place right before the start o f the 13^ International AIDS Conference in the South Afiican coastal city o f Durban. Mbeki's plan, however, utterly failed. The panellists first met in the beginning o f May in Pretoria, the country's capital. Mbeki's scheme proposed that dissident as well as orthodox experts congregate in multiple ' ' mixed' teams in order to present and discuss scientific data. The press should be invited to observe the initial debate. In reality, orthodox panellists used their majority vote to spht the panel into two groups, each comprised exclusively of either dissident or orthodox experts. The majority vote also banned the participation of the media, and the presentation o f any scientific data. In addition, the scientific 'debate', which was meant to have taken place over the Internet in the intervening two months, was a fiasco. Orthodox representatives completely ignored dissident questioning and evaluation. Moreover, the orthodox share o f virtual space was left utterly blank for the two months in which the scientific debate ought to have taken place. Mbeki's organisers were reported to be fiirious (Rethinking AIDS, (8) 8). The 13^ International AIDS Conference opened on the 9* o f July o f 2000. On the 6^ of July the 'Durban Declaration' was published in Nature, and released just before the second meeting o f the advisory panel. Whilst the orthodox panel advisers had blatantly avoided any form o f debate in the forum set up by the South Afiican government, many o f them comprised the list o f 5,195 scientists and physicians firom around the world who had signed the 'Durban Declaration'. The Durban document - 'a declaration by scientists and physicians affirming HIV is the cause o f AIDS' \u2014 did not address the issues raised by 199 20% of South Africa's 41 million inhabitants are supposed to be HTV-positive. This represents the highest number of HTV infected individuals of any nation in the world (Washington Post 10/06/00). 241 the dissident critique. It simply constituted a reverberation o f the orthodoxy o f HIV. A month later. Nature published the dissident response - 'The Durban Declaration Is Not Accepted By AIT - where the 'clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous' evidence presented by the signatories o f the Durban Declaration was contested [Nature 407,286 (2000)].^\u00ae\u00ae Mbeki was not intimidated. His press secretary declared that if the Durban Declaration was officially presented to him it would find its place 'amongst the dustbins in the office (SAPA, 10/06/00). The 13^ Conference on AIDS became a 'Mbeki-bashing event' (SAPA, 10/06/00). Thousands demonstrated at Durban's City Hall before the meeting began. Later, in his opening speech to the 10,000 delegates, broadcast live on South African television, Mbeki blamed malnutrition, poverty, and inequity as the causes o f the great burden o f disease in the African continent Hundreds o f delegates walked out on President Mbeki, as he failed to state that HIV is the cause o f AIDS (Washington Post, 10/06/00). Unabated, and despite increasing international pressure and discredit Mbeki has stuck to his position. In a controversial interview with America's Time magazine o f September 11,2000 Mbeki stated: Clearly there is such a thing as acquired immune deficiency. The question you have to ask is what produces this deficiency. A ^ o l e variety of things can cause the immune system to collapse. Now it is perfectly possible that among those things is a particular virus. But the notion that immune deficiency is only acquired from a single virus cannot be sustained. Once you say immune deficiency is acquired from that virus your response will be antiviral drugs. But if you accept that 200 A number of the 13 scientific references iqx)n which the document based its 'indisputable' evidence 242 there can be a variety of reasons, including poverty and the many diseases that afflict Africans, then you can have a more comprehensive treatment response A month after his Time interview, President Thabo Mbeki addressed the two hundred members o f his country's National Assembly. After discussing some points concerning international relations and economic matters, the President focused on the controversy his views on AIDS have caused. Mbeki said a propaganda war was being waged against him, and that institutions and individuals determined to maintain the current world economic order were leading such attempt. Mbeki stated that the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had become covertly involved in the dissemination o f the notion that HIV causes AIDS, and that what passed as US aid constitutes, in reality, loans for African governments to buy anti-HIV medication. He concluded his address by demanding a positioning on the issue by the members of his Cabinet, and pleaded for support in his challenge not only to the AIDS industry, but also in his government's attempts to strike a better deal for developing nations in the international economic order (SAPA, 12/11/2000). Subsequently, dissident organisations have established 'The International Coalition to End AIDS Censorship'. Its objective is to support President Mbeki's call for an open scientific debate on the definition, causation, treatment and prevention o f AIDS. 3,500 signatures have so far been gathered (virusmyth.com).20l 'did not support the points they were cited to support' (Rethinking AIDS 8 (8):3). 20^ In 2003 the South African government has started providing antiretroviral treatment for its population. 243 6.7.- The Medical Gaze: probing the positive body In 1993 Kary Mullis won a Nobel Prize for inventing 'biotechnology's version o f the Xerox machine' - known as 'Polymerase Chain Reaction' (PGR). PCR enables the multiplication o f a minute sample o f DNA into millions o f copies, PCR technology was first publicised during the 11^ International AIDS Conference in Vancouver in early 1996. By the end o f that year, the 'viral load' test (as PCR technology is popularly known) had undoubtedly become the principal surrogate marker o f disease p r o g r e s s i o n . 2 9 2 i n the Vancouver Conference the initial success o f 'combination therapy' was also announced. As such, the conference marked the triumph of the virological conception of HIV aetiology and treatment. Since the mid-1980s it had been widely believed that HIV infection remained latent in the body for many years. In this 'dormant' state, however, HTV somehow depleted the infected body firom its vital CD4 cells. PCR technology, postulated David Ho and his research team, demonstrated that there was no dormant period o f HIV infection (Ho et al, 1995). The virulent activity o f HIV could now be measured by PCR, and be identified in recently infected individuals. After PCR a number o f significant changes have occurred in HTV clinical practice; the main goal o f anti-HIV therapy has become the achievement of 'undetectable viral load'. Although health monitoring o f the positive body continues to involve multiple pathologies, T-cell testing, which had been the primary marker of the disease for over a decade, has been upstaged by the measurement o f 'viral load' as the decisive factor in treatment decision- making.203 As a result o f such technological developments, an important shift in the The test is thought to quantify the level of HTV in plasma, relaying the activity of virus in the blood in terms of a logarithmic scale. 203 The Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases, for example, states that the viral load test is ^central to making decisions to start or switch antiretroviral therapy, (and able to) predict progression 244 conceptualisation o f AIDS occurred in 1996. The syndrome AIDS would now be better conceptualised as HIV disease since the new technology had demonstrated that the positive body engaged in a continuous battle against the virus from the moment of infection. The shift in the conceptualisation o f AIDS to HIV disease was accompanied with the new treatment strategy o f HAART. Previously assessed in terms o f preserving immune function, antiviral treatment now came to be determined mainly in terms of viral suppression. PCR technology had revealed the high levels o f viral activity in the bodies o f the newly infected; as such, 'hit hard, hit early' became the new motto of biomedicine's treatment strategy. Sadly, the initial euphoria occasioned by the new 'cure' only lasted for a little while. The utility o f early intervention has not been proven by clinical trials, and the efficacy o f combination therapy in fighting HTV disease has often been disappointing (Positive Times, 20/03/1998), Four years of 'hit hard, hit early' HIV treatment may be on the way out in the US, as evidence mounts of the drugs' serious side effects. AIDS experts in the US are about to complete a humiliating U-tum when the Department of Health and Human Services launches its revised HTV treatment guidelines in January. The revisions will underline the need to hold back from using powerfiil antiviral drugs until the immune systems of HTV patients show significant signs of decline. It reflects the view, long held by British doctors, that early use of currently available drugs may do more harm than good... British doctors were often ridiculed at conferences and in the pages of research journals for suggesting the drugs be used more cautiously, in case they proved too toxic for patients who take them for years or decades at a time...taking a combination of to AIDS and death independently of CD4 counts' {Antiretroviral Therapy fo r HIV 245 protease inhibitor and transcriptase inhibitor drugs early on in HIV disease could do patients more harm than good {New Scientist, 12/16/2000) Although HAART therapy has benefited many HIV-infected patients, the benefits of the drags cannot be evenly shared. Several recent studies have found that the new drags work only for some patients, and that many develop severe side effects.^^ As we have seen, one of the main dissident arguments against the HTV/AIDS hypothesis is that traditional methods o f virus detection produce no detectable virus (even persons dying o f AIDS present very low levels o f 'viral activity'), and that the presence of HTV is measured by indirect methods that are not specific to HTV.205 The dissident critique argues that if minimal amounts o f HIV were present, then traditional techniques o f virus detection, rather than PCR technology should be sufficient. Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel prize for the invention o f PCR technology has criticised the use o f his invention to detect HTV, and has referred to quantitative PCR as 'an o x y m o r o n ' . ^ ^ 6 p c R 's sensitivity will amplify whatever DNA is in the sample - whether HTV-related or not (PCR may detect HTV in those who test negative for HTV antibodies). As such, it is difficult to decide which amplified material belongs to HTV and which belongs to the contaminants, especially when HTV cannot be found in the sample without the use o f PCR in the first place. For such reasons, the US's FDA does not recommend nor license PCR for diagnostic Use. Standard o f Care Guidelines (10,1997:11). A German study, for example, has recently reported a 44% failure rate from 198 HTV-positive patients treated with protease inhibitors, and concluded that 'the favourable results from controlled studies with antiretroviral drugs containing protease inhibitors cannot simply be translated into everyday clinical practice' (v4//)S(15), 1997:15-17). These indirect measures are: detection of reverse transcriptase or the presence of a p24 protein (which, for example, is detected in 35% of patients with biliary cirrhosis) (Lancet, 30/05/1988). 246 purposes in HIV disease. Yet, as in the case of surgery for TB, the medical profession is often oblivious to issues o f efficacy and validity when a new technology is favoured. Thus, although PCR is not FDA-approved for diagnostic use, and is unable to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious genetic fragments, the use o f the new technique has come to dominate HIV science (Maggiore, 1996; Johnson, 1996a). HTV is much more than a biological entity - it is a social phenomenon, a powerful marker o f identity with a myriad of socio-economic consequences. As we have seen in the previous chapters o f this thesis, many 'micrological' resistance strategies have been articulated to countereffect and combat the stigma o f HIV and homosexuality. In the present chapter I have not attempted to provide a scientific critique o f the science that surrounds HIV. What I have endeavoured to do is demonstrate how modem science, deemed to constitute 'a public space with restricted access', may protect its boundaries to the point where this 'form of knowledge that is the most open in principle has become the most closed in practice' (Hodgkinson, 1996:21). Since the inception o f the first antiviral dmg (AZT), debate on early intervention has existed as a discourse articulated and constrained by a multiplicity o f actors and institutions: biomedicine, the pharmaceutical industry, the dissident critique, HTV-infected individuals, AIDS activism, and public health policy makers. However, only after the appropriation o f PCR technology by the science o f HTV/AIDS did the 'hit hard, hit early' therapeutic strategy become institutionalised as legitimate (even if contested) knowledge. As such, knowledge(s) and systems o f surveillance have firmly crystallised around the positive body, which is 206 Mullis has also said: 'If there is evidence that HTV causes AIDS, there should be scientific documents that either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability. There is no such 247 constantly monitored in terms o f its compliance to HAART treatment. The medical system, as such, has achieved an unprecedented level o f incursion into the lives and the bodies o f the infected. In the following chapter I shall analyse the empirical data I have collected. My objective is to examine how these configurations o f power and knowledge have played out on the individuals of my sample, and the particular characteristics of the resistance strategies they might have engaged in after having received an HIV diagnosis. {tocument* (Interview with Kary Mullis, Spin July, 1994). 248 Chapter 7 HTV-Diagnosed: Constructing Resistance and Legitimising Identities 7.1.- Conducting Computer-Assisted (HAMLET') Text Analysis The social scientific study o f the 'meaning' of communication is articulated through a series of techniques known as 'content', 'text' or 'thematic' analysis. Since the first basic quantitative analyses o f printed texts took place in eighteenth century Sweden (Kripendorfif, 1980), the technique has significantly e v o l v e d . 2 0 7 The focus o f the technique is the invisible dimension o f language, its symbolic content. Several definitions o f text analysis have been proposed (Stone et al, 1966; Berelson, 1971 ; Kripendorff, 1980; Shapiro and Markoff, 1997); the various approaches should be applied in accordance with the symbolic objects o f communication o f each particular study. As such, 'text' can be interpreted in a variety o f ways.^\u00ae* The material characteristics o f 'text' do not constitute the most relevant aspect for text analysis studies as the definition o f 'text' depends on the nature o f the research questions. However, interpretative approaches to communication material which call themselves 'text analysis' must observe the fundamental principle o f objectivity and engage in systematic analysis. Its five stages of development so far are: 'fi' equency' analysis (fi^quency of words/themes in a text) until the 1950s; 'valence' analysis (negatively and positively valued words) in the 1950s'; 'intensity analysis' (words/themes were assigned weights to indicate tiie relative strength of assertions) up to the 1960s; 'contingency' analysis (text analysis evolved from its purely descriptive phase to investigating the associations between textual characteristics) starting from the 1960s; computer assisted analysis from die 1960s to the present (Popping, 2000). 208 xhere are three fundamental definitions of text The first defines text as every semiotic structure of meaning (including not only language, but plastic art, music and social action and events). The second 249 Objectivity implies a number o f technical subterfuges to avoid bias whereas being systematic signifies the inclusion and exclusion o f categories according to consistently applied rules.^\u00ae^ In my qualitative research project the emphasis was not on statistical inference; categories were hence devised in terms o f their presence or absence, not in terms o f their variable scaling points on ordinal levels o f measurement (George, 1959). The focus was both on 'manifest' (defined by the standard use o f the word) and 'latent' (defined by all the other possible uses o f the word) content o f the object o f study, i.e. transcripts o f interviews o f HIV-infected male individuals. In my research 'text' was viewed as a 'linguistic' form o f expression (Popping, 2000). 7.2.- Code Development 7.2.1. Exploring Codes through Word Frequencv Analvsis With the goal o f expanding on the initial (potential, provisional) conceptual categories that had emerged firom the NUDIST organisation and analysis o f the data, the single def\u00eenitioD only includes linguistic means of expression. The third definition of text refers to written language only (Lindkvist, 1981). Reliability is a critical component in the use of thematic analysis; it means consistency of observation and interpretation. For example, in order to determine the reliability of themes, codes should be applied to a subsample of the data by independent coders (people other than the person who has developed the codes). If desired levels of reliability and consistency of agreement of the themes in the code are not achieved then the codes should be abandoned. Consistency of observation, i.e., intrarater and interrater reliability is achieved when independent coders abstract similar information from the codes. Research design and methods, such as standardisation of the interview process; also affect the degree of consistency of observation that can be achieved. Systematic procedures of comparison between codes, and the determination of their presence or absence in the data, will also increase the reliability of codes inasmuch as they are continuously reviewed against the data and as such can be reviewed, rethought, dropped, and rewritten if necessary (Boyatzis, 1998). 250 words o f each of the ten transcripts selected for thematic analysis were analysed by HAMLET. In the first stage o f conducting thematic analysis HAMLET produced a list o f the frequency of words uttered in each interview as according to the transcripts. The next step was to remove the utterances o f the interviewer from each individual transcript with the objective of obtaining a more accurate lexical picture o f interviewees' usage of words. Another 'frequency o f words' run was then executed for each transcript, and compared to the previous run (which included the interviewers' vocabulary as well).^^\u00ae These lists o f respondents-only utterances provided me with a complete panorama, in descending order o f frequency, of all the respondents' words present in each transcript. I was therefore able to assess word-usage in each transcript, and compare word-usage between transcripts o f each subset. After I had familiarised m yself with each individual transcript, and in order to refine my understanding o f how the two subsets understood their experience o f HIV infection, a 'total' file was created for each subset. The 'total orthodox file' contained all (and only the) utterances o f the five orthodox interviewees and the 'total dissident file' contained all (and only the) utterances o f the five dissident respondents. Such a procedure allowed me to contrast the word-usage o f each 'total file' with the general usage of words in spoken English (Leech at al, 2001), and hence determine which were the most common 'uncommon' words each subset employed in order to describe their experience o f being an individual infected with HIV. In order to illustrate the process o f how I devised my categories I present in Table 1 and Table 2 below the preliminary exploratory set of codes for each subset. These exploratory 210 See appendix C for an example of a frequency of words table. 251 codes were devised after the most 'coinmon-uncommon-words' were grouped together in terms o f the different categories they were thought to represent. At this point in the process some NUDIST derived categories were dropped as no 'common-uncommon- words' pertaining to the NUDIST category emerged. The most important example is the 'religion' category, which I had previously hypothesised might be related to therapeutic choice. Yet, in neither one o f the subsets 'Religion' appeared as relevant. In addition, new categories suggested by the HAMLET analysis were brought in. For example, in analysing the orthodox subset it was revealed that the word 'never' constituted a very frequent word in all transcripts. As such, the exploratory code 'Never' was introduced. 252 Table 1 : Exploratory Codes for Orthodox Subset Codes Interview 2J Interview 3A Interview 5S Interview 17 OSInterview 19M B/A before after after after before after Gay out gay out out gay out gay out Never never never never never never Time time years time years time years time year weeks monthsmonths years Wellness well hospital healthwell well sick well well sick healing herbs Family mother mother mother father father mother People people people people people people Belief think thought thought think think thought think AIDS HTV positive medicationmV positive HTV positive mv diagnosed Sex sex sex sex sex Experience experience experience Relationship relationship relationship relationship Life died life life life Drugs drugs drugs Hardness hard hard problems difficulthard 253 The analysis of individual dissident transcripts suggested that this subset employed many o f the same categories o f the orthodox subset. In addition, some new provisional categories emerged 6om the dissident data (these new categories are represented in Table 2 below, after the two blank rows which were introduced to highlight the distinction). For example, the code 'God' was created for this subset as the words God and spirit appeared frequently in three o f the transcripts. Table 2 includes all the new (dissident) codes, and all the codes of the orthodox subset so that I could then compare the degree o f presence or absence o f the codes in the two different subsets. 254 Table 2: Exploratory Codes for Dissident Subset Codes Interview 8HDInterview IID JInterview 15DAInterview 18 DMInterview 20 DE B/A before after after before after after after before Gay out gay out gay out out gay Never never never never never never Time time months yearstime months yearsTime months yearstime yearstime months Wellness well well hospital doctorsdoctor well sickwell well sick treatment Family mother people people people people Belief think thought supposebelieve thoughttiiought tiiink think thought believethink thought AIDS HIV positive AIDS testHIV AIDS positive KS test negativeHTV AIDS diagnosedHTV HIV positive cancer chemotherapy Sex sexual sex sex sex sex unsafe Experience experience ejqjerience Relationship relationship relationship Life life life died died life death life Drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs (hags Hardness Appended Codes Work work money money business money Antibody antibody cells CD4 viral 255 antibodies cellsload D ifference different different Combo combination therapytherapy combination Continuum continuum M ind mind mind mind God spirit god god spirit spiritual soul Stress stress stress stress Body body body body body (Table 2 continued from previous page) 256 Concqrt categories are operationalised by words and phrases. However, as a single word is often 'polysemous' the most-common-uncommon words identified above were subsequently examined in the specific contexts they were used.^^ ^ By utilising Hamlet's 'Key Word in Context Listings' I obtained a list o f all lines o f text where the single 'most-common-uncommon' words appeared and as a result could identify the different meanings and contexts in which they were used. After performing a 'content analysis' o f all transcripts, comparing and contrasting them, I was able to then aggregate single words and their multiple meanings into the codes. 7.2.2.- Creating The Vocabularv List: word senses into the codes After developing the codes and rereading transcripts several times in order to identify the other words used by respondents to refer to the same concept, I proceeded to create a vocabulary list. My vocabulary list included the single 'uncommon-most-common' words o f each code, plus all the other words (word senses) which through the close reading of the transcripts I had decided belonged to a certain code.^*^ For example, the word sense o f the word 'drug' (used to denote both anti-HIV medication and recreational drugs) had to be amplified to include: The disambiguation of a polysemous word such as 'bit' is a good example; 'bit' has different word senses such as 'the mouse bit the giiT, it was a brace-and-bit tool', a 32-bit machine'. In my data it was necessary to disambiguate the word 'drugs' because it was equally applied to denote antiretroviral therapy and recreational drugs. ^1^ Single words can not be included in different codes otherwise the categories would no longer be exclusive. 257 a. when used to describe anti-HIV medication (code 'Medication') the word sense was broadened to include: combination therapy, anti retrovirals, medication, protease inhibitors, retrovirals, 'combo', 'cocktail', and the several different specific names such drugs are commercialised as: AZT, DDI, Indinavir, etc. b. when used to describe recreational drugs (code 'Harddrugs') the word sense was broadened to include the whole array o f recreational drugs mentioned by respondents: cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine, special K, speed, Isd, acid, marijuana, pot, splif, joint, and poppers. The construction o f a vocabulary list involves the differentiation o f theoretical ideas. As such, I not only included in my vocabulary list the concepts that emerged from the HAMLET analysis o f word frequencies, but also a number o f theoretically-derived concepts I had explored through NUDIST. Therefore, my final vocabulary list included both a priori and posteriori coding schemes that fundamentally represented my emerging theory o f how identity is reconstructed after diagnosis (Popping, 2000). Such a theory coalesced after systematic exploration o f the data through HAMLET, and the previously acquired theoretical perspective I had adopted from literature review. If my codes (or categories) related single words to the relevant theoretical concepts, the vocabulary list comprised all the distinct conceptual categories that together refer to all the issues involved in the reconstruction of identity after an HIV diagnosis. 258 The final vocabulary list consisted o f twenty codes and two-hundred-and-fifty-three word senses.^ The process o f developing categories had been broadly initiated with the NUDIST analysis I had conducted on the totality o f the interviews I conducted. If the initial categories I used to aggregate data under general concepts had been deductively derived from literature review subsequent categories emerged from the empirical data and were thus inductively derived. The succeeding focus on ten interviews occasioned not only the revision o f some o f the categories generated through NUDIST but the emergence o f new ones revealed by HAMLET. In this sense my research process resembled a 'stepwise' process. It started with tentative categories that were systematically revised in relation to issues o f theoretical relevance by exhaustive and exclusive criteria in order to arrive at the next analytical step (Banks, 1976).The task now was to combine the categories into themes and sub-themes, i.e. broader clusters of distinct conceptions that related to the processes o f restructuring identity. 7.3. Analvsing Categories 7.3.1. - MultiDimensional analvsis scaling (MDS) is the name given to a number o f different models that translate the information o f a set o f data into a low-dimensional spatial configuration, i.e. a set o f points in space. Such representations facilitate the understanding o f the empirical relationships found in a data set by representing complex associations between variables See Appendix D for the vocabulary list 259 that are contained in symmetric matrices o f associations (of similarity or dissimilarity measures) (Kruskal and Wish, 1981; Coxon, 1982; Borg and Groenen, 1997). MDS hranslates such associations into points in space whose respective distances reproduce the numerical values o f the coefficients o f dissimilarity (or similarity) o f the matrix. As such, the proximity and/or distance between the variables reflects the empirical relationships of the data set. In deciding upon which MDS model to use the researcher first has to consider the type o f data that will be represented. The nominal (categorical) nature o f my data (i.e. words assigned to codes in an unordered set o f mutually exclusive categories) implied that only the order o f the entries into the matrix was o f relevance for the MDS solution appropriate to this type o f data. In order to format the data to be suitable for h a m l e t 's multidimensional scaling, the data had to be configured into a co-occurrence m a tr ix .^ h a m l e t 's application 'Joint Frequencies' was used to calculate the co\u00ad occurrences o f the words that comprise the vocabulary list. Hamlet calculates co\u00ad occurrences as the joint presence o f both words within a 'context unit'^*^. The context unit for the present analysis was ultimately decided to be 'sentences as normally punctuated' because experimentation with the 'fixed' and 'variable' context units produced insufficient co-occurrences. A matrix o f dissimilarities between the categories was produced for both data subsets as well as a 'total' matrix for the two subsets together. The co-occurrence matrices can also be represented by HAMLET as hierarchical clustering schemes (HCS). Based on the See Appendix E for the co-occurrence matrices of the data sets. HAMLET allows fw co-occurrence analysis to be performed within several contexts: fixed (a certain number of words); variable (delimited by special characters according to the researcher's decision); sentences (as normally punctuated); and collocations (within a span of words). 260 dissimilarity coefficients yielded by the matrix, HCS gathers the categories into clusters (Johnson, 1967). Hierarchical clustering constitutes a method that merges the two most similar points into a single grouping and continues to do so successively into more inclusive groupings until all variables have been accounted for. As such, HCS represented the twenty categories, referred to as 'levels o f a single total hierarchical scheme', in terms o f a total hierarchical scheme where each level is a special case o f the next highest. As such, the higher level contained all categories whereas at the lowest level there were as many clusters as there were categories. It can be said that the solution provided by HCS methods consists o f separate sets o f groiQJS or classifications that are rather unlike the spatial representational models o f MDS. However, HCS methods are often used in conjunction with MDS precisely because cluster analysis provides no information on the extent o f separation o f the clusters, even if by forming clusters at decreasing levels o f compactness HCS give considerable insight into the regions of space.2*^ As such, the clustering scheme that was yielded by HCS analysis would later be used in conjunction with MDS to gain insight into the data sets. By constructing tables o f MDS solutions with clusters drawn within, I would be able not only to determine the proximity of clusters but to home in on those with the most significant relevance (the ones formed in the initial stages o f clustermg).^'^ HCS constitutes a set o f (digoint) clusterings which are hierarchical in structure, i.e. each clustering level is a finer specification o f the one below it. In the case o f perfect data there is only one solution. However, if the data are imperfect, ambiguities enter into the 216 Another variety of clustering methods, so-called 'overlapping' or 'additive' clustering, are also used with MDS (Shepard and Arabie, 1977). 261 definition o f the distance\" between an existing cluster and the other points. Various possibilities have been suggested for defining the 'distance', and each is used in different methods o f HCS. But Johnson (1967), who developed HCS as a non-metric procedure, suggests examining such 'distances' by using the extreme values which such a 'distance' could take on the minimum ('connectedness' or 'single linkage') and the maximum ('diameter' or 'complete linkage') solutions. HAMLET, however, only enables the researcher to conduct the 'connectedness 'or 'single linkage' method, which typically produces chaining (where a single cluster is repeatedly augmented by a succession o f single points; see Table U). Therefore, I additionally employed the Johnson Hierarchical Clustering Program HICLUS in NewMDSX (http://www.newmdsx.com) software in order to be certain that my cluster analysis would not be restricted to the 'chained' perspective. See section 7.4.2. For example, SPSS uses average and median linkage methods as *die* solutions. 262 Table T: Diameter Maximum Dcndogram for Orthodox and Dissident Data Sets JOHNSON HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING PROGRAM.

As my data was represented by categorical variables, I employed the 'Basic Non-Metric Distance Model' o f MDS whereby only the order of the entries of the co-occurrence matrix is necessary for a solution. The Basic Non-Metric Model transformed the dissimilarities between categories into two or three-dimensional representations where the distances between the categories matched the dissimilarities o f the specific concepts they represent.^ Initially I wanted to see how the categories would be spatially represented in terms o f the entire sample (five dissident and five orthodox). The goal here was to set a possible framework for comparison with the two smaller subsets. The first table produced by the MINISSA option in HAMLET resulted in the following three dimensional solution: The methods employed by HAMLET to derive similarities from co-occurrence data are the Jaccard and the Sokal coefficients. In my analysis I opted for the Jaccard coefficient because it does not include joint non co-occurrences and as such is suitable for most purposes. In addition, in non-metric MDS only the rank order of the entries in the data matrix are relevant since the method monotonically transforms the data. As such, the distances of the solution should reflect closely the rank order of title data. 269 Table 1 : Three-Dimensional Solution for Total Data Set MINISSA : Multidimensional seating lis c lo s w c l\u2014 r ^ ^ - \u00ab4i5S\u00ce4\u00ab*ce' Kruskal's Stress 1 = 0.086 270 If we compare the Kruskal stress 1 of Table 1 (0.086) with the Kruskal stress 1 of Table 2 (0.14) we see that the three dimensional solution has a lower level o f stress. Stress assesses the fit between the solution and the value required to preserve an ordinal relation with the data. The Kruskal stress 1 o f Table 1 is at an acceptable level at about 1/3 o f what it would have been if the data were random (the stress 1 based on approximation to random data would be 0.2 2 ).^ 2 0 The lower the stress the better the fit; in case o f perfect data the stress would be zero. A two-dimensional solution is expected to have a higher level o f stress, i.e. to constitute a worst fit of the data in comparison to the three- dimensional solution, since the two-dimensional solution has fewer parameters to fit the data. The advantage o f a two-dimensional solution is that it is much easier to visualise. 220 Average stress values based upon simulated random data sets of varying numbers of points and dimensi(His are given in Spence (1972), and implemented in NewMDSX.

For ease of visualisation only two-dimensional solutions were used.

It is also possible that the proximity o f the non-central categories 'dissidence' and 'doenca' might constitute a separate cluster.Not much else however can be inferred from comparing Table 2 with the two dimensional solutions for the orthodox (Table 4) subset. Again, there appears to be an independent cluster of 'saude' and 'dissidence', but the rest o f the data generally conforms to the pattern encountered in Table 2. Table 6 (two-dimensional solution for dissidents) reveals nothing besides an apparent tendency for all categories to be clustered together. On its own MDS analysis did not provide me with as clear a picture as I needed for analysing the data, hence I proceeded to conduct a cluster analysis in conjunction with the MDS solutions so that I could spatially represent the Johnson hierarchical clustering solutions (Table X and Y). In order to analyse the clusters at the most significant levels o f significance the two-dimensional solutions for each subset (table 4 and table 6) were zoomed in on so that the spatial distribution of the most important clusters could be more easily looked at. Please note that the impossibility o f inserting the clusterings within the MDS solutions by computer has forced me to draw them manually, and as such very imperfectly. The category 'doenca' refers words used to describe the physical ailments or the diseases associated with HIV infection. Doenca is the Portuguese word for disease. 275 Table A: MDS Solution and Johnson Dendogram for Orthodox Subset * MINISSA : Multidimensional scaling C * - 276 Table B: MDS Solution and Johnson Dendogram scafing 7.4.2.- Different Clustering Patterns: grasping the differences and/or similarities between data sets In the Intersection Table below dissident and orthodox clusters are compared at the median level of clustering, i.e. halfway through their HCS tables as outlined on Table X and Table Y (diameter maximum dendogram for orthodox and dissident subsets respectively). This table represents the intersection of the clusters of the orthodox subset with the clusters of the dissident subsets (Coxon, 1999). 277 Intersection Table of Orthodox and Dissident Clusterings at Median Level Orthodox 4,14 6,7 10 13,15 13 6,17 6 17 7,15 3,18 s s 2^9,11,10,19 10 2,11 5,9 s. 19.Technology 20.Testcwitext 278 The intersection matrix above tells us the dissident and orthodox individuals perfectly coincide on cluster 4/14 (eq); and that they partially coincide on two other subsets (ss), 3/18 and 5/9. Note that in subset 3/18 dissidents form part o f a bigger cluster 'dominated' by the orthodox whereas the opposite is true for subset 5/9. For example, for the subset 3/18 (disclosure/stigma) dissidents associate only category 12 'Pretest' whilst the orthodox individuals have a wider group o f associations with the disclosure/stigma subset that does not include 'Pretest', but does include categories 1,2,11, and 17, respectively 'Conceptions', 'Diagnosis', 'M yself, and 'Society'. This constitutes important information about the data inasmuch as it tells us how the different groups o f individuals interpret their HTV diagnosis. Before I proceed to look at their fundamental differences in section 7.5.3., let me first separately describe how these individuals reconstruct their distinct identities in order to 'mend' their shattered 'cocoons'. 7.5.- Thematic Analvsis: describing the meaning o f clusters The description o f the particular processes o f orthodox and dissident individuals is based on quotes from my data, which have been organised from the most to the least significant levels o f meaning (descending order from the first clusters). In the following sections (7.5.2. and 7.5.3.) all quotes will be extracted for the ten interviews that comprise the 'thematic' subsets.222 The quotes will be related to transcripts by numbers: the five orthodox interviews will be numbered from one (1) to five (5), and the dissident interviews from six (6) to ten (10). The different organisation and sequencing o f clustering is different in the two subsets. As such, the analysis o f orthodox individuals The quotes have been somewhat edited to remove the repetitions, hesitations, and errors of spoken language, and to preserve anonymity. 279 was based on their specific clustering processes as illustrated in Table For the dissident individuals the analysis followed the information illustrated by Table Y.^24 7.5.1.- Orthodox Positivitv: a legitimising identity HFV diagnosis constitutes a 'fateful moment' that launches the individual into a process o f reconstructing his 'shattered' identity in an attempt to restructure a sense of self which will enable him to continue to participate in social life (Giddens, 1991). Castells (1997) argues that in contemporary, or 'network', society most social actors organise meaning around a primary identity. There are three forms o f identity building: legitimising identity, resistance identity, and project identity.^^s Whereas 'project identity' characterises the strategies o f identity building of the gay movement, or feminism, where actors moved beyond resistance to seek transformation o f the fabrics o f social structure. 223 Sequencing Orthodox Clustering A A- Diagnosis/Myself the sequencing of clustering for dissident individuals Sequencing Dissident Clustering A A- Diagnosis/Doenca B- Dissidence/Saude 280 the types of identities which are forged from an HTV diagnosis constitute 'legitimising' and 'resistance' projects. A 'legitimising' identity is 'introduced by the dominant institutions of society to extend and rationalise their domination vis \u00e0 vis social actors' (Castells, 1997:47). The achieved identity of the orthodox individual can be seen as a 'legitimising' cognitive construct achieved through the dialectic between the infected person and the surrounding social structure (Castells, 1997).^^^ The genesis o f such identity takes place at the moment o f diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is given it is immediately juxtaposed to previously acquired notions o f a selfhood spoiled by deviant sexuality: I wonder in a way in a kind o f a group consciousness thing o f being gay if a lot of us do not wish this upon ourselves because we as individuals and me as an individual was always told by society that I was sick and that I was diseased and that what HIV gave me gave people and now I have a physical manifestation of my sickness and I am diseased and I think that on a level me as an individual and my upbringing and my personal problems with esteem and self-worth and within the gay community I live in it has somehow promoted HIV because it gives us the stigma that we so long have been labelled with and maybe in some way desired but it is strange initially with my diagnosis I was so devastated a lot o f changes in the last two years and I have a very different image o f myself now and so my 225 Network society is the term Castells (1997) applies to characterise what Giddens (1991) calls late- modemity, and what Baumman (1997) refers to as post-modern society. ^^^The social structure refers to political institutions, the AIDS service industry, the welfare system, religious institutions, biomedicine, and alternative medical models. The discursive fields that surround HlV/AIDS are produced by such institutions as well as by the AIDS movement, religion, academic 281 image about being gay now and being positive is that I am have a disease but that although I have no idea how I became infected I feel that if I was not infected now and I was the person I am today I think I would less likely put myself in any situation which could potentially be o f risk because I do not need to see myself as sick or diseased or inferior or I do not need to and in a way now being gay and being negative you are not part o f the ghetto almost it is starting to be like you are kind outside o f the ghetto you know what I mean a lot o f people who the weirdest way is another way o f identifying ourselves and isolating ourselves you know what I mean so many times I heard in clinics when someone comes in who is not physically attractive or desirable people say I do not think that person is positive how could they be who would sleep with them? (#3) I mean when I tested positive I all the feelings o f low self esteem and self hatred they all came back and I thought if I was not gay I would not be positive that I would not have had the diagnosis but in many in some ways being diagnosed was I mean I was devastated (#5) I think there was always this punishment thing when it was like you know God will not love me because I am gay and I used to pray as a child when I was a teenager even I used to pray to be straight I used to pray on my hands and knees that when I woke up in the morning I would never have these feelings again and I hated m yself because o f my sexuality and that was what religion was for me it was research, the media, networks o f'positive' friendships, the dissident movement, and by networks of so- called long-term survivors. 282 sort of punishment and fear of being burned in hell you know I think when I was diagnosed there was a lot o f self-blame and I blamed m yself for being gay and I thought if I was not gay I would not be HIV then that turned into some really horrible thoughts about myself and the sexual abuse that happened when I was very young and then got caught up with those very old feelings that I am only gay because o f the sexual abuse and if I had not been abused therefore I would not be gay therefore I would not be positive and it was all unhealthy and I think I am dissociated now I it is like I forgive myself for having become infected in whichever way I did I looked after myself the best way I could it has happened I will live with (#4) The previously tainted gay self now has to cope with the reality of the added burden of HIV infection. His previous association with 'gay' as identity, and as such the m\u00e9dicalisation of the problem of AIDS that the institutions o f gay culture reproduce from mainstream society, occasions the individual to look for help within and through the gay- associated institutions of the AIDS service industry such as HIV clinics and support centres. These institutions difiuse and articulate standard biomedical recommendations for HTV infection that currently are as follows: With regard to specific recommendations, treatment should be offered to aU patients with the acute HIV syndrome, to those within 6 months of HTV seroconversion, and all patients with symptoms ascribed to HlV-infection.^^^ 227 Current British HIV Association (BHTVA) guidelines recommend that anyone with a CD4 count between 350 and 500 cells, and with a viral load above 30,000 copies, should consider HAART treatment or be monitored at least once every three months. Anyone with a CD4 count less than 350 cells with any 283 The acceptance o f the 'diagnostic invitation' (Kenen, 1996) marks the consolidation of the 'legitimising' identity, and inscribes the body o f the infected individual with the official label o f PWA, i.e. Person (living) with AIDS (PWA).^^* The implications o f the biomedical inscription produce significant shifts in the subjectivity o f these individuals inasmuch as the laboratory measurements that define HIV disease (the 'counts') come to constitute the principal metonymic signifiers around which the PWA understands his health. Dominant discursive practices often subjugate any resistance the individual might offer to the biomedical control o f his body. In addition, these 'counts', where institutions and the interior of positive bodies intersect, exert a fundamental role in the cognitive processes o f the PWA by institutionally legitimising the individual into the sick role:^29 I have chosen to take medication initially probably out o f fear because I had I bought this fast progressor diagnosis so I started medication on that when I started I had 350 CD4s and my viral load was about 140,000 so yeah I could see that clinically I was OK but then I had gone from 2 months before from 12,000 viral load and CD4 o f 490 so it could have been just a bUp it could have been I was a bit run down a bit anxious whatever and maybe I should have waited you know but I was I made my decision out o f fear I did not want to die now I have a totally detectable viral load should be offered HAART therapy. {Crusaid' s Information Exchange fact sheet on HAART guidelines). The seeds of the legitimising PWA identity dates back to 1983 when the first autonomous 'People Living With AIDS' movement was established in the United States to resist the then prevalent label 'AIDS Victim'. The movement was initially a self-help type of organisation that quickly grew into a coalition of local groups (Patton, 1990). 229 A 'deviant' sick role (where the patient never recovers) since antiretroviral medication often fails to achieve its desired goals (Turner, 1995). 284 different view because I think if 1 am starting on no viral load and CD4 count of 600 and my medication stops working I still have plenty o f years to be asymptomatic unless the viral load rebounds which I know it often does if you stop the medication so I do not know (#2) I have been doing them now for 3 years there was a time they reminded me I had HTV but now they have just become part o f my life they are quite dominating in terms o f they are something that you just have to do and it is something that you can not forget to do and there have been occasions it is not so much that I did not want to do it I am just bored of doing it now it becomes like God do I really have to do that? I do my combination twice a day I have had to do them three times a day in the past... when I start I have always sort o f planned when I start a new combination initially it was when I started the first lot I set m yself six months you can do this on the dot you will not forget now when I start a new combination for the first three months I do it religiously so it then becomes habit but you know it is sort o f if I have gone to work and I have not taken my pills with me and I go out for a drink after work I have to come back home it is that sort o f thing (# 4) I knew that test was going to be positive because you do not get PCP unless you have HTV I went back to talk to the doctor I was thinking how long have I got she said do not worry there is combination therapy and people are living full lives it is not a question as it would have been 18 months ago you will be OK so I seemed to like her she asked me if I had any issues around taking drugs \"this is our gold 285 standard therapy DDI DDR AZT do you want to go on it?' some people have a big thing about making their mind up about that I had a CD4 count o f about 20 and a viral load o f 164,0001 was not going to dwell on whether they were too toxic for my body or my immune system.... I am very actively involved with my treatment with my combination and the choices that I have I take very much an active role I read a lot about the new developments NAM (National AIDS manual) is on my bedside table in the drawer I mean because I do not want to frighten people off but I have always I take responsibility for my actions and my conduct in life and I think one o f the reasons I survived the last few months is because I was determined to get well not to let the virus storm through my immune system so I am taking a very powerful triple combination and I am very compliant besides I believe in the psychological dimension o f health and I have taken a very active role in that too mainly through my hydrotherapy which has enabled me to reach a level of relaxation I had not known before and in this way I help my body can cope with the toxicity o f the drugs as well (# 1) The health o f the positive body thus becomes the responsibility o f the PWA who procures to actively restructure his immune system through compliantly adhering to HAART regimes. As such, regularised control and reflexive monitoring produce a structuration of the positive body within a dynamic that mediates the relationship between a reconstituted 'positive' agency and the social structure. The aim of the PWA is to cast the interiority of the body in accordance with biomedical parameters o f good health. Hence the Cartesian framework o f a medical strategy that subjugates the lived body to technologically 286 produced representations of its health comes to view. The harsh consequences of HIV infection and treatment are understood as a contingent reality that might have been avoided had the individual not put himself at risk. As such, in order to 'mend the protective cocoon' the positive self has to engage in a process o f (re)interpretation that at best seeks personal absolution at worst a justification for the previously HIV-negative but positively-tainted gay self in the acquisition of infection: Because o f the way I felt about myself I met the guy shortly after moving to London and you know was also incredibly fucked up in those days very lost did not have any sort o f self worth blah-blah-blah and was seeking out abusive relationships very much so I sought out this perfect abusive relationship and gave this man lots of power turned I take full responsibility o f my ability to turn this man into an abusive man and he was an IV drug user he was perfect he was a dealer we used to drive around in stolen cars and things like that he was just perfect for me to and at one point I ended up sort o f I got into injecting for a while and you know I just something clicked then it was like I was trying to destroy m yself and I think that was the time I did put myself at risk for I was very young and you know years o f therapy and later I can understand that but at the time I was very wrapped up in seeking out abusive relationships and creating a self - destructive environment for myself so that scared me after that I really started to sort o f work on myself and try and respect myself more and I think that has been a continuous process o f 10 or 12 years but I think starting to respect m yself and part o f that was not to put myself at risk for HIV (#2) 287 I went and got tested and it came back positive so then 1 told him and he got his results and it was positive as well so I am fairly clear that is where it came ftom I was hugely angry with him but since then I have come to accept 50% of the responsibility I do not feel angry anymore I also think if it had not been him it probably would have been somebody else I do not think I would have not been able to maintain safe sex indefinitely I mean probably just knowing the places that I like going to and sort o f the hfestyle that I lead I probably would have ended up having sex with somebody who had HIV at some point (#4) In the process o f reinterpretation engaged in by the PWA the positive agency, unlike the one previous to HIV infection, should not allow for the stigma o f HFV (or gay) to continue causing damage. As such, the PWA almost always engages in health-producing behaviour with the objective o f helping the positive body not to psychosomatically manifest the psychological stresses involved in carrying the stigma o f HIV. Another goal is to countereffect side effects involved in HAART therapy. As a result, many PWAs employ complementary and alternative therapies to 'relax' and 'support' their threatened bodies. The appropriation o f the AIDS crisis has pushed aside the implementation o f purely CAM strategies for dealing with HTV infection. However, one of my respondents had been dealing with his long-term diagnosis exclusively on a CAM basis. His 'alternative' belief system seemed to have a significant impact on maintmning the plausibility o f a therapeutic strategy (mostly) discredited by combination therapy, and illustrates a moment o f 'resistance' in the constitution o f the legitimising identity. 288 As soon as I was diagnosed I started I spoke to this naturopath I knew in Australia from when I was diagnosed with EBV she said start with echinacea and mushrooms she knew all this she was brilliant and when I came over to England I did many I started looking at herbs and now I am at a point I diagnose m yself if something comes up I know what to follow if I have diarrhoea I know what to take I have just had shingles so you leam you leam. ..a lot o f my belief system is about the earth and the environment my belief in a god is more like an energy that helps the world grow I believe in energies as such in acupuncture I guess yet again we go back to my childhood 1 was very sick as I child 1 had asthma I had bad I remember talking to therapists about my childhood ailments as a young child you know I was pumped with drugs to the point that 1 can not remember I think that was in my unconscious when I was growing up I still did western medicine but I guess really it was my mother's influence I have always been kind o f a greeny as well an environmentalist I recycle a lot of stuff and I am a vegetarian I am pleased 1 am pleased I live that kind o f lifestyle I am proud o f it for a while I just did all kinds o f treatments I did not know exactly what I was doing I was experimenting I think or maybe I was just afraid (#5) Despite the alleged 'gentleness' o f CAM, the enactment o f his 'alternative' protocol is not only very structured but also very constraining, in fact it would appear more constraining than HAART's r e q u i r e m e n t s , 2 3 0 xhe surveillance o f the positive body is Depending on the particular 'combination' of antiretroviral drugs the timing and frequency of taking the pills has to be strictly respected. Some (hugs interact with certain kinds of foods so they can only be taken after a certain number of hours some foods have been consumed. 289 analogised in this individual's CAM strategy, and the biomedical conceptualisation that HTV is a powerftil virus that needs to be suppressed is reproduced He continued: What I do basically now once a week I do acupuncture and occasionally I will do Chinese herbs because I just started on this trial Todoxin it is called so I am cutting back on well I am not doing Chinese herbs because the Todoxin is too much it is 12 times a day every 2 hours I do supplements and if I get sick I look at what is happening and 1 use a lot o f herbs western herbs 1 try to think o f myself as being well but at the back o f my mind there is always the issue that I have HIV I say if I did not have this bloody virus I would be one o f the healthiest people I know I go to the gym three times a week well I try I am vegetarian I do supplements I recently cut out wheat so and I try to look after myself the best I can and when I need emotional support I will turn to one o f my therapists I have considered using the drugs o f course especially now with combination therapy but I will try the alternative first if it works it is much better it is a more comprehensive gentler approach without all the side effects and the toxicity of the combination drugs.. .there is three o f us really we run seminars lectures about nutrition colonic irrigation NLP spiritual healing they have all come and given lectures about HIV we used to be at the Information Exchange now we have a room well a space at the IDT so we can use that once a month but unfortunately the turn up is so poor we had a shiatsu seminar and only 2 people showed up especially now that combination th e r^ y is here (#5) 290 The ' 'circuit of culture' has produced a multitude o f social metaphors surrounding HIV/AIDS (Woodward, 1997), which by impinging upon the AIDS body the '^ c a ly p tic metaphor', have magnified the stigmatising burden o f HIV diagnosis (Palmer, 1997). As such, the social stigma that accompanies the illness, and the psychosocial consequences o f the diagnosis, may be as debilitating as any physical manifestation o f immunodeficiency syndrome. The stigma attached to HIV is such that disclosure of HIV status is an equally problematic issue whether one is disclosing it in the context o f a gay friendship, to a member o f the family, or to a sexual partner: O f course I did not take my shirt off while I was there and I was very concerned I mean I already looked haggard now I did not want any physical evidence o f the virus you know the stigma the rejection could be so fiightening even among fiiends as I have experienced (#1) My aim in a very broad sense is to do something to help gay men and also I think that the whole thing about positive people is that they are so in the closet and I mean I explained to a fiiend about HIV and the issue came up and I mentioned I am positive and he got really annoyed with me and he was like how dare you tell me I am sick of people telling me they are positive he was weird and I said to him do you not realise when we were young we were in the closet because we were too scared to come out and HTV has put people back in the closet again but it is not a gay closet anymore it is an HTV closet you know it is almost ok to be gay but it is not at all ok to be positive and that is sad it just adds another stigma to being gay it just adds another way for people to hurt each other and to be hurt (#3) 291 1 was in Florence Italy and this guy cruised me and he was like cruising me all night going 6om bar to bar I ended up having sex with him we went back to the hotel my hotel we had sex and then he came in my mouth and he was like my God you could get positive and I was like I am positive and he freaked out he was like how dare you have sex with me you could have infected me and I was just like fuck you at no stage I have put you under any risk fuck you get out of my hotel I am not dealing with your bullshit and you trying to stigmatise me and make me into some kind o f I do not know some social pariah I will not allow it... these experiences can be very stressfid (#5) My mother I am seeing her in a month she lives in Switzerland she is in France right now and she phoned me and told me that she bumped into a friend o f hers there who told her I was positive that I was dying and she was on the phone and she was crying she was saying tell me you have not got AIDS and I just used the language to get away with saying to her honestly I do not have AIDS but everyone else in my life I am out to about my status but my mother it is this whole thing I have a problem with her manipulating and controlling my life so the reason she does not know is because o f my relationship with her as a child and not my relationship with her as gay positive man but I will tell her when I see her I will explmn that yes I am positive but that is it is not a death sentence that the drugs are very promising she does not know all that (#3) 292 Subject-position and representation are inseparable moments in the process o f identity construction. As such, these 'positive' subjectivities are significantly blemished by notions of culpability, shame, and isolation. Illness narratives are often not descriptions o f the past but o f systematic ongoing efforts to reconstruct a self that includes both the experience of illness and ways to counteract it (Frank, 1997). The constant references to self-absolution that appear in the PWA narrative suggest that the self is actively engaged in a recontextualisation o f infection without which his continued existence as a social being may be significantly problematised: It has got something to do with shame you know the idea o f getting sick and dying o f AIDS in firont o f my family and the people I had known all my life that was not a good picture you know Wiat I mean? (#5) I spent a lot o f time at the beginning first o f all punishing myself for allowing myself to get into those situations and then be angry at them and then just thinking why am I doing this I have to forgive m yself I have to forgive whoever infected me what is the point of spending the rest of my life bitter and twisted you know it has happened how it got there it was bad luck you know I have to get on with it in someway (#1) I had a lot you know very affected by HFV over the years and just overwhelmed by it at that point I remember I started using I had taken an anti-depressive because I was just so overwhelmed and I do not really it is not something that I 293 like using it I think it changes you someway it was Prozac I started with and you know I was living in this false world for a while part o f me was hugely grieving from these things and the other part was yes everything is lovely and 1 was partying like mad and I do not blame myself in anyway but I still feel that somewhere it was all this depression and actually lack o f hope and you know feeling very suicidal at times and so when I did get infected even though you know I can forgive m yself because I did everything I possibly could to protect m yself (#2) Sometimes it amazes me I am going through a big change and the people who are around me are very different well they are not very different I do not have a lot o f people around me now I have lost a lot of friends and I am quite surprised that people I have known a long time that I am diagnosed that I am living with this disease they do not seem to understand I feel a huge gzq) between us this sort o f isolation imposed isolation but I suppose I only have m yself to blame (#4) The PWA experiences the materiality of his physical body through constructs, associations, and images that relate it to the technologically produced vision o f an interiority rendered problematic by medical discourse. As such, through a reflexive engagement with the discourses o f medicine the PWA acts iq)on his body to bring it close to technologically produced standards of normalcy. It could be argued that in this capacity, especially when biological imbalances are the direct result o f the powerful allopathic palliative being used to prevent a disease that might not yet have manifested, the PWA represents a 'disembodied consciousness' (Turner, 1996). However, the 294 disembodied consciousness is not always successM in subjugating its materiality onto the symbolic level o f meaning: The reason I changed was the second set of drugs 1 went on to contained retinavir and it started to cause me gastric problems it made me produce too much stomach acid which burned the lining o f my stomach and I was sick as a dog really and St Mary's was going to take 8 weeks to have an endoscopy and Barthes could do it in a week so I went there.... The earlier part of this year was very difficult because what happened when I was on the combo that contains sequinavir retonavir it was woiking from the point o f view o f keeping my virus undetectable and my CD4 high but starting sort o f January I lost 2 stone of weight subcutaneous fat was just falling off o f me not muscle wastage but a sort o f strange case o f lipodystrophy it did not get put anywhere because I lost that weight the toxicity o f the drugs suddenly kicked in so I started throwing once a day which did not help put the weight back on (#4) I know the drugs are quite toxic and they can be very detrimental to some o f your organs my liver function is quite bad at the moment and I have diarrhoea and you know I have a little bit o f lipodistrophy on my legs but the virus the drugs are helping to slow down the replication o f the virus my viral load is about 40,000 from 75,000 and my CD4s are better so they are working (#3) Recreational drugs are widely used in urban gay communities across the western world (Lewis and Ross, 1995), as they are among subcultures in crisis (Hanna, 1979). The five 295 orthodox individuals o f my subset were current drug users.^^ As such, drugs are employed in the ritualistic articulation o f sex and drugs as a mechanism to cope with the tripartite stigma o f being gay, being infected, and possibly terminally ill: I never stopped having sex you know like some people do after their diagnosis if when 1 go to a clinic for a VD check up and they say how many people have you had sex in the last 6 months and it has always been difficult for me to work out because there will be weekends when I will go up to the heath it will be a huge number you know six in a night and I do that through a weekend when I will go to Trade 1 love having sex on drugs it is absolutely the best and I will do loads o f drugs and have lots o f sex and then I will not have any for a couple o f months so it is very erratic... love having sex on drugs it is a big release (#4) The speed and the coke and the acid it did my head in and I became quite mental I became quite paranoid I became psychotic I was incredibly paranoid you know I lost touch with reality for a while and I had to go back to Wales for 3 months to sort o f come down and when I came back uh created a few mistakes again I had a great time on drugs when I was in Wales but now sex and drugs are completely different when I was you know 21 it was an escape then I was doing loads of acid and things like that (#2) Except for #5 who used cannabis only (but had been a user of harder drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy) all other individuals were current occasional users of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy. 296 I have had a Trade spiritual experience spiritual emotional experiences at Trade but I think it is because o f the drugs not because o f Trade because I have had those experiences elsewhere that is my experience drugs are like a spiritual psychological emotional to o l... it was a very spiritual experience you know when I came out o f it I knew I was not Jesus but thinking well there is something in here about spirituality but also about the insights you gain about your own life if you know vdiat I mean (#4) Spirituality is another theme through which life with HFV is contextualised in an attempt to reconstruct a mended self. However, such spirituality is embedded within the level of the psyche and o f the physical healing o f the body, not as a disembodied Dionysian entity floating above the mind/body complex. As such, the legitimising identity o f the PWA may think o f itself as spiritual but in reality it is very much firmly grounded on the positivistic, dualistic paradigm that has framed and institutionalised the construction of knowledge and power relations o f the modem era. I did psychotherapy that started on the spiritual aspect because I think psychotherapy has a lot to do with the spiritual and that started in must be six years now a very close of friend died and \u00dciat was kind o f the beginning ok looking at my life really (#2) 297 Looking into the abyss I think a genuine sense o f spirituality is beginning to grow in me since my diagnosis.. .my mind is being set free o f ail the shit I used to carry around (#3) Like healing and spirituality I guess I always had a link to nature I have always been kind o f an environmentalist so I think it had to come sooner or later anyway but HIV has brought more about spirituality and healing and self-worth and all those kinds o f issues into my life (#5) 298 7.5,2.- Positively Dissident: a resistance identity Narratives about HIV/AIDS represent instances where the PWA attempts to locate his own 'authentic' voice (Frank, 1996). When successful such endeavours are heard by the speaker as authentic reconstructions at the level o f self, body and 'other' (HIV). As such, in a broadly Foucauldian perspective, where the lived body is seen as a product of discourse, the discourse o f medicine is opposed by the discourse o f the patient. This voice validates the experiences o f the patient who consents to the 'colonisation' o f the body by the disempowering discourses of medicine (Radley, 1997). Hence, a degree of appropriation o f the sense o f loss o f the autonomy o f the body is enabled by the possibility to speak for oneself and not be spoken through (Frank, 1996).Illness narratives are deemed to be relevant in the reconstruction o f the (lived) body not only because o f what they say, but also because as 'exemplar' displays they provide templates for the alternative ways o f being that can be assembled in the face o f serious illness (Frank, 1996). As such, the discourse of the PWA demonstrates that life with HIV is a 'liminal' process that constantly altercates 'between and betwixt' disease and health (Turner, 1967). However, the role o f the 'exemplary' narrative depends on whether the told story constitutes a successful account o f how the patient deals with the physical reality o f the virus or whether all that is offered is a 'chaotic' narrative (Frank, 1995). The successful narrative o f the PWA may disrupt the dominant discourse o f medicine and as such momentarily shift the balance o f power relations. Yet, discourse is not sufficient in itself to eiq)lain the corporeality o f the physical body neither in health nor in sickness. In the quote below a PWA describes his 'style o f coping' as an embodied action (represented in speech) enacted in order to deal with the limitations imposed iq)on the 'colonised' body 299 (Frank, 1995). As such, the significance o f such action as a resisting practice that aims at fleeing agency from the constrains o f a demanding 'regime' o f therapeutic drugs lies in its embodied nature, which permits material effects that go beyond symbolic reinterpretations o f the experience o f the disease and focus on what the body can do. If I have been good for the week before I do not mind missing one dose a week it is probably not a good idea but I just fiiink well I am human if I missed one during the previous week then there is no way I will miss another I can remember when I was on the ritinavir/siquinavir combo I had to take it at eight in the morning but was supposed to take it with food and I was at Trade and there was no way that I would put food down my throat so I did not take the pills also I try and move things so that if I am going to Trade at the weekend now it is what twice a day so if I was to go to Trade now I would move it a couple o f days before hand so that rather than talking it at what 8 in the morning and 8 at night I would take it at midnight and midday so that Trade could happen without too many problems but it is not a good idea because the drugs need to follow their own rhythm but to be compliant all the time it is impossible if I am to keep on living a relatively normal life (#4) Identity construction is fundamentally related to the signifying practices and symbolic systems that characterise the cultural environment, which shape and contain, as much as they allow, the internalisation o f meanings that ultimately produces varying subject- positions. The body o f the PWA does not constitute a totally 'passive' entity completely 300 'colonised' by dominant discourses, even if its legitimising nature means that the PWA derives meaning from institutionalised sources. On the other hand, the 'resistance' identity embodied by dissidents is a cognitive construct achieved by a more dynamic agency unwilling to relinquish the individual freedom and self-determination perceived to be enabled by its independence from the colonisation of medical discourse. Because the interiority o f subjects is historically contingent, and consequently can not be given any analytical priority, does not mean that subjects never exercise any power. Hence, dissidents occupy 'positions/conditions devalued and/or stigmatised by the logic o f domination (and are) thus building trenches of resistance and survival on the basis o f principles different from, or opposed to, those permeating the institutions of society' (Castells, 1997:56). The material effects o f the ontological position occupied by dissidents constitute them into very distinct species of (positive) homosexuals indeed. Still, at the moment o f infection all my respondents subscribed to mainstream notions surrounding HIV. As such, the 'fateful moment' caused emotional responses similar to those o f the PWA. However, unlike the PWA for whom a diagnosis is immediately collapsed to previous notions o f a tainted selfhood, for the dissident-to-be individual the diagnosis set him into a process o f questioning biomedical practice. It could be hypothesised that the gay component o f identity was less significant for dissidents than it appears to be for the PWA so they did not immediately turn to the institutions o f gay subculture. Another possibility is that such individuals possessed a countercultural streak before the diagnosis. 301 What made me sick was the HIV fear believing initially in the HIV causes AIDS model my ill health whatever ill health I have had has been caused by the stress of the HIV model (#7) Surprisingly I could sleep the night o f the diagnosis I actually had this incredible sleep I probably was exhausted from emotions or something like that and then fortunately for the next few months I kept going through this business o f having you know these sleeps I did not have nightmares or anything like this I would wake up in the morning but then the recollection o f the diagnosis hit me and I would have this sort of depression not monstrous I was still going to work I mean the day o f the HIV I went back down into work I pushed m yself and sort o f worked like hell but I guess looking back I was pretty depressed for almost a year (#8) The same individual later talks about his attitude towards biomedical solutions to the problem o f AIDS in relation to his previous self: I guess I have always been a free thinker and I have done things on my own my whole life and you know I was saying how there is a neurotic inside o f me and how I always enjoyed preferred being on my own but being an AIDS dissident is very difficult you have to just basically do it on your own there are no doctors to support you I mean no institutions like the NHS to help you with treatments and it is basically a lonely road and I do not know it would be nice to be able to you know have a fiiend or someone to support you on the way I mean Continuum is 302 the only support I have I was actually talking to (deleted) about that about he also I mean he is very involved in all this and the pressures o f being a dissident there are so many levels of pressure you know from not being able to talk to your friends or even your doctor and that and being constantly bombarded with all the HIV information like have you seen these new advertisements on the tube it is ridiculous that in itself creates a huge psychological burden (#8) Dissident positions contradict the logic of biomedicine that measures health in terms of technological representations o f the body's inner reality by privileging the sensory experience o f the lived body. As such, dissidents challenge the Cartesian dualism of biomedicine where the body is subordinated to the mind. I was on the three combination medication for about 6 months after I left the hospital after I got out o f hospital I it was difficult for me because I did not know whether after a while I decided to stop the medication I thought sod this I must have been living with this virus for at least 11 years and I have always been the perfect picture o f health so why do I have to start polluting my body and my mind with these drugs and their toxicity so I stopped them I refused to become a victim of the rigamorous o f having to take the pills if I had looked upon this as a death sentence and I have seen too many go down with that a few months after their positive test results very often because they have taken it as a death sentence the whole world collapses for them their psyche started to dysfunction I know some who did not know what to do anymore I just kept on living as if nothing had 303 happened just kept on with leading a normal life I really believe that that is the only way to secure a normal life span if you do have this virus the mind body spirit connection is very important when I was on the combo I got so many side effects especially this horrible neuropathy on my feet and I am convinced it was due to the A ZTI and the siquinavir made me vomit a lot you know this book by Hilda Clark she was working for the government and she was sick o f being told by the government what to say all the time apparently you can not get this book anymore I was just told but my best friends the couple I mentioned just got this through a pharmacy she also says that the whole HIV=AIDS is a total lie that it has not been proven at all she is very much along the same lines o f Continuum (#9) It was a few months afrer I decided to stop the combination and it was incredible in April I had a blood test and I went to see him after the test and he asked me what is it with you I have never seen you like this and he said I feel terrific I have never felt so good before and do not tell me shit fix>m your computer I know that the results must have improved drastically the viral load was down to 430 which was below the level o f undetectability now is 250 and the CD4 count was 167 still not out of PCP danger and then I told my doctor that I had stopped with the combination and that is why my counts were so much better I mean o f course I am sure that because my fimne of mind had improved so much because I was not polluting myself with all that toxic my firame of mind had much to do with it but I actually think that stopping the drugs has it has initiated an upward trend in all my counts (#10) 304 Dissidents are concerned with what the body 'can do' whereas the PWA is concerned with what the body 'means'. As such, dissidents enable the body to operate beyond the colonisation o f representational practices and to move beyond institutionalised ascriptions o f the 'normal'. Mediceil discourse has established the notion o f an inherent normality o f the human body. Once the capacity to see beyond and through the epidermis became an established professional practice, the 'statistical man' took over the 'biologically unique man' (Illich, 1976). This new system o f knowledge converged onto bipolar definitions o f what constituted the normal and the pathological body. As a result, normative configurations o f power/knowledge privileged biophysical proximity to observed ranges o f parameters rather than the lived experienced o f functioning bodies, which might nevertheless deviate firom the established norm. The ever-increasing capacity o f medical technology to probe the depths of the body is both an effect and a result o f such discursive practices. The extent and the nature o f the deviance shapes the degree to which a 'phantom normalcy' may be achieved by the abnormal individual, and the 'phantom acceptance' the abnormal being may be granted by 'normal' society (Goffinan, 1968). In resisting the ascription o f a PWA identity the dissident individuals faces a series of challenges. Such resistance is articulated through marginalised discourses and stigmatised by the institutionalised HIV/AIDS model. The distinct alternative discourses that surround the biological, social, and moral dimensions o f HIV/AIDS may be differently appropriated by each particular individual; yet, the psychosocial pressures involved in maintaining the plausibility o f such a belief system is equally shared. 305 1 do like to have a hot bath but these are relaxation techniques 1 do think that relaxation techniques are very important I would just make the point though that within these issues I work in a way that is kind of described by other people as dissident I suppose and I think that dissidence is a chronic dis-ease in itself I think that there are particular stresses involved in trying to maintain an energy contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy that you can not go into a tube station and see one o f those big ads for HIV testing without realising that you are alienated it is a constant experience o f alienation as opposed to the experience o f the HIV community and I think that are particular risks and stresses with that that would not matter if you are diagnosed or not (#6) I was trying to get DLAI guess I caused a lot of trouble because I was a dissident I remember saying I used to go to Body Positive in Earl's Court and back then all I was saying was that not everybody with HIV gets AIDS and people were saying you are wrong everybody with HIV gets AIDS how dare you say that but nowadays it is not controversial to say that because everybody knows I hope everybody knows now that not everybody with HIV gets AIDS it is not controversial anymore but back then it was because it was challenging people's beliefs I sort o f drifted out o f AIDS because it is like I spent 3 or 4 years I mean I got the editor o f Positive Nation the editor the editor o f Pink Paper some people fix)m the medical research council so I got people who believed in HIV who believed in combination therapy to come and have dinner and I paid for it is quite 306 an expensive restaurant in the West End it is not that expensive but it was because I was paying for it all but I wanted to get them around the table to talk you know friendly but scientifically with each other to discuss I did that it was interesting because the guy who was editor o f Positive Nation he was a nice guy alright he believed HIV existed just got them to sit down they were not bad people because some o f the dissidents thought that the people working at Positive Nation were evil nasty people and they were not this guy was gay he was on combination therapy himself so he would not be taking something he thought was going to kill him so I reckoned we should respect what this guy believes but we should still communicate perhaps we can find some middle ground and respect for the different view points so I was very interested in doing that I was very interested in getting debate going like I wanted the gay press to debate the cause o f AIDS to look at all the different hypothesis that were and people to understand that there is some controversy about what are the causes o f AIDS (#7) Resistance identities are mainly constituted via the 'reverse' discursive practices o f the dissident critique, and as such demand to be acknowledged by employing the same (scientific) categories that are used to disqualify it (Foucault, 1981). However, committing to a belief system that is discredited by the institutional apparatus of mainstream society can constitute an unstable process: I see this doctor at Ealing hospital because he is he is known as being more tolerant and not pushing the drugs on you so I see him regularly and he does all 307 the tests and the CD4 counts and viral load and all that is on the file but I do not want to know because you go up and down sweating and worrying but since I have been reading Continuum and realising the waywardness o f these things anyway how can you match them up. . .I went along to Dr (deleted) in January that was about nine months after the diagnosis in 1992 and I was struck quite nicely with him he was not so busy those days I suppose so we had a nice long chat and he asked me you do not mind if we take some blood tests and I said no as long as I do not get the CD4 results because I just did not want to obsess I do not give a fuck I am asymptomatic at the moment but I can not stand the idea that he is looking out for ways and means for actually sort o f suggesting to me that it might be a good time to start on combination therapy .. .you know I am a Continuum reader and in many ways I see myself as a dissident because I refuse to take combination therapy and I pretty much do my own thing in terms o f health and nutrition and I tell him (the doctor) that he should be reading it and he is aware that he gets mentioned in it occasionally this kind o f thing but you know his empire is growing and I get the feeling that if I wanted sort o f some quick treatment or something if I all of a sudden sort o f decided I want an appointment like I can do now you know being a patient o f (deleted).... the thing is that sometimes I question my own sanity I everybody believes in HIV that HIV causes AIDS and to hold on to dissident views and to stay strong in my conviction is not so easy and what I was saying that the isolation is enormous and that there is no way to isolate me from all the AIDS facts and statistics and blood counts and all 308 these things and all I am doing is taking infusions and some supplements so I get paranoid sometimes (#8) 1 mean I ask m yself should I should I be worried about counts and all those measurements I mean when they are so detrimental to my state o f mind and if they make no such difference but I still have not been able to break the habit I it is like a security blanket my spirit is not that strong yet but that is my goal (#9) Other dissidents deal with the uncertainty of their belief system by constructing narratives with high levels o f incorporation o f the 'reverse' discursive practices that constitute the basis o f the dissident critique. They may resist the colonisation o f science, but embedded within a scientific society that repudiates their cosmology, dissidents maintain their fragile belief system through the use o f the same scientific discourse they attempt to escape: I do not believe that the viral load is actually measuring HIV infectious particles I do not believe that but I believe the viral load is measuring a pathogenic state which is a non specific pathogenic state I am speaking with some doctors from St George's and they told me if you have TB TB is interesting because 50 percent o f all the AIDS cases in the worid are actually TB cases if you have TB or PCP it makes your viral load go sky high but also bacterial infections viral infections there are loads o f things which affect your viral load that can make it go up so 309 when you treat the conditions they go back down so I think it is measuring a high pathogenic state it could be high cellular turn over but I do not believe it is measuring HIV so I had a very high viral load which is strange because my CD4 count actually doubled with a high viral load which you would not expect and then some people said your CD4 just doubled that is just more CD4 cells for the virus to eat so before the viral load test came up it was a good thing if your CD4 came up but there is no proof that HIV kills CD4 cells so but the hypothesis is that you have a high viral load and that the virus is running around eating the T-cells and through an indirect invisible mechanism that is yet to be identified the CDC states that HIV kills CD4 counts through a yet to be identified invisible mechanism I mean the Pasteur institute has shown that bystander cells not infected cells are the cells that are actually dying and the infected cells are not there has also been some research which was published in science which actually measured you can calculate the age o f the cell by measuring the tylamus because each time the cell goes through mitosis each time the cell divides the tylamus become shorter so you can calculate the age o f the cell and these scientists calculated the age o f cells in AIDS patients and said this does not make any sense because all the cells were old cells and that really could not be the case I sort o f believe HIV does not kill T- cells there is no evidence for that (#7) For the dissident disclosing his ideological stance, not his status, constitutes the main social problem. The stigma o f resisting such a subjugated social location occasions 310 several problematic situations that are resolved by the representation o f mainstream society and its values as the 'other'. The risk involved is not so great as they want us to believe you know suppressing your sexuality that way it is very dangerous for the body and the soul are connected and sexuality is an expression of spirit and it should not be it is not about sexual acts dangerous acts it is about human connection and if someone is not on my level o f understanding then sod them (#9) The whole thing I just really strange I do not think about it anymore I just it is as if I had no HIV I do not even feel strange about not doing the combination it is like I am not on the same boat with all these HIV positive guys who are doing the drugs but to be honest I find it very difficult to explain to people what my beliefs are I mean the language o f Continuum is too complicated but to just say HIV does not exist or something like that people just look at you like yeah right (#10) Despite the significant social costs involved in the articulation o f a dissident identity, dissidence is interpreted by the individual the most important technology o f the 'dissident' self. The maintenance o f the boundaries between 'us' and the mainstream 'other' with its detrimental colonising surveillance practices is understood as constitutive o f mental and physical health. 311 I had a doctor firiend and he said you know you do not want to be part of an experiment I was feeling pretty grim you know because I just felt so powerless I mean the only option at that time was AZT and there was nothing else I just felt like if the only medication they were offering was like poison gas I had a friend well not really a ftiend but somebody I used to see every once in a while here in London he was a lovely guy and he was diagnosed a year before I was and he went straight into AZT and it was scary I mean the guy just completely deteriorated in one year and he was dead in two and I just you could see that it was the drugs he was taking because he was perfectly fine and then they started pumping him with AZT and that was when the doses were very high and he looked terrible I could there was a sense in my guts that it was the drugs so but the fact is that I am that I have been diagnosed with HTV but I have never been sick with an AIDS illness with an opportunistic infection so y^hy would I take those terrible combination drugs when I am perfectly healthy you know even before I was diagnosed I mean from the start of the epidemic or the health crisis as we should say really because there is no epidemic I just had it deep down inside o f me you know that whatever they are offering is the killer people wiio take the drugs are the people that are more likely to be dying I mean I was optimistically about the doctor who told me people are lasting 8 to 10 years this kind o f thing and I was supposed to say wow that is a real relief off my shoulder when they gave me the CD41 it was about 500 and I was scared really scared because I thought well I do not have much more time but now after becoming a Continuum reader and being you know knowing that these counts can go up and down if you 312 have the flu or been vaccinated now 1 just do not care I still do not want to know them because I would go crazy with worry but deep down I do not really care anymore I feel healthy my body is strong so why should I not think o f myself as healthy? (#8) I think one o f the ways to keep my health is to focus my mind on being well staying well living clean eating the right foods organic foods getting rid o f toxins and fighting on a mental and emotional level I mean it works for me I have not been sick or been to a doctor in over five years (#6) I think 1 got better because I wanted to because 1 found the will to live you know and I started to take more responsibility for myself considering drugs considering food considering supplementation considering you know getting enough sleep and so on I take care o f m yself and because before cancer or whatever I did not I was not conscious about my body what my body is and what it can do how it sort of heals itself if the conditions are right beyond the physical now I know there is another level I know it is all about how you treat yourself and also about your own being happy being happy in being happy you start projecting yourself into the future and if you start projecting yourself into the future there is a Wiole new I do not know approach to life you realise you will need your body for longer and in order to use your body for longer you have to do something you know you have to treat your body nicely so that it continues doing what it is meant to do for longer but I think that quitting combination was also key in my healing I was drugged up 313 I mean not recreational drugs but combination therapy TB medication as well as all the toxic stuff from the chemo still in my body and there I was thinking the combo was going to save me it is such bullshit and I was developing I had lipodistrophy and you know I had not even noticed but it was shocking later I realised I did have it or at least the beginning o f it and that is such a terrible thing you see all these guys now they are o combination therapy and they begin to have that terrible look it is like the AIDS look you can see it from a mile and I know this sounds so shallow but that was one o f the main to me that would have been one o f the worst things to walk around looking like a freak but thank God that I am so grateful to God or whatever that I quit because since then my CD4s have tripled and my viral load is down to nothing (#10) 7.5.3. Legitimising and Resisting: homing in on the fundamentals through clustering In the previous two sections I conducted a type o f step-by-step cumulative analysis o f the social processes that constitute the formation o f a new type o f subjectivity based on the clustering information I gathered through HAMLET. Yet, I have not yet explored in Wiat specific ways they are fundamentally different. The 'Intersection Table' o f section 7.4.2. was very useful in helping me understand the principal nodes (clusters) of differences between the dissident and the orthodox individuals. 314 The two subsets only perfectly coincide in one cluster (4/14), or 'Dissidence' and 'Saude'.^^ This cluster signifies the most relevant point at which the two coincide; yet this does not necessarily mean an agreeable coincidence. By looking at 'Table A: MDS Solution and Johnson Dendogram for Orthodox Subset' one can not locate the points dissidence and 'saude' because they constitute the most distant points in the matrix (see Tables 2 and 4). The interpretation o f these different clustering patterns seems to suggest that their distance in the context o f orthodox experience translates the rejection that the dissident cosmology by orthodox individuals: The first that that I time that I came across that was in Vancouver but I think it is bull you know science is a developing entity and new developments come along so \\^4iat is true today may not be true in a year's time but that is for everything but then when they say a fact is not a fact I am just like sorry but I go for this but if it offers you some sort o f mental health or offers you some sort of solace then that is fine and that can obviously have an effect on you as a person but it has no effect on your stress levels and your cd4s but to endorse things that end up limiting someone's life expectancy through ignorance or whatever I just do not have time for I think Continuum is dangerous because people can be easily influenced (#4) The distance o f the code 'saude', on the other hand, can only be explained by the poor health experienced by orthodox individuals. The same cluster (saude/dissidence), in the context o f dissident discourse, occupies the last clustering position in the sequencing o f Saude, the Portuguese word for 'health', was the name given to the code that contained words and word soises related to good health and well being. 315 clustering stages evidenced by the information provided by the Table Johnson (see footnote 231). This fact seems to suggest that dissident narratives o f health, as we have seen, interpret good health as a direct consequence o f the dissident location, and its positive implications in terms o f rejection of the biomedical solution for HIV. The second cluster subset where dissident and orthodox individuals overlap is within issues o f disclosure and stigma (3; 18). Again, the partial coincidence is a discordant one. As I have shown in the previous section, for the dissident the issue o f disclosure is problematic in terms o f the subjugated position o f their resistance identity whereas for the PWA it is the stigma o f HIV that constitutes the problem. The next instance o f partially coinciding clusters is represented by codes 5 and 9, or 'doenca' and medication.^^^ Some o f some o f the last 6 months being sick from drug reactions have really stressed me out not from antiretrovirals it was not side effects but from prophylactics mainly the septrin because I took every prophylactics I took I would come out you know after 10 days violent rashes that would stay with me for 2 weeks afterwards and so on and so on and then I would take another one and the same thing would happen and there was just I got so stressed about a fiiend of mine caught a bacterial infection on his arm and I kind o f could have caught it off him so then I had to take another kind of antibiotic which I was seemed to be so reactive to and I just did not want to take any more drugs to be sick for longer I was sick o f being sick but that has only been in the last 6 months I guess because 'Doenca', to remind the reader, is the Portuguese word for 'disease' and was used to name the code that contained alt the words and word senses that represented issues of disease. 316 I guess I had gained a lot o f knowledge about Wiat is available what can honestly be achieved and expected from drag therapy no but then sometimes when you are not feeling so good you can get depressed there is times when things happen when people say things that you you are not feeling so good so you get a vulnerability there so HTV per se does not the first time I got I suppose I felt that bad about it is in terms o f being sick and looking haggard if I keep on being reactive to all of these drugs then how long am 1 going to be sick for then what is going to happen if there is going to be no more drag choices and you know I had all this time in my hands because I was so sick and I got very anxious and depressed about the whole situation (#4) The quote above illustrates the often experienced reality o f iatrogenic disease in the context o f HAART and/or related biomedical guidelines (of prophylactic drags to prevent opportunistic infections). However, the PWA conceptualises health in terms o f the body's counts, not in terms o f the lived body. The definition concerns the meaning o f the body, not what it can do. The opposite relation is enacted by the dissident individual for whom the iatrogenic potential o f HAART is seen not only as causative o f disease, but as an inefficient and toxic compound that is going after the wrong culprit in the aetiology o f the diseases known as AIDS. As such, the coincidence o f the cluster 'doencaVmedication represents the diametrically opposite views o f the two subgroiqjs in terms o f health and illness paradigms. 317 7.6.-Bcneath Representations The main objective o f this research project was to understand the impact a 'fateful moment' can have on the fragile basis through which our ontological security is maintained in the world, the self. Initially I framed the research questions in terms o f the kinds of coping strategies infected individuals devised. A t that point in the process of conducting research my framework was grounded on the specific social processes and discourses which had been (mainly) articulated at the beginning o f the health crisis. For at least the first half o f the 1980s, when AIDS 'victims' were ostracised by most political and medical institutions, many turned to what was then widely known as 'alternative' medical systems. Until the m\u00e9dicalisation of the AIDS problem coalesced around the development o f antiretroviral drugs, the New Age and the holistic health movement played an important role in the coping strategies o f many AIDS 'victims'. The evolution o f 'alternative' medicine to the potentially integrative framework o f CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) is to a great extent attributed to the initial significance o f alternative medicine in the AIDS crisis (chapter six). Therefore, I was interested in finding out if religious or spiritual cosmologies had any relevance in the choice between allopathic treatment and 'complementary and alternative medicine' treatments. I also articulated the question o f the restructure o f the self in terms o f whether individuals agreed that HIV was a 'blessing in disguise'. The theme o f HIV as a catalyst for positive psychological and spiritual transformation had been widely articulated in the beginning of the AIDS crisis by so-called 'alternative' or spiritual healers who understood the development o f the syndrome as a symptom o f the irmer workings o f the 318 damaged gay self. These discourses attempted to shift power relations by repositioning the AIDS body not as an 'apocalyptic' metaphor (Palmer, 1997) but as an exemplary instrument whose healing could catalyse the much needed process of transformation on a global level. At last the Age o f Aquarius would rise. The discovery o f the 'dissident' category illustrates how the resisting discursive practices around AIDS have changed since the 1980s. The resistance project that 'alternative' conceptions o f healing had represented has been entirely subsumed by the repositioning o f a redefined CAM in a complementary role to biomedicine. By the late 1990s the most significant resistance project was articulated through the 'reverse discourse' practices of the dissident critique and the social movement it had spawned. In the sixty seven interviews I conducted only one revealed the association between therapeutic choice and a 'New Age', 'greeny' worldview (interview # 5 o f section 7.5.1.). In addition, in my sample HIV as a blessing in disguise' turned out to be a totally discredited notion; only two o f the sixty seven respondents agreed with the statement 'HIV is the best thing that has happened to me' (I quote here firom two NUDIST interviews): Yes definitely I am lucky to be HTV HIV made me open to life without HTV I would have wasted my life Wien I discovered I was HTV I discovered my mortality and I discovered how important was every relationship... I would have been a dug dealer I do not know some really grim life (# 17) 319 My life would have taken a completely different direction if I had not been HIV I have changed a lot and I am afraid I would have I would still be the prat that I was if I had not been if my life had not been so frmdamentally changed the day o f my test (#11) Narratives that proposed HTV as a blessing (Hay, 1984) reflected strategies o f coping rather than actual experience. The realities o f life post-HIV do not reflect an improved social existence; however the 'framing' o f the experience o f illness in a positive light is frequently employed in a cognitive effort to symbolically mend the 'protective cocoon'. The mending o f the shattered cocoon o f the AIDS body is not confined to the individual level; it is a desire articulated on the (sub)cultural level. The 'gay circuit' phenomenon described in chapter four emerged in the 1980s as a response to biomedical definitions o f the gay body as the sick body. The fact that the 'circuit' is mainly (but not exclusive) an American phenomenon might explain the low number o f individuals o f my sample who had ever attended these events (only four had ever attended and only one could have been described as a 'circuit queen'). As such, the effects o f the 'circuit' in resisting biomedical definitions o f the body played no role in the reconstruction o f the identities o f my sample. As we saw in chapter five. Queer Spiritual Discourse (QSD) constitutes another resistance project which attempts to dissociate the homosexual body from notions o f intrinsic deviance. The elitist nature o f QSD, a historical and theological body o f ideas, which have been produced by gay and lesbian scholars and intellectuals, may explain the feet that none o f my sixty-seven respondents were aware o f it. As such, QSD constitutes a resistance project with very little effect on the material lives o f its constituency. To sum 320 it up, the initial framework o f my research project would have yielded very little relevant information on the processes o f restructuring o f the positive self. The emergence o f a new unit o f analysis in the midst of my field work changed the focus and the direction o f my research. The category 'dissidence' suggested that resistance in the contemporary arena o f power relations o f HIV/AIDS could no longer be articulated from outside the discursive practices that 'own' it. As such, resisting the stigma o f AIDS in the technologically-advanced context o f contemporary Anglo-American society is an effort enacted fix>m within the discourse o f science. Magical New Age connotations around the 'healing' o f AIDS can not be sustained in societies \\^ e re the guardian of moral boundaries is no longer the religious functionary but the medical professional. The articulation o f a resistance identity constitutes an attempt to resist the m\u00e9dicalisation and the control o f the positive body. Yet, the dominant discourse o f biomedicine is also the starting point for such a strategy o f opposition to m\u00e9dicalisation, and its effects on processes o f embodiment. Discourse, medical discourse in this case, is both an 'instrument' and an 'effect' o f power (Foucault, 1973). The 'productive' aspect o f biomedical power produces the resistance identities, which oppose the legitimising identity o f the PWA. Power in this sense is relational, a strategy which is invested in and transmitted through all social groups. As such, dissidents attempt to resist not the malevolent imposition o f ascribed biomedical definition by the new 'clergy' but a 'series o f loosely linked assemblages' that reproduce medical dominance (Lupton, 1997). 321 Many HIV-infected individuals appear to normalise a pathological relationship to their bodies in order to conform to technologically produced signifiers o f health. The fundamental issue in the articulation o f the PWA identity is the relinquishing o f agency that the adoption o f a legitimising perspective necessarily implies. When the pathological state o f the positive body is reinterpreted as necessary for a simulacrum o f health that includes serious iatrogenic dis-ease, the gay body fails to resist the institutional inscriptions which have been labelling it as deviant since the early modem era (chapter three). The adoption o f such a 'passive' positioning by the PWA implies the relinquishing of his agency in the production o f his own corporeal meanings. Thus the PWA is ultimately implicated in his own subjugation by the discursive practices that endeavour to constrain the positive body that is his self. Dissidents engage in processes and practices that destabilise the subjectification o f the body as the object o f control o f the institutional gaze. The dissident chooses to interpret health from an embodied, experiential, lived perspective. As such, the resistance identity represented by the dissident position asks what can my body 'do', not what does my body 'mean'. This form o f resistance identity should not be understood as a deluded positioning incapable o f accepting the truth of AIDS. A more productive way to understand what such a resisting possibility may mean is to consider AIDS dissent from the 'questioning' logic o f contemporary (post-modern) society wliere 'meta-narratives' no longer sustain plausibility stmctuies. In their recalcitrance dissident individuals afhrm the effects of representation upon our materiality, and the consequences they impinge upon our organic beings. However, by embodying the subject position o f AIDS dissident 322 these individuals defend the processual nature of our materiality, a contingent and continuously evolving 'event'. Dissidence uncovers the fact that in the naturalisation of the binary positive/negative much is socially constructed and highly political. More fundamentally, the embodied experience o f dissidence raises the important question o f the 'possibility o f a free consciousness that could precede, and be revealed beneath, representations' (Bray and Colebrook, 1988:57). 323 Appendix A; Interview Guide Start by informing interviewee that the interview data is strictly confidential, that he/she may refuse to answer any question, and that in case excerpts o f interviews were to be published any biographical information would be changed in order to assure that confidentiality is maintained.

C: Can you tell me where you are from and how long you have been living in London? G: I was bom in London in 1964 so that makes me 35 and lived here in Harrow I was bom in Harrington but lived in Harrow until I was 8 then my parents moved to Oxford and I lived there until I went away to boarding school at the age o f 13 until 18 near the south coast then I studied chemistry at school I wanted to become a doctor decided at the last minute 1 did not want to be a doctor 1 wanted to be an actor big change so then after school spent a year in Oxford at a college of further education doing English A level and theatre studies A level in a year then spend a year cooking at a pizza parlour and then spent three years at drama school in Gilford and then spent the next few years touring around the country working I spent quite a few years working as an actor and doing temp jobs and my last acting job was in 1989 uh it was a tour of Great Expectations in the middle and the far East which was around 4 months and came back into this country at xmas o f 1989 with four thousand pounds in the bank did not want to work as an actor because 1 had lost contact with friends and those sorts o f tilings I just wanted to settle down for a while so I started doing some volunteer work for Crusaid and then after a while 1 needed some money so I got a short term contract with somebody who was doing some HV training for the health service in the summer o f 1990 and he said during it was 335 supposed to be six weeks I was just doing some administration and he said why do you not come along and see what I do it was in front o f some 20 midwives and it was just doing basic training what AIDS stands for how it is transmitted and that sort o f thing and halfway through the morning he said so Henry what do you think and with the communication I got as an actor and the knowledge that I picked up working for Crusaid I have the skills and the knowledge to do some basic HIV training which he realised so he started to employ me as a trainer so that is more or less what I have been doing ever since using the skills I got as an actor I get paid a lot more and it is there is a real I can see real benefits rather than just entertain. C: Can you tell me a little bit about when you realised you were gay? G: Looking back I can sort o f see I enjoyed watching Tarzan movies on a Saturday night that would have been when I was about 4 or 5 and I had no real concept o f what it was the real thing I realised was around the age o f 11 or 12 that was when I was able to not necessarily put words to it but in terms o f labels but I could put words into the desire you know who I fancied you know I like him rather than her and it was actually when I was 12 uh my mother had a first o f a series bouts o f mania mental breakdown type o f thing and she had one she had just had a hysterectomy it was the summer o f 1976 and she had I was supposed to be at home because it was a holiday and my father was due to come up to London to do a lecture or something like that and he could not leave me at home the next day because my mom could not cope with me so what he did was he brought me to London and dropped me outside the science museum with 25 quid in my pocket at the 336 age o f 12 and said go look around at that and 1 will pick you up at 4 in the afternoon at least that is my memory o f it and I did not go to the science museum I went to Soho and that is where I had my first sexual experience it was with a man who must have been much older than me he must have been oh old 24 in a straight cinema booth in Soho. C: So you realised firom a very early age then? G: Oh yes. C: Do you think you were bom gay? G: I am sure I was. C: How did you feel when you went back to meet your dad? G: I knew it was something that I should not talk about my parents had made it very clear my brother is 5 years older than me and in conversations with my brother which I had been part of it which was you are not supposed to have sex with women until you are married nothing had been talked about sex with boys I did not feel guilty I was very excited and wanted to do it ogam. C: Did you continue to have sex? 337 G: The next time I had sex was about a year later it was the first time I had penetrative sex sex in hoarding school only happened when I was 18 and only three times with a guy my age. C: What about sex with girls? G: No I never thought about it I was I it just never crossed my mind I was only aware of men and it did not seem wrong to me so there was not a dilemma o f having to choose really. C: Did you tell anybody? G: I came out in boarding school when 1 was 16 and it went around the school pretty quickly as those sort of things do and then fairly shortly the teachers knew originally one o f my best fiiends said you can not be gay being gay is standing on a street comer and picking somebody up and I just said yes I think the language I may well still have been using was I like men or I am a homosexual I am I do not know when 1 started using gay. C: How did they react? G: Well it meant that I was never to have sex with anybody else at boarding school because the moment I identified m yself uh nobody else would even consider because it 338 would label them but I managed to maintain the respect o f other people I ended iq) being the head o f house o f 80 boys I was a prefect. C: What about your parents? G: I told my dad when I was 18 just before my A levels around the same time I told him I did not want to be a doctor 1 wanted to be an actor he sort o f accepted it he is a doctor and I can remember his words being I do not think you are because I have not seen any o f the symptoms I never asked him what the symptoms were but he just thought I was under the pressure o f the exams and sort o f making a change from doctor to actor teenage type o f problems he has now pretty much accepted it we do not talk about it much about it but you know it is just one o f those sorts o f things my mother he suggested not telling my mother because o f her mental state most o f the time she is fine but her bouts o f mania are set off by family emotional difficulties and so we decided not to tell her but she found those magazines I had been hiding for 9 years so she found them when I was 21 threw them all out and called me home and confronted me with it and 1 said yes at the time she told me she was concerned about me being 50 and a lonely old queen since then she has expressed worries about religion and how it sort o f she she believes in she is a member o f the C o f \u00a3 she has got very strong Christian beliefs and she can not quite marry the Christian upbringing that I had with being homosexual she thinks it is a sin but we get on we get on. C: Is your dad religious as well? 339 G: No he is not he is a con^lete atheist a real scientist. C: What about yourself are you religious? G: I think 1 am faMy spiritual but I have had real problems with the times that 1 have tried to when I was a teenager I explored being a church member when I was in school I was in the church choir that sort o f thing but I did try and be part of the church in terms o f you know being a Christian and accepting Christ when I was 16 that was my quandary it was not so much about my sexuality but I had real problem when 1 came out I think that was the one area where I had real problems over the other members o f the school church not treating me in what I thought was a Christian way so I had problems with organised religion but even then I saw that the churches teachings about homosexuality being a sin and therefore members of the church judging somebody else for doing something like that as somehow surely that is not what Christ and Christ teachings are about they are about accepting everybody and I find religions where people are not accepted because o f things that they do or because o f what they are kind o f tricky. C: Did you really want to belong to the church? G: I think I was I think I was looking for some kind o f identity because there were not many other people around me I did not feel as if I were a member o f anything I felt very different because I was very clear about my sexuality and it was being expressed in a way 340 that was not normal for a teenage boy so 1 wanted to be a member o f something and when I was rejected from that I went OK let us find the resources within me so I became very independent very early. C: How were you rejected? G: I remember some o f my Mends when I was 16 telling me being a homosexuzd is a sin and me trying to have conversations with them about the philosophy o f Christianity you know it was never very being told by a groiq> o f people Wio you want to be a member of that you are committing a sin was difficult and I felt as if well it is their lack not mine and 1 did not feel as if what I was doing was a sin so it was their problem, C: Have you ever heard o f Queer Theology? G:No. C: Arc you familiar with the work f John Boswell? G: No Wio is he? C: He is a gay historian what about HIV when did you find out? 341 G: I found out in 1992 uh the way it came about obviously I had a clear understanding of what HIV was because I had been working with it for a couple o f years and I had been having tests every 6 months or so since about 19861 was going out with this guy a New Zealander called Ian and we had been going out for about 3 months we both said that I mean I had had and he had said that he had just before we started going out with each other that he had a negative test tests that had come back negative it was in the summer o f 1991 we came back from a club on a Sunday afremoon and we had sex and I had stopped checking to see if he was wearing a condom or not and it was not until after he had finished fticking me that I realised he was not wearing one and so even though everything I knew well I sort of rationalised it well it has happened once then therefore we had been OK practicing safer sex OK we might be having sex outside o f the relationship we both were uh but we discussed how the sex outside o f the relationship was safe how we both had negative tests just before we started going out with each other therefore the risk was pretty small so we continued to have unsafe sex with each oftier it was during a hectic. C: Were you having safe sex outside the relationship? G: I was and pretty much I mean not in the 1970s but as soon as I was aware o f AIDS I was having safe sex always we negotiated that between the two o f us how we would not have unsafe sex outside the relationship and decided not to have unsafe sex outside during a fairly hectic time in terms of we would go to Trade at weekends and sex parties after that and they were a couple o f occasions one where I almost caught him about to be fucked by somebody without a condom and I just put the condom on the guy and and the 342 next time was in November when 1 was having sex in one comer and 1 heard somebody say to him not without a condom and I thoi^ht hang on so the next day I conhonted him probably not a good idea because we were both coming down the next day 1 confironted him and said do you remember he did not remember because he was so off his face and I said to him does it worry you mid he said no well it worries me because 1 thought well if he can not remember he is telling me he is having safe sex but he might not remember the times he is having unsafe sex so I finished the relationship because I was so ai^ry I was so angry he had no regard for me. C: How long was this relationship? G: 9 months. 3 months later end o f January I went and got tested and it came back positive so then I told him and he got his results and it was positive as well so I am fairly clear that is where it came hom I was hugely angry with him but since then I have come to accept 50% of the responsibihty. I do not feel angry anymore I also think if it had not been him it probably would have been somebody else. C: Why do you say that? G: 1 do not think I would have not been able to maintain safe sex indefinitely I mean probably just knowing the places that I like going to and sort o f the lifestyle that I lead I probably would have ended up having sex with somebody who had HFV at some point. 343 C; Can you tell me about your lifestyle? G: There was a period I do not do it so much anymore now I may do it every 6 weeks but 1 used to do it every weekend you know getting off my head and getting laid basically I did that constantly for 2 years and 1 still like doing it I also like the leather scene so it was likely to happen. C: So you are no longer angry? G: No but uh I think I had issues around my parents or particulariy my mother or my upbringing because my mother had this unstable mental health which I never worked through because I did not understand what was goir^ on and in a way the HTV was die thing that brought us back and since then we sorted things out. C: Let us go back to the day you got your results? G: I went to the hospital with a friend who was also very good friends with Ian and I went and saw the same health advisor that had given me the pre-test counsel and she just said you are HIV antibody positive and she said do you want a whiskey and I went sorry and she got out of the bottom o f the filing cabinet she got a bottle o f wiiisky and at that stage I did not drink so I said no thank you and I could see she wanted to do something she asked me if I wanted a ciqi o f tea but all I wanted her to do was to sit down and talk some o f this through with me so i said yes I would like a cup o f tea so she left to make 344 this cup o f tea for what seemed ages and I can not remember what we talked about but she took me through the t h ii ^ and then we called my friend in and he was more in shock that i was but i do remember diat I did not want to get into the tube to go home I wanted space around me I did not want to be crowded I was in shock for a while I can not remember how long I just kept going frmctioning from day to day I just kept on working. C: You were an HTV educator by then what did you think the diagnosis meant? G: Even though I knew and 1 had been telling people for the last 18 months that it would take 9 to 10 years on average until they would die I still thought oh it is going to be tomorrow I remember 1 thought and I discussed this with people \\ ^ o woik within the industry and then found out they were positive several people have said to me and 1 had this thought this myself two months and then I will be dead then you get to those two months and you think six months and then you get to those 6 months and you think oh sod it 1 suppose it took me about 2 years to really sort most o f it out I mean occasionally there are things that jump over my shoulder. C: Like \\ ^ t ? G: It is usually about something else I can remember dioi%h suddenly getting a CD4 count o f 190 so it is below the 200 mark so thinking oh I have AIDS or having to start treatment. 345 c : So let us talk about that one are you on treatment? G: Yes I have been on treatment now since for 3 years I got my positive result in 1992 but it must it seems like I have been on treatment forever it must have been early 1995 when I ^ t that result o f about 210 190 what I had always I had worked out pretty quickly because o f Wiat I knew that there was not a lot o f treatment around but what was around was effective and would work at around 200. C: Are you talking about AZT? G: Yes so I had said to myself r i ^ t when my CD4 counts gets to about 250 200 that is when I will consider starting th e r^ y or AZT becau% \u00dciat is what it was and I got my result and my doctor had this list o f things that I could take which was AZT or I could go on a trial and I thought well I had thought 1 should go on a trial because that is the only way I will get anything more than AZT and it was there was a trial around at the time called the Quatro trial there was a combination o f AZT DDC 3TC and one the no nucleoside protease inhibitors called Loverite and the idea was either you either took AZT and 3TC or you took all 4 or you took 1 d n ^ for 8 weeks and then another for 8 weeks and then another for 8 weeks on rotation and I liked the idea o f taking all 4 drugs together uh and I thought OK 1 will do this but the p'oblem was. C: Why the sqjpeal o f 4 d n ^ s together? 346 G: Because I always thought just in my head more will be better tiian one it just seemed more logical to me it is not very scientific or it was not at that stage but just seemed to make sense and just at the time they were proving \u00dciat 2 drugs was better than one so 1 th o r ^ t well if they are proving that then surely 4 drugs will be better than 2 but they had not quite crossed all the its and dotted and the is for the trial they said you have to wait to start this but it will not be long so I continued going every 2 to 3 weeks to have my CD4 count and it continued to drop particularly rapidly. C: Were you otherwise well? G; Yes I was otherwise well I was a bit tired but there was no physical stuff there was a tiredness and a lethargy and I could feel that there was something going on but there was no physical manifestation. C: Had you had any diseases? G: I had some skins problems but no diseases as such 1 never have uh and it got to Apnl and tiien said OK we will be able to start in 4 weeks time I went and saw the doctor who was going to do the trial and had my blood taken and my CD4 count came back as 120 and I thought this is very low it was getting lower and lower and lower and went on to th e r^ y and it went back up to 300 350 but that is \\^ e n I became not ill but the side effects kicked in and I was sleqjing 16 hours a day for the first 4 weeks and then after a 4 week period o f feeling so unwell but I knew I was adjusting to the drugs 1 started to feel 347 better this was around Septembo: and 1 went back to work that w o^ed very nicely for about 2 years and then my CD4 just started to drop again and I m an a^d t get a hold o f all my viral load results because they had been doing this as part o f the trial and my viral load was about 9,000 10,000 and I t h o u ^ uh not good so I said to them look I need to change \u00dcien I changed to a combination containing 2 protease inhibitors and 2 new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors so it was a completely different set o f drugs. C: So this was your decision? G: Yes I said to them look I think I need to change and they went yes we think so too but it was precipitated by me by this time I was pretty involved in training about treatments and there was little I did not know I mean when 1 had started I am one o f those people who is incredibly curious about their own health so I needed to learn it about for myself but also I was already starting to train nurses in how the virus replicates what drugs are being used the latest research so it was both from a persomd point o f view and from a work point o f view that I needed to know this information and as more and more research came along there was little \u00dciat 1 did not know and I am pretty much a control freak when it comes to me so yes it has always been my decision I often ask for a suggestion and the doctors will tell me what ftiey think.
