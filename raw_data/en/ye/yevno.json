The representative also stated that the death penalty undermined human dignity and that errors made in its application we re irreversible. Moreover, imposing the death penalty for drug offences undermined the norms of international law, specifically article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The representative underlined the importanc e of the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 69/186, on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, which was adopted in December 2014 with an unprecedented number of votes and in which the Assembly, as an interim step, had called for inte rnational minimum standards on the use of the death penalty to be respected.

E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 60 drug -related crimes in countries that applied the death penalty and respectfully proposed to those countries that, with due regard for their national realities, they consider the possibility of adopting a moratoriu m on the application of the death penalty for drug -related crimes, with a view to its final abolition. 42.

The representative put on record the following principled position of those delegations concerning the important issue of the death penalty: there was no international consensus on the issue of the death penalty; the death penalty was not prohibited under international law; its application was a criminal justice matter for individual States to be decided by their competent authorities and each State had the sovereign right to decide on its own justice system, taking i nto account its own circumstances; every State had the sovereign right to choose its own political, economic, social and legal system based on its own best interest; and the issue of the death penalty did not fall under the mandate of the Commission, which was not the right platform to raise this topic. The representative reiterated that the death penalty was an important component of the administration of the law by and the justice systems of the countries on whose behalf he made the statement, that it was imposed only for the most serious crimes and that it served as a deterrent. Furthermore, he stated that the world drug problem continued to pose a threat to the safety and security of all and that those countries had proper legal safeguards and national p olicies in place that prevented any miscarriages of justice. 44. The observer for Morocco, speaking on behalf of the African Group, expressed appreciation to the Board tasked with the preparations for the special session and its Chair for facilitating consensu s and enabling the adoption of the outcome document. 45.

He stated that, owing to the consensus, some issues had remained unresolved that should be resolved in the future in order to have more people -focused policies t hat would deal with the challenges identified. He noted that much remained to be done and that the United Nations should make preparations to ensure a comprehensive approach for 2019 and beyond. He also recalled that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Su stainable Development was an opportunity to align all policies, including drug policies, so that they favoured development, inclusion and peaceful societies. 46. The observer for New Zealand reiterated his country's strong opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances, expressed disappointment that this position was not reflected in the outcome document and noted that his country would continue its efforts for the global abolition of the death penalty at every opportunity and urged other States to do the same. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 61 47.

Australia urged all other Member States to do so as well. 48. The representative of Norway expressed his country's strong regret that there was no reference to the abolition of the death penalty in the outcome document and noted that his country con sistently opposed the use of the death penalty, including for drug -related crimes, throughout the preparatory process. He stated that there was no empirical evidence proving that the death penalty had a deterring effect and that the absence of any referenc e to the abolition of the death penalty weakened the impact of the outcome document. The representative also stated that his country would continue to press for the global abolition of the death penalty and respect for the right to life, and urged other Me mber States to do so as well. 49. The observer for Oman expressed support for the statement made by Indonesia and emphasized the need to observe the three international drug control conventions and to respect the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.

The representative of Nigeria stated that the outcome document addressed the key issues and concerns within the framework of the three international drug control conventions and other relevant United Nations instruments. He called on Member States to embrace the document and find solace in the spirit of the Vienna consensus. 51. The observer for Romania noted that, in her delegation's view, sovereignty was not incompatible with the right to life and that modern society had the means to defend itself without defin itively denying drug offenders the opportunity to reform. 52. The observer for the United Arab Emirates aligned himself with the statement delivered by Indonesia that it was the sovereign right of States to determine their own national affairs based on their o wn legal systems, including laws and penal codes. He also noted that the right to life could not be granted to those who took away the lives of others and that States that were calling for the abolition of the death penalty did so as a general principle in relation to all crimes, and he referred to the linkages between the activities of terrorists and those of drug traffickers. He expressed gratitude that the outcome document did not contain a reference to the abolition of the death penalty. 53. The representat ive of Thailand welcomed the adoption of the outcome document, which was the result of a collective effort. 54.

The observer for Iraq reaffirmed the importance of upholding the three international drug control conventions as main pillars. He noted that his delegation's agreeme nt to some amended language in the outcome document did not mean that the three conventions should be overlooked in the context of national, regional or international policies or in the development of other strategies. He expressed the hope that the amend ed language would not be a precedent concerning the status of the three conventions and would not undermine their role in addressing the world drug problem. He also recalled that criminal justice systems were an internal affair for each Member State and th at it was the prerogative of Member States to determine the most constructive approach in line with the magnitude of the challenge, be it the world drug problem or transnational organized crime or terrorism. 57. The observer for the European Union thanked the Board and all partners for their contributions to a truly collective effort. 58.

He also stated that the political and legal platform provided by the three international drug control conventions should be used t o develop an approach for different countries that respected the position of each Member State of the United Nations and that addressed the legal, political and social aspects of the world drug problem based on scientific evidence, learning from historical experience, with a view to emphasizing human rights and applying diverse and well -considered measures within the framework of international law. 61.

One speaker insisted on the necessity of being consistent in the application of full cost recovery, and also insisted on the use of programme support costs to fund certain field office costs. In the context of further improving transparency, reporting and results -based management by UNODC, several speakers highlighted the important work of the Independent Evaluation Unit. One s peaker proposed that an evaluation of the Division for Management be conducted in conjunction with the Office of Internal Oversight Services. 71. Some speakers insisted on the importance of ensuring a transparent and successful implementation of Umoja without loss of reporting capacity and without burdening programme delivery. One speaker expressed concerns over the discontinuation of the ProFi system and called for a timely delivery of the new reporting platform. It was noted that financial reporting on techn ical assistance should resume as soon as feasible. 72. The adoption of Commission resolution 58/12, which included provisions on gender equality and geographical representation, was welcomed, and the need for enhanced exchanges and dialogue between Member Sta tes and UNODC on these topics was stressed. It was noted that the Secretariat should seek ways to further improve its recruitment policies and to actively reach out to qualified candidates from developing countries, particularly female candidates. A number of speakers expressed concern that insufficient progress had been made in achieving gender E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 65 balance, especially at the senior and policymaking levels, and urged UNODC to take action in this regard. UNODC was called on to develop a comprehensive strategy to promote gender balance and geographic diversity. The importance was highlighted of promoting highly qualified professionals from within the organisation, notably through the implementation of measures at headquarters and in the field offices to ensure wor k-life balance, including family -friendly measures. 73. The initial responses given by UNODC to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals it contains was highlighted together with the importance of orienting the impleme ntation of the strategic plan of UNODC to assisting Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with due regard for its universal and integrated nature. It was suggested that UNODC make full use of opportunities for collaborat ion with other United Nations entities and development actors. 74. While expressing appreciation for the report of the Executive Director on the activities of UNODC, one speaker stated that his country did not share the views contained in its paragraph 101 (b ).

It was noted that the world drug problem continued to pose serious risks to health and safety of citizens and families and to the stability and sustainable development of societies. The need for continuing commitment to the three international drug control conv entions and other relevant international instruments was stressed. The need for a balanced and multidisciplinary approach to supply and demand reduction policies was emphasized, as was the need to strengthen and support the efforts of other countries. The work of UNODC and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in relation to the implementation of the conventions and of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action was highlighted. 1. Demand reduction and related measures 83. The need for a balance d and comprehensive approach to demand reduction based on the principles of public health and human rights was emphasized. It was noted that, in order to be effective, demand reduction policies should, within a comprehensive health approach, cover a range of equally important and mutually reinforcing evidence -based measures such as prevention, treatment, early detection and intervention, rehabilitation, social reintegration and recovery. Reference was made to the International Standards on Drug Use Preventi on prepared by UNODC, and the international standards for the treatment of drug use disorders prepared by UNODC and the World Health Organization (WHO) and made available to the Commission (see E/CN.7/2016/CRP.4). The need for awareness -raising and drug use prevention education measures, including in families and schools, and the importance of reducing stigmatization and discrimination were highlighted. Communities were called on to increase the coverage of rehabilitation and employment services. 84. Existing c hallenges, particularly with regard to increasing the coverage of demand reduction interventions, and the need to train service providers were acknowledged. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 68 85. It was noted that the successful implementation of demand reduction programmes required close coord ination and coherence between the criminal justice, health, social and other sectors, including in the delivery of interventions for drug prevention and treatment, and for HIV prevention, treatment and care for people who use drugs. 86. The importance of takin g into account the gender perspective in the context of the prevention of drug use, the treatment of drug use disorders and in efforts to effectively reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission among people who use drugs, including in prison settings, was stre ssed. 87. The special needs of children, adolescents, young people and women, as well as the importance of involving women in drug policy design and implementation were highlighted. Some speakers also made reference to the need to involve civil society in the formulation and implementation of drug policies at all levels. 88. A number of speakers expressed the view that effective and comprehensive demand reduction policies should also include risk and harm reduction measures. One speaker noted that, while his countr y supported treatment measures, it was opposed to the uniform promotion of harm reduction policies. The speaker stated that each Government should take into account the social and cultural aspects of drug use in its country. 89. The need to improve evidence ga thering and research was noted. Concern was expressed regarding the lack of capacity to collect objective information on emerging trends and to monitor and evaluate the situation and the responses given to it. 90. Reference was made to the need for synergy be tween drug prevention and violence prevention policies. 2. Supply reduction and related measures 91. Joint operations by different jurisdictions and cross -border cooperation were reported as being effective in combating drug trafficking, as was the exchange of information on illicit trafficking and related illicit financial transactions. States were called upon to strengthen mutual legal assistance capabilities, establish central authorities and maintain effective points of contact. It was noted that, to be m ore effective, supply reduction policies should be based on an improved evaluation and analysis of drug markets and drug -related crimes, and on the effectiveness of drug -related law enforcement responses. 92. Cannabis trafficking and the continuing proliferat ion and manufacture of new psychoactive substances and amphetamine -type stimulants, including methamphetamine, were highlighted. Also highlighted was the ongoing importance of maintaining effective border controls and ensuring regional and international cooperation to combat the trafficking in and diversion of precursor and pre - precursor chemicals. The need to review legislation in order to improve efforts to combat drug trafficking and meet emerging challenges, such as the evolution of synthetic drug manuf acturing and the misuse of the Internet for the purpose of drug trafficking, were noted. 93. Some speakers reaffirmed their strong opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, including for drug -related offences. Other speakers E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 69 noted that a strong law enforcement approach against transnational organized criminal groups and individuals involved in drug trafficking was necessary. 94. Reference was made to the need to ensure the adequate availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances fo r medical and scientific purposes, while preventing their diversion, trafficking and abuse. 95. Alternative development was recognized as a critical component in reducing illicit drug crop cultivation, enhancing human development, improving viable economic livelihoods and promoting sustainability. Representatives of States that did not yet implement alternative development programmes expressed their strong interest in implementing alternative development programmes, including in order to address illicit cult ivation of cannabis, taking into consideration best practices and lessons learned and calling for cooperation and international support. Several speakers welcomed the growing number of countries engaging in alternative development and reaffirmed their comm itment to sharing experiences and lessons learned with other countries. Support was expressed for giving market access to products stemming from alternative development and, where appropriate, preventive alternative development. Reference was made to the n eed to implement the United Nations Guiding Principles on Alternative Development and to the outcome of the Second International Conference on Alternative Development. The important role of alternative development in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda f or Sustainable Development was highlighted. 3. Countering money -laundering and promoting judicial cooperation to enhance international cooperation 96. The issue of illicit financial flows derived from drug trafficking and the need to combat money -laundering were highlighted. In that regard the need for continuous intelligence work on the strongest links between illicit financial flows and the drug markets by, inter alia, monitoring and identification of such flows was noted. Reference was made to the importa nce of the coordination efforts among relevant institutions at the national level. 97. It was also noted that a balanced approach should be taken to combating drug trafficking by focusing on improving the legal, institutional, regulatory and operational framew orks on anti -money -laundering in accordance with international conventions and national legislation, including in order to counter the financing of terrorism and other crimes. The role of inter -agency and international cooperation in various forms, includi ng information -sharing between financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies, was highlighted as an essential element in detecting, investigating and disrupting the ways in which drug traffickers financed their activities, including where there are links with the financing of terrorism.

The representative of China expressed his country's support for the statement made by the representative of Thailand and expressed the view that the position of the three international drug control conventions as the cornerstone of the international drug control system should not be cast in doubt and noted that, although the position of the conventions as the cornerstone was not mentioned in the draft resolution, this should not constitute a precedent. The representative of China also stated that the position of the conventions as the cornerstone should be reflected in the outcome document. The representative of Peru stated that his delegation supporte d the statement made by the representative of Thailand and noted that, bearing in mind the importance of alternative development for Peru as a state policy, although his country decided to give priority to the essential focus of this resolution, the withdr awal of the preambular paragraphs 1 and 2 should not set a precedent for the future. The representative of Peru also reaffirmed that the three international drug control conventions were the cornerstone of the international legal system for this subject a nd therefore his delegation was convinced that the respective paragraph should be included in the final outcome document. The observer for Malaysia stated that his country aligned itself with the statement by the representative of Thailand, in particular a s regards that the decision [to withdraw the preambular paragraphs 1 and 2] would not be considered as a precedent in any future case and that the world drug problem must be addressed in accordance with the provisions of the three international drug control conventions, which constituted and remained the cornerstone of the in ternational drug control system. The observer for Iraq noted that his delegation associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Thailand and expressed suppor t for statements made by States, whereby it was recalled that the three international drug control conventions were the cornerstone in all international drug control policies, as well as in the development of alternative development strategies.

The representative of the Russian Federation noted that his delegation was determined to have a constructive dialogue and to look for mutually acceptable solutions and that the technical withdrawa l of this draft resolution did not mean that his country's commitment to the UNODC's globa l initiative to decrease the flow of opium from Afghanistan was in any way diminished . The representative of the Russian Federation also expressed gratitude to Paris Pact partners for supporting the draft and for their readiness to increase their efforts to implement the Vienna Declaration adopted in 2012 at the Third Ministerial Conference of the Paris Pact Partners on Combating Illicit Traffic in Opiates Originating in Afghanistan and to have a continued, constructive interaction among E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 73 Member States, inter alia within the Commission , on counter ing Afghan opiates on the basis of the principle of common and shared responsibility of all States in view of the world drug problem.

Statements were also made by the observers for the Vienna NGO Committee on Drugs, Viva Rio and Students for Sensible Drug Policy. A. Deliberations 1. Challenges and future work of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the World Health Organization in the review of substances for possible scheduling recommendations 113. The need for informed international scheduling decisions by the Commission under the conventions to tackle the most harmful, persistent and prevalent new psychoactive substances was highlighted, together with the work of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, supported by UNODC, in identifying the adverse health effects of new psychoactive substances. The importance of ensuring the continued availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances while preventing their diversion was also highlighted. 114. Reference was made to the importance and utility of the UNODC early warning advisory on new psychoactive substances and of the global Synthetics Monitoring: Analysis, Reporting and Trends (SMART) prog ramme. The role of INCB in addressing the issue of new psychoactive substances was noted as well. 115. Appreciation was expressed by a number of speakers for the work of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence and States were urged to continue to submit eviden ce to it in order to support the review process. The importance of enhancing data collection, as well as cooperation between the Committee and UNODC, INCB and regional organizations, such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, was recognized. WHO was also urged to make the reports on the meetings of the Committee available to Member States at an earlier stage and to disseminate more widely the list of substances that the Committee recommended should be kept under surveillance. 116. One s peaker expressed regret regarding the recommendation of WHO on the scheduling of ketamine, in view of its increasing abuse, illicit manufacture and trafficking, especially in Asia. He noted that its placement under Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention would ensure the application of the principle of a comprehensive and balanced approach to preventing the abuse, diversion and illicit manufacture and trafficking of the drug, while ensuring its availability for medical use. He called on the Expert Committee to better play the treaty -mandated role, to substantively improve transparency and efficiency and to improve its cooperation with the Commission and by making full use of the information provided by States. He also referred to Commission decision 58/2, where by the consideration of the proposal to E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 76 place ketamine in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention had been postponed and additional information was requested from WHO and other relevant sources. A number of speakers invited the Commission to consider placing ke tamine under Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. 117. A number of speakers expressed concern regarding the disproportionate impact that the scheduling of the anaesthetic agent ketamine, which was classified as an essential medicine by WHO, would have in lower - and middle -income countries and during emergencies such as wars and natural disasters, or where no adequately trained personnel existed. It was proposed that States continue cooperating and exchanging information on national and regional experiences of ta ckling the public health harms of the misuse of ketamine. The need to enhance international cooperation to reduce existing technical gaps among Member States was noted. 2. Changes in the scope of control of substances (a) Consideration of a proposal fr om the World Health Organization to place acetylfentanyl in Schedules I and IV of the 1961 Convention as amended by the 1972 Protocol 118. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that acetylfentanyl was a compound with typical morphine -like properties including physical dependence. It had been extensively trafficked internationally, its use had resulted in over 50 recorded deaths and it had no medical uses. The effects of acetylfentanyl were similar to those of morphine and fentanyl, which were included in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention. It was therefore recommended that acetylfentanyl be placed in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention. T he Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, at its 37th meeting, had also considered that acetylfentanyl was particularly liable to abuse and to producing ill effects without therapeutic advantages, and had therefore recommended its placement in Schedule IV of the 1961 Convention as amended. (b) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place MT -45 in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended 119. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that MT -45 was a compound with typical morphine -like qualities including physical dependence, that its use had been recorded in several countries, that reports existed of fatal and non -fatal overdoses of the sub stance and that it had no current medical uses. The effects of MT-45 were similar to those of morphine and other opioids that were included in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended; therefore, the Committee had recommended that MT -45 be placed in Sc hedule I of that Convention. (c) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place para -methoxymethylamphetamine in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention 120. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that para-methoxymethylamphetamin e (PMMA) was similar to the scheduled substances methamphetamine and para -methoxyamphetamine (PMA). He noted that PMMA had effects similar to those of PMA, which was a drug listed in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention. The use of PMMA had been reported in a number of countries and the rate of overdose deaths had been increasing. PMMA had no medical use. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 77 associated with the abuse of PMMA was especially serious and had therefore recommended that PMMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention. (d) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place -pyrrolidinovalerophenone, para -methyl -4-methylaminorex (4,4' -DMAR) and methoxetamine in Schedule II of the 1 971 Convention 121. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that the substances -pyrrolidinovalerophenone, para -methyl -4-methylaminorex (4,4' abused in a number of different countries and had been shown to cause mu ltiple overdose deaths. None of them had any medical uses. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society associated with the abuse of each of the substances was substantial and it had therefore recommended that they be place d in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (e) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place phenazepam in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention 122. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that the illicit use of phenazepam had in creased in a number of countries in recent years, that its use had been associated with a number of overdose deaths and with an increased risk of traffic accidents and that it was used therapeutically in some countries. Phenazepam had been shown to have ef fects similar to diazepam and many other benzodiazepines that were included in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society associated with the abuse of phenazepam was smaller compared wi th substances in Schedules I to III, but still significant. Phenazepam had some therapeutic usefulness. The Committee considered that the evidence of its abuse warranted its placement in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. 123. In response to a request for add itional information, the observer for WHO noted that phenazepam belonged to the 1,4 -benzodiazepines, the same family to which diazepam, oxazepam and temazepam belonged, and that it had a structural resemblance to diazepam, which was in Schedule IV of the 1 971 Convention. He also noted that phenazepam could induce tolerance, and that the discontinuation of its administration could result in withdrawal effects, which was indicative of physical dependence. Furthermore, he informed the Commission that user repo rts had indicated that phenazepam could be used to enhance the euphoric reports of opioids and that effects such as psychomotor impairment, respiratory arrest, psychotic experiences and delirium, as well as overdose and death, had been reported. Driving un der its influence had also been reported. He stated that the Committee had undertaken a pre -review of the substance and considered that the information provided in the pre -review report had been sufficient and had indicated that the dependence and harm cau sed by phenazepam was of such magnitude that proceeding directly into a critical review during the meeting had been warranted. All procedural requirements for a critical review, including two peer reviews, had been fulfilled. Phenazepam had been shown to h ave effects similar to diazepam, which was listed in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society associated with the abuse of phenazepam was significant. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 78 3. International Narcotics Co ntrol Board 124. Appreciation was expressed for the work carried out by INCB and for the release of its annual report for 2015. Its important role in monitoring the implementation of the international drug control conventions was welcomed. States were called u pon to make better use of the tools made available by INCB, such as the Precursors Incident Communication System (PICS), Pre -Export Notification Online (PEN Online) and the International Import and Export Authorization System (I2ES). 125. The need for a compreh ensive, integrated and balanced approach to the drug problem in order to ensure the health and welfare of humankind was reiterated, and continued commitment to the international drug control conventions was expressed. It was noted that socioeconomic aspect s, such as poverty, food insecurity, economic inequality and social exclusion, had a negative impact on supply and demand reduction efforts. Reference was made to the obligation of States parties under the conventions to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes, while preventing their diversion and abuse. It was also noted that the conventions required the application of the principle of proportionality and the use of alternatives to imprisonm ent. 126. A number of speakers encouraged States that imposed the death penalty to consider abolishing it for drug -related offences. Another speaker stated that every country had the right to adopt its own legislation and policies, in line with national and int ernational law. One speaker noted that INCB's recommendation on the death penalty issue went beyond its treaty -mandated duty. 127. Several speakers expressed concern regarding the rapid spread of and the threat posed by new psychoactive substances, as well as regarding the diversion from domestic channels and the use of precursor chemicals. 128. The role of the Commission, INCB and WHO in responding to new psychoactive substances was highlighted. Reference was made to the need for partnerships between authorities an d the relevant industrial sectors. Reference was also made to the importance of streamlining the review and scheduling processes and WHO was requested to prioritize the review of new psychoactive substances on the basis of prevalence, persistence and poten tial harm. States were urged to increase voluntary cooperation and efforts to put substances under provisional control under the conventions until international controls could be put into place. 4. International cooperation to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes while preventing their diversion 129. Support was expressed for international cooperation in ensuring the availability of controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes. It was noted that, in cases where the scheduling of substances at the international level could result in a lack of availability in some areas, including rural or remote regions, targeted regulatory measures could be designed to facilitate availability to such substances. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 79 5. Other matters arising from the international drug control treaties 130. At its 8th meeting, on 17 March 2016, the Commission considered agenda item 6 (e), entitled \"Other matters arising from the international drug control treaties\". No issues were raised under the item. B. Action taken by the Commission 131. At its 9th meeting, on 18 March 2016, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs included acetylfentanyl in Schedules I and IV of the 1961 Convention as amended by the 1972 Protocol. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/1 .) 132. At the same me eting, the Commission decided to include MT -45 in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/2 .) 133. Also at the same meeting, the Commission decided by 48 votes to none, with no abstentions , to include para -methoxymethylamphetamine (PMMA) in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/3 .) 134. Also at its 9th meeting, the Commission decided by 48 votes to none, with 1 abstention, to includ e -pyrrolidinovalerophenone ( -PVP) in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/4 .) 135. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 48 votes to none, with 1 abstention, to include para -methyl -4-methylaminorex (4,4' -DMAR) in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/5 .) 136. Also at the same meeting, the Commission decided by 48 votes to none, with 1 abstention, to include methoxetamine (MXE) in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/6 .) 137. Also at its 9th meeting, the Commission decided by 46 votes to 2, with no abstentions, to include phenazepam in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. D, decision 59/7 .) Following the adoption of the decision, the representative of Belarus stated that his Government had voted against the scheduling of phenazepam because it was widely used as a medicine a nd in the medical industry. He requested WHO to provide further clarifications, given that there were similar substances, used in medicine, whose use was restricted, although they were not placed under international control. Also following the adoption of the decision, the representative of the Russian Federation noted that all the substances considered by the Commission at its fifty -ninth session for scheduling, except phenazepam, had already been placed under control in the Russian Federation. The represe ntative expressed disappointment with the outcome of the voting on the scheduling of phenazepam and with the fact that phenazepam had been recommended for scheduling as it was not a psychotropic or highly active substance. He also noted that, in the Russia n Federation, phenazepam was included in the general list of medical substances and that it had been widely used for medical purposes since the 1970s. The representative stated that there was no evidence of large -scale abuse of phenazepam for non -medical p urposes and that the E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 80 WHO recommendation would limit its use in the treatment of patients who needed it. Furthermore, the representative raised the issue of the motives and transparency of WHO recommendations and noted that WHO should provide clear and deta iled criteria describing how it formulated recommendations for scheduling. The representative also recalled the situation with ketamine, the consideration for scheduling of which had been postponed owing to its widespread medical use, and noted that that c riterion had not been taken into account in the case of phenazepam. The representative expressed the view that a consistent, comprehensible and substantiated approach to the critical review of substances recommended for scheduling at the international leve l should be developed. 138. Following the adoption of the decisions on scheduling of MT -45, of Austria noted that her Government had abstai ned from voting because, although global answers on the specific global phenomenon of new psychoactive substances were needed, it questioned whether the existing mechanism was appropriate. She referred to the changing consumer markets for new psychoactive substances, in which a high increase in the number of identified substances had emerged within a few years, and the continued proliferation of new chemical variations. She noted that there was a free market for those chemicals in which they were profitably sold to consumers until they were scheduled, which was done on an individual basis and after some time. Once scheduled, a few substances, possibly from whole groups of analogue substances, stood in relation to a large number of others that were not schedu led, while new substances continued to emerge. She stated that none of the newly emerging chemicals on the market could be presumed safe for consumption, since none had been subject to studies on the impact of their consumption on health; sound data on the potential health risks of acute and long -term consumption and the effects of interactions with other substances were lacking; no information on the health consequences of consuming those chemicals frequently or over a period of time was available; and the re was no guarantee that substances were correctly labelled when sold to consumers, as production and trade were not subject to any control. Furthermore, products often contained other substances or higher concentrations than expected by the buyer, which l ed to consumer incidents. She noted that the situation with new psychoactive substances required tailor -made solutions. Austria had implemented a specific legal approach to the phenomenon of those substances in 2012, with its New Psychoactive Substances Ac t. Although it had implemented a criminal regime, the offences covered under the Act were exclusively related to supply to consumers; when appropriate, it allowed for a generic approach in order to break the cycle of new substances emerging and the public regulator always lagging behind. The Act enabled law enforcement authorities to act immediately against those who supplied consumers with new psychoactive substances and to seize the substances, unless a legitimate purpose for the substance was identified and the substance was not used for human consumption. She stated that effective health -related interventions were needed, that prevention, information, education and awareness -raising among target groups with regard to the risks played an important role, and that consumers and potential consumers needed to be encouraged to talk openly about why, what and how they consumed new psychoactive substances. She explained that that was why the Government of Austria avoided criminalizing consumers; Austria criminalization would motivate consumers to develop secretive consumption behaviours which, in turn, would make it difficult to provide them with preventive messages and make them aware of the health risks related to the consump tion of new psychoactive substances. She noted that all the substances proposed for scheduling by WHO during the session were either already controlled in Austria or would soon be placed under control, most of them under specific regulations on new psychoa ctive substances. She reiterated the willingness of Austria to cooperate with the international community, while encouraging it to consider new approaches specially designed to address the specific challenges posed by new psychoactive substances, and there by paying the utmost attention to public health requirements. 139. Following the adoption of all the decisions on scheduling, the representative of the United Kingdom expressed appreciation to WHO for conducting evidence -based reviews of substances under intern ational control and for the support provided by UNODC, INCB, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and other organizations and Member States. He noted that international scheduling was an effective tool for restricting supply and redu cing the public health harms of the most prevalent, persistent and harmful new psychoactive substances and that a comprehensive and balanced approach to such substances required distinct but complementary approaches at the national, regional and internatio nal levels that enhanced national action and were guided by local circumstances. He called for greater ambition from WHO, international organizations and Member States in the number of substances reviewed and scheduled at the international level, where tha t did not restrict their legitimate use. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 82 Chapter VI World situation with regard to drug trafficking and recommendations of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission 140. At its 11th meeting, on 21 March 2016, the Commission considered agenda item 7, which read as follows: \"World situation with regard to drug trafficking and recommendations of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission\". 141. For its consideration of agenda item 7, the Commission had before it the following : (a) Report of the Secretariat on the world situation with regard to drug trafficking (E/CN.7/2016/5); (b) Report of the Secretariat on action taken by the subsidiary bodies of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (E/CN.7/2016/10). 142. An introductory presentation was made by a representative of the Implementation Support Section of the Organized Crime and Illicit Trafficking Branch of UNODC. A statement was made by the Secretary of the Commission. 143. Statements were made by the representatives of Belgium, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, the United Sta tes of America, Spain, Mexico, India, Canada and the Russian Federation. 144. Statements were also made by the observers for Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Egypt and Iraq. A. Deliberations 145. Appreciation was express ed for the work of the meetings of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies and of the Subcommission on Illicit Drug Traffic and Related Matters in the Near and Middle East. The observer for Algeria, the representative of Belgium and the observer fo r the United Arab Emirates reported on the outcomes of the Twenty -fifth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa, the Eleventh Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Europe, and the fiftieth session of the Sub commission on Illicit Drug Traffic and Related Matters in the Near and Middle East, respectively, on behalf of the Chairs of those meetings. 146. Reference was made to the importance of focusing on the practical suggestions and operational outcomes emanating f rom those meetings, the significance of the meetings as effective mechanisms for multilateral action for law enforcement bodies in countering drug trafficking and the opportunity they presented to learn about the results and outcomes of different approache s to the world drug problem. 147. The need for a comprehensive, balanced and integrated approach to the drug problem was stressed. In that regard, the importance of enhancing international cooperation, including mutual legal assistance and extradition, as well as, where possible, harmonizi ng laws across countries, was highlighted. Reference was made E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 83 to the need for a balanced approach to supply and demand reduction policies and to the importance of closer cooperation between the justice and health sectors. 148. The need to build the capacities of States to tackle the drug problem was noted, as was the need to focus on providing assistance to States that had borne the direct effects of illicit crop cultivation and the illicit manufacture, transit, trafficking, dis tribution and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 149. States that were producing precursor chemicals were called upon to prevent the diversion of such chemicals into the illicit manufacture of drugs, and the need for international cooperation in that regard was noted. Reference was made to the establishment by drug traffickers of new trafficking routes in order to avoid monitoring, widen their customer base and identify profitable new markets. 150. Successes such as the development of forensic ana lysis to dismantle trafficking in amphetamine -type stimulants, existing regional cooperation initiatives and cooperation between States in money -laundering investigations and asset recovery were noted. Reference was made to article 17 of the 1988 Conventio n, which was considered an important tool for disrupting trafficking by sea; it was suggested by one speaker that its application be monitored, that analyses and studies be conducted and the topic be revisited in detail during working groups at future meet ings of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission. 151. One speaker proposed that the Commission should consider reviewing, at its next session, the functioning of the meetings of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies to promote greater regional coordi nation on drug control and public health control efforts in all regions. One speaker noted that, at future meetings of the subsidiary bodies, priority should be given to human rights, security and development, in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustaina ble Development. One speaker noted that any proposals to extend the area of competence of the meetings of the subsidiary bodies and the advisability of such a decision should be carefully reviewed, as those meetings had not fully exhausted their potential as outlined in their initial mandates from the Economic and Social Council. B. Action taken by the Commission 152. At its 11th meeting, on 22 March 2016, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs adopted a draft resolution (E/CN.7/2016/L.14), as orally amended . (For the text, see chap. I, sect. D, resolution 59/ 2). E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 84 Chapter VII Contributions by the Commission to the work of the Economic and Social Council in line with General Assembly resolution 68/1 153. At its 11th meeting, on 21 March 2016, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs considered agenda item 8, which read as follows: \"Contributions by the Commission to the work of the Economic and Social Council in line with General Assembly resolution 68/1\". 154. For its consideration of agenda item 8, the Commission had befo re it a conference room paper entitled \"Contribution by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and a proposed role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in reviewing the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals\" (E/CN.7/2016/CRP.1 -E/CN.15/2016/CRP.1). 155. An introductory statement was made by the Director of the Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs. 156. The representative of t he United States of America made a statement. Deliberations 157. The important linkages between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the work of the Commission were highlighted. It was noted that one of the mandates of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was to assist Member States in achievi ng target 3.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals (\"Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol\"), which was also a key element of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on Int ernational Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem, which was adopted in 2009. Reference was also made to the UNODC mandate to promote HIV prevention, treatment and care among people who use drugs or are in prisons so as to contribute to ending AIDS by 2030, as part of target 3.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (\"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, waterborne diseases and other communicable diseases\"). Reference was further made to the fact that the parties to the international drug control conventions had recognized that it was indispensable to ensure the availability of internationally controlled narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes and that the availability of those drugs and substances to relieve pain and suffering should not be unduly restricted. UNODC partnered in particular with the World Health Organization (WHO) and civil society leaders to meet part of target 3.8 (\"Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health -care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all\") a nd target 3.b (\"Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non - communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 85 affordable essential medicines and vaccines\"). Additionally, the Office's research work supported countries in the monitoring and reporting of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (\"Ensure healthy lives and promote well -being for all at all ages\") by implementing drug monitoring systems for the collection of reliable data. 158. It was noted that UNODC would support Member States in reaching the targets under Goal 5 (\"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\") by, inter alia, promoting access to justice for women and girls, supporting the development of legislation a nd policies that protect their rights, and prevent as well as respond to violence against women and girls. It was also mentioned that the Office's global work on the prevention of drug use and the treatment of drug use disorders specifically addressed the unique needs of women and girls, as was the fact that the empowerment of women was at the core of the Office's alternative development programmes. 159. Particular emphasis was placed on Goal 6 (\"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanita tion for all\"), Goal 8 (\"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\") and Goal 10 (\"Reduce inequality within and among countries\"), and on the Office's activities in assisting Member States in reducing illicit financial flows, which contributed to achieving Goal 10, including, in particular, target 10.b (\"Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is gre atest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programmes\"). Activities contributing to the implementation of Goal 15 (\"Prot ect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\") were mentioned as well. 160. Of particular relevance to the work of the Co mmission on Narcotic Drugs, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and UNODC (which are based in Vienna) in the 2030 Agenda was the inclusion of Goal 16 (\"Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels\"). Whereas traditional development interventions were focused on vulnerability, the inclusion of Goal 16 acknowledged the need to also deal with the root causes o f this vulnerability, as impunity, lawlessness and other problems create opportunities for exploitation of the vulnerable. In this regard Goal 17 (\"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development\") w as also important, since improved policy coherence and increased multi -stakeholder partnerships were one of the key elements of the 2030 Agenda, within the respective mandates of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 161. It was stressed that the Sustainable Development Goals provided a unique opportunity to enhance cooperation within the United Nations system. The efforts by the Economic and Social Council to coordinate and harmonize the work of the United Nations system were welcomed. It was also stated that, while the Commission played a leading role as the central policymaking body within the United Nations system dealing with drug -related matters, other entities, such as WHO, the Joint United Nations Pr ogramme on HIV/AIDS and the United Nations E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 86 Development Programme, played important roles in formulating drug policy, and the preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016 had shown that there was a need for increased coordination of the public health and justice sectors. It was suggested that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs should work to develop new and creative ways to involve other United Nations bodies in its work through expert panels, briefi ngs to the Commission or side events. It was further proposed that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, together with the International Narcotics Control Board and UNODC, should help Member States to implement the Sustainable Development Goals in the areas of public health, criminal justice and law enforcement, consistent with their obligations under the drug control treaties. It was noted that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice should also be involved in these efforts, given, inter alia, the links between drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and money -laundering. It was also noted that the Office's expertise should be fully and appropriately utilized in programmes focused on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and that the Office should help Member States and other United Nations agencies to monitor and evaluate progress made in achieving Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and develop evidence - based responses to drugs and crime. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 87 Chapter VII I Provisional agenda for the sixtieth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs 162. At its 11th and 12th meeting s, on 22 March 2015, the Commission considered agenda item 10, entitled \"Provisional agenda for the sixtieth session of the Commission\". For its c onsideration of the item, the Commission had before it a draft decision entitled \"Report of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on its fifty - ninth session and provisional agenda for its sixtieth session\" (E/CN.7/2016/L.15). 163. Statements were made by the represe ntatives of Mexico, United States of America, Austria, Guatemala and China. A. Deliberations 164. Speakers expressed their views on the contents of the draft agenda for the sixtieth session of the Commission. B. Action taken by the Commission 165.

At its 12th meeting, on 22 March 201 6, the Commission considered agenda item 1 1, entitled \"Other business\". No issues were raised under this item. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 89 Chapter X Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifty-ninth session 167. At its 12th meeting, on 22 March 201 6, the Commission considered agenda item 1 2, entitled \"Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifty-ninth session \". The Rapporteur introduced the draft report (E/CN.7/201 6/L.1 and Add.1 -6). 168. At the same meeting, the Commission adopted the report on its fifty-ninth session, as orally amended. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 90 Chapter X Organization of the session and administrative matters A. Opening and duration of the session 169. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs held its fifty -ninth session, including the special segment on preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016, in Vienna from 14 to 22 March 2016. The Chair of the Commission opened the session. A statement was made by the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). A statement was also made by the President of the International Narcotics Control Board. 170. Opening statements, including o n issues relating to the preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016, were also made by the representative of the Sudan (on behalf of the Group of African States), the representative of Pakista n (on behalf of the Group of Asia -Pacific States) and the representative of the Netherlands (on behalf of the European Union and its Member States, as well as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Montenegro, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, the forme r Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, San Marino and Ukraine). 171. The Commission held a total of 12 plenary meetings, including 5 meetings of the special segment, and 7 meetings of the Committee of the Whole. B. Attendance 172. The session was attended by repres entatives of 51 States members of the Commission (2 were not represented). Also attending were observers for 80 other States Members of the United Nations, as well as non -member States, representatives of organizations of the United Nations system and obse rvers for intergovernmental, non -governmental and other organizations. A list of participants is contained in document E/CN.7/2016/INF/2 /Rev.2 C. Election of officers 173. In section I of its resolution 1999/30, the Economic and Social Council decided that, with effect from the year 2000, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs should, at the end of each session, elect its Bureau for the subsequent session and encourage it to play an active role in the preparations for the regular as well as the intersessional meetings of the Commission, so as to enable the Commission to provide continuous and effective policy guidance to the drug programme of UNODC. Pursuant to rule 16 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Council, the officers of the Commission hold office until their successors are elected, and are eligible for re -election. E/201 6/28 E/CN.7/201 6/16 91 174. In the light of that decision and in accordance with rule 15 of the rules of proce dure of the functional commissions of the Council, the Commission, after the closing of its reconvened fifty -eighth session, on 11 December 2015, opened its fifty-ninth session for the sole purpose of electing its Bureau for that session. At that meeting, during the consideration of item 1, the Commission elected the Chair, three Vice -Chairs and the Rapporteur. In accordance with Council resolution 1991/39 and established practice, a group composed of the chairs of the five regional groups, the Chair of the Group of 77 and China and the representative of or observer for the State holding the Presidency of the European Union assists the Chair of the Commission in dealing with organizational matters. That group, together with the officers, constitutes the exte nded Bureau foreseen in Economic and Social Council resolution 1991/39. 175. On 25 February 2016, the Group of Asia -Pacific States informed the Chair that Yong Il Lee of the Republic of Korea could no longer serve as the Rapporteur of the Commission. On 9 March 2016, the Group of Asia -Pacific States nominated Indra Rosandry for the office of Rapporteur. At its 1st meeting, on 14 March 2016, the Commission elected the Rapporteur. 176. The officers of the Commission at its fifty -ninth session were as follows: Office Region Officer Chair Eastern European States Vladimir Galuka (Czech Republic) First Vice -Chair Western European and other States Bente Angell -Hansen (Norway) Second Vice -Chair Latin American and Caribbean States Evandro de Sampaio Didonet (Brazil) Third Vice -Chair African (Nigeria) Rapporteur Asia -Pacific States Indra Rosandry (Indonesia) 177. During the fifty -ninth session of the Commission, the extended Bureau met on 17 March and 21 March 2016 to consider matters related to the organization of work. 178. At its reconvened fifty -seventh session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs adopted decision 57/2, entitled \"Preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016\".
