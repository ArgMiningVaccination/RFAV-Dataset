The planned studies include a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2 study of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in solid tumors and an open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eribulin in combination with pembrolizumab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Eisai and Merck will establish a Joint Development Committee to oversee clinical development activities. The studies are expected to begin in the second half of 2015. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. \"This collaboration could be a major step in the direction of developing combination regimens in different types of cancer, potentially maximizing the value of eribulin and lenvatinib,\" said Kenichi Nomoto, PhD, president, oncology product creation unit, Eisai Product Creation Systems. \"Together, Eisai and Merck seek to explore combination regimens that have the potential to create synergistic effects between lenvatinib and pembrolizumab as well as between eribulin and pembrolizumab. Our hope is that we will bring treatments to market that make a difference in the lives of people battling cancer.\" \"Cancer is a complex disease that often requires different approaches to help patients achieve the best possible outcome,\" said Dr. Eric Rubin, therapeutic area head, oncology early-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. \"The collaboration with Eisai exemplifies Merck's focus on advancing breakthrough science in immuno-oncology. We look forward to evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with eribulin and also with lenvatinib in different tumor types.\" The combinations of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, and eribulin and pembrolizumab, are investigational. The efficacy and safety of these combinations have not been established. About LENVIMA (lenvatinib mesylate) LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is an oral molecular targeted agent that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs (including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFR; KIT; and RET) involved in tumor proliferation. In particular, LENVIMA possesses a new binding mode (Type V) to VEGFR2, as confirmed through X-ray crystal structural analysis, and exhibits rapid and potent inhibition of kinase activity, according to kinetic analysis. LENVIMA was approved on February 13, 2015 and launched on February 26, 2015 for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in the United States, and is currently undergoing regulatory review for this indication in Japan, the EU, Switzerland, South Korea, Canada, Singapore, Russia, Australia and Brazil. Meanwhile, Eisai is currently conducting studies clinical studies of LENVIMA in several types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (Phase III), renal cell carcinoma (Phase II), non-small cell lung cancer (Phase II) and endometrial cancer (Phase II). Furthermore, lenvatinib has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in Japan (for thyroid cancer), the United States (for the treatment of follicular, medullary, anaplastic, and metastatic or locally advanced papillary thyroid cancer), and Europe (for follicular and papillary thyroid About halichondrin class microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mechanism of action, belongs to a class of antineoplastic agents, the halichondrins, which are natural products isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. It is believed to work by inhibiting the growth phase of microtubule dynamics without affecting the shortening phase and sequestering tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. HALAVEN was first approved as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer in the United States in November 2010, and is now approved in nearly 60 countries worldwide, including Japan and countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia. In the United States, HALAVEN Injection is indicated for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. In Japan, HALAVEN has been approved to treat inoperable or recurrent breast cancer and was launched in the country in July 2011. Since June 2014, Eisai has been obtaining approval in countries in Europe and Asia for the indication expansion of HALAVEN to contribute to earlier treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting, unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. In addition, HALAVEN has been designated as an orphan drug for soft-tissue sarcoma in the United States and Japan. About KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. KEYTRUDA is indicated in the United States at a dose of 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Merck is advancing a broad and fast-growing clinical development program for KEYTRUDA with more than 70 clinical trials - across more than 30 tumor types and over 8,000 patients - both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies.
