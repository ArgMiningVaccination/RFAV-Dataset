[Acid Reflux](#acid-reflux) in Dogs](#motionsickness-dogs) Contraction Disease)](#myoclonus) Air (Pork in Consider When Boarding Your Dog](#boarding-dogs) Acid Reflux Gastroesophageal reflux (acid reflux), is a relatively common ailment in dogs. It occurs when gastric fluids flow backward from the stomach into the esophagus, which is not covered by a protective lining like the stomach. This causes damage to the esophageal lining and inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis). Causes Acid reflux occurs when the muscular opening at the base of the esophagus, the sphincter, is weak or damaged. This malfunctioning valve then allows stomach acid, bile, pepson and other gastrointestinal fluids to come in contact with esophageal lining. The sphincter may relax improperly after an animal has undergone anesthesia or been recumbent during surgery. Chronic vomiting can weakin the sphincter, example if a dog is experiencing long-term vomiting as a result of another condition is often considered at rish for developing acid reflux. A hiatal hernia, a cogenital condition that causes the stomach to sit farther forward than normal, can also be the blame. In addition, acid reflux can occur after a dog as eaten a high-fat meal. In general, younger dogs seems to be at a higher risk of developing acid reflux than older dogs. This is likely because young dogs' esophageal sphincters are underdeveloped. Obesity is also considered a risk factor for developing acid reflux. Symptoms - Gagging - Vomiting - Drooling - Loss of appetite resulting in weight loss - Visible signs of pain - Whining or vocalizing pain while swallowing - Discomfort - Stress; pacing or flatulence - Fever (severe cases) Diagnosis Your Veterinarian will most likely perform a esophagoscopy to diagnose a case of acid reflux. This consists of putting the dog under anesthesia and inserting an endoscope into the esophagus to view the esophageal lininng. If the ulceration and inflammation typical of acid reflux is found, diagnosis is confirmed. Treatment In most cases, hospitalization is not required. A low-fat easily digestible diet recommended by a veterinarian will need to be implemented, along with possible portion size and meal schedule modifications as advised by a veterinarian. Medications may be prescribed to your dog. Antacids can help lower the acidity of gastrointestinal fluids and prevent further esophegeal damage. Other medication strengthen the esophageal sphincter and help the stomach contents to move through the intestines. Prevention Feeding your dog a well-balanced diet can prevent the condistion in many cases. Obesity is another risk factor. so keeping a pet at a healthy weight with a proper diet and exercise is also key. High-fat foods make acid refulx worse. Allergies in Dogs Just like us, our canine companions can suffer from allergies. Allergies occur when a dog's immune system mistakenly recognizes certain substances as intrusive and dangerous. In dogs, the most common types of allergic reactions are from inhaled substances and ingredients in food. Causes Multiple substances can cause allergies in dogs. Inhaled substances, including pollen, dirt, dust, mold, dander, smoke, chemical sprays, air fresheners, and even perfumes. A chemical in flea saliva can also cause reactions. Those are known as flea allergies. Ingredients in dog food such as pork, lamb, soy, beef, or chicken can also cause a dog's system to react adversely. Symptoms - Intense Itching - Scratching - Licking - Red, runny eyes - Inflamed skin - Snoring noises causes by an irritated throat - Sneezing - Chewing at paws - Vomiting and Diarrhea (especially in a food allergy) - Bald patches - Hair Loss - Scabs Treatment Most often simply removing the allergen source from your dog's environment is an easy and effective way to control the problem. If the substance your dog is reacting to is in the air, take steps to eliminate it by dusting your home, using air filters, vacuuming on a daily basis, and bathing your dog with prescription shampoo. Put your dog on flea treatment and preventative to prevent flea bites. If the allergy is coming from your dog's food, you'll need to implement a food trial with the help of your veterinarian. Involves trying out different foods to determine what your dog reacts to. Then, you will be able to choose a diet without the offending ingredient. Another way to treat canine allergies is with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Antihistamines block histamines (agents that cause itching) from being produced by your dog's immune system. Corticosteroids suppress your dog's response to the allergen. A third option involves desensitizing a dog to an allergen over time. First, the offending allergen will need to be identified. Next, mixtures of this allergen will be made and injected into your dog at various intervals. Over a period of time. your dog's system will learn not to react as severely to the substance, in return controlling the allergy symptoms. If you suspect your dog may be suffering from allergies, let your veterinarian know right away. Working together, you will be able to determine what your dog is reacting to and how to most effectively treat the allergy. Amphetamine Poisoning in Dogs Amphetamines are a type of medication used to treat a variety of human conditions. They are prescribed for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients, weight loss, uncontrollable sleep (narcolepsy), and more. Of course, some amphetamines are also illegal drugs, like methamphetamine and ecstasy. If a dog ingests any amphetamine product, toxicity can occur. Cause Accidental ingestion of amphetamine products is almost always the cause of amphetamine poisoning. Thanks to dogs' non-discriminatory tastes, they are most likely house pets that have ingested pills left on countertops or the floor. Amphetamines are designed to stimulate the release of norepinephrine in the body. Norepinephrine stimulates the central nervous system, leading to the symptoms associated with amphetamine toxicity. Symptoms - Hyperactivity - Restlessness - Muscle tremors and seizures - Increased heart rate - Raised blood pressure - Dilated pupils - Drooling - Vomiting - Diarrhea **Without treatment, death can occur. Diagnosis Along with a health history including any possible exposure to amphetamine products, a veterinarian will test blood or stomach contents for the presence of amphetamines. However, results may take a while. In the meantime, treatment for amphetamine poisoning will need to be initiated. Treatment A veterinarian may induce vomiting or perform a stomach lavage to rid a dog's body of the amphetamine toxin. Activated charcoal may also be given to slow the body's absorption of the toxic material. IV fluids, drugs to control seizures, and medications to lessen the central nervous system stimulation will be administered. Blood pressure, body temperature, and other vital signs will need to be monitored until the episode is resolved. Prevention Pet owners can prevent this by restricting all pets' access to any prescription amphetamines. Take care not to leave pill bottles out on countertops or tables where pets could easily reach them. Never purposely give amphetamine products to a pet. Anal Gland Problems Dogs have anal glands (sacs) positioned on either side of the anus that releases a liquid substance onto fecal matter. It's not uncommon for these sacs to become irritated, causing your dog discomfort. Anal Gland Function You may be wondering what exactly anal glands do. In healthy dogs, the sacs produce a thick, brown, foul-smelling liquid. This liquid gets deposited onto bowel movements when your dog defecates. Experts believe dogs have developed this evolutionary trait as a way of scent-marking their territory. When dogs smell one another's fecal matter, they're able to know who has been in whose territory. Anal Gland Discomfort It's not uncommon for the draining ducts of each anal sac to become clogged with the gland substance. As a result, the gland becomes engorged and causes irritation. Most times, you will see a dog try to relieve this discomfort by dragging their hindquarters along the ground, or by chewing and licking at the anal area. This is often mistaken to mean that the dog has worms-while this is possible, anal gland enlargement is actually much more likely. One good thing is that it's not difficult to have anal gland build-up relieved. If you see your dog exhibiting the above symptoms for more than a day or two, let your vet know. Your veterinarian or veterinary technicians will be able to release the gland pressure. Most often this is achieved by gently squeezing the anal gland to squirt out the liquid while simultaneously performing a rectal exam. In fact, this is often performed as a regular part of a dog's grooming appointment. While anal gland enlargement is relatively common and easy to treat, more rare problems like infection of the anal glands can also occur. In these cases, antibiotics, abscess draining, or even surgical procedures may be necessary. Preventing Anal Gland Problems While there is no effective way to completely prevent anal gland problems, recognizing the symptoms and acting early is the best way to avoid any complications. For unknown reasons, some dogs seem to be more prone to anal gland issues than others. Surgery to remove the anal glands entirely may be beneficial for these pets. It is not recommended for every dog, but some can live a better life after such a procedure. Arsenic Toxicity Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid that is used in various commercial products. Dogs, like other animals and humans, can suffer from its toxic effects. Than to dogs' general indiscriminate tastes, they are at a heightened risk of ingesting products containing this deadly compound. Cause Arsenic poisoning can occur when a dog ingests any type of product containing arsenic. Common sources include herbicides, insecticides and certain treated wood products.Some private water wells have higher than normal concentrations of arsenic as well, it may be possible for dogs or other animals to be poisoned if they drink too much. Some parasite treatments, such as injectable medications for heartworm, contain low levels of arsenic tht help to kill off parasites and their larvae. In normal dosages, the levels of arsenic in these drugs won't harm a dog, But overdosing can lead to toxicity. It is important to note that arsenic is only used in injections made to treat a pet that already has heartworms; arsenic is not present in monthly preventatives. Symptoms Symptoms of this poisoning usually develop quickly (within a few hours of ingestion) and severely. - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Gastrointestinal discomfort - Lethargy - Blood in the feces - Dehydration - Depression Without treatment, a pet may go into shock and die. Diagnosis A thorough laboratory work-up, including a blood count, blood chemistry profile, and urinalysis will be performed. A sample of stomach contents may also be taken. If arsenic is found in the blood or stomach contents, toxicity is confirmed. A health history is also very useful in a case of arsenic poisoning. Pet owners should let their vet know about any recent exposure to arsenic-containing products that their pet may have had or about any parasite medications they have taken recently. Treatment Arsenic poisoning is an emergency and should be dealt with immediately. A vet will induce vomiting to rid the body of the poisonous substance or perform gastric lavage (stomach wash). Medications to slow absorption of the poison will be administered, and drugs may be given to promote excretion from the body. Fluid therapy may also be needed to help flush out the poison and combat dehydration. In severe cases, a dog may have to undergo dialysis to prevent kidney failure. Prevention Cases of arsenic poisoning are less and less common as more companies move away from using the substance in their products, but prevention is still the best way to protect pets. Pet owners should remove all sources of arsenic from a dog's environment and carefully follow the safety guidelines listed on any arsenic-containing products for handling and storage. Dogs should not be given more than the required dose of any medication containing arsenic or other potentially poisonous substances. If a dosage is missed, \"doubling up\" on the next dose is never appropriate. Instead, a vet should be notified before the medication is given again. Bloat (GDV) Bloat also known as Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus, GDV, or Gastric Torsion, is a life-threatening disorder that most commonly occurs in large, deep-chested breeds like the Doberman, Great Dane, Boxer, Saint Bernard, Basset Hound, German shepherd or a Weimaraner. Although it can occur in smaller breeds, these cases are very rare. Since up to a third of dogs diagnosed with GDV won't survive, it's very important to know the causes and symptoms in order to get your dog prompt veterinary care in the event of an episode of bloat. Causes Bloat occurs when gas can't escape the stomach, leading to a distended abdomen. The stomach's normal contractions will stop and the entire stomach organ will rotate inside your dog's abdomen. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply at each end of the stomach, while pressure is simultaneously put on the diaphragm, causing breathing difficulties. It's also possible for heart failure and blood flow to be affected due to the restriction of the arteries in your dog's abdomen. If left untreated, bloat will lead to shock and eventually death. Although there are many different causes, bloat is often associated with over-eating or gulping of food. It can also occur when a dog is vigorously exercised right after eating a meal. Symptoms - Painful abdomen - Obvious signs of distress - Salivation - Retching - Gasping for breath - Weakness - Pale gums - Rapid heartbeat - Collapse Treatment Your Veterinarian will treat your dog with oxygen supplementation, IV fluids, analgesics, and other emergency measures as necessary. In many cases, a tube is inserted down the esophagus to try to decompress the stomach and relieve pressure. Surgery is almost always required to correct a twisted stomach. To prevent the stomach from twisting again in the future, it is recommended that your dog's stomach be surgically attached to the side of the abdominal cavity. This is known as prophylactic gastropexy surgery and is helpful for many high-risk breeds. Prevention Dogs who only eat one meal a day are more likely to gobble up food ravenously. Feed your dog several small meals per day to avoid this problem. If your dog still gulps food, try special bowls or timed feeders that only allow a small amount of food to be accessible at a time. Keep your dog at a healthy weight and don't let your dog over-exercise immediately after meals. Brachycephalic Dog Breeds Brachycephalic dog breeds are those with short, \"pushed in\" noses and bulging eyes. The group includes the Pug, Bulldog, Pekingese, Boston terrier, Boxer, Shih Tzu, and others. Because of their unique head and jaw configuration, these breeds are especially prone to certain health concerns. Brachycephalic Respiratory Syndrome Brachycephalic Respiratory Syndrome affects various parts of these dog breeds' respiratory tracts. Dogs may only suffer from a few of the aspects associated with Brachycephalic Syndrome, or they may suffer from several at the same time. Narrowed nostrils, medically known as stenotic nares, can cause difficulty breathing. Many brachycephalic dogs also have an elongated soft palate and everted laryngeal saccules, causing heavy snorting and snoring. In addition, tracheal hypoplasia, or narrowing of the windpipe, can further exacerbate breathing problems and be very dangerous. All of these problems combine to make normal respiratory function much more difficult for brachycephalic breeds. These dogs also pant inefficiently and are at risk for airway inflammation and overheating. In some cases, surgeries can help to correct the issues. Help keep your brachycephalic dog safe by not letting them overexert themselves, especially in hot weather. Since obesity will only exacerbate the problems associated with these breeds, take steps to keep your dog at a healthy weight. Instead of a standard collar and leash, which can restrict the airways even further, use a specialized harness for your brachycephalic breed. Eye Issues Since the nasal bones are compacted in brachycephalic breeds, these dogs also tend to have eye problems. A severe blow to the back of the head or a sharp tug on a leash when the dog is wearing a collar can actually cause an eye to pop from the socket, requiring surgical correction. Sometimes, a brachycephalic dog's eyelid can't cover the eye completely. This leads to dry eye and irritation, Abnormal tear drainage and eyelashes rubbing against the eye are other common problems; surgery may be needed for correction. Dental Concerns Dogs have 42 teeth in their mouths. In brachycephalic breeds, those 42 teeth have far less space to fit into. This can lead to problems with crowding, teeth growing in at angles, food trapping, and periodontal disease. Be sure to keep up good dental care at home and visit your vet for regular dental check-ups. Other Issues Since brachycephalic breeds tend to have many skin folds on their bodies, skin fold infections are common, especially around the face. Pregnancy is another tricky aspect of these breeds; often time a C-section is required for a safe birth. In addition, breeding brachycephalic dogs can be complicated and should be left to professionals. Because of the specific health concerns and care requirements of brachycephalic dogs, people who own these breeds should maintain a close relationship with their veterinarian and schedule regular office visits. Call your vet if you have any questions about the care of your brachycephalic breed. Canine Arthritis Arthritis is a fairly common condition in dogs, especially larger breeds and dogs that are overweight. It's characterized by an inflammation of the joints, which causes pain, lameness, reluctance to move, and more. This article will discuss the types of arthritis, symptoms that you may notice and how to manage and prevent the condition. Types of Arthritis The most common form of canine arthritis is osteoarthritis, which occurs in the hips, shoulders, elbows, knees, or vertebral column. It can be considered either primary or secondary; secondary osteoarthritis develops as a result of some other condition, like hip dysplasia, trauma, or ligament issues. Rheumatoid arthritis is triggered by your pet's own immune system and can cause severe bone and cartilage deterioration. For some dogs, blood tests can help diagnose the condition. Septic or infective arthritis is another type of disorder. It's caused by the invasion of bacteria, fungi, or viruses into the affected area. Typically, septic arthritis only affects one joint. Symptoms - Reluctance to stand up, walk, run or move normally - Lethargy - Loss of appetite Let your vet know immediately if you see these symptoms. First, your vet will rule out other problems-ligament tears, disc problems, nerve damage, etc.-using X-rays. If a diagnosis of arthritis is reached, you and your vet will work together to bring your dog comfort and relief. Treating Arthritis While arthritis can't be cured, it can be successfully managed. Osteoarthritis is usually treated with analgesic medications. Your very will probably need to see your dog regularly to monitor the condition of these drugs. Rheumatoid arthritis is often treated with corticosteroids and infective or septic arthritis conditions can be managed with antibiotics. Certain therapies can also offer relief for many dogs. Water therapy, massage therapy, and electrical therapy are only a few examples of treatments that may help. Consult with your vet for more information on physical therapy for dogs. Preventing the Condition By taking precautions, you can reduce the likelihood that your dog will develop painful and debilitating arthritis. Since obesity is the single leading cause of arthritis in dogs, take steps to keep your pet at a healthy weight-exercise your dog regularly and feed a well-balanced diet. Supplements that promote joint health, like glucosamine and chondroitin, may also help. Ask your vet about specific diets and supplementation to reduce the risk of arthritis in your dog. Canine Asthma Canine Asthma or allergic bronchitis is a respiratory disorder in which the upper airways spasm and constrict, leading to difficulty breathing and other symptoms. As the name suggests, allergic bronchitis is caused by a reaction to something a dog inhales from the environment. Causes of Asthma When dogs breathe in an allergen, their respiratory system responds to it adversely, causing the symptoms associated with asthma. For dogs, common allergens include pollen, grass and weeds, dander from other animals, smoke, perfumes, cleaning chemicals, air pollution, fertilizer, paints, and even air fresheners. Symptoms of Asthma - Respiratory difficulties- wheezing, coughing, struggling to take a breath. - Open-mouthed breathing - General weakness - Lack of appetite with concurrent weight loss - Reluctance to perform physical activity - Gums may turn pale blue (severe)- starved for oxygen and need emergency veterinary attention immediately. Diagnosing Asthma A diagnosis of canine asthma will be reached by physically observing symptoms and ruling out other possible causes of coughing or shortness of breath, such as heartworms. Radiographs of the lungs, parasite tests, an echocardiogram to evaluate heart health, and examination of the trachea and respiratory system may also be in order. Treating Asthma Treating canine asthma will involve identifying the offending allergen. Once the vet and pet owner know what is causing a dog's reaction, steps can be taken to remove the allergen from the dog's environment or have the dog avoid the substance. Of course, it is not always possible to identify the exact allergen causing a dog's symptoms. In these cases, medications can be prescribed to help. Bronchodilators and glucocorticoids can help lessen inflammation and prevent attacks, and cough suppressants are sometimes prescribed to fight persistent coughs. Preventing Asthma Attacks Prevention is easy when the allergen causing a dog's symptoms is known. This way, the dog can avoid it whenever possible. Otherwise, the aforementioned medications will need to be kept on hand to use in the event of an attack. Some dogs even have a specialized inhaler that fits the muzzle; these devices quickly administer anti-inflammatory medications to open a dog's airways and lessen the severity of asthma attacks. Canine Brucellosis Brucellosis is a bacterial Infection caused by various strains of the Brucella bacteria. The most common to infect dogs is Brucella canis. The bacteria can be transmitted to people, although this is rare and isn't likely to cause serious symptoms in a healthy human being. Infection and Transmission Brucellosis is very contagious. It is most often transmitted between dogs during breeding, but it can also be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids like urine, saliva, and blood. Puppies can become infected in the womb or while nursing. Since variations of Brucella are common in livestock, dogs who are kept around livestock animals are at the highest risk. Unless conditions are ideal, the Brucella canis bacteria will have trouble surviving in the environment outside of a host. It's easily killed with common disinfectants like bleach. Symptoms - Female Dogs- inability to conceive and late-term fetal abortions - Male Dogs- rendered infertile and experienced testicular swelling. - Paralysis of the rear legs - Back pain - Lethargy - Eye inflammation - Lymph node enlargement - Kidney inflammation Treatment Brucellosis can be difficult to treat because the bacteria infect multiple body tissues. An infected dog should be removed from any breeding program and be spayed or neutered. Combinations of antibiotics may help to rid the body of the bacteria, but Brucellosis tends to be very resilient. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics like doxycycline, tetracycline, or minocycline, among other medicines to treat your dog. The full courses of these antibiotics may take several weeks or months to complete. Dogs treated with antibiotics are at risk for eventual reinfection. Prevention There isn't a vaccine to protect against Brucellosis, but regular screening is effective for catching the disease early and keeping dog populations healthy. Isolation of infected animals is also key, and the environment of an infected dog should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before any dog is reintroduced to the area. Canine Coronavirus (CCV) The canine coronavirus is an intestinal disease of dogs. While typically a mild disease with minimal or nonexistent symptoms, coronavirus is most dangerous when it is diagnosed concurrently with another disease, like the canine parvovirus. Transmission and Contraction Canine coronavirus is highly contagious. It is commonly spread through infected fecal matter since the viral strands are resilient and can be shed in the feces for up to six months after initial contraction. Dogs get the virus by coming into contact with contaminated feces or materials contaminated by the feces. Several factors are thought to make the contraction of CCV more likely. The overall health of a dog, stress, environmental factors including sanitation and crowdedness, vaccination status, and more can all play a role. Symptoms - Symptoms are variable, many adults dogs don't show any symptoms at all - Sporadic vomiting or diarrhea - Mild respiratory difficulty - Low-grade fever - Minor weight loss Puppies are at the greatest risk of serious harm from CCV and concurrent infections. Diarrhea and accompanying dehydration will affect puppies much faster than adult dogs, and dangerous inflammation of the intestines (enteritis) can also occur. Deather has even been reported in puppies with CCV and accompanying infections. Diagnosis There is no specific test for the canine coronavirus, so diagnosis will involve eliminating other possible causes of symptoms, taking a patient's health and vaccination history, and relying on certain laboratory tests like antibody analysis or microscopic examination of viral particles. Treatment Many times, adult dogs won't need treatment at all and can recover from a CCV infection on their own. Again, puppies will need the highest level of supportive care. If enteritis is present, antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed. In cases of dehydration, IV fluids and electrolyte replacement may be necessary. Supportive care at home is usually sufficient to help a dog recover from CCV infection. Prevention There is a vaccine available again CCV. In some instances, it is included in a puppy's core batch of vaccinations. However, some veterinarians only recommend it for show dogs or dogs who live in large groups. Dogs that are recovering from CCV can still shed the virus in feces, potentially infecting other dogs. Pet owners who keep multiple dogs should keep the infected animal isolated from other dogs until the infection is completely eliminated. The coronavirus itself can be removed from the environment with a diluted bleach solution. Keeping a dog away from other dogs' fecal matter whenever possible is a good preventative measure against the canine coronavirus and other contagious diseases. Canine Dental Care Dental disorders are some of the most common health maladies that vets treat in dogs-in fact, over 75% of dogs three years of age or older come down with some kind of dental problem. Did you know that dental disease is highly preventable? Most dental issues can be avoided entirely with good preventative healthcare. Canine Dental Diseases The most common canine dental disease is periodontitis, which occurs when plaque-a mixture of food, saliva, and bacteria-hardens on your dogs' teeth and becomes tartar. The substance then irritates the gum around the tooth, causing reddened gums (gingivitis), bleeding, tooth loss, and bad breath. If bacteria gets into bleeding gums, it can enter the bloodstream and damage your dog's heart or kidneys. Broken or fractured teeth are also common in dogs, especially those who tend to chew on hard objects. Broke or bleeding teeth will require veterinary attention right away. Professional Dental Care Your dog's teeth and gums will be checked out by your vet every time your dog has a regularly-scheduled examination. Most dogs benefit from dental exams at least twice a year. Professional dental cleaning is also necessary once in a while. If your vet discovers gingivitis, tater accumulation, or other problems, they will probably recommend a cleaning. Your dog will have to go under anesthesia for the procedure, during which all tooth surfaces are carefully cleaned with special instruments to prevent the formation of plaque and tart. Fluoride and other preventative measures may also be part of your dog's professional cleaning. Brushing Your Dog's Teeth By starting slowly and having your dog associate positivity with tooth brushing, you can clean your dog's teeth from the comfort of your own home. Start by massaging your dog's teeth and gums gently with your finger. You may want to try dipping your finger in broth to make it more palatable and entice your dog to accept the sensation. Over a period of weeks, you can introduce a dog-specific toothbrush with specially-formulated pet toothpaste to gently clean the outside tooth surfaces. Never use human toothpaste, as it can cause irritation and upset your dog's stomach if they swallow it. Since plaque begins developing mere hours after a brushing session, most vets recommend daily brushing for your dog. Ask your vet for further advice regarding the products and procedures to use. Toys, Treats, Diet Keep in mind that your dog's diet has a lot to do with his or her oral health. Some dogs even benefit from specially-formulated dental diets, so ask your bet about these options. Chew toys are also important for scraping off plaque and tartar and some dog treats can even help slow the formation of these substances. Canine Disc Disease Canine disc disease occurs in the vertebral discs of the spine, which help cushion the spinal column. These discs are also found in humans-in fact, we can suffer from disc disease as well. In dogs, disc disease is fairly common in certain breeds and in older animals. Causes For certain dog breeds with long backs, like Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, and Cocker Spaniels, disc disease is especially likely. Older dogs are also prone to the disorder, simply because the discs in the back can wear down as a pet age. Some cases of disc disease occur as a result of physical trauma, such as a fall, a misplaced jump, run-ins with cars, or even rough play antics. The disk material can become displaced, pressing painfully on the spinal cord. In any pet, obesity can be a contributing factor to disc disease. This is because the extra weight puts further pressure on the back, exacerbating the condition and causing more pain. Symptoms Symptoms of disc disease may vary depending on what disc is affected. If a disc closer to the rear end is affected, dogs may lose motor control of the back legs and potentially even the bowel and bladder. If the disc in question is located in the upper back or lower neck area, a dog might not be able to hold his head up. In just about all cases of disc disease, a dog will be visibly weakened and lethargic. Most dogs will be reluctant to move or jump and may exhibit obvious signs of pain. Severe cases of disc disease can even lead to paralysis. Treatment Your vet will need to take x-rays of your dog's back to assess the health of the discs and vertebral column. Disc disease can be treated and managed with pain medications, anti-inflammatory medicines, and muscle relaxers. A combination of all three may be prescribed. Physical activity will probably need to be restricted or more tightly managed. Physical therapy, including water3 therapy, massage, and other techniques, can also be beneficial for some dogs. Dogs with more serious disc disease may need to see a specialist for a CT scan, MRI, or surgery. If your pet is overweight, you'll need to start your pet on a diet and exercise plan to reduce pressure on the discs. Your vet will help you choose a specialized diet for your dog and give you recommendations on safe exercise to get your dog's weight under control. Canine Influenza Canine influenza or dog flu originated in horses before developing into a form that infected dogs; the first case of canine influenza was confirmed in a racing grey house in 2004. It is a contagious respiratory illness that can be spread between dogs but cannot affect humans or other animals. Cause Canine Influenza is caused by a train of the influenza virus called H3N8. It is a mutation from the equine influenza virus. Due to its contagious nature, Canine influenza is of primary concern for dogs housed in large groups, such as those in breeding facilities and shelters. Symptoms The mortality rate of canine influenza is extremely low; less than one percent of infected dogs die from the virus. In fact, almost half of all dogs that contract the virus fight it off on their own as their immune systems create antibodies. - Dry cough - Loss of appetite - Fever - Lethargy - Secondary pneumonia In cases with pneumonia, canine influenza can prove fatal. Dogs with pre-existing lung or heart issues are at the highest risk for pneumonia. Treatment If caught and treated early, the prognosis for canine influenza is very good. Supportive therapy will be given, including IV fluids, electrolyte replacement, diuretic drugs, and antibodies. Some cases may only require a mild cough suppressant. Other symptoms or secondary infections will be treated as necessary. Prevention There is a vaccine against canine influenza. Although the vaccine doesn't entirely prevent a dog from catching the virus, it will significantly lessen the symptoms and shorten the time a dog suffers from the virus's effects. The vaccine can also help prevent the spread of canine influenza by reducing viral shedding. Generally, the dog flu vaccine is not included in the core vaccination series, but it may be administered to dogs at high risk. Dogs should receive the entire series of vaccinations at least a full week before entering a high-risk environment like a boarding facility or kennel. It may also be given to a dog who commonly goes to the groomer, attends group training classes, or regularly visits dog parks or doggie daycares. Canine Pancreatitis The pancreas is located along the base of a dog's stomach, right at the entrance to the small intestine. It produces digestive enzymes and insulin for your dog's body. In healthy dogs, these enzymes are activated after being released into the intestine, thereby allowing your dog to digest well. When the pancreas becomes inflamed (pancreatitis) the enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas, leading to \"digestion\" of the pancreatic tissue. This can be life-threatening and quite painful for your dog. Causes Pancreatitis is often triggered by a high-fat meal that has been ingested recently. If a dog consumes a large amount of fat from meat trimmings, a ham bone, or other fatty substances, pancreatitis can occur. Certain medications and chemotherapy agents can increase a dog's vulnerability to pancreatitis. Dogs with diabetes are predisposed to the condition as well. While any dog can suffer from pancreatitis, Miniature Schnauzers are the most common breed of dog to be diagnosed. Symptoms - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Loss of appetite - Fever - Visible signs of pain Your vet will obtain a diagnosis of pancreatitis using a blood test, physical exams, a chemistry profile, x-rays, and ultrasound. The Specific Canine Pancreatic Lipases Test, or spec CPL, detects the elevated enzymes in the pancreas to confirm the diagnosis. Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis Acute cases-usually, those triggered by recent ingestion of a fatty meal-are treated in a supportive manner using IV fluids, electrolytes, antibiotics, and nausea and pain medications. Since the pain can slow your dog's recovery by inhibiting the immune system response, pain management is very important in cases of pancreatitis. For dogs with chronic pancreatitis, a change in diet is usually warranted. Your veterinarian can prescribe a fat-restricted dog food and offer recommendations on exactly how to manage your dog's dietary needs moving forward. Canine Parvovirus Canine Parvovirus is one of the most serious diseases to affect dogs. It's most common in unvaccinated puppies, and certain breeds like Rottweilers and Doberman Pinschers seem to be more likely to contract the virus. Unfortunately, it's also highly contagious. How is Parvovirus Contracted? Parvovirus is spread through the droppings of infected dogs. Healthy dogs contract the virus when they eat or interact with other dogs' fecal matter. The virus is quite resilient and isn't easily killed by household disinfectants. It can even survive in the same environment for years at a time, potentially infecting other pets. Puppies born to unvaccinated mothers or who have not had their vaccinations themselves are at the highest risk for contracting Parvovirus. Dogs under stress, those who already have parasitics infections, and those who are already in poor health are also at risk. What are the Symptoms? Parvovirus weakens a dog's immune system by infecting the lymph system and bone marrow. It also destroys the intestinal lining, prohibiting the proper absorption of nutrients and water. The impaired intestinal lining can even allow bacteria to leak into the bloodstream, which can be potentially life-threatening. You may see symptoms like bloody diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, weakness, and fever. Excessive diarrhea and vomiting can lead to fatal dehydration. How is Parvovirus Diagnosed and Treated? Parvovirus will be diagnosed with a fecal sample and physical exam. Some vets may order a blood panel and parasite tests.w There isn't a treatment that kills the Canine Parvovirus, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and destroying any secondary infections. A dog's treatment regimen may include IV fluids to combat dehydration and electrolyte loss, medications for vomiting and diarrhea, and antibiotics. With prompt and proper treatment, nearly 90% of infected dogs recover fully. It's important to isolate infected dogs from any other dogs since Parvovirus is very contagious. Disinfect contaminated objects with a bleach solution. How Can Parvovirus be Prevented? Proper Vaccination will greatly reduce or entirely eliminate the chance of a dog contracting Parvovirus. Puppies get their first vaccines at six to eight weeks of age, receiving regular booster shots until 16 weeks of age. From there, dogs are given booster shots every one to three years The Canine Parvovirus is almost always included in a puppy's core vaccination batch. If your adult dog has never been vaccinated against Parvovirus, let your vet know right away. Unvaccinated dogs will receive one or two initial Parvovirus vaccinations, then are given booster shots for one to three years. Your vet can fill you in on the exact details of your dog's vaccination schedule. Caring For a Dog After Surgery Many dogs have to undergo surgery at one point or another in life. If your dog has just had a procedure performed, keep the following information in mind to ensure that your pet has a speedy and healthy recovery. Anesthesia In the case of most surgeries, a dog will undergo anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. After your pooch wakes, he or she isn't going to feel quite right for a day or so. Don't give food or water to a dog that seems groggy, as the anesthesia is probably already making your dog feel nauseous. Introduce a small amount of water when you think your dog is feeling a bit better, then gradually offer a small amount of food. Over the next few days, you can wean your dog back onto a normal feeding schedule. Environment For a day or two after the surgery, keep your dog in a quiet, warm area to allow for rest. Provide a comfortable, clean, dry pet bed and keep other pets out of the area. Monitoring Your Dog Check on your dog's surgical site daily. If you see any pus, discharge, bleeding, inflammation, or missing stitches, notify your vet right away. Swelling is common with many surgeries, but let your vet know if you think it is excessive. Keep bandages clean and dry, and change them as directed by your vet. Don't bathe your dog or allow swimming for at least a week. If you see your dog licking, scratching, or chewing at the incision, ask your vet for an Elizabeth collar so stitches don't get pulled out. Exercise Exercise should be restricted for a day or two after the surgery and greatly limited for the next week or so. Short walks are permissible unless your vet tells you otherwise. Don't let your dog play aggressively, jump or run-there's too great of a risk for swelling, stitches getting pulled, a delay in healing, and more. Medications If your dog has been prescribed medications for the postoperative period, follow all label instructions to the letter. If you're unsure about dosage or administration directions, don't hesitate to ask your vet. Also be sure to give your dog's medication for the full prescribed period, even if you think your dog is already better. Caring for Newborn Puppies Caring for newborn puppies can be one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences you'll ever undertake. It's not a decision to make lightly-a great deal of time, patience and attention will need to be given in order to make sure the puppies grow up healthy. If you decide to raise puppies from birth, though, one of the strongest bonds possible between a human and an animal will develop. Nest Newborn puppies are quite susceptible to body heat loss due to their underdeveloped coat of fur and lack of mobility. Make an artificial nest for the pups out of a padded box outfitted with several warm blankets. A heating pad on a low setting may be placed under half of the box, but never put underneath the entire box. Pups may not be able to move away from the heat source if they get too hot. Cleaning A quick cleaning with a damp cloth should be performed daily, and the genital area should be stimulated with the cloth after feeding. This will encourage the puppy to urinate and defecate. Full baths should be given only as needed and the puppy should be fully dried afterward. Use a milf puppy shampoo and warm water. Always make sure the water isn't cool to the point that puppies could become chilled, or hot enough to scald them. Mild dish soap, such as Dawn or Ivory, can be used if fleas are present. Diet Like us, dogs aren't born with the ability to eat solid foods. Ideally, a nursing mother dog-either the pup's biological parent or a stand-in female-can give the puppy colostrum which contains antibodies, protecting the puppy against disease until vaccinations can be given. Since colostrum is only present in a mother's milk 24 hours after birth and antibodies can only be absorbed by puppies for the first 18 hours of life, it's important to have puppies nurse from their biological mother or a surrogate during that time period. If your puppy is being nursed by a surrogate nursing mother, never leave the two alone together. If the surrogate rejects the puppy, she may kill it. Replacement milk formulas can be found at pet stores and your vet's office. Ask your vet to recommend a product that will suit your puppy. These formulas should be warmed slightly to body temperature, then delivered in a bottle. Always test the milk before giving it to a puppy, making sure it's not hot enough for possible scalding. Puppies should be fed every two to three hours during the daytime. They'll also probably need to be fed a few times through the night until about three to four weeks of age. After four weeks, you can start introducing solid foods, but soak the food in formula or water and mash it up before offering it to puppies. Veterinary Care Maintain a close relationship with your veterinarian while you're raising newborn puppies. Puppies are often born with intestinal parasites and may need deworming. Thanks to their underdeveloped immune systems, pups are also very susceptible to disease and should be kept indoors to prevent exposure. At six weeks of age, puppies should receive their first round of vaccinations. As a puppy gets older, they should be gaining weight and become very active. If you don't think your puppies are behaving the way they should call your vet right away. Cervical Spondylomyelopathy (Wobbler Syndrome) Cervical Spondylomyelopathy, commonly known as wobbler syndrome, is a neurological disorder that affects a dog's spine at the neck area. It is primarily a disease of large and giant breed dogs, only occurring very occasionally in small breeds. Dobermans and Great Danes are the most commonly diagnosed breeds, but Cervical Spondylomyelopathy can also occur in the Rottweiler, Irish wolfhound, Basset hound, Mastiff, German shepherds, others rarer and others. Cause The exact cause of Cervical Spondylomyelopathy isn't entirely understood, but the disorder is thought to have a genetic linkage. Some ecperts believe that certain nurtritional excesses or deficiencies may play a role as well. WHen Cervical Spondylomyelopathy occurs, spinal cord compression is the underlying cause of neurological symptoms. Compression of the vertebrae, spinal nerves, and/or nerve roots leads to pain and neurological problems associated with the disorder. Symptoms The name \"wobbler syndrome\" refers to the condition's primary symptoms: a wobbly, uneven, or abnormal gait that is usually seen in the hind limbs. Neck stiffness, pain, and general weakness are also possible. As the disease progresses, difficulty getting up from a lowered position, muscle wasting (atrophy), and partial or complete paralysis of all four limbs may occur. Diagnosis First, your vet will perform thorough physical and neurological examinations to determine the nature of the affected dog's condition. Other possible causes of symptoms (spinal cord diseases, bone disorders, tumors, etc) must be ruled out. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and other techniques will be used to definitively diagnose a case of wobble syndrome by visualizing spinal cord compression. Treatment Treatment of wobbler syndrome depends on the severity of the condition. For dogs with a mild form of the disorder, medical treatment may suffice. This will involve anti-inflammatory medications, activity restriction, and possible physical therapy. Dogs who are more severely affected will likely require surgery to correct the spinal cord compression. This can be accomplished with various types of surgeries, and the best option will be chosen based on the affected dog's overall health, the severity of the disease, the nature of symptoms, and other factors. Surgery to correct wobbler syndrome has a success rate of approximately 80%. Postoperatively, dogs will require restricted activity, physical therapy, and possible dietary modifications. Generally, the prognosis for dogs with wobbler syndrome is good with either surgical or medical treatment. It is possible, however, for the symptoms of wobbler syndrome to recur. In these cases, further treatment will be required. Chagas Disease Chagas Disease is caused by a protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, which can cause heart disease and other severe health concerns in dogs. The parasite is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans. Transmission and Contraction T. cruzi is transmitted through the bite of the reduviid insect, commonly known as the kissing bug or assassin bug. Dogs can also contract the parasite by eating infected tissue of certain wild animals-primarily raccoons and opossums-or via contaminated blood transfusions. In the United States, Chagas disease is found mostly in the southern half of the country, especially Texas, although it has been diagnosed in California, Virginia, and Maryland as well. The disease is also a concern in South and Central America, where it is more likely to be transmitted to humans. Symptoms The T. cruzi parasite can spread throughout the body through the blood, potentially causing symptoms shortly after contraction. However, some dogs enter an asymptomatic latency period, which can last for months or even years. Although symptoms don't appear during this time, the parasite spreads and develops, eventually causing heart failure. Aside from the latency stage of the condition, Chagas disease is categorized in two phases: acute and chronic. The acute phase usually occurs in younger dogs and is characterized by symptoms like lethargy, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. Chronic Chagas disease is represented by lethargy, possible fainting, increased heart rate, and congestive heart failure. Sudden death is possible if the disease progresses to this stage. Diagnosis In addition to a full laboratory work-up, serology tests will be administered if a dog is suspected of Chagas disease. These tests measure the body's antibody response to the parasite. In addition, X-rays and echocardiogram scans can show abnormalities of the heart muscle that may be associated with T. Cruz infestation. Treatment Unfortunately, there is no cure for Chagas disease. Treatment is symptomatic in nature and focuses on responding to heart failure and heart arrhythmias. Even dogs who do receive treatment may progress to the chronic phase of the condition, and death is the most likely outcome. At this time, studies to develop viable drug treatments for Chagas disease are ongoing. Chocolate Poisoning in Dogs Chocolate is one of the most common human foods to poison our pet dogs. Just like us, a dog will find the taste of chocolate to be quite enjoyable-however, it contains ingredients that can prove harmful or even deadly in high doses. Why is Chocolate Toxic? Chocolate of all types contains theobromine, a stimulant chemical that's similar to caffeine. Chocolate also does contain actual caffeine, although in much lower concentrations than theobromine. This chemical stimulates the central nervous system and heart, causes digestive upset, and increases blood pressure. Dark, baker's and unsweetened chocolates have the highest levels of theobromine and are therefore the most dangerous. Milk and white chocolate have lower concentrations of the stimulant but are still hazardous. Items with chocolate in them, like cookies or cakes, are also potentially poisonous. Symptoms of Chocolate Poisoning - Agitation - Excitement - Thirst - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Loss of coordination (severe) - Seizures (sever) Without treatment, an episode of chocolate poisoning can lead to come and even death. Smaller dogs are at even greater risk of chocolate poisoning, simply because it won't take as much of the hazardous chemicals to cause severe health complications. Treating Chocolate Poisoning If you've seen your dog consume chocolate, tell your vet the type and amount that's been swallowed. Your vet may induce vomiting or give your pet a special absorbent charcoal medication, which binds to the chocolate in your dog's intestines absorbents it from being absorbed. For dogs that have already absorbed the theobromine into their systems, IV fluids, an anti-seizure medicine, and heart medication may be helpful. Preventing Chocolate Poisoning Keep your dog safe from harm by keeping chocolate or any items containing chocolate well out of your pet's reach. Store hazardous items in sealed containers and place them inside closed cabinets. Never leave chocolate of any kind out on kitchen countertops or tables where pets could swipe them down. Choosing a New Dog There's no doubt that owning a dog can bring happiness, companionship, and fulfillment to pet parents. It's very important though, to make careful considerations about what dog to choose. This way, you and your new dog can have the best relationship possible for years to come. Breed Consideration Consider the breed of the dog you're thinking about bringing home. Different breeds have different health requirements and personalities, so you'll want to make the appropriate choice. Remember that a dog is a multiple-year investment; most dogs live to be at least 10 years of age, and some can live twice as long. Choosing between a purebred dog and a mixed breed is another important consideration. Before choosing a purebred animal, remember that hundreds of thousands of homeless dogs wind up on the streets or in shelters every year. Choosing a mixed breed pet may simply prove easier; purebred dogs are often predisposed to certain health problems and finding a reputable and responsible dog breeder can be quite a task in and of itself. If you do choose a purebred dog, you must ensure that it is a high-quality breed-specific fault. Lifestyle Choices Think about the size of the dog you are considering. A large dog may not be a good choice for apartment living unless the owner remains committed to daily outdoor exercise. It's also important to consider your potential new pet's personality. Generally, working and sporting dogs have a lot of energy. These dogs will require a lot of mental and physical stimulation and require close contact with humans. Terriers, on the hand, tend to be more independent and may be harder to train. Grooming What sort of grooming requirement will your potential new pet have? Long-haired dogs will require more frequent brushing and bathing, and may even need attention from a grooming professional. Factor in the cost of canine shampoo and grooming visits before picking a long-haired dog or a breed with specific grooming requirements. Children and Dogs Do you have children? This is another important consideration to make when thinking about introducing a dog to your family. Young children will need to be taught the proper handling and interaction techniques with dogs, so as to avoid bites or other injuries. Ultimately, adults need to be a dog's primary caretaker. When children are old enough, they can be included in various aspects of your family dog's care. Cognitive Dysfunction in Dogs As a dog age, cognitive Function will deteriorate and manifest itself in behavioral changes. While some behavior issues can be overlooked and considered normal for elderly dogs, advanced dysfunction and senility can probe very problematic. It's very important to think of these changes as symptoms of a disease, rather than typical misbehaviors that come with old age. Causes - Cognitive dysfunction can be caused by some or all of these changes in the brain: - Decreased dopamine levels. Monoamine oxidase B, or MAOB, increases in older dogs. MOAB metabolizes the neurotransmitter dopamine, which leads to a decrease in dopamine levels. - Increased beta-amyloid levels. Beta-amyloid is a protein that can accumulate in the brain and damage neurons, leading to cognitive dysfunction. - Mico-hemorrhages and infarcts (areas where blood flow has been disrupted). These can impair blood flow and reduce the availability of oxygen to the brain. - A reduction in the total size and weight of the dog's brain. This leads to a decrease in neurons and, consequentially, diminished brain function. Symptoms These brain changes will manifest themselves in various ways. You may witness your dog having difficulty with spatial orientation, apparent loss of memory, wandering, confusion, restlessness, nighttime pacing, and inappropriate elimination. Some dogs may even have difficulty recognizing known family members. Treatment There are several treatment methods available for dogs with cognitive dysfunction. L-Deprenyl (Anipryl) helps prolong dopamine activity by inhibiting MAOB function, thereby lessening cognitive impairment. Dopamine also breaks down free radicals in the brain. Many dogs improve after a few weeks of taking L-Deprenyl. Certain therapeutic diets may also help with canine cognitive impairment. These foods are supplemented with antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and other substances that can help retain cognitive function. Studies have shown that dogs fed these diets perform better at cognitive tests than dogs who are fed non-supplemented diets. Ask your vet about special prescription diets for your older dog. Keeping your dog mentally stimulated and enriched is another good way to treat, manage and prevent cognitive dysfunction. Even old dogs can learn new tricks-use verbal instruction, hand signals and touch indicators to teach your dog tricks or commands. This type of mental exercise, a stimulating environment, and a supplemented diet can all work well together to improve cognitive function in affected dogs. Collie Eye Anomaly Collie eye anomaly (CEA), or collie eye defect, is an inherited chromosomal condition that affects the development of the eyes in certain dog breeds. The disorder occurs worldwide and is diagnosed in various types of collies, Australian shepherds, Shetland sheepdogs, Lancashire heelers, and others. The symptoms of CEA may vary from virtually none at all to total blindness. Cause CEA is caused by a genetic anomaly in the 37th canine chromosome. It is considered an autosomal recessive trait, meaning that both parents must possess the mutated gene to pass it on to the offspring. Symptoms Some dogs who carry the affected gene show no symptoms at all at first, but may start showing symptoms as the eye develops. A thinning choroid (the group of blood vessels that supply the retina) is the telltale sign of CEA. Other possible symptoms include varying stages of blindness, corneal mineralization, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis (sunken eyeballs), and microphthalmia (abnormally small eyeballs). Coloboma (hole in the tissue) of the retina, iris, optic disc, lens, or other parts of the eye is also possible. Diagnosis A thorough eye examination is the first step in diagnosing collie eye anomalies. Funduscopy, which examines the retina or back portion of the eyeball's interior using an ophthalmoscope, is also used. Other possible causes of eye issues or blindness back disease, infection, or injury must be ruled out. Since 2005, a test has existed that can screen for the presence of the CEA gene. In addition to helping diagnose the condition, this test is useful when determining if a dog is safe for breeding. Genetic testing and eye examinations are recommended for potentially affected breeds as early as five to eight weeks of age. Treatment There is no specific treatment for collie eye anomaly, but steps can be taken to minimize the condition's effects on a dog. Laser surgery, retinal reattachment and other steps may be able to resolve certain symptoms in the eye. Otherwise, treatment is supportive in nature. Prevention The only way to entirely prevent collie eye anomaly is to avoid breeding two affected dogs. This can be difficult because of CEA's widespread presence. In addition; some breeder breed mildly affected dogs in hopes of producing only mildly affected offspring. However, breeding two mildly affected dogs does not necessarily mean the offspring will only have a minor form of the condition, it is entirely possible for the offspring to have severe CEA even if both parents have the mild form. Genetic testing to determine whether or not dogs possesss the CEA gene is highly recommended before mating breeds that are likely to have the mutation. Coonhound Paralysis Acute canine idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis (ACIP), otherwise known as coonhound paralysis, is a relatively rare disease in dogs that involves nerve inflammation and temporary paralysis. The \"coonhouse\" designation comes from the condition's suspected association with raccoon saliva, which may serve as a stimulating agent. Cause Although the exact cause of coonhouse paralysis isn't known, it is thought to be an immune-mediated or autoimmune condition. This means that a dog's own immune system attack the body; specifically the nerves of the limbs, neck, and face in this case. It is possible that contact with a raccoon-or raccoon saliva, in particular-triggers the symptoms. Viral or bacterial causes may also be to blame. Any age, gender, or breed of dog is at risk for developing coonhound paralysis, but hunting or working dogs who spend time outdoors are more frequently diagnosed. Symptoms Usually, symptoms of coonhouse paralysis begin to appear anywhere from one to two weeks after initial contact with the stimulating agent. Hind-end weakness, stiff or unusual gait, muscle wasting (atrophy), weight loss, changes in vocalization as paralysis affects the vocal cords, and progression to paralysis in all four limbs are the common signs of the condition. Dogs may also exhibit hypersensitivity to touch, weakness in the facial muscles, respiratory distress, and lowered reflex or response time. Diagnosis While routine laboratory tests like a blood count and urinalysis won't test specifically for coonhound paralysis, they can help rule out other potential causes of a dog's symptoms. a diagnosis is usually made with a combination of physical symptom observation, muscle and nerve function tests, and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid tap. Coonhound paralysis is unique in that dogs remain sensitive to pain even with nerve paralysis, which isn't the case in many diseases that cause similar symptoms. Dogs may even be hypersensitive to pain or touch; this response is one way a vet can distinguish a case of coonhound paralysis from other disorders. Treatment Although there isn't a specific medication available to treat coonhound paralysis, almost all dogs can be treated successfully. For mild to moderate cases, treatment involves the rulebination of vigilant nursing care and physiotherapy. If a dog is suffering from severe respiratory distress as a result of paralysis, hospitalization and breathing support will be required. Sometimes, fluid therapy is needed if a dog is dehydrated and unable to drink normally. Care at home will involve hand-feeding and prolonged bed rest. Dogs will need a heavily padded bed and should be turned frequently to prevent pressure sores. The area must also be kept clean of urine or fecal matter to prevent associated scalding and bacterial infections. Basic physical therapy exercises will need to be performed at home to prevent muscle atrophy. This will involve gentle stretching of each of a dog's limbs; a vet will demonstrate the exact procedures for a pet owner. Pet massage and swimming therapy have also been proven effective for dogs recovering from coonhound procedures for a pet owner. On the whole, the prognosis for coonhound paralysis is very good. Most does recover fully over the course of several weeks or month and some even recover spontaneously, In rare cases, dogs never completely recover and may require supportive care indefinitely. Copper Storage Hepatopathy Copper storage hepatopathy is a condition caused by an abnormal accumulation of copper in the animal's liver, which leads to progressive damage and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). This condition may be secondary to a primary disease or the result of genetic-based abnormal copper metabolism. Bedlington terriers, Doberman Labrador retrievers are dog breeds known to be susceptible to this disease. Copper storage hepatopathy is more prevalent in females than in males. Symptoms and Types Primary copper liver diseases (medically referred to as hepatopathies) generally fall into one of three categories: - Subclinical disease: a condition where the disease is present in the organ or body, but not detectable by abnormal signs or changes in the dog - An acute (sudden) disease that most frequently affects young dogs; is associated with a condition that causes the death of liver tissue (hepatic necrosis) - Chronic progressive disease in which symptoms are often observed in middle-aged and older dogs with chronic hepatitis, with damage and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) Conversely, secondary copper hepatopathies show symptoms of progressive signs of liver disease due to chronic hepatitis or progressive cirrhosis. Liver disease in which the flow of bile is slowed or stopped is known as a cholestatic liver disease; the abnormal flow of bile results in secondary copper retention. Both types may display symptoms in their acute or chronic forms; they are as follows: Acute: - Lethargy - Anorexia - Depression - Vomiting - Yellowish discoloration of the skin and moist tissues (icterus or jaundice) - Moist tissues of the body (mucous membranes) are pale due to low red blood cell count; - simply referred to as anemia - Dark urine due to the presence of bilirubin (bilirubinuria) - Hemoglobin in the urine (hemoglobinuria) Chronic signs: - Lethargy - Depression - Anorexia - Weight loss - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Excessive thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria) - Abdominal distention due to fluid build-up in the abdomen (ascites) - Yellowish discoloration of the skin and moist tissues (icterus or jaundice), - Spontaneous bleeding, black or tarry stools (melena) - Nervous system dysfunction due to the liver being unable to break down ammonia in the body (hepatic encephalopathy) Causes It is important to note that dogs can be affected by copper storage hepatopathy at any age. Genetics is the main contributing factor in this liver disease in Bedlington terriers and possibly other breeds. Here is some information that is known about the contributing genetic factors: - An autosomal recessive trait in Bedlington terriers due to the lack of a specific gene (COMMD1) coding for a liver protein involved in the excretion of copper in the bile is confirmed. - At one time, possibly as many as two-thirds of Bedlington terriers either were carriers of the gene or were affected by the disease; with recent genetic screening, the incidence is now much lower. - A genetic cause is suspected but unconfirmed in breeds other than Bedlington terriers. The mode of inheritance is unknown. - The prevalence in certain lines of West Highland white terriers appears to be high, but the incidence in all West Highland White terriers is low. - A reported four to six percent of Doberman Pinschers may have chronic hepatitis, which can be a cause of the effect of copper storage hepatopathy. Diagnosis A laboratory workup will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a history of its symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to whether the condition is of primary or secondary origin. A tissue sample will then be taken from the dog's liver for laboratory analysis (biopsy), and ultrasound images will be taken of the abdominal area to examine the condition of the liver. TREATMENT Inpatient evaluation and treatment are needed for dogs with signs of liver failure. Treatment will be determined by the type of disease and whether it is acute or chronic in nature. Making modifications to the dog's diet and providing it with foods low in copper have proven to be effective in most cases. Most commercially available diets contain high amounts of copper, so follow your veterinarian's instructions as to feeding a diet specifically tailored for your dog. You should also avoid giving your dog mineral supplements containing copper. Your veterinarian may also provide you with medications (e.g., penicillamine) and/or nutritional supplements (e.g., zinc) that help eliminate copper from the body. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Blood tests will be done every four to six months to monitor the dog's liver enzyme levels and zinc levels if the patient is on a zinc supplement. The veterinarian may also ask you to monitor your dog's body weight. Rarely, a liver biopsy will need to be repeated to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Prevention If you are considering purchasing a Bedlington terrier, you should ask if the dog's parents have been tested for the gene that causes this type of liver disease. There is also a liver registry available that provides information as to a breeding Bedlington's genetic status. Purchasing a Bedlington puppy from a breeder whose dogs are all free from the problematic genes and markers will diminish the probability of receiving an individual who will develop copper storage hepatopathy. Coprophagia Dogs are known for their indiscriminate eating habits and will eat some unusual things. Some dogs have even been seen ingesting fecal material (on their own or from other animals). The medical term for this act is coprophagia, and its underlying causes are numerous. In this article, we will focus on coprophagia due to deficiencies in digestive enzymes. Reasons for Coprophagia For some dogs, eating feces is a behavior learned from their littermates and/or mother. Watching other animals pick up feces and ingest it becomes a curiosity that can turn into an ingrained behavior. However, dogs that are fed low-quality food (or an insufficient amount of food) may also resort to eating feces in an instinctual attempt to balance out a dietary deficiency. This may be further exacerbated if your dog has a digestive enzyme deficiency because it prevents any of the food's nutrients to be properly absorbed by the body. Basically, your dog is attempting to eat feces in the hopes to forgo starving to death. DIAGNOSING ENZYME DEFICIENCY Your veterinarian will need to take blood samples to make a diagnosis of digestive enzyme deficiency (called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or EPI). Along with a history of loose, foul-smelling stools and weight loss, EPI in dogs can be diagnosed with relatively simple tests. The underlying reason why an animal's body stops producing adequate digestive enzymes may not always be discovered, but depending on the situation, your veterinarian may prescribe certain supplemental digestive enzymes and/or medications, such as antibiotics, as well as a dietary change. TREATING WITH DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Dogs diagnosed with EPI require digestive enzyme supplements along with their food for the rest of their lives. These supplements break down the food so that the animal's body can properly digest it, which in turn promotes weight gain and eventually an overall improvement in health. As long as the act of eating feces has not become a habit, coprophagia should diminish as well. In the meantime, any feces should be cleaned up quickly and removed from the environment to prevent future incidences. Supplemental digestive enzymes and a highly digestible diet will also help make the stool seem less desirable to your dog. Crate Training Your Dog Proper crate training is essential for just about any dog-it will be extremely helpful for transportation, housetraining, and eliminating unwanted behavior problems. This article will tell you more about picking the right crate and training your dog to use it. Choosing a Crate There are several factors to consider when picking out a crate for your dog. Think of your dog's size; the crate must be large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down comfortably. There should also be room for food and water dishes. Ensure that the crate has slits along the sides or top for ventilation, but make sure they're not big enough that your pet could stick a paw through. For dogs that are sociable and friendly, a write mesh carrier may work well. This will allow your dog to view the world around them. For dogs that want more seclusion, a plastic crate may provide a greater sense of security. Acclimating Your Dog to the Crate You'll want to have your dog associate enjoyment and relaxation with the crate, never punishment or negativity. First, simply let your dog explore the crate by themselves, leaving the crate floor fully open. Try placing a soft pet bed, toys, and treats inside the crate to entice your dog to use it. After a few days of exploration, many dogs will be willing to enter and exit the crate on their own. Training After your dog is comfortable with the crate, put them inside the carrier with food, water, and a few toys. Close the crate's door and leave the room entirely. It might be helpful to exercise your dog a bit before this step; there's a chance that they'll be tied enough to take a nap in their new crate. Most dogs, especially young puppies, will vocalize and whine a bit when left alone in their crate. Don't your dog out as soon as you hear vocalization because this will only reinforce the notion that their whining works to get what they want. Wait until your dog has stopped barking or whining, then let them out of the crate. Upon releasing your dog, don't make a big fuss. This will teach your pet that being released is actually exciting and somewhat of a treat. Instead, going into the crate should be considered a treat. Over time, your pup should get more and more comfortable spending time in the crate. Gradually increase the length of time they spend in the crate as time goes on. With perseverance, your dog should come to view crate time as a relaxing, enjoyable experience. This will make travel and further behavior training much easier later in life. For further advice on crate training your dog, contact your vet. Digging Behavior Jumping, Digging, Chasing, and Stealing Behaviors in Dogs All of these actions are within the range of normal dog behaviors. However, a dog that is not kept active enough may behave excessively in one or more of these ways. This can be especially true of dogs that are normally high energy by genetic disposition or character. Jumping up excessively as part of a greeting, for example, can be associated with separation anxiety and the excitement of having the human companion return home. Digging can often be associated with other behavioral disorders, neurologic disorders, or abdominal pain. Symptoms and Types - Jumping on people - During arrivals, departures, or greetings - Exploring the contents of countertops - Digging - Along a fence line - In areas of recent gardening - At rodent holes - On interior flooring - Worn claws (nails) - Stealing - Items displaced, hidden - Food items missing from surfaces (i.e., tables) Causes - Jumping - Excitement, encouragement of excited behavior - Separation anxiety - Digging - Following the scent of rodents - Anxiety - Regulation of body temperature - Boredom or lack of adequate exercise - Hunting behaviors (food catching or retrieval) - Escape from confinement - Pain - Separation anxiety - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - Neurologic disease - Stealing - Maybe an attempt to get your attention - Desire for a food item, lack of internal discipline - Chasing - Herding instinct - Hunting - Play - Defense Diagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a neurological exam. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Before your doctor concludes a behavioral basis for your dog's unruliness, other non-behavioral causes will need to be ruled out or confirmed first. In addition to the medical work-up, your veterinarian will need a background history of your dog's health, living conditions, level of activity the dog is allowed each day, diet, family background, if possible, and the level of training you have given to your dog. Treatment If your dog is not found to be suffering from any underlying health problems, it may be seen on an outpatient basis. Medical care and prescriptions will be entirely dependent upon whether there is an underlying condition that requires medical treatment. Otherwise, if your dog is diagnosed with a behavioral problem, your veterinarian will advise you to begin by increasing your dog's activity levels. Follow-up appointments will assess the progress your dog is making and adjust the treatment accordingly. If your doctor feels that your dog's behaviors can be modified by training, you will be referred to a behavior specialist. Living and Management Tips for Preventing Jumping: - Use a head collar and leash to control movement - Greet visitors outside - away from dog - Keep the dog in another room until the visitor is seated - Teach your dog \"sit\" and \"stay\" as an appropriate greeting - Practice having the dog sit for a food reward in different areas of the house - Say \"stay\" when the sitting is a few seconds; take a step away, return to the dog, and reward; increase time to 3-5 minutes. - Keep sessions reasonable; 3-5 minute sessions with 8-12 repetitions per session - Repeat near the door when leaving the home and returning - Have the dog sit for a food reward when returning from work, etc. - Reward the dog for remaining seated as visitors enter - Dogs that like to retrieve and are too excited to sit may do better if a ball is tossed as a visitor enters - When guests call, walk calmly to the door and speak in a quiet voice before allowing them in - When the dog jumps on guests have them turn away - Avoid stepping on the dog's toes or squeezing the paws Prevent Digging - Adequately heat or cool dog's shelter - Control rodent population around home - Resolve separation anxiety, phobias, or OCD - Increase the dog's exercise routine - Create an area where it is acceptable for the dog to dig in, such as a plot of ground or a children's sandbox. - Using aversive stimuli, redirect the dog to another activity as it starts to dig; loud noise and water spray may distract the dog Prevent Chasing - Use a no-pull harness or head collar - Desensitize (gradually expose to) and counter-condition (teach a different response) the dog to the stimulus - Use the \"sit-and-stay\" command with the addition of a \"look\" command, while using a treat brought up to eye level - Work in a quiet yard with leashed dog: sit, stay, step away, return, look, and reward - Keep sessions reasonable; 3-5 minute sessions with 8-12 repetitions per session - If able to keep the dog's attention, stage the chase stimulus to pass by at a great distance (which shortens as the dog improves) while training the dog - When a dog ignores the chase stimulus in the yard, try the same exercise while on a walk Prevent Stealing - Give adequate attention, exercise, and toys - Do not chase the dog; walk away, get a treat, and call the dog to you - As the dog is dropping the \"stolen\" item to take the treat, say \"drop,\" and \"good dog,\" and then give the reward - Give a second treat, preventing a \"race\" for the dropped item; hide the item - Ignore the dog if it retreats under the furniture - Place food out of dog's reach - Use a motion detector Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) Heart Muscle Disease in Dogs Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle that is characterized by an enlarged heart that does not function properly. With DCM, both the upper and lower chambers of the heart become enlarged, with one side being more severely affected than the other. When the ventricle, or lower chamber, becomes enlarged, its ability to pump blood out into the lungs and body deteriorates. When the heart's ventricle does not pump enough blood into the lungs, fluid begins to accumulate in the lungs. An enlarged heart soon becomes overloaded, and this often leads to congestive heart failure (CHF). The incidence of DCM in dogs increases with age, usually affecting dogs between four and ten years old. DCM is also more common in certain breeds, such as the Doberman Pinscher, Boxer, Scottish Deerhound, Irish Great Dane, Saint Bernard, Afghan Hound, and Cocker Spaniel. Symptoms and Types The major symptoms of DCM include lethargy, anorexia, rapid and excessive breathing, shortness of breath, coughing, abdominal distension, and transient loss of consciousness. In some cases, dogs with preclinical (prior to the appearance of symptoms) DCM may be given a questionable diagnosis because it appears to be in fine health. On the other hand, a thorough physical exam can make apparent some of the subtle symptoms of DCM, such as pulse deficits, ventricular or supraventricular premature contractions (within the ventricles and above the ventricles, respectively), and slow capillary refill time. The dog's breathing sounds may also have a muffled or crackling sound due to the presence of fluid in the lungs. Causes The cause of DCM in dogs is largely unknown. Nutritional deficiencies of taurine or carnitine have been found to contribute to the incidence of DCM in certain breeds such as Dobermans and Cocker Spaniels. Evidence also suggests that some breeds have a genetic susceptibility to the disease. In most breeds, male dogs are more susceptible to the disease than female dogs. Diagnosis In addition to a thorough physical examination of the heart, certain medical tests are needed to confirm a diagnosis of DCM and exclude other diseases. Radiographic imaging may reveal left ventricular and atrial enlargement and the presence of fluid in the lungs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) may reveal atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (rapid beating of the heart). An ultrasound of the heart using echocardiograph imaging is required for a definitive diagnosis of DCM. This test examines the size of the heart, and the ability of the ventricular to contract. In the case of DCM, an echocardiograph will reveal an enlarged left ventricular and left atrial, and low contraction ability. Treatment Treatment for DCM is heavily focused on improving the heart's function, and on treating the symptoms of congestive heart failure. Drugs may be administered to enhance heart contraction and to slow down rapid beating, and diuretics may be used to control the accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Vasodilators, drugs that induce dilation of the blood vessels, and help the heart pump blood more effectively, are also usually part of the therapy for DCM. Except in cases where a dog is severely affected by the disease, long-term hospitalization should not be necessary. Living and Management Follow-up treatment for DCM will generally involve regular progress checks. Clinical examinations such as thoracic radiographs, blood pressure measurements, and EKG induce dilation tests are all standard diagnostic tools for measuring progress. You will also need to monitor your dog's overall attitude, and stay alert to any outward signs of relapse, such as labored breathing, coughing, fainting, and lethargy. Despite therapy and conscientious care, most dogs with DCM have a poor prognosis. Your veterinarian will counsel you on your pet's likelihood for survival, based on the progression of the disease at the time of diagnosis, but in general, dogs with this condition are given 6 to 24 months to live. Dobermans are more severely affected by this disease, and will generally not survive longer than six months after the diagnosis is made. In this case, your veterinarian can advise you on ways in which you can make your dog's life as comfortable as possible. Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) Skin dermatoses is a general medical term that applies to several types of bacterial infections or genetic diseases of the skin. Some dermatoses are cosmetic conditions involving loss of pigmentation of the skin and/or hair coat not but are otherwise not harmful. For instance, German Shepherds tend to bacterial skin infections involving areas of the lips, eyelids, and nostrils. German Shepherds, Collies, and Shetland sheepdogs are predisposed to lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own skin and other organs, and discoid lupus, an autoimmune disease involving the skin only, usually the face. Chow chows and Akitas are predisposed to an autoimmune disease involving the skin, characterized by inflammation with crusting, and lesions containing pus. Akitas, Samoyeds, and Siberian huskies tend to develop a rare syndrome that causes inflammation in the front part of the eye. The most affected area is the iris, with coexistent inflammation of the skin characterized by loss of pigment in the skin of the nose and lips. Doberman Pinschers and Rottweilers may develop a condition characterized by a symmetrical lack of pigment in the skin and a white hair coat, especially involving the face and nose. Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and Labrador Retrievers can display a seasonal loss of pigment in the tough, hairless skin of the nose. St. Bernards and Giant schnauzers can be afflicted with inflammation of the arteries of the nasal philtrum, the juncture between the sides of the upper lip extending to the nose. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - White hair (known as leukonychia) - Partial or total lack of pigment in the skin (known as leukoderma) - Reddening of the skin (known as erythema) - Loss of the top surface of the skin (known as erosion or ulceration, based on the depth of tissue loss) CAUSES - Bacterial skin infections; the most commonly affected areas are: - Lips - Eyelids - Nostrils - Fungal infection of skin - Contact hypersensitivity (allergies) - Skin on face tends to be primarily affected - Red skin and pus - face and ears - Crusting scabs and pus on skin - Loss of skin/hair color after skin was inflamed - Loss of color on nose and lips, vision loss - Seasonal nasal depigmentation - Inflammation of the arteries of the nasal philtrum (very front of nose, above upper lip) - Albinism (genetic) - Vitiligo (smooth white patches of skin due to loss of skin color) - Severe: skin and bodily organs affected - Autoimmune disease (often there is a genetic predisposition) - Systemic lupus - Uveodermatologic syndrome - Hormonal disorders - Drug reaction DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as whether your dog suffered a recent infection. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Blood samples can be tested for autoimmune factors. As part of your dog's physical exam, your veterinarian will take skin samples and skin scrapings to send to a lab for bacterial and fungal cultures. If the skin biopsy shows that skin cells are separating from each other (acantholytic), this is diagnostic for pemphigus. Direct immunofluorescence of skin samples using fluorescent dyes can also be used to demonstrate antibodies. Your veterinarian may also take fluid samples from your dog's joints to check for lupus. TREATMENT Unless your dog is suffering from multiple organ dysfunction caused by lupus, treatment may be performed on an outpatient basis. Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian if a bacterial or fungal infection is present. Immunosuppressive medication is often prescribed for autoimmune disorders. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist if your dog's eyes are affected. Unless topical medications or ointments have been specifically prescribed by your veterinarian for your pet, any preparation should be avoided. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT You will need to protect your dog from exposure to the sun if it has been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, a water-resistant sunblock with an SPF of greater than 30 to depigmented areas of your dog's skin for walks or days out n the sun. If your dog is exposed to plastic or rubber dishes (especially if the dishes have roughened edges that might cause abrasions), they will need to be replaced. If your dog's skin condition worsens, you will need to contact your veterinarian, since it may indicate something more serious that is underlying the skin condition, such as a spreading infection. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to monitor your dog's skin ailment. Animals that are taking immunosuppressive medications (for autoimmune diseases) should have frequent blood work tests performed. Dog Breeding Before breeding a dog, careful considerations should be made. It must be done responsibly and never solely for profit's sake. It might be rewarding to have a puppy directly from your family's longtime dog, but there are hundreds of thousands of dogs waiting in shelters that need loving homes, too. Plus, complications during pregnancy, special care requirements during the mother's gestation period, and caring for an entire litter of newborn puppies will not make breeding easy. Most vets recommend that breeding be left to professionals. Before Breeding If you decide to breed, do so responsibly. This beings by having the male and female dog you plan on breeding undergo complete physical examinations. Each dog must be screened for various heritable conditions, like hip or shoulder dysplasia, cryptorchidism (undescended testicles), hernias, and more. Female dogs will need to be de-warmed to make sure no parasites can be transferred to the puppies. Both dogs will also need to be completely up-to-date on their vaccinations. Ask your vet what vaccines breeding dogs require. Gestation The typical gestation period for dogs or the time between conception to delivery is about 63 to 65 days. Litter size can vary widely, from one puppy to 10 or more. Puppies are weaned at six weeks of age and adopted out at about eight weeks of age. Before adopting puppies, they should receive their core vaccinations at about six weeks of age. During Pregnancy During the female's pregnancy, special care will be required. Four to five meals should be fed, and many vets recommend premium puppy food to provide extra protein and other nutrients a pregnant or nursing mother will require. Fresh water must also be available at all times. Before the female delivers her litter, you'll need to make a whelping bed. This can be constructed from a large box, outfitted with warm blankets. The box must be large enough for her mother to arrange and groom her pups once they've been delivered. Don't put a heating pad under the blankets; puppies won't be able to move away from the heat source if they need to cool themselves. Delivery If the female is able to have a natural delivery, most mother dogs will prefer to be left alone during delivery. However, if the mother can't tend to each pup quickly enough-especially likely with large litters-you may have to step in to help. The birth sacs around each puppy must be removed to prevent suffocation. There may be amniotic fluid in the puppies' mouths and lungs-this can be removed with a bulb syringe or gently shaken away. At this point, the puppy should be rubbed vigorously to stimulate squirming and crying. Then, the puppy should be placed in the whelping bed to allow the mother to finish grooming it. Some dogs will need an emergency Cesarean section (C-section) to deliver the puppies. This is especially common with brachycephalic breeds, which have pushed-in noses, bulging eyes, and dome-shaped heads. Their anatomy makes natural delivery more difficult, so surgical removal is often required. If you're breeding a brachycephalic breed like the pug, Pegkinese, English bulldog, French bulldog, Shih Tzu, or Boston terrier, make sure your vet is aware. Keep your vet's phone number on hand at all times during the pregnancy and delivery of your dog's litter of puppies. If a partial-birth occurs or contractionspartial-birth take place without delivery of a puppy, immediate veterinary attention is required. Ehrlichiosis Ehrlichiosis in dogs is a rickettsia infection caused by the organisms Ehrlichia canisand Ehrlichia lewinii. These bacteria are spread by the brown dog tick and the Lone Star tick, respectively. Rickettsiae are a type of bacteria that inhabit a cell, in this case, the body's white blood cells, which are destroyed in the process. While there are a number of species in the genus Ehrlichia, the E. canis and E. lewiniiare the two that are of main concern for dogs, with E. canis being the more diagnosed form (note that these bacteria can infect other animals as well, including humans). This disease is seen throughout the year and throughout the continental U.S. but is more common on the Gulf Coast, eastern seaboard, Southwest, and California, geographical areas that tend to have an abundance of warm days. Chronic and severe forms of this disease are more representative of Doberman pinschers and German shepherds. Symptoms and Types There are three stages of Ehrlichiosis: Acute stage: - Symptoms present around 1-3 weeks after biting from infected tick - Enlarged lymph nodes - Weakness - Lethargy - Depression - Lack of appetite - Difficult respiration - Limb edema Subclinical stage: - Bacteria may be present for months or years without clinical symptoms Chronic Stage: - Abnormal bleeding - Nose bleed - Severe weight loss - Fever - Trouble breathing due to inflammation of the lungs - Joint inflammation and pain - Seizures in some animals - Lack of coordination - Head tilt - Eye pain - Anemia - Kidney failure - Paralysis DIAGNOSIS You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, including recent activities, and the environment your dog spends time in. It goes without saying that if your dog has recently been bitten by a tick, you will need to share this information with your veterinarian. Along with the standard fluid tests, complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, your veterinarian will also need to carry out more specific tests for isolating E. canis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, which isolates the DNA of the causative agent, is now commonly employed for confirmation. The PCR test, in combination with a test for antibodies to the Ehrlichia infection, is typically the best way to make a concrete diagnosis. Typically, ehrlichiosis will cause a decreased number of platelets (the cells involved in the clotting of blood), a condition referred to as thrombocytopenia. There will also be a decreased number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), anemia, and an increased number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell usually seen in advanced infections). The urinalysis may reveal the presence of proteins in urine, which result from inflammation of the kidneys. Other indications your veterinarian will look for hemorrhage within the retina of the eye, inflammation of the lungs, an enlarged spleen, and inflammation of the brain or spinal cord. If nervous symptoms are present, such as a lack of coordination or seizures, your veterinarian may take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for further evaluation. TREATMENT The main objective of treatment is to clear the body of the organism and stabilize the patient by managing complications like anemia and bleeding related to this disease. Standard antibiotic therapy remains the choice for treatment, along with anti-inflammatory drugs for reducing swelling and inflammation. Your veterinarian will also treat your dog with fluid therapy to maintain the water content, and if anemia is severe, a blood transfusion may also be required. Other drugs and therapies will be chosen based on the stage of illness your dog is experiencing. Prognosis is best when treatment is begun early. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Observe your dog closely and immediately call your veterinarian if your dog begins to bleed from any site. It is recommended that you provide a calm and quiet space where your dog can rest until fully recovered. Physical activity should be low impact, with a short walk outdoors. Avoid areas where ticks may be present as much as possible. Most dogs recover well with prompt and appropriate therapy. Some dogs clinically recover but the infection is not entirely eradicated, remaining in the body and sometimes returning at a later time. Your veterinarian will repeat blood tests during follow-up examinations to determine your dog's progress. Medications may be changed according to your dog's progress. Ehrlichiosis is a common infection, and one to be on guard against in almost all geographical locations, and throughout the year. The best prevention is to practice tick control using tick-resistant products on your dog, and checking your dog's skin and fur daily for the presence of ticks. Consult your veterinarian for proper guidelines on tick control in your specific area. Elbow Dysplasia Elbow dysplasia is a condition caused by the abnormal growth of cells, tissue, or bone. The condition is characterized by a series of four developmental abnormalities that lead to malformation and degeneration of the elbow joint. It is the most common cause of elbow pain and lameness, and one of the most common causes of forelimb lameness in large and giant-breed dogs. Labrador retrievers, Rottweilers, Golden retrievers, German shepherd dogs, mountain dogs, chow chows, bearded collies, and Newfoundland breeds are the most commonly affected. The age for onset of clinical signs is typically four to ten months, with diagnosis generally being made around 4 to 18 months. One type of condition is more likely to affect males than females: when the bone fragment is located at the inner surface of the upper ulna. The ulna is one of the bones of the foreleg, just below the elbow joint. Otherwise, there are no known gender differences. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Not all affected dogs will show signs when young - Sudden (acute) episodes of elbow lameness due to advanced degenerative joint disease in a mature patient are common - Intermittent or persistent forelimb lameness that is aggravated by exercise; progresses from stiffness, and is noticed only after the dog has been resting - Pain when extending or flexing the elbow - Tendency for dogs to hold the affected limb away from the body - Fluid build-up in the joint - Grating of bone and joint with movement may be detected with advanced degenerative joint disease - Diminished range of motion CAUSES The causes are genetic, developmental, and nutritional. DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will want to rule out several possible causes for the symptoms before arriving at a diagnosis. For example, whether there has been trauma to the joint, or whether there is an infection that has brought on, an arthritic condition will need to be explored. A tumor may account for the symptoms, and this possibility will be taken into account as well, with x-ray images taken of the affected area for closer examination. Both elbows will probably need to be x-rayed, since there is a high incidence of disease occurring in both legs. Your doctor may also want to order a computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance image (MRI) to look for fragments. A sample of fluid will be taken from the joint with a fine needle aspiratefor laboratory testing, and an arthroscopic examination (by use of a tubelike instrument for examining and treating the inside of the joint) may be utilized to help for making a definitive diagnosis. TREATMENT Surgery may be the treatment of choice; if so, cold-packing the elbow joint immediately following surgery to help decrease swelling and control pain is advised. You will want to continue to apply the cold pack five to ten minutes every eight hours for three to five days, or as directed by your veterinarian. Range-of-motion exercises will be beneficial for healing therapy until your dog can bear weight on the limb(s). Your veterinarian will demonstrate the types of range of motion movements you will be working on with your dog, based on the location and severity of the affected limb. Activity is restricted for all patients postoperatively for a minimum of four weeks, but to avoid muscle wasting or abnormal rigidity, you will need to encourage early, active movement of the affected joint(s). Again, have your veterinarian advise you on the specific movement therapy you will be using with your dog. Weight control is an important aspect of decreasing load and stress on the affected joint(s). Medications may be prescribed for minimizing pain and decreasing inflammation. Medications may also be prescribed for slowing the progression of arthritic changes, and for protecting joint cartilage. PREVENTION Excessive intake of nutrients that promote rapid growth can have an influence on the development of elbow dysplasia; therefore, restricted weight gain and growth in young dogs that are at increased risk (due to breed, etc.) may decrease its incidence. Avoid breeding affected animals, since this is a genetic trait. If your dog has been diagnosed with elbow dysplasia, you will need to have it neutered or spayed, and you will need to report the incident to the breeder your dog came from if that is the case. If the affected dog came from a litter in your own home, do not repeat dam-sire breedings that result in these offspring. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Yearly examinations are recommended for assessing the progression and deterioration of joint cartilage. Progression of degenerative joint disease is to be expected; however, the prognosis is fair to good for all forms of this disease. Elbow Hygroma in Dogs A hygroma is a false bursa, which is a nonpainful, fluid-filled swelling surrounded by a thick, fibrous capsule that develops under the skin. Hygromas most commonly develop on the outside of the elbow. They can also occur on the hip and hock. Hygromas are initially small, soft, and fluctuant and do not pose a problem for the dog. They may be present for the dog's lifetime. In some instances, they may become quite large, up to 2 inches in diameter, or very hard. Hygromas can become infected in which case they are painful, sometimes warm to the touch, and may develop draining tracts. Causes A hygroma is caused by repeated trauma to an area over a bony prominence. The trauma most often occurs as a result of lying on hard surfaces, such as cement or hardwood floors. It is more common in larger breed dogs in which more weight is placed on the bony area having contact with the hard surface. Hygromas are also more common in dogs that are sedentary, such as those recovering from surgery or having other medical conditions that make them less active (e.g., hip dysplasia). Treatment The first step in treatment is to prevent further trauma. This can be accomplished by providing a soft padded bed. The area involved can be bandaged using donut-shaped padding over the elbow, placing the 'hole' of the donut over the hygroma. This will protect the hygroma from further contact with anything hard. Simply bandaging the area is often not effective since there would still be pressure on the hygroma if the dog lies on that side. There are commercial products available for protecting the elbows and for dogs with hygromas. Try searching for \"dog hygromas\" on the web. Periodically aspirating (removing the fluid via needle and syringe) the hygroma is usually not effective and may introduce infection. Likewise, surgery is seldom performed unless the hygroma is infected. Generally, the area involved is so large that once the hygroma is removed, skin grafting or other techniques may be needed to close the incision. When the animal flexes and extends the leg, considerable tension is placed on the sutures and the incision is likely to open up. Some success has been seen by surgically inserting a drain (latex tubing) into the hygroma to allow for constant drainage. Then the area is bandaged, and the dressings are changed regularly. Prevention Hygromas can be prevented by providing soft bedding, especially beds made of orthopedic foam. Animals recovering from surgery should be turned from side to side multiple times during the day. Excessive Barking Excessive vocalization refers to uncontrollable, excessive barking, whining or crying, often occurring at inappropriate times of the night or day. Such vocalization can be due to pain, illness, cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), or may be related to a decline in hearing in senior pets. CDS is often associated with night waking, during which excessive vocalization occurs. Dogs that are bred for work and high-energy activities may be prone to excess barking. Excessive barking may also be related to behavioral conditions, which may be controlled by behavior modification training. There are also some breeds that are better known for excessive and inappropriate barking. Many breeds of terriers, such as the Yorkshire, Cairn, Fox, West Highland White, and Silky terriers, are prone to barking without cause and may benefit from behavioral modification training. Other breeds include toy and miniature poodles, chihuahuas, and Pekingese. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Night vocalizations in senior-age dogs - Excessive barking in working-breed dogs - Excessive barking in high-energy nervous dogs - Vocalization caused by pain or illness - Vocalization is disruptive to owners or others (e.g., neighbors) CAUSES - Medical: disease, pain, CDS - Anxiety or conflict - Alarm barking - in response to novel stimuli - Territorial - warning or guarding response to sounds from outdoors - Social or attention-seeking behavior that is reinforced by verbal commands or return of owner to room - Distress vocalization (e.g. howling or whining) - often due to separation from mother, family, social group, or owner - Growling may be associated with antagonistic displays - Stereotypical behaviors or compulsive disorders - Breed - genetic characteristics DIAGNOSIS If your dog's increased vocalization is out of the ordinary, you will want to have health problems ruled out before considering behavior modification. Your veterinarian can perform a full medical work-up, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, and electrolyte panel, along with a complete physical exam. Possible incidents that might have led to this condition will also be considered, and a thorough history of your dog's behavioral health leading up to the symptoms will be taken into account. It is critical to rule out a non-behavioral, physical cause of the vocalization first. Imaging can be helpful for ruling out medical/neurological disorders. BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) testing can be done if the auditory decline is suspected. TREATMENT A plan must be created which is customized to suit your dog and your personal living conditions, your household, and the type of problem, being sure to attempt to resolve the underlying cause before behavioral modifications are begun. Do not reinforce the vocalization. This includes punishing the behavior, which is still regarded as attention. Instead, positively reward your dog when it is calm and quiet, and lead by example by remaining calm as well. Also, counter-condition your dog to calm down when stimulated. Training your dog to be quiet on command will be the priority. To prevent your dog from becoming accustomed to the attention received by barking or crying, a quiet response can be reinforced using head halters, bark-activated alarms, bark-activated citronella collars, and disruptive devices such as alarms or water sprayers. Another method that has been used to some success is to desensitize the dog to the outside stimuli using food treats until the response threshold is very high. Becoming more attentive to the triggers that cause your dog to bark excessively will help you to distract your dog before it becomes excited or anxious. Medications might be indicated if there is real anxiety, conflict, excessive responsiveness to stimuli, or a compulsive disorder: - Benzodiazepines on a short-term or as-needed basis when situations of anxiety might be expected or for inducing sleep - Sedatives may be effective for tranquilizing the dog prior to exposure to stimuli (e.g., car rides, fireworks), but will not decrease anxiety and may increase noise sensitivity and vocalization in some dogs - Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for long-term therapy for excessive and chronic anxiety, combined with behavior modification can be useful for some dogs - SSRIs or clomipramine may help when combined with behavior therapy for compulsive disorders. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT The dog should be brought back to the veterinarian or to a behavior specialist to modify the program based on your dog's particular response. Obedience training, head halter training, and quiet command training are often effective in dogs. Dogs should be habituated and socialized to a variety of stimuli and environments throughout development, including with other people and pets. This desensitizes the animal to novel experiences, reducing anxiety, and over-excitation. Fear of Thunderstorms It can be heartbreaking to watch: Even before the first clap of thunder, otherwise, well-behaved dogs begin to pace, pant, cling to their owners, hide in the closet, or jam themselves behind the toilet. In severe cases, they'll claw through drywall, chew carpets, or break through windows in their escalating panic. Thunderstorm phobia in dogs is real, not uncommon, and shouldn't be ignored, experts say. \"Most of the time they don't grow out of it on their own, and many will get worse with time if nothing is done,\" says Matt Peuser, DVM, a veterinarian at Olathe Animal Hospital in Kansas. Why does storm phobia happen, and what can you do if your dog suffers from it? STORM PHOBIA TRIGGERS Veterinarians don't know all the triggers but suspect the dogs are set off by some combination of wind, thunder, lightning, barometric pressure changes, static electricity, and low-frequency rumbles preceding a storm that humans can't hear. According to one theory, dogs experience painful shocks from static buildup before the storm. The anxiety often gets worse throughout the season as storms become more frequent. Dogs often start having storm-related panic attacks seemingly out of nowhere, says Barbara L. Sherman, Ph.D., DVM, associate professor of veterinary behavior at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine and a past president of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists. \"Owners come in and say, 'He wasn't like this last year,\" Sherman tells WebMD. \"It's really heart-wrenching to see these dogs that are usually calm companions become severely affected by thunderstorms.\" Herding breeds, such as border collies, may be predisposed to the problem, according to an Internet survey by Tufts University researchers. Dogs with other fearful behaviors, such as separation anxiety, also seem more prone to panic. Some dogs with storm phobia are also frightened of other loud noises, such as fireworks or gunshots, but others are only afraid of storms. What to do? There's no easy fix, and unless your dog is only mildly affected, it can be difficult to treat, vets say. But there are lots of tools to reduce your dog's distress during storm season: 1. Reward calm behavior year-round. Many owners make the mistake of trying to console and pet a fearful dog that's whimpering or climbing on them, but that just encourages the panicky behavior, Sherman says. \"We absolutely don't want owners to scold their dog, but we don't want them to reward the dog for being clingy because that will increase the clingy behavior,\" she says. Instead, practice getting your dog to settle on command. Sherman advises clients to put a special \"inside\" leash on the dog and practice having the pet lie at their feet while praising the calm behavior. \"They should practice when there is no storm, so the dog learns the routine,\" she says. \"When the storm comes up, then they put on the leash and say, 'Come on and lie down here,' and the dog still knows what to do.\" During the storm, you can also try distracting the dog by offering its favorite toy, playing fetch, petting it, and feeding treats as long as the dog remains calm, Peuser says. \"What you're trying to do is get them to forget about the storm and replace [the fear] with something positive,\" he says. 2. Give the dog a safe place where he can go in a storm. That might be an open crate, a basement where the dog can't hear or see what's happening outside, an interior room with music playing, or a bathroom. Let your dog decide: Notice where he goes during a storm, and if possible, allow access to it. Be sure your dog can come and go freely since some animals become more anxious if confined. Sherman treated one golden retriever that was confined to a garage and, in an attempt to escape during a storm, scratched through the drywall of the door leading to the house. 3. Consider a snug garment. Snug-fitting shirts and wraps specially designed to calm anxious dogs are worth a try, says Sherman, who has consulted for Thundershirt, a so-called pressure garment that is said to have a calming effect similar to swaddling a baby. Some dogs also respond to wearing a metal fabric-lined cape marketed as the Storm Defender, which claims to protect dogs from static shocks. So far, the benefits of these garments are anecdotal. A 2009 study found \"there was a trend toward the Storm Defender performing better\" than a placebo cape, but the results were statistically insignificant, said study author Nicole Cottam, MS, behavior service coordinator at Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Tufts researchers are currently performing a study sponsored by the makers of Anxiety Wrap, another compression garment. 4. In the winter, desensitize your dog to the sounds of a storm. Play a CD of thunder recordings at low enough levels that don't frighten your dog, while giving him treats or playing a game. Gradually increase the volume over the course of several months, stopping if your dog shows any signs of anxiety. The goal is to get your dog used to the sound of thunder, and associate it with good things, Peuser says. Experts caution that desensitization can have limited success in an actual storm because you can only recreate the noise and not the other factors that may be bothering the dog, such as static electricity or changes in barometric pressure. 5. Ask your veterinarian for advice. The doctor may have more ideas for behavior modification and can assess whether medication may also be needed. \"Not every dog needs anti-anxiety medication, but dogs that are in a horrible state of high anxiety will really benefit,\" Sherman says. In severe cases, owners will keep their dogs on the medication for the whole season, while others give their dog medicine in the morning if there's a chance of a storm later on. A 2003 study by veterinarians at the University of Georgia found that 30 out of 32 dogs with storm phobia showed significant improvement when given medication combined with behavior modification and desensitization. Feeding Your Dog Just like us, our dogs need a nutritionally complete and balanced diet to stay healthy. While all dogs are different and no two animals will have the exact same nutritional requirements, every dog must receive the proper amount of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats, and other essential nutrients. Also, remember that your dog's nutritional needs can change depending on their stage of life Puppy Diet A growing puppy needs a lot of nutrition in the first year of life. Essential growth nutrients, like calcium and phosphorus, are found in abundance in puppy diets. This is why it's very important to give your young pet a specially formulated puppy diet until they've stopped growing. Most puppies stop growing by 12 months of age. but some large breeds may continue to grow until about 18 months of age. If you have a large-breed puppy, ask your vet about specific diets for larger dogs. Puppies should be fed three times per day until they're about 6 months old. After this, dogs are usually fed twice daily. Many toy breed puppies should be fed every four to six hours. Adult Diet After about a year, a dog's diet should shift to adult food. Thesesenior diets are formulated with carefully balanced ingredients and include vitamins and antioxidants that are key to fighting off disease and infection. Avoid generic canine diets. These products contain too much \"filler\" and not enough solid nutritional value. There are many premium diets available, so ask your vet which one will best suit your adult dog. Senior Diet By about the age of seven, most dogs should be transitioning to a specially formulated senior diet. Nutritional needs will change during this period of life, and the diet we give our dogs should follow suit. Many premium senior diets contain fewer calories while retaining the proper allotments of key nutrients. Never free-feed your dog, as it can often lead to obesity. Regularly scheduled meals are recommended. The quantity of food to offer can be found by checking the label on your dog's food bag. Throughout your fogs life. work closely with your vet to develop a nut First Aid for Dogs While no pet owner wants to think about an emergency, accidents are likely to happen at one point or another. Being well-informed and prepared are the best ways to give your dog the best chance for a full and speedy recovery. First aid can be life-saving when it is the initial treatment administered in an emergency situation. Emergency Protocol These are four steps to take when responding to an emergency situation involving your pet: - Stay Calm- Avoid panicking, as it will only make things harder. Do your best to breathe normally and think clearly. - Assess the Scenario- Assess the situation in front of you and decide what to do next. - Administer First Aid- Apply first aid as needed-this will be discussed further in the sections below. - Take Your Pet to the Veterinarian- After you've stabilized the situation as best as you can, contact your vet immediately and begin transporting your pet to the office. Shock Assessment Shock is the body's response to trauma or another serious injury, and is characterized by a quick drop in blood pressure and unresponsiveness. Other symptoms of shock include vomiting, shaking, rapid breathing, and pale lips and gums. If you witness these indicators, try to keep your dog as still and calm as possible, Cover your pet with a warm blanket to conserve body temperature and offer some security. Remember, pets that are in pain can behave differently than usual. Even well-trained animals can bite out of panic, fear, and pain. Always take steps to keep yourself safe in an emergency situation. Broken Limbs If your dog suffers a broken bone, slide a clean towel under the affected limb. If the break is \"open\" and you can see the bone, cover the area with a clean gauze patch. If the break is closed, you don't need to cover it. In both cases, keep your dog as still and flat as possible, supporting the broken limb with a folded towel, while transporting your pet to the vet's office. Burns, Cuts, Heatstroke If your dog has suffered a burn, cool the area quickly with water and cover it with a damp, cool towel before taking your pet to the hospital. If your pet was burned with a chemical, flush the affected area with cool water for 15 minutes before transporting your pet to the vet's office. Bleeding cuts should be cleaned with fresh water and covered with a gauze pad. Get your dog to the vet's office as soon as possible-the longer you wait, the greater the risk of infection becomes. Heatstroke is common during the deep summer months when it is the hottest outdoors. It's also likely to occur when pets are left outdoors without adequate hydration or ventilation. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, drooling, diarrhea and vomiting, and lethargy. Take immediate steps to cool your dog down-bring them to a cooler area, offer fresh water and soak your pet with cool, damp towels. Call your bet for follow-up instructions. Gingival Hyperplasia (Gum Enlargement) in Dogs Gingival hyperplasia refers to a medical condition in which a dog's gum (gingival) tissue becomes inflamed and enlarged. Enlargement is typically caused by irritation due to dental plaque or other bacterial growth along the gum line. In many cases, this can be prevented with good oral hygiene habits. This enlargement is typical in dogs, and while it can occur in any breed, Boxers, Great Danes, Collies, Doberman Pinschers, and Dalmatians appear to be especially prone to developing an inflammation of the gums. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Common symptoms of gingival hyperplasia include: - Thickening of the gums - Increase in the height of the gums - Pockets developing in the gums - Areas of inflammation in the gums - Growth or tissue mass formation on the gum line CAUSES The most common cause of gum enlargement (gingival hyperplasia) is bacteria and plaque along the gum line. If left untreated this disease can also affect the bones and structures supporting the teeth (periodontal disease). DIAGNOSIS This medical condition is often diagnosed during a routine inspection of the dog's mouth. If there is a mass present, a biopsy of tissue taken from the mass will likely be performed to rule out or confirm the presence of cancer (neoplasia). X-ray images may also be taken to rule out the presence of other potentially serious underlying medical conditions. TREATMENT For serious cases, surgical repair and/or deep cleaning, with re-contouring of your dog's gums may be performed to help return the gum line to its original shape and to return any formed pockets to normal so that food and bacteria will no longer be problematic. Pain medication can be given as needed to reduce your dog's discomfort during the recovery process. Overall, a dental cleaning, along with oral antibiotics (antimicrobials), should be sufficient for cleaning your dog's mouth and for reducing the swelling and enlargement of the gums. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT It is important that you take your dog for complete routine dental cleanings with your veterinarian, and to maintain good oral hygiene and diet to prevent the formation or recurrence of enlarged gums. Animals with gingival hyperplasia generally will have a good outcome with treatment, although relapse is common. There are some potential complications with gum enlargement, including deeper pocket formation in the gums, which can encourage additional bacterial growth within the pockets. Giving Your Dog a Pill At one point or another, just about every dog owner will have to give their pet a pill. Unfortunately, this can often be easier said than done. This article offers some helpful tips on how to get your dog to take their medication. Hiding Method The easiest method of administering medication in pill form is to hide it in food or a treat. Try placing the pill in a small ball of your dog's canned food, or wrap the pill inside a small amount of chees, meat, or peanut butter. This method is preferred over putting the pill in your dog's entire bowl of food; it's much easier to make sure your dog has actually consumed the medication. Crushing Method In some cases, you may be able to crush the pill up using a hard object, then sprinkle the medication over food or stir it in to conceal it. Always check with your vet before doing this, though. Some medications may be rendered ineffective if they are crushed up. Even more dangerously, some pills that are designed to release medicine over time may release it all at once when in powder form, leading to overdoses and other serious health complications for your dog. Only crush a pill if you've received approval from your vet. Chewable Varieties Keep in mind that some medications are now available in chewable tablet form. Often, these medications are made to taste like dog treats, causing most dogs to scarf them right up without ever realizing they've swallowed the medication. Ask your veterinarian if any of your pet's medications are available in chewable form Manual Administration Of course, many pets are very good at avoiding pills in food, eating around them, or spitting them out. For these dogs, you'll have to administer the pill manually. Begin by lubricating the pill with a small about of butter or margarine. This will make the pill much easier to swallow. Sit down with your dog in a quiet, well-lit area. Grasping the pill between your thumb and index finger, place your other hand on your dog's muzzle. Position your thumb on one side of the mouth and your remaining fingers on the other, just behind the canine teeth. Tilt your pet's head toward the ceiling. If the mouth doesn't open automatically, use your fingers to press gently on the lower teeth; this should cause your dog to open their mouth. Be cautious not to put your fingers entirely inside the mouth during this process. Once your dog's mouth is open, place the pill near the back of the tongue. Close your dog's mouth and lower the head back to the standard position. If your pet doesn't automatically swallow, try rubbing the throat gently and blowing on the nose. This should trigger your dog's swallow reflex. Remember to check your pet's mouth afterward to make sure the pill has been swallowed, then reward your dog with a tasty treat for a job well done. Granulomatous Meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the formation of granuloma(s) \u2014 a ball-like collection of immune cells formed when the immune system tries to wall off foreign substances \u2014 which can be localized, diffused, or involving multiple locations, such as the brain, spinal cord and surrounding membranes (meninges). This disease is the most well-recognized and accepted CNS inflammatory disorder in dogs. However, dogs between the ages of 6 months and 10 years are most commonly affected by GME. And although both sexes can be affected, there is a slightly higher prevalence in females. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES The symptoms depend on the form of the disease and its location. For example, the ocular form of GME will affect the eye region, while multifocal GME will affect the brain or brain and spinal cord, and focal GME will focus singly on either the brain or spinal cord. Common symptoms associated with GME include: - Blindness - Drowsiness - Circling - Seizures - Behavioral changes - Weakness of hind limbs (paraparesis) - Weakness of all four limbs (tetraparesis) - Constant Head pressing against objects CAUSES The exact cause of GME is currently unknown. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis \u2014 the results of which are typically within normal ranges unless an infection is present. In those cases, the white blood cell count will be abnormally elevated. The preferred method for diagnosis, however, is an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan, which will reveal single, multiple, or well-circumscribed lesions within the nervous system. Your veterinarian may also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord. Though not a good test to confirm a diagnosis of GME, it can confirm inflammation associated with the disease. In addition, conducting a brain biopsy can help confirm GME, but it is rarely done due to the dangers involved with removing a small sample of brain tissue. TREATMENT Often, immediate intensive care and hospitalization are required for dogs with severe forms of GME. For debilitated patients, intravenous fluid therapy is initiated to counter the body fluid deficits. Long-term steroid therapy, meanwhile, is used to alleviate the symptoms \u2014 though never after the use of NSAIDs and only under the supervision of your veterinarian. In case of the focal nature of the disease, radiation therapy can also be suggested by your veterinarian. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT The overall prognosis is highly variable and will depend on the form of the disease and its location. In addition to following the veterinarian's instructions for the dosage and frequency of the medication, it is vital you provide extra care once your dog is home. If it is still active, your veterinarian may recommend restricting its movements to prevent injury or trauma. Dogs that are immobile, meanwhile, should be allowed to rest in a padded cage or bed and turned every four hours to prevent bed sores. Your veterinarian will recommend follow-up exams once or twice a month to conduct neurological tests and to verify that the dog is being adequately nourished. Happy Tail in Dogs A wagging tail isn't always a happy, welcome-home greeting. Sometimes it means a face full of fur for pet parents or a broken glass flung across the room by a swift swing. Despite these occasional destructive faux pas, dogs' tails are more than battering rams and wiggly appendages. They're communication devices, and with some careful observation, they'll tell you a little bit about how a dog is feeling. WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS \"The tail serves lots of functions, such as acting as a rudder in the water when the dog is swimming and acting for balance when a dog is running,\" says Dr. Lisa Radosata, owner of Florida Veterinary Behavior Service. \"If you watch a dog take a tight turn at high speed, you will likely see him use his tail for stability.\" The tail is also one component of the body language dogs use to communicate, along with facial expressions and body postures. Maybe one of the most common misconceptions about dogs and their tails is that a wagging tail means a happy dog. This isn't always the case, though. \"Tail wags are a frequent cause of misunderstanding between dogs and humans,\" says Dr. Carlo Siracusa, head of the Animal Behavior Medicine Service at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. \"Tail wagging is what a lot of people look at the most for gauging whether a dog is friendly or not, and even veterinarians rely on it, but this often isn't very helpful.\" You should view a wagging tail as a sign of willingness to interact, says Radosta, but not a signal of a particular mood or state. \"In other words, a tail wag means that the dog is open to interaction, not that the dog is friendly.\" Here's another way to look at it. A wagging tail simply indicates that a dog is mentally aroused and engaged with what is going on in his environment, not how he will react to whatever is going on. Siracusa says it's difficult to parse meaning from just a tail wag, and even other dogs, who have a better ability to read those signals than humans do, sometimes make mistakes. This is especially true when the dog doing the wagging has a docked tail, or if it's a breed with a curly tail, like a pug, that doesn't have a full range of motion. DOG TAILS AND THE TALES THEY TELL The \"language\" of a wagging tail can be complex, and the tail doesn't \"speak\" in isolation from the other components of body language. \"We tend to give more meaning to a wagging tail than it really has,\" Siracusa says, and to try and figure out how a dog might feel beyond \"ready to interact\" you have to consider the rest of his body language. That said, a lot of the time you can glean some info by looking at the tail, how it's positioned, how relaxed it is, and how fast it's going: Tail Height: A wagging tail held high, Siracusa says, often signals enthusiasm. The height of a wagging tail can also signal a dog's level of confidence says Dr. Karen London, a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist and Certified Pet Dog Trainer in Flagstaff, Ariz. A higher tail usually means a dog is confident, while a lower tail indicates a more timid or nervous dog. It's important to keep a close eye on a tail held high or over the dog's back, Radosta says. \"A tail wag which just involves the tip, with the tail high above the back, or less than 90 degrees from the back indicates high arousal. This dog may want to interact, but not necessarily in a controlled or friendly manner. I would avoid a dog who was wagging his tail this way or if I was the owner, I would work to help him calm down.\" Tail Stiffness: Generally, a loose, flowing wag is good, London says, but a stiff wag can communicate tension or hostility. Tail speed: A fast wag is generally good, London says, but a slow wag usually signals that a dog will not be friendly. Then there's the \"full body wag,\" where the butt or whole body is relaxed and moves back and forth. \"A big tail wag where the butt is moving and the tail is making wide sweeping motions\" generally indicates a friendly dog who's ready for friendly interaction with a person or other dog, Radosta says. London agrees and says that the closer to the front of the body the back-and-forth rocking starts, the friendlier the dog. Keep in mind that these wags can have different meanings depending on the situation, and you should always look at the other signals that a dog is giving. \"Wags can mean different things in different contexts, just like words,\" Siracusa says. \"It's like if I say, 'One of these days I'm going to kill you.' That can be read as a joke or an actual threat, depending on the situation.\" Wags and their meanings can also differ from dog to dog. \"It [wagging] is a pretty universal behavior. What isn't universal is temperament between and within breeds,\" Radosta says. \"One individual dog may wag his tail a little lower or a little higher or a little faster than another individual. It is important for owners to get to know their dog's body language.\" Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis in Dogs Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is identified by blood in the vomit and/or stool, often due to a foodborne illness. Because it is a serious disorder that can be potentially fatal, immediate veterinary care is required. SYMPTOMS Continuous vomiting and/or diarrhea are the most common symptoms. Other symptoms include: - Lethargy - Listlessness - Anorexia - Weight loss - Fluid loss - Electrolyte imbalance - Dehydration - Hemoconcentration - Hypovolemic shock CAUSES Infectious gastroenteritis is caused by pathogens (infectious agents). Some of the pathogens most commonly associated with infectious gastroenteritis include: - Bacteria (e.g., Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, Clostridia) - Virus (e.g., Parvovirus, Canine distemper) - Fungi (e.g., Penicillium, (e.g., Roundworms, Hookworms, Tapeworms, Whipworms, their Coccidia) E. coli, Salmonella, and Corynebacterium are the most significant intestinal pathogens because they can be passed from animal to human or vice versa. Salmonella infections are also important due to their association with reproductive disorders. Sudden dietary changes and/or dietary toxins may cause irritation and/or affect the immune system. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, a chronic form of illness, has been associated with allergens in dog foods. Gastroenteritis may be also observed due to irritation caused by stress, toxins, physical obstruction, ulcers, and abdominal disorders. Gastroenteritis is not specific to any breed or gender, however, small breed dogs are more prone to infectious gastroenteritis. DIAGNOSIS It may be difficult to identify the cause of gastroenteritis. Therefore, invasive diagnostic procedures may be required if routine diagnostic procedures are not successful. A brief outline of diagnostic procedures: Medical history: - Physical obstruction, tumors, ulcers, intestinal blockage, etc. - Information about the severity, progression, and magnitude of the vomiting and diarrhea - The vaccination record may help in ruling out a parvoviral infection Physical observations: - A skin test to determine the presence and extent of dehydration - An abdominal palpation to check abdominal pain and/or abdominal obstruction - An examination of mucus membranes to determine hemorrhagic losses - Cardiovascular function provides information on dehydration and/or blood loss - Visual observation of the vomit and/or stool to determine if there is blood present Routine blood/biochemical tests: - Packed cell volume (hematocrit) data to confirm hemorrhagic gastroenteritis - Biochemical tests (i.e., liver, kidney, blood protein, and blood sugar) Fecal study: - Cultural assays to identify any potential microbiological or parasitic organisms Radiographs/endoscopy: - To locate any potential physical obstruction, tumor, ulcer, intestinal blockage, etc. TREATMENT In most cases, dogs recover and respond very well. The course of treatment, however, is dependent on the underlying cause of the condition. A brief outline of treatment is given below: - Fluid and electrolyte therapies are important, especially in cases of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. - Antibiotic therapy may be restricted to animals with systemic infections. - Corticosteroid therapy is useful in cases of shock. Usually, hypovolemic shock develops due to dehydration. - Medications that soothe the intestine and bind noxious agents can also be used in supportive therapy. - Parasitic infections are treated with anthelmintics. - Physical obstruction, ulcers, and tumors may need surgical treatment. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT An improved diet may reduce intestinal infections and other gastrointestinal disorders. The main priority should be to provide healing time for the dog's inflamed intestinal area. Thus, food and water should not be given for at least a period of 24 hours to rest the intestine. Then, provide a bland diet for three to seven days, followed by a gradual return to the dog's normal diet. Often dietary irritants (especially protein) may lead to the recurrence of the problem. In these cases, a special hypoallergenic medical diet may be required. PREVENTION Some veterinarians have recently emphasized the importance of restoring intestinal microflora through food additives (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics) in order to prevent the infection from recurring. If dog owners are using homemade diets, the ideal micro- and macro-nutrient profile, along with optimum energy density, must be the focus of formulation. These diets provide highly digestible nutrients, fewer fats, and restricted osmolarity. Consult your veterinarian for a proper, well-balanced diet abnormality inside the liver that causes shunting (bypass) between the portal vein (the blood vessel that connects the gastrointestinal tract with the liver) and circulation into the system. It may be caused by microscopic lesions on the liver, abnormal development, abnormal positioning, or throttling due to a prominent smooth muscle that prevents blood flow. The lobes of the liver are involved, some severely, others very little. This is suspected when the bile is not doing its work. In short, because of malformations in the blood vessels, the blood is not flowing to the liver as it should. This is a rare disease of genetic origin in certain small-breed dogs. There is compelling evidence of inheritance in Yorkshire terriers, Maltese dogs, Cairn terriers, Tibetan spaniels, Shih-Tzus, Havanese, and others. It is rarely without symptoms (asymptomatic). The symptoms are usually vague gastrointestinal signs: vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite. Inheritance is not gendered or regionally linked; it is found worldwide. It may be a dominant gene that does not affect all members, since unaffected parents may produce affected offspring, or it may be caused by more than one gene. A total serum bile acids (TSBA) test is used as the marker for this condition. Prevalence in certain small-breed dogs ranges from 30 to 70 percent. It is rare to non-existent in large-breed dogs. It is usually detected in asymptomatic juveniles by four to six months of age, or as early as six weeks. SYMPTOMS While two groups have been described (asymptomatic and symptomatic), it is most likely that dogs with the anomaly will be symptomatic. Symptoms are indicative of gastrointestinal complications: vomiting, lack of appetite (anorexia), diarrhea, and lethargy. Asymptomatic dogs are typically diagnosed in the course of routine screening or diagnostic evaluations for unrelated health problems, or on routine testing in kindreds with a known prevalence of the disorder. The congenital inherited disorder is diagnosed by total serum bile action (TSBA) before clinical signs are attributed to a microvascular tumor (MVD); concurrent illnesses may complicate the interpretation. Dogs with microvascular tumors rarely, if ever, develop an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Asymptomatic dogs usually have an unremarkable history; occasionally, they will display a delayed recovery after anesthesia or sedation, or show drug intolerance. CAUSES Congenital inherited disorder DIAGNOSIS You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms if any, and any information you might have regarding familial lines. This condition is attributed in any asymptomatic young dog with increased total serum bile action values, or in any young dog with hepatic encephalopathy (brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders). Symptomatic dogs over two years of age typically acquire a shunt owing to acute or chronic inflammatory, tumor, or toxic liver ailments. Microscopic features of many disorders causing a lack of fluid in the hepatic portal are similar to hepatoportal microvascular dysplasia. Your veterinarian will perform a liver biopsy for microscopic examination of liver tissue, aspiration needle biopsies for examination of fluid, and wedge or laparoscopically retrieved samples from the liver. TREATMENT No specific medical care is recommended for asymptomatic dogs. You will need to watch for adverse reactions to drugs. Selected drugs or dietary protein restriction is inappropriate to prescribe. You should not treat the symptoms without first consulting your veterinarian. Brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders and protracted vomiting or diarrhea will need to be treated in the hospital for supportive care and diagnostic evaluations; these dogs will most likely have other disorders or complicated MVD. Mild brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders will be controlled with a veterinarian-approved protein-restricted diet and appropriate medical treatment, PREVENTION Recommendations to eliminate MVD from a particular genetic line or breed are not possible at present. Based on information derived from large pedigrees of Yorkshire terriers, Cairn terriers, Tibetan spaniels, Maltese, Shih-Tzu, and Havanese dogs, breeding unaffected parents does not eliminate MVD from a kindred. The genetic defect involves vascular malformations commonly involving the liver, but may not be limited to this organ. In high-incidence kindreds, you will need to remain vigilant for vaguely ill dogs that may have a portosystemic vascular anomaly; surgical exploration can miss this, as can some of the other standard tests. Hip Dysplasia in Dogs Hip dysplasia in Dogs is a disease of the hip in which the ball and socket joint is malformed. This malformation means that the ball portion and its socket don't properly meet one another, resulting in a joint that rubs and grinds instead of sliding smoothly. CANINE HIP DYSPLASIA IN DOGS The hip joint is composed of the ball and the socket. The development of hip dysplasia is determined by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors, though there is a complicated pattern of inheritance for this disorder, with multiple genes involved. Hip dysplasia is the failure of the hip joints to develop normally (known as malformation), gradually deteriorating and leading to loss of function of the hip joints. Hip dysplasia is one of the most common skeletal diseases seen in dogs. Gender does not seem to be a factor, but some breeds are more likely to have the genetic predisposition for hip dysplasia than other breeds. Large and giant breeds are most commonly affected, including the Great Dane, Saint Bernard, Labrador Retriever, and German Shepard. Rarely, small breed dogs can also be affected, but are less likely to show clinical signs. Hip dysplasia often begins while a dog is still young and physically immature. Early onset usually develops after four months of age. There are also cases of later onset, where hip dysplasia develops later due to osteoarthritis, a form of joint inflammation (arthritis) that is characterized by chronic deterioration, or degeneration of the joint cartilage. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Symptoms depend on the degree of joint looseness or laxity, the degree of joint inflammation, and the duration of the disease. - Early disease: signs are related to joint looseness or laxity - Later disease: signs are related to joint degeneration and osteoarthritis - Decreased activity - Difficulty rising - Reluctance to run, jump, or climb stairs - Intermittent or persistent hind-limb lameness, often worse after exercise - \"Bunny-hopping,\" or swaying gait - Narrow stance in the hind limbs (back legs unnaturally close together) - Pain in hip joints - Joint looseness or laxity - characteristic of early disease; may not be seen in long-term hip dysplasia due to arthritic changes in the hip joint - Grating detected with joint movement - Decreased range of motion in the hip joints - Loss of muscle mass in thigh muscles - Enlargement of shoulder muscles due to more weight being exerted on front legs as the dog tries to avoid weight on its hips, leading to extra work for the shoulder muscles and subsequent enlargement of these muscles CAUSES Influences on the development and progression of hip dysplasia are concurrent with both genetic and environmental factors: - Genetic susceptibility for hip looseness or laxity - Rapid weight gain and obesity - Nutritional factors - Pelvic-muscle mass DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Inflammation due to joint disease may be noted in the complete blood count. As part of surveying the physical symptoms and fluid work-ups, your veterinarian will also need a thorough history of your dog's health, the onset of symptoms, and any possible incidents or injuries that may have contributed to your dog's symptoms. Any information you have on your dog's parentage will be helpful as well, as there may be a genetic link. X-rays are crucial for visualizing the signs of hip dysplasia. Some of the possible findings may be a degenerative disease of the spinal cord, lumbar vertebral instability, bilateral stifle disease, and other bone diseases. TREATMENT Your dog may be treated for hip dysplasia on an outpatient basis as long as it does not require surgery. The decision on whether your dog will undergo surgery will depend on your dog's size, age, and intended function (i.e., whether your dog is a working dog, as many large breeds tend to be). It will also depend on the severity of joint looseness, degree of osteoarthritis, your veterinarian's preference for treatment, and your own financial considerations. Physiotherapy (passive joint motion) can decrease joint stiffness and help maintain muscle integrity. Swimming is an excellent form of physical therapy, encouraging joint and muscle activity without increasing the severity of the joint injury. Weight control is an important aspect of recovery and is recommended to decrease the pressure applied to the painful joint as the dog moves. You and your veterinarian will need to work together to minimize any weight gain associated with reduced exercise during recovery. Special diets designed for rapidly growing large-breed dogs may decrease the severity of hip dysplasia. The TPO surgery rotates the socket for dogs less than a year old. The juvenile pubic symphysiodesis surgery is performed on dogs that are younger than six months, fusing part of the pelvis together to improve hip joint stability. A total hip replacement is done in mature dogs that are not responding well to medical therapy and that are suffering from severe osteoarthritis. Most dogs will handle this type of surgery, with acceptable hip function after the recovery period. Excision arthroplasty is performed when hip replacement surgery is cost-prohibitive. In this surgery the ball of the hip joint is removed, leaving muscles to act as the joint. This surgery works best for dogs weighing less than 44 pounds, and for dogs with good hip musculature. Your veterinarian may also prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling and inflammation, along with pain medications for lessening the severity of the pain. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you to monitor any changes in your dog's hip dysplasia. X-rays will be taken for comparison with previous x-rays. If your dog has undergone surgery, these x-rays will indicate the rate of post-surgical healing. If your dog is being treated as an outpatient only, the x-rays may indicate the rate of deterioration in the hip joint. If your dog has been effectively diagnosed with hip dysplasia, it should not be bred out, and the dam and sire (the parents) of your pet should not be bred again, since this condition is often acquired genetically. Special diets designed for rapidly-growing large-breed dogs may decrease the severity of hip dysplasia. Hypertrophic Osteopathy Hypertrophic osteopathy refers to an abnormal enlargement of bone due to new bone formation. It commonly occurs in humans and dogs and has been reported in dogs, horses, cows, sheep, and various other more exotic species. In dogs, the disease is characterized by swelling, primarily affecting all four limbs. Subtle in onset, it is often mistaken for early arthritis. Neoplasia is a common cause of this disease, and therefore, more common in older dogs as neoplasia is more common in older dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Lethargy - Reluctance to move - Swellings at distal portions of limbs, especially forelimbs - Painful limbs - Edema on limbs - Decreased movement in joints due to swelling - Lameness CAUSES The exact cause of new bone formation is still unknown, but this condition has been seen in association with various diseases, including: - Pneumonia - Heartworm disease - Heart disease - Tumor of the urinary bladder - Tumor of liver and prostate gland - Lung tumors metastasizing to the affected areas DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will take a detailed history, asking you about the duration and frequency of symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. The results are usually normal but may vary depending on the underlying disease if present. X-rays of the bone may reveal the new bone formation and help your veterinarian in localizing the disease. He or she may also decide to take bone samples for further evaluation, including investigating for the presence of tumors. TREATMENT Diagnosis of the underlying cause and treating it are major goals for the resolution of the problem. However, as the exact etiology is still unknown, finding the underlying cause and treating it is not always possible. Your veterinarian will prescribe painkillers to alleviate pain and drugs to reduce swelling at affected sites. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the tumor mass. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT It is important to follow the guidelines and administer medication at the right dosage and time to maintain quality of life. But even after treatment of the primary cause, clinical symptoms may continue for one to two weeks. Bone(s), meanwhile, may take months to get back to their original shape, even with the correction of the underlying disorder, and are not known to be fully reversible. Your dog may feel sore and may need therapy for pain management at home. If a metastatic tumor is the underlying cause of hypertrophic osteopathy, the prognosis is very poor. Hypothyroidism in Dogs The thyroid gland is an essential gland in the body, producing a number of hormones, including T3 (liothyronine) and T4 (levothyroxine), both of which are required for normal metabolism in the body. Hypothyroidism is a clinical condition resulting from a lowered production and release of T4 and T3 hormones by the thyroid gland. It is common in medium to large-sized dogs, with some being more predisposed than others. These breeds include Doberman pinschers, Irish setters, miniature schnauzers, boxers, poodles, and cocker spaniels. It is also more commonly diagnosed in middle-aged dogs between the ages of 4-10 years. Neutered male dogs and spayed females are found to be at higher risk than intact dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Lethargy - Generalized weakness - Inactivity - Mental dullness - Unexplained weight gain - Hair loss (alopecia) - Excessive hair shedding - Poor hair growth - Dry or lusterless hair coat - Excessive scaling - Recurring skin infections - Intolerance to cold - Tilting of head to one side (uncommon) - Seizures (uncommon) - Infertility (uncommon) CAUSES - Unknown etiology (origin) - Congenital disease - Iodine deficiency - Cancer - After-effect of medical treatment, including surgery DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Finding the exact cause of hypothyroidism may require a thorough investigation. Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Your doctor may be able to make an initial diagnosis based on the results of these tests, but endocrine testing is also an important panel for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The levels of T3 and T4 will be measured to determine if these are in the lower ranges. Radiographic studies may also be conducted to examine your dog internally for abnormalities that may be causing the dysfunction of the thyroid glands. TREATMENT Good treatment options are available for treating hypothyroidism in dogs. The treatment is usually life-long, with carefully administered medication given in conjunction with dietary restrictions at home. The deficient hormones are given in the synthetic form, with the dosage adjusted occasionally based on your dog's individual physical condition and progress. Most clinical symptoms will resolve after a few months, but only your veterinarian can determine whether your dog's medicine dosage should be adjusted or changed. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Conscientious compliance with the prescribed drugs and diet is required for successful therapy. Your veterinarian will adjust the dosage of the synthetic hormones as necessary for your dog, and will also monitor the use of any medications that have been prescribed. To avoid complicating the condition, do not change the type or dosage of the drug yourself, and never give anything new to your dog without first consulting with your veterinarian. This caution includes the use of herbal remedies. Diet modifications, including a reduction in fat, are recommended during the initial phase of therapy. Most dogs respond well to therapy, with activity levels and mental alertness increasing significantly after only a relatively short time. Idiopathic Cerebellitis (Generalized Tremor Syndrome) GENERALIZED TREMOR SYNDROME IN DOGS Shaker syndrome is a disorder that causes a dog's entire body to shake. It is also known as idiopathic cerebellitis, which describes inflammation of the cerebellum (the part of the brain that is responsible for the coordination and regulation of voluntary muscular movement) for unknown reasons. While dogs of any coat color can be affected, those with a white hair coat are over-represented in the medical literature. For example, Maltese and West Highland white terriers appear to be predisposed. In addition, both genders are affected by shaker syndrome, especially young to middle-aged dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Diffuse body tremors - May be mistaken for anxiety, or low body temperature (hypothermia) CAUSES Although a dog may be affected by the syndrome due to unknown reasons (idiopathic), it is most often associated with mild central nervous system disease. DIAGNOSIS You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's physical and behavioral health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including standard laboratory work, such as a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. A cerebrospinal fluid (fluid from the spinal cord) sample may also be taken by your veterinarian and sent to the laboratory for analysis of the nervous system. Your doctor will use the process of differential diagnosis to rule out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Some other causes of the tremors can be anxiety/fear, seizures, and hypothermia. TREATMENT Depending on how severe the tremors are, and your dog's overall condition, care will be given inpatient or outpatient. If your dog is very ill as a result of tremors, or if there is an underlying condition or infection, your dog will be hospitalized until its health stabilizes. The primary treatment for neurological shaker syndrome is the use of corticosteroids for reducing the inflammatory response in the body. Most dogs recover in a week although some rare patients never entirely recover. The steroids will be gradually reduced over the course of a few months until they are not being used anymore. Steroid treatment will be reinstated if symptoms recur, and in some cases, steroid treatment will need to be continued for a longer period and possibly even the lifetime of the dog in order to maintain health. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Your veterinarian will schedule weekly evaluations for your dog for the first month after the initial treatment. Thereafter, your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments with you for your pet until the corticosteroids are discontinued. Inappropriate Chewing Behavior in Dogs Chewing is one of a dog's natural instincts. They do it to investigate the world around them, but unfortunately may turn their curiosity to your furniture, your shoes, or other objects you don't want to be chewed apart. Luckily, dogs can be trained to chew only on appropriate objects. Why Dogs Chew Boredom is the leading cause of destructive chewing behavior in dogs. Many dogs-especially high-activity animals like hunting and working breeds-have pent-up energy that they need to expel. If they don't get a chance to run and play, they'll take it out on the couch cushions or the kitchen table. If your dog is already well-trained and suddenly beings chewing destructively, this can be a symptom of an underlying health concern. Separation anxiety, stress, or even disease can cause sudden-onset chewing, so let your bet know right away if your normally well-behaved dog has started chewing inappropriately. Bringing Home a New Puppy Puppies begin chewing as soon as their baby teeth come in. Consequently, puppy owners often have the most trouble with destructive chewing. Puppies have not yet learned to distinguish between what is right or wrong. Before you bring home a new puppy, go through the home and pick up anything that is off-limits for chewing. Furthermore, don't give your puppy their very own sock or show to chew on; this makes it too easy for your dog to get confused. Resolving Inappropriate Chewing Make sure your dog gets plenty of attention and exercise every day. Allowing them to release pent-up energy and aggression in an appropriate manner will go a long way toward curbing the chewing habit. Proper crate training is also key-this way, your dog learns a schedule and knows that playtime is forthcoming, making them less likely to act out destructively. Ensure that your dog has plenty of appropriate chewing items. If the only thing around to chew on are shoes, your purse, and the table leg, your down won't have much choice! Chew toys and rawhide toys are excellent for keeping your dog occupied. Food puzzle toys allow the owner to put a treat in the middle of the toy, holding the dog's interest as they try to uncover it. If your dog can't seem to stop the destructive chewing behavior, let your vet know. You may need the help of a certified animal trainer or behaviorist. Internal Parasites That Affect Dogs Parasites are a common and important cause of disease in dogs. Although most people know about external parasites like fleas and ticks, many do not realize that intestinal parasites can also cause significant health problems. What are intestinal parasites? Intestinal parasites are parasites that live inside the host animal's gastrointestinal tract. Examples include worms, like roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and protozoa, such as giardia and coccidia. How do dogs get intestinal parasites? Dogs can contract intestinal parasites via different routes. Parasites are usually transmitted when an animal inadvertently ingests parasite eggs or spores in contaminated soil, water, feces, or food. In the case of tapeworms, they can also be transmitted when a dog eats an infected flea. Puppies, on the other hand, usually get intestinal parasites from their mother. Transmission can occur in utero or from nursing. Why should you care? Intestinal parasites can cause malnutrition, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia. Besides making our pets sick, many of these parasites can affect people. According to [kidshealth.org](http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/parasitic/toxocariasis.html#), \"20% of dogs pass Toxocara eggs in their stool.\" Toxocara can cause damage to the eyes and untreated can lead to vision loss, especially in children. What are the symptoms of intestinal parasites? While external parasites, like fleas and ticks, are easy to spot, intestinal parasites are rarely seen because they live inside your pet's intestinal tract and pass microscopic eggs or spores in your pet's stool that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Tapeworms are one exception-they shed segments that resemble sesame seeds or grains of rice and are typically seen in your pet's stool or around their rectum. Roundworms are another exception since they may occasionally be seen in your pet's vomit or stool. Nevertheless, intestinal parasites are difficult to spot and you should not rely on seeing them before taking your dog to the veterinarian. Besides being hard to detect, many dogs infected with intestinal parasites are asymptomatic. Even symptomatic dogs may go undetected because their symptoms can be nonspecific. The most common signs and symptoms of intestinal parasites are: - Scooting - Vomiting - Diarrhea - A distended abdomen - Weight loss - Occasionally coughing Since dogs infected with intestinal parasites can exhibit no symptoms or subtle symptoms that can be easily overlooked; the best way to ensure that your dog is parasite-free is to take him to the veterinarian at least once a year for check-ups. Your veterinarian will examine your dog and perform fecal testing. A fecal examination allows your veterinarian to diagnose intestinal parasites by looking for microscopic eggs or spores in your pet's stool. How can you prevent intestinal parasites? While the thought that your pet may have intestinal parasites may give you the heebie-jeebies, intestinal parasites are treatable and even easier to prevent. In fact, many people are already protecting their pets and family from intestinal parasites and don't even know about it. Did you know that most monthly heartworm medications also contain a broad dewormer that protects your pets not only from heartworm disease but also from many intestinal parasites? If your dog is not already on monthly parasite preventatives, take him to your veterinarian to discuss how you can protect your pets and family from intestinal parasites. Also, before you bring a new pet into the household it's important to have them checked by your veterinarian so that they do not expose your other pets or family to parasites. Although intestinal parasites are treatable, remember that the best way to protect your pets against parasites is to keep them on parasite preventatives and have their stool checked at least once a year. Kennel Cough Kennel cough, the common name given to infectious canine tracheobronchitis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease among dogs. As the name suggests, it is typified by inflammation of the trachea and bronchi. This disease is found throughout the world and is known to infect a high percentage of dogs at least once during their lifetime. It is also sometimes referred to as bordetellosis. Young puppies often suffer the most severe complications that can result from this disease since they have immature immune systems. Also at increased risk are older dogs, who may have decreased immune capabilities, pregnant bitches, who also have lowered immunity, and dogs with preexisting respiratory diseases. SYMPTOMS - A persistent cough is the most common symptom - Retching - Watery nasal discharge - In mild cases, dogs are often active and eat normally - In severe cases, symptoms progress and can include pneumonia, inappetence, fever, lethargy, and even death CAUSES Some of the most common microorganisms that contribute to infectious canine tracheobronchitis are Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria, canine adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and mycoplasma. Any of these organisms can cause the symptoms of this disease, alone or in combination. Infections with multiple organisms tend to cause the most severe symptoms. Dogs often develop clinical signs associated with kennel cough 3-4 days after exposure to a large number of other dogs (e.g., at a boarding facility or show). DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of this disease is largely based upon the type of symptoms that are present and a dog's history with regard to exposure to other dogs. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and the onset of clinical signs. Your veterinarian may order some combination of blood chemistry tests, a complete blood cell count, a urinalysis, fecal examinations, and chest X-rays. If a dog does not respond to treatment as expected, additional testing (e.g., bacterial cultures) may be necessary to identify the microorganisms that are causing kennel cough TREATMENT Treatment depends on the severity of the infection. If your dog is alert, active, eating well, and has only minor symptoms, your veterinarian may only prescribe general supportive care like rest and good hydration, and nutrition. More severely affected dogs benefit from medications that reduce inflammation and coughing. If a bacterial infection is present, antibiotics may help shorten the course of the disease. Dogs with pneumonia often need to be hospitalized for more aggressive treatment. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT In order to prevent the spread of this disease, dogs with kennel cough should be isolated until they are better and no longer contagious. Dogs who are at high risk for infection (e.g., those who attend shows or spend time in boarding or daycare facilities) should be vaccinated against Bordetella bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus. All dogs should be vaccinated against canine adenovirus. Even after being vaccinated, dogs may still acquire kennel cough (although usually a less severe form than they would have otherwise). It is best to be observant and prepared. Although this infection usually does not cross over to humans, there are instances where young children and adult Legg-Perthes Disease Legg-Perthes disease is a condition that affects the hip of the dog at the ball-in-socket joint where the femur (thigh bone) meets the pelvis. Also known as Legg-Perthes Disease, this disorder causes the femoral head (the ball of the hip joint) to spontaneously disintegrate, ultimately collapsing the joint and resulting in a very painful and dysfunctional condition. Because of the pain involved, dogs may become irritable and \"not themselves.\" Progressive limping may occur, with a dog bearing no weight on the affected limb within roughly two months. Atrophy, or loss of muscle mass, is visible in the thigh. Is your dog at risk for Legg-Perthes disease? Legg-Perthes disease is found in puppies of miniature, toy, and small dog breeds such as small terriers (e.g. Yorkshire), Miniature Pinschers, and Toy Poodles. There is also evidence of hereditary predisposition, so the breeding of affected dogs is discouraged. Males and females alike can be affected, and most patients are 5-8 months old. The cause of Legg-Perthes disease While the precise cause of Legg-Perthes disease is unknown, evidence suggests that the disease occurs when the blood supply to the head of the femur is inadequate, causing the bone in that area to die. This results in weakened bone, followed by fracture and collapse of the femoral head. Other hip conditions can cause signs that can appear similar to Legg-Perthes diseases, such as fractures, dislocations, or hip dysplasia. Another disorder that commonly affects small breed dogs is a dislocated knee cap ( [medial luxating patella or MPL](http://www.pethealthnetwork.com/dog-health/dog-breeds/small-breed-dogs-what-you-should-know-when-you-adopt)). Diagnosing Legg-Perthes disease When examining a dog that is suspected to have Legg-Perthes disease, your vet or surgeon will perform several orthopedic tests. Among these, extending the hind leg backward will invariably make a dog with the disease react painfully. Since other hip conditions can make a dog react the same way, the next step is to take hip x-rays. This is ideally done under sedation to get good-quality pictures and avoid pain. Collapse and fracturing of the hip can be detected on X-rays. Treating Legg-Perthes disease with surgery Once the disease is confirmed, treatment can begin. Since the disease causes pain and loss of bone, conservative treatments such as rest and pain medications will not help long term. The treatment of choice is a surgical procedure called a Femoral Head Ostectomy (FHO). During an FHO, the ball (or head) and neck of the femur are removed. When both hips are affected, one surgery at a time is preferred, usually 2 months apart. After surgery, the healing process begins. Scar tissue will build up in the space where the femoral head and neck were removed, creating a \"false joint\" or \"fake joint.\" The scar tissue also prevents the rubbing of bone on bone. The FHO, therefore, eliminates the pain caused by Legg-Perthes disease. The secret to a successful FHO surgery is appropriate physical therapy. After surgery, your veterinarian or surgeon will explain a regimen of activity restrictions and physical therapy that should be strictly adhered to. This is necessary to get your dog as mobile and functional as possible. If you have a hard time performing physical therapy yourself, then seek help from a rehabilitation specialist. In good hands, few complications occur with FHO surgery, besides the normal risks with any surgery or anesthesia. Overall, Legg-Perthes disease has a good to great outcome after surgery and physical therapy. Questions to ask your veterinarian - Is the condition in one hip or both? - Who is the best person to perform the FHO? - Can you recommend a good place for physical therapy? Leptospirosis in Dogs Leptospirosis is an infection of bacterial spirochetes, which dogs acquire when subspecies of the Leptospira interrogans penetrate the skin and spread through the body by way of the bloodstream. Two of the most commonly seen members of this subspecies are the L. grippotyphosa and L. Pomona bacteria. Spirochetes are spiral, or corkscrew-shaped bacteria that infiltrate the system by burrowing into the skin. Leptospires spread throughout the entire body, reproducing in the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, eyes, and reproductive system. Soon after the initial infection, fever and bacterial infection of the blood develop, but these symptoms soon resolve with the reactive increase of antibodies, which clear the spirochetes from most of the system. The extent to which this bacteria affects the organs will depend on your dog's immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully. Even then, Leptospira spirochetes can remain in the kidneys, reproducing there and infecting the urine. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal for animals if the infection progresses, causing severe damage to these organs. Younger animals with less developed immune systems are at the highest risk for severe complications. The Leptospira spirochete bacteria is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans and other animals. Children are most at risk of acquiring the bacteria from an infected pet. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Sudden fever and illness - Sore muscles, reluctance to move - Stiffness in muscles, legs, stiff gait - Shivering - Weakness - Depression - Lack of appetite - Increased thirst and urination, may be indicative of chronic renal (kidney) failure, progressing to the inability to urinate - Rapid dehydration - Vomiting, possibly with blood - Diarrhea - with or without blood in stool - Bloody vaginal discharge - Dark red speckled gums (petechiae) - Yellow skin and/or whites of eyes - anemic symptoms - Spontaneous cough - Difficulty breathing, fast breathing, irregular pulse - Runny nose - Swelling of the mucous membrane - Mild swelling of the lymph nodes CAUSES Leptospira spirochete infection mainly occurs in subtropical, tropical, and wet environments. Leptospira spirochetes are more prevalent in marshy/muddy areas which have stagnant surface water and are frequented by wildlife. Heavily irrigated pastures are also common sources of infection. The infection rate for domestic pets has been increasing in the U.S. And Canada, with infections occurring most commonly in the fall season. Dogs will typically come into contact with the leptospira bacteria in infected water, soil, or mud, while swimming, passing through, drinking contaminated water, or coming into contact with urine from an infected animal. This last method of contact might take place in the wild. Hunting and sporting dogs, dogs that live near wooded areas, and dogs that live on or near farms are at an increased risk of acquiring this bacteria. Also at increased risk are dogs that have spent time in a kennel. DIAGNOSIS Because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, your veterinarian will be especially cautious when handling your pet, and will strongly advise you to do the same. Protective latex gloves must be worn at all times, and all body fluids will be treated as biologically hazardous material. Urine, semen, post-abortion discharge, vomit, and any fluid that leaves the body will need to be handled with extreme caution. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, recent activities, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what stage of infection your dog is experiencing, and which organs are being most affected. Your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, an electrolyte panel, and a fluorescent antibody urine test. Urine and blood cultures will also be ordered for examining the prevalence of the bacteria. A microscopic agglutination test, or titer test, will also be performed to measure the body's immune response to the infection, by measuring the presence of antibodies in the bloodstream. This will help to definitively identify leptospira spirochetes and the level of systemic infection. TREATMENT Dogs with acute severe diseases should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be the primary treatment, in order to reverse any effects of dehydration. If your dog has been vomiting, an anti-vomiting drug, called an antiemetic, may be administered, and a gastric tube can be used to nourish your dog if its inability to eat or keep food down continues. A blood transfusion may also be necessary if your dog has been severely hemorrhaging. Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian, with the type of antibiotic depending on the stage of infection. Penicillins can be used for initial infections, but they are not effective for eliminating the bacteria once it has reached the carrier stage. Tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, or similar antibiotics will be prescribed for this stage since they are better distributed into the bone tissue. Antibiotics will be prescribed for a course of at least four weeks. Some antibiotics can have side effects that appear serious, especially those drugs that go deeper into the system to eliminate an infection. Be sure to read all of the warnings that come with the prescription, and talk to your veterinarian about the indications you will need to watch for. The prognosis is generally positive, barring severe organ damage. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT A vaccination for the prevention of leptospirosis infection is available in some areas. Your veterinarian can advise you on the availability and usefulness of this vaccine. Make sure to inspect kennels before placing your dog in one - the kennel should be kept very clean and should be free of rodents (look for rodent droppings). Urine from an infected animal should not come into contact with any other animals, or people. Activity should be restricted to cage rest while your dog recovers from the physical trauma of this infection. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, transmissible to humans, and other animals via urine, semen, and post-birth or post-abortion discharge. While your dog is in the process of being treated, you will need to keep it isolated from children and other pets, and you will need to wear protective latex gloves when handling your dog in any way, or when handling fluid or waste products from your dog. Areas where your dog has urinated, vomited or has possibly left any other type of fluid should be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly with iodine-based disinfectants or bleach solutions. Gloves should be worn during the cleaning process and disposed of properly after. Finally, if you do have other pets or children in the home, they may have been infected with the leptospira bacteria and are not yet showing symptoms. It may be worthwhile to have them (and yourself) tested for the presence of the bacteria. And, it is important to keep in mind that leptospires may continue to be shed through the urine for several weeks after treatment and apparent recovery from the infection. Appropriate handling practices will be the best prevention of the spread of infection, or reinfection. Lyme Disease in Dogs Lyme disease is one of the most common tick-transmitted diseases in the world but only causes symptoms in 5-10% of affected dogs. It is caused by a spirochete (bacteria) species of the Borrelia burgdorferi group. When infection leads to disease in dogs, the dominant clinical feature is recurrent lameness due to inflammation of the joints. There may also be a lack of appetite and depression. More serious complications include damage to the kidneys, and rarely, heart or nervous system disease. Kidney disease appears to be more prevalent in Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, golden retrievers, Shetland sheepdogs, and Bernese Mountain Dogs. Experimentally, young dogs appear to be more susceptible to Lyme disease than older dogs. Transmission of the disease has been reported in dogs throughout the United States and Europe but is most prevalent in the upper Midwestern states, the Atlantic seaboard, and the Pacific coastal states. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Many dogs who develop Lyme disease have recurrent lameness due to inflammation of the joints. Sometimes the lameness lasts for only three to four days but recurs days to weeks later, either in the same leg or on other legs. This is known as \"shifting-leg lameness.\" One or more joints may be swollen, warm, and painful. Some dogs may also develop kidney problems. Lyme disease sometimes leads to glomerulonephritis - inflammation and accompanying dysfunction of the kidney's glomeruli (essentially, a blood filter). Eventually, kidney failure may set in as the dog begins to exhibit such signs as vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, weight loss, increased urination and thirst, and abnormal fluid buildups. Other symptoms associated with Lyme disease include: - Stiff walk with an arched back - Sensitivity to touch - Difficulty breathing - Fever, lack of appetite, and depression - Superficial lymph nodes close to the site of the infecting tick bite may be swollen - Heart abnormalities are reported, but rare - Nervous system complications (rare) CAUSES Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, is transmitted by slow-feeding, hard-shelled deer ticks (Ixodes spp.).Infection typically occurs after the Borrelia-carrying tick has been attached to the dog for 2-3 days. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated them. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected. Your veterinarian may run some combination of blood chemistry tests, a complete blood cell count, a urinalysis, fecal examinations, X-rays, and tests specific to diagnosing Lyme disease (e.g., serology). Fluid from the affected joints may also be drawn for analysis. There are many causes of arthritis, and your veterinarian will focus on differentiating arthritis initiated by Lyme disease from other inflammatory arthritic disorders, such as trauma, degenerative joint disease, or osteochondrosis dissecans (a condition found in large, fast-growing breeds of puppies). Immune-mediated diseases will also be considered as possible causes of the symptoms. An X-ray of the painful joints will allow your doctor to examine the bones for abnormalities. TREATMENT If the diagnosis is Lyme disease, your dog will be treated as an outpatient unless its condition is unstable (e.g., severe kidney disease). Doxycycline is the most common antibiotic that is prescribed for Lyme disease, but others are also available and effective. The recommended treatment length is usually four weeks, but longer courses may be necessary in some cases. Your veterinarian may also prescribe an anti-inflammatory (pain reliever) if your dog is especially uncomfortable. Unfortunately, antibiotic treatment does not always completely eliminate infection with Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Symptoms may resolve but then return at a later date, and the development of kidney disease in the future is always a worry. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Improvement in sudden (acute) inflammation of the joints caused by Borrelia should be seen within three to five days of antibiotic treatment. If there is no improvement within three to five days, your veterinarian will want to reevaluate your dog. PREVENTION If possible, avoid allowing your dog to roam in tick-infested environments where Lyme disease is common. Check your dog's coat and skin daily and remove ticks by hand. Your veterinarian can also recommend a variety of sprays, collars, and spot-on topical products that kill and repel ticks. Such products should be used under a veterinarian's supervision and according to the label's directions. Lyme vaccines are available, but their use is somewhat controversial. Talk to your veterinarian to see if Lyme vaccination is right for your dog. Mammary Tumors in Female Dogs Benign and malignant tumors of the mammary glands occur fairly frequently in unspayed female dogs, in fact, they are the most common type of tumor in the group. Spaying can largely reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer, especially if the dog is spayed before it has an opportunity to go into heat. There are two main types of mammary gland breast tumors, each with several subtypes of tumor growth. The mammary glands' function is to produce milk to feed newborn puppies. They are located in two rows that extend from the chest to the lower abdominal area; the nipples indicate their location on the trunk of the body. While this condition is more likely to occur in the female population, it does also affect male dogs, albeit rarely. When a male dog is affected by a tumor of the breast, the prognosis is much more guarded and grave. A genetic basis is possible in some breeds, and there are frequently some genes that can be identified in dogs that are predisposed to cancer of the mammary glands. For example, toy and miniature poodles, English springer spaniels, Brittanys, cocker spaniels, English setters, pointers, German shepherd dogs, Maltese, and Yorkshire terriers have been reported to have an increased risk of developing breast or mammary tumors compared to other breeds. The median age is about 10.5 years (range, 1 to 15 years of age); it is less common in dogs younger than five. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Usually, slow-growing single or multiple masses in the mammary glands - about half of patients have multiple tumors - May have a superficial loss of tissue on the surface of the skin over the mammary tissue, frequently with inflammation - Mass may be freely movable, which implies benign behavior - May be fixed to skin or body wall, which implies malignant behavior or cancer About half of the affected dogs will be diagnosed with the benign form of mammary tumors, which may be classified as complex adenomas, simple adenomas, fibroadenomas, and duct papillomas. Approximately another half of dogs to be diagnosed with mammary tumors will have a malignant form of tumor, which may be osteosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, solid carcinomas, and papillary cystic adenocarcinomas, amongst others. CAUSES Unknown, although likely hormonal or genetics DIAGNOSIS Benign and malignant tumors of the mammary glands occur fairly frequently in unspayed female dogs, in fact, they are the most common type of tumor in the group. Spaying can largely reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer, especially if the dog is spayed before it has an opportunity to go into heat. There are two main types of mammary gland breast tumors, each with several subtypes of tumor growth. The mammary glands' function is to produce milk to feed newborn puppies. They are located in two rows that extend from the chest to the lower abdominal area; the nipples indicate their location on the trunk of the body. While this condition is more likely to occur in the female population, it does also affect male dogs, albeit rarely. When a male dog is affected by a tumor of the breast, the prognosis is much more guarded and grave. A genetic basis is possible in some breeds, and there are frequently some genes that can be identified in dogs that are predisposed to cancer of the mammary glands. For example, toy and miniature poodles, English springer spaniels, Brittanys, cocker spaniels, English setters, pointers, German shepherd dogs, Maltese, and Yorkshire terriers have been reported to have an increased risk of developing breast or mammary tumors compared to other breeds. The median age is about 10.5 years (range, 1 to 15 years of age); it is less common in dogs younger than five. TREATMENT Surgery is the primary mode of treatment. The tumor(s) will need to be removed. Depending on the age of your dog, the type of tumor present, and the rate at which the tumors have metastasized, your doctor may remove the tumor only, or all of the tumor along with the surrounding tissue, lymph nodes, and mammary glands. Some types of tumors are more invasive, rotting deeper into the tissue or bone, making them very difficult to remove. In these cases, partial removal of the cancerous mass and surrounding tissue may be performed, and chemotherapy may be an option, but the use of chemotherapy for breast or mammary tumors is not typically used. Surgical removal of the tumor may be as effective in terms of the disease-free interval as radical bilateral mastectomy is for humans. Spaying intact bitches at the time of surgical removal of the breast or affected mammary tissue is often the preferred method, and this may enhance survival as it decreases the possibility of recurrence. However, this depends on the age of your dog as well. If your dog is older, this method will not be as beneficial. Your veterinarian will consult a veterinary oncologist (cancer specialist) for additional or updated information regarding chemotherapy in dogs. PREVENTION Spaying before the first heat or estrous cycle will greatly reduce your dog's risk for developing breast or mammary tumors compared to an intact bitch; spaying before the first heat or estrus is also suggested to markedly decrease the likelihood of developing mammary tumors. Early spaying is the best method for the prevention of this form of cancer. If spaying is delayed until before the second heat or estrous cycle the risk of developing breast or mammary tumors compared to intact bitches increases to 8 percent. If spaying is delayed until after the second heat or estrous cycle, there is a 26 percent risk of developing breast or mammary tumors compared to an intact bitch, and if spaying takes place after the dog has reached 2.5 years of age, there is no sparing effect on the risk of developing breast or mammary tumors. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Your veterinarian or a consulting veterinary oncologist will recommend a treatment plan that will include managing your dog's health at home, with follow-up progress visits to the veterinarian or oncologist. Physical examinations and chest X-rays will be required one, three, six, nine and twelve months following the initial treatment to check for recurrence or changes in the tissue. The prognosis and course the disease will take varies with the type of breast or mammary tumor your dog has (for example, whether the tumor is benign or malignant), as well as the size of the tumor, and the presence or absence of metastasis. Surgery for tumors that have not spread may be curative. For example, median survival after surgical removal of the breast or mammary tissue (mastectomy) with tubular adenocarcinoma is 24.6 months. Median survival after surgical removal of the breast or mammary tissue (mastectomy) with a solid carcinoma is 6.5 months. Benign tumors have an excellent prognosis after mastectomy. Carcinomas that are less than five centimeters in diameter also usually have a good prognosis for remission, if the excision is complete. However, regional lymph node involvement, which can be confirmed by microscopic evaluation, makes the prognosis worse and full recovery may not be possible. You should never ignore a breast or mammary nodule, or adopt a wait and see attitude towards it. A breast or mammary lump should never be left in place and observed, as it can quickly metastasize when it is the malignant form, spreading throughout the body and becoming untreatable before its severity is recognized. Early detection and thorough surgical intervention is best. Always make a plan for evaluation and possibly surgical removal of any lump in the mammary gland(s), if you have a female dog that you are leaving intact for possible breeding. On the other hand, if breeding is not essential for your dog, early spaying before the first heat or estrus will markedly decrease the likelihood of her developing breast or mammary gland tumors. Motion Sickness in Dogs Much like humans who experience a feeling of illness while on car trips, dogs and cats can also get a queasy stomach when traveling in the car (or even by boat or air). SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Dogs show their uneasiness in various ways. The first signs of motion sickness may be a constant licking of the lips, followed by excessive drooling; yawning; whining or crying out in distress; immobility or acting afraid to move; and finally, vomiting and regurgitation. An extremely emotional dog may even urinate or defecate in the car. CAUSES There are several potential causes of motion sickness in dogs and cats. Young dogs may experience this condition more frequently because their equilibrium needs to develop a bit more as they mature. Some dogs may actually \"grow out\" of the condition if this is the case. The cause of motion sickness can also be emotional (behavioral) and linked to a bad travel experience in early life. DIAGNOSIS Once neurologic and behavioral causes are ruled out, the diagnosis of motion sickness can be easily made by your veterinarian. The history of your dog's reaction to traveling usually points to the problem. TREATMENT Treatment of this condition may be as simple as making your dog familiar with going for rides in the car. If time and training do not help the situation, various medications are available. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) have a sedative action to slightly calm the dog during travel, as well as to reduce drooling. Other over-the-counter (OTC) medications that may be useful include meclizine and dimenhydrinate. These drugs don't cause sedation but can reduce nausea and vomiting. Ginger is a holistic treatment that can be used for nausea. It can be found in pill form (in health food stores), or even in cookie form. Ginger snaps and pills reportedly calm a nervous stomach when given about 30 minutes to an hour before travel. Consult with your veterinarian before feeding ginger to your dog in any form, to be sure that there are no indications that the ginger would be harmful to your dog, and to make sure that you are giving your dog the appropriate amount. In severe cases, stronger sedative drugs such as acepromazine may be prescribed. A veterinarian should be consulted before any drugs are given (either OTC or prescription) just to be sure the dog is healthy, the dosage is correct, and that the medication won't harm the dog. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Providing a safe, comfortable environment for your dog may lead to a better overall attitude toward travel. Opening the windows in the car slightly may help reduce air pressure inside the vehicle and allow for better ventilation. No food should be given for a few hours prior to getting in the car. Toys may help distract and entertain a high-strung dog, and taking frequent breaks for elimination may also help. PREVENTION Time and training may go a long way toward preventing motion sickness. You may need to stock up on certain medications to help calm your dog if it tends to get extremely nervous before rides in the car. Your veterinarian can suggest safe and effective drugs to ensure that travel goes smoothly each and every time. Myoclonus (Muscle Contraction Disease) The term \"myoclonus\" is used to denote a condition in which a portion of a muscle, entire muscle, or group of muscles contracts in a coarse, repetitive, involuntary, and rhythmic manner at rates up to 60 times per minute (sometimes even occurring during sleep). These abnormal contractions occur due to nervous dysfunction and most commonly affect groups of muscles involved in chewing and/or any of the skeletal muscles of the limbs. Myoclonus is also seen in cats, though it is rare. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Involuntary, continuous, coarse, and rhythmic contractions of a muscle, a portion of a muscle, or a group of muscles is the most common sign to look out for. However, there are other symptoms your dog displays that are related to the underlying disease causing myoclonus. CAUSES The most frequent cause of myoclonus in dogs is canine distemper, though it may be drug-induced or due to lead poisoning. Myoclonus is also a congenital condition, one that is often seen in Labrador retrievers and Dalmatians. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including any illnesses it may have recently suffered from and symptoms it has displayed. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis \u2014 the results of which may show abnormalities related to the underlying cause, including inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis). He or she may also take a sample of your dog's cerebrospinal fluid (a protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord) or administer an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) on the animal. TREATMENT The course of treatment for myoclonus will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Dogs with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, for example, are given medication to reduce swelling. Unfortunately, dogs with severe and chronic myoclonus suffer immensely. Your veterinarian may recommend euthanasia in these cases. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT This problem usually continues indefinitely, although remission is possible. Dogs that display myoclonus after succumbing to the canine distemper virus have a poor prognosis. Watch for symptoms that may be associated with the treatment for brain and spinal cord inflammation, and call your veterinarian if they should worsen. The dog may require a new diet or movement restriction depending on the severity of the disease. Nipping and Biting Behavior in Puppies Puppies, like human babies, have sharp little teeth. If you're unlucky enough to be your puppy's teething toy, those teeth might remind you of Jaws! When your puppy's biting becomes focused on the human version of the teething ring, it's time to \"nip\" her behavior in the bud by teaching him or her the right way to use her new chompers. Understanding why your puppy is biting is the first step toward correcting behavior that could not only become persistent but could be a potential hazard to others, as well. \"Play-biting\" is when your puppy uses her mouth to initiate and sustain play. She may grab onto clothing, or your body, to try and interest you in a game of chase or tag, and then continue by chasing you and tagging you with a little bite! When it's clear that your puppy is biting playfully, it's important to redirect her away from this unfavorable behavior toward an acceptable way to play. Things to do to redirect her attention include: - Offer a favorite toy to chew on or play fetch with - Give a quick, high-pitched yelp (not a negative shout of \"no\" or \"stop\") to startle her and stop the behavior. Then praise her for stopping and redirect her to a toy. - Allow your puppy to socialize with other dogs AND humans so she can begin to understand how to interact properly. Puppies need role models, too! - \"Fear-biting\" is when your puppy becomes scared and feels the need to protect herself. You'll know when she is frightened by her appearance: ears back, tail down or between the legs, and body tense. It is important that you reassure her, through words and tone, that she is okay. - Let your puppy come to you as you speak to her in a high, happy voice and assume a nonthreatening position by sitting or kneeling. - Scolding or slapping your puppy for nipping will not improve the situation, and may encourage further aggression. - Inform other people interacting with your puppy that you are working toward correcting this behavior and ask that they not allow biting on fingers, hands, or toes\u2014even if they think it is playful or that she is giving \"love bites.\" - Don't leave your puppy unsupervised during this biting stage. If you feel like you need additional guidance in correcting this behavior, reach out to your veterinarian for help with behavior modification. They may have tips for you or might be able to refer you to a behaviorist with more extensive training. Osteochondrodysplasia (Abnormal Bone Growth) Osteochondrodysplasia (OCD) is a growth and developmental abnormality of the bone and cartilage, which results in a lack of normal bone growth and bone deformities. Where osteo refers to the bone, control refers to the cartilage, and dysplasia is a general term that is applied to abnormal growth. Dog breeds that tend to be predisposed to this disorder are the great Pyrenees, Alaskan malamutes, Achondroplasia is a form of osteochondrodysplasia in which the bones do not grow to the normal size, based on what is expected of the breed. This is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene. The result is abnormally short limbs, a condition called dwarfism. In some breeds, this trait is selectively encouraged, such as with the dachshund, Skye terrier, and Welsh corgi. Other breeds that are to be affected bulldogs, German and Scottish terriers. These disorders are genetically acquired. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Larger than normal head Undershot jaw with a shorter nose Crooked teeth due to the shorter jaw Abnormal bone shape Poor growth or lack of growth Bones appear shorter than normal Enlarged joints Sideways bowing of forelimbs - front legs are more likely affected Spinal deviation to either side of the body CAUSES Osteochondrodysplasia is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning that it can be passed along by either gender and only one parent needs to carry the gene for an offspring to be potentially affected. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give your veterinarian a detailed medical history, including when you first noticed symptoms of growth abnormality and any information you have about your dog's genetic background. Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis to rule out other causes of the disorder. X-rays of the affected limbs will be taken, which will show abnormalities related to bone growth and structure. X-rays of the spine will also show such abnormalities in patients with spinal deviation. To confirm a diagnosis, your veterinarian will take a sample of tissue from the small bones of the body and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further diagnostic testing. TREATMENT After establishing the diagnosis, your veterinarian may decide to correct the problem with surgery. However, the results of such corrective surgery are usually not rewarding. Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications are recommended for many affected patients as bone deformities can cause significant pain for these patients. Your dog's feelings of comfort and its projected lifespan depend on the severity of the problem. If it is relatively minor, it is entirely possible for your dog to go on to live a relatively comfortable and healthy life. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT The prognosis of this disease depends on the extent of the problem. There is no definitive treatment option available for treating this disorder, and the outcome varies according to the severity of the disorder and which bones are affected. For some dogs, bone dysplasia can be incapacitating, while for others, learning to compensate for the smaller limb size and reduction in mobility is successfully achieved. Dogs that are affected with osteochondrodysplasia may be more prone to arthritic developments. This is something to be aware of as your dog ages. Another precaution to keep in mind is the risk of obesity which is a common side effect of this disorder. Make sure that you stay on a healthy diet and be observant of your dog's weight and physical health. If your veterinarian does recommend pain medications, be sure to use them with caution and with full instruction from your veterinarian. One of the most preventable accidents with pets is an overdose of medication. As these disorders are genetically acquired, breeding is not recommended. Pododermatitis Pododermatitis is a medical term for skin inflammation, particularly inflammation in the feet or paws. With treatment, the prognosis is positive. The disease is more common in dogs than it is in cats. SYMPTOMS The following symptoms are commonly seen: - Lameness - Reddened/swollen paws - Painful paws and itchy paws - Fluid buildup in the paws - Small, solid masses - Thickened, raised, or flat top areas - Loss of the top portion of the skin - Discharge from the paws - Inflammation of the soft tissue around the nail CAUSES Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections can cause this skin inflammation to develop. Other potential causes for it can include cancer, trauma, poor grooming, decreased levels of thyroid hormones, increased levels of steroids present, and irritants from the environment. While this medical condition can occur in any breed, it is more common in the following: - English Bulldog - Great Dane - Basset Hound - Mastiff - Bull Terrier - Boxer - Dachshund - Dalmatian - German Shepard DIAGNOSIS In some instances, a skin biopsy is performed to ensure that pododermatitis is brought on by cancer. A thorough skin examination may be done as well. TREATMENT Treatment is generally done on an outpatient basis and can include foot soaks, hot packing, bandaging, and a hypoallergenic diet. In the event that there is a more serious underlying medical condition, its symptoms will be treated first. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Maintaining healthy habits for the dog will help the medical condition from recurring. PREVENTION Good breeding practices and frequent medical checkups can prevent the recurrence of the condition. However, if the inflammation is occurring because of an allergen, removing it from the dog's environment is recommended. Properly Raising a Puppy Most owners believe that obedience training is best left to the professionals. This is entirely not true because anybody can do it, given the commitment to success. It is definitely not an easy task, but if you have the confidence and focus to be a \"pack leader,\" all it takes is for you to dedicate your time and attention to the task. At home, you must first instill the principles of good behavior as part of your puppy's training. As you begin the serious task of teaching your puppy how to obey commands, you will find that it is difficult to teach obedience to an unruly puppy. In fact, if you want to have your puppy certified as a good citizen, aside from the training that he receives from you at home, your puppy must also attend training classes. Beginner classes usually start when the puppy is around 14 to 16 weeks old. These classes also give your puppy the opportunity to socialize with other puppies of the same age or breed, making it easier for you to take your puppy out to dog parks and other public places where dogs are welcome. LEARNING FROM OTHERS As a pet owner, you also get to socialize with the other owners in the class, giving you the chance to exchange ideas with them about training your puppies. You can also exchange stories about your experiences in training and raising your puppies, which can be a big help to you. By observing the other puppies in the class, you will be able to compare your puppy's behavior with the others in the class and know what is normal and what your puppy is either capable or incapable of at his age. Puppy class is also a great venue for you to receive feedback on your progress in training your dog at home. The other owners, along with the trainers, can give you insights on what you are doing right, or wrong, in your training. An experienced trainer can easily point out mistakes that you may not be able to see for yourself. It can be very helpful to receive training advice from an expert in the field of dog training. TRAINING AT HOME Some areas do not have classes for puppy training. If that is the case, then you can just begin training your puppy by following a consistent program at home. Training should be scheduled for two sessions each day at roughly the same time each day, with each session lasting about 10 to 15 minutes. It is important to familiarize yourself thoroughly with the exercises beforehand. Read them more than once and visualize each step of the exercise in your mind. You cannot be an effective trainer if you do not know the exercises by heart. It will distract both you and your puppy if you have to keep stopping to refer to your books or notes during training. Before the scheduled sessions, mentally go through the exercises that you will be doing with your puppy before you start each session. Remember all the guidelines on how to praise or correct your dog. In training your puppy, you must be confident and focused on what you are doing. If your puppy senses that you do not know what you are doing, or if you find yourself getting frustrated and impatient, then he will also become unfocused and it will be difficult for you to proceed with the training. Take a break until you feel that you can go on with the training in a focused frame of mind. EXUDING CONFIDENCE THROUGH PREPARATION To be an effective trainer, you should be confident about yourself and in your knowledge. Your puppy needs a leader that does not waver in what is expected from him. Do not allow guilt to get in the way, and do not allow yourself to get angry if the puppy is not proceeding as expected. Proper training takes time, patience, and a strong but gentle hand. And don't forget \u2014 lots of verbal praise and affection when the puppy gets it right. Proper preparation is important for training, but it is also important that you have the ability to anticipate what could go wrong during training so that you do not lose your patience. A puppy normally makes several mistakes during training, and how you react to this can greatly affect the success of his training. When you are prepared for what can go wrong, or what your puppy is capable of, you will be able to respond in a consistent way that is positive for your dog. And when your puppy knows that he can trust you and that you are to be obeyed but not feared, he will learn for the pleasure of pleasing you. Your puppy will be able to look up to you as a leader that he can count on. Puppy Behavior PEDIATRIC BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN DOGS Undesirable behavior exhibited by dogs between puppyhood and adolescence, such as destructive chewing, jumping on people, and play biting, is medically referred to as pediatric behavior problems. Though these behaviors may be perceived as a \"normal\" trait of a puppy, it is often not acceptable behavior for a pet. It is important to address this as early as possible with behavioral modification therapies while the puppy is still impressionable. Genetics do play an important role and the behavior of young pups is likely to be similar to those of their parents. Certain breeds inherit certain problems like unruly, activity problems in working breeds of dogs. However, such behavioral problems have been found to be more common in urban areas where opportunities for exercise and play are limited. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Destructive Chewing Initially, the pup may chew and damage furniture and/or other household items in the presence of a family member, but after being caught and punished, he may continue to be destructive when no family member is around. Play biting Play fighting may be started by a family member initially, but can further escalate or become spontaneous afterward. This is a problem because the deciduous teeth of puppies are still sharp and can cause injury if it bites the hands, legs, and/or clothing of family members. Growling and barking may also develop but usually differ from the acts associated with fear or justified aggression. Jumping on People Jumping on people and placing paws on visitors and/or family members typically occurs during greetings and when she is excited, but may occur when the pup wants attention or something in the person's hand. Getting on Counters/Furniture The pup may get on the counters or furniture to grab an object to chew or eat. He or she may also jump on furniture during play, to get attention, or to rest. CAUSES While many behavior problems in puppies are species-typical, there are some causes that can worsen behavioral issues \u2014 many of which are related to inadequate supervision, control, training, exercise, and/or the pup's general environment. Specific factors that may lead to the categories listed above include: Destructive chewing - Poor nutrition or inadequate food provisions - Presence of mice or other small mammals in the walls or flooring - Spilled food on carpet or furniture - Insufficient or uninteresting toys - Escape behavior Play biting - Teasing and rough play (i.e., encouraging the pup to bite) - Long confinement periods, especially in small enclosures - Excited greetings by visitors or family members Getting on Counters/Furniture - Insufficient or uninteresting toys - Desired foods or objects left on furniture - Uncomfortable floor surfaces or inadequate sleeping areas DIAGNOSIS You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The questions will particularly focus on the pup's environment, new additions to the family (including other animals), and other related topics. Laboratory tests, meanwhile, are often not conducted unless a concurrent disease or condition is present. TREATMENT Your veterinarian will discuss the various behavior modification techniques like rewards and punishment. It is, however, never advisable to strike the pet, shake it by the scruff, thump its nose, roll it on its back or squeeze its lips against its teeth to stop mouthing or biting. Such approaches are detrimental to existing behavioral problems and may aggravate the condition due to fear and aggression. Vigorous exercise can also be extremely helpful for pups with these types of behavioral problems. Involving these puppies in healthy games like fetch/drop, for example, lets the pup know that the human is in control. Certain medications may also be used especially in cases not responding well to behavioral therapy. Other tips your veterinarian may recommend include: To Discourage Destructive Chewing - Experiment with various toys and look for those that interest your pet, especially those that have compartments for food - Keep forbidden objects out of reach - Close doors to deny access to forbidden areas - Interrupt any unacceptable chewing with a sharp \"no\" Play biting - Provide plenty of exercise and activity - Use toys to distract the pet during the act of play biting - A leash and halter can be used to provide minimal restraint - Avoid games that encourage play biting behavior - Put your puppy in puppy classes as early as possible - Take control of resources and train your pup to sit before receiving toys, food, attention, and food - Ignore any pushy social behavior like barking, whining, or pawing for attention Jumping on People - Teach the pet to sit on command - Avoid games and play that may encourage it to jump on people - Gain your dog's attention with a loud, sharp noise when it does jump - Head halter can also be used to provide minimal restraint Getting on Counters/Furniture - Keep your counters and furniture free of any food or other objects that might get attention of the pup - Move dog to a confined area when it does misbehave - Provide interesting toys for mental stimulation, and a comfortable living space LIVING AND MANAGEMENT It is important you follow up with your veterinarian to ascertain the effectiveness of the behavioral therapy program. Prognosis in most cases is good; in addition, the frequency and intensity of such behaviors typically decrease with age. If the dog is still misbehaving after several weeks, your veterinarian may recommend a trained behavioral therapist for a more intense training program. Puppy Strangles Puppy strangles, or juvenile cellulitis is a nodular and pustular skin disorder that affects puppies. It usually occurs between the ages of three weeks and four months and is rarely seen in adult dogs. The face, pinnae (outer part of the ear), and salivary lymph nodes are the most common sites to be affected. The cause of this condition is unknown, but there are breeds that have been shown to be predisposed to it, including golden retrievers, dachshunds, and Gordon setters. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Acutely (sudden and severe) swollen face - especially the eyelids, lips, and muzzle - Salivary gland lymphadenopathy: a disease process affecting a lymph node or multiple lymph nodes - Marked pustular and oozing skin disease, which frequently fistulates (develops into a hollow passage); develops within 24-48 hours - Pustular ear infection - Lesions often become crusted - Affected skin is usually tender - Lethargy in 50 percent of cases - Loss of appetite, fever, and presence of sterile suppurative arthritis in 25 percent of cases (acute inflammation of membranes, with leaking into a joint, due to the bacterial infection) - Sterile pustular nodes (rare) over the trunk, reproductive organs, or on the area around the anus; lesions may appear as fluctuating nodules under the skin with fistulation CAUSES - Cause and pathogenesis (origination) are unknown (idiopathic) - Immune dysfunction with an inheritable cause is suspected DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will conduct a skin biopsy (tissue sample) to determine what is causing the lesions. TREATMENT If your puppy is diagnosed with puppy strangles, early and aggressive therapy will be required to avoid severe scarring. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice. Your veterinarian may prescribe a topical (external) ointment to soothe and ease the pain, and as an adjunct to corticosteroid medication. In rare resistant cases, chemotherapy may be required. Adult dogs with panniculitis (inflammation under the skin) may require longer therapy. Antibiotics may be also prescribed if there is evidence of a secondary bacterial infection. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Most cases do not recur, but scarring may be a permanent problem, especially around the eyes. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Pyruvate Kinase (PK) is an enzyme that plays an important role in energy generation and its deficiency impairs the red blood cells (RBCs) ability to metabolize, which in turn may cause anemia and other blood-related issues. Breeds more prone to PK deficiency include the basenji, beagle, West Highland white terrier, Cairn terrier, miniature poodle, dachshund, Chihuahua, pug, and American Eskimo dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Anemia - Weakness - Muscle wasting - Jaundice (rare) - Pale mucous membranes - Elevated heart rate (tachycardia) - Inability to perform routine exercises CAUSES PK deficiency is typically associated with a genetic defect acquired at birth. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing may reveal an increased number of platelets as well as white blood cells (leukocytosis), anemia with abnormally large, pale red blood cells (RBCs), abnormally-shaped RBCs called poikilocytes (poikilocytosis), and a variation in RBC color (polychromasia). The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may show an excess of iron in the blood (hyperferremia), a mild increase in bilirubin, and a slight increase in liver enzymes. Lastly, urinalysis may reveal high levels of bilirubin. TREATMENT Bone marrow transplantation is the only available treatment for PK deficient dogs. However, this treatment is expensive and potentially life-threatening. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Dogs that undergo a bone marrow transplant may have a normal lifespan. Unfortunately, those that are left untreated will typically die by four years of age as a result of bone marrow or liver failure. Most of these patients develop severe anemia and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites) during the terminal stage of the disease. Retained Deciduous Teeth (Baby Teeth) A retained or persistent deciduous (baby) tooth is one that is still present despite the eruption of the permanent tooth (between three to seven months of age). This can cause the permanent teeth to erupt in abnormal positions, resulting in an incorrect bite pattern (or how the upper and lower teeth fit together when biting or chewing). Retained deciduous teeth may also cause overcrowding of teeth, accidental bites into the palate, or an abnormal jaw position. As with most oral issues, early recognition and immediate dental care are essential to prevent permanent damage. Unfortunately, it often goes undiagnosed until later in life. Retained deciduous teeth are more common in dogs, though it does occur in cats. It often affects smaller breeds of dogs, including the Maltese, Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, and Pomeranian. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES In addition to observing the deciduous (baby) teeth once the permanent teeth begin to erupt, the following signs may occur: - Bad breath (halitosis) - Abnormally-positioned permanent teeth - Swollen, red, bleeding gums around baby teeth - Local gingivitis and periodontal disease due to teeth overcrowding - A permanent abnormal passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity (oronasal fistula) CAUSES None identified. DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam and inspect your dog's mouth. He or she will chart the teeth present in the mouth and record the presence of deciduous teeth. X-rays of the inside of the mouth will also be taken to verify which teeth are permanent and which are deciduous, and whether baby teeth have permanent successors ready to replace them. TREATMENT The deciduous (baby) tooth should be surgically removed as soon as the permanent tooth has begun pushing through your dog's gums. In addition, fractured or retained root(s) may need to be removed with a gingival flap \u2014 a procedure in which the gums are separated from the teeth and folded back to allow a veterinarian to reach the root of the tooth and the bone. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT After surgery, restrict your dog's activity for the rest of the day. Feed him or her a soft diet\u2014canned or moistened dry kibble\u2014as well as restrict his access to chew toys for 24 hours after surgery. Your veterinarian will provide you with oral pain medication to give to your pet for one to three days after surgery. You may also be asked to administer an oral rinse or gel in your pet's mouth for three to five days after surgery. Daily brushing, meanwhile, should commence 24 hours after brushing. Reverse Sneeze in Dogs Sneezing refers to the normal behavior of expelling air to remove matter through the nasal cavity. Reverse Sneezing, on the other hand, refers to the reflex of bringing air into the body to remove irritants in the upper area that lies behind the nostrils. Dogs may gag to remove irritants from the larynx; this is commonly misinterpreted as vomiting. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Sneezing is often accompanied by a sudden movement of the head downwards, with a closed mouth, and may cause the dog's nose to hit the ground. Reverse sneezing is often characterized by a backward head motion, a closed mouth, and lips sucking in. Gagging usually causes the dog to swallow after extending its neck and opening its mouth. Causes Any breed of dog can be affected by these medical behaviors. The most common causes for younger dogs include infections, the existence of a cleft palate, or bronchial infections. Another primary cause is the involuntary movement of the hairlike cilia that line the respiratory tract and act to remove foreign matter from the air before it reaches the lungs. This involuntary movement of the hair is medically termed ciliary dyskinesis. The most common causes for older dogs include nasal tumors and dental diseases. Other causes can be mucus irritation, nasal passage obstruction, inflammation, excess nasal discharge or secretion, pneumonia, chronic vomiting, and gastrointestinal disease. Under vaccinated or unvaccinated dogs are at a higher risk of developing infections, which may lead to consistent sneezing. Chronic dental disease can lead to both chronic sneezing and reverse sneezing. Mites found in the nasal openings can also be a cause for any of these physical reflexes. DIAGNOSIS The first method of diagnosis is to distinguish between sneezing and reverse sneezing in the dog. Next, if the condition is serious, more in-depth testing may be performed to see if there is a more serious underlying medical condition. TREATMENT In most cases, if the mucus or foreign matter in the nasal passages is removed, these reflexes will stop. There are no particular drugs that will stop these reflexes. However, if these reflexes are the result of another medical condition, that particular medical condition can be treated. In many cases, an antihistamine or a decongestant will effectively reduce the dog's involuntary reflexes. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Close contact with other animals should be avoided while your dog is being treated. For best results, it is important to follow the entire course of treatment prescribed by your veterinarian. Ringworm in Dogs Dermatophytosis is the medical term for a parasitic fungal infection that affects the skin, hair, and/or nails (claws). The most commonly isolated fungal organisms are Microsporum canis (more commonly referred to as ringworm), Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Microsporum gypseum. This disease occurs in dogs, cats, and other mammals. It is diagnosed more commonly in young animals than in old. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Symptoms of ringworm in dogs include accumulations of surface skin cells, such as seen in dandruff (scales); poor hair coat; reddened skin (erythema); darkened skin (hyperpigmentation); itchiness (pruritus); and hair loss (alopecia), which may be patchy or circular. Other indications of ringworm in dogs that are readily apparent on the skin are raised, rounded, knotty (nodular) lesions known as granulomatous lesions, or boils, and raised nodular lesions that frequently ooze (kerion), the result of ringworm infection. There may also be inflammation of the claw folds \u2014 the folds of skin bordering the nail, and medically referred to as paronychia. Occasionally, dogs are classified as inapparent carriers \u2014 harboring the disease-causing fungus, but presenting no visible signs of the condition. However, even these dogs are contagious to humans and other animals. CAUSES Dogs most commonly develop ringworm because of infections with the fungi Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The incidence of each fungus varies according to your geographical location. Diseases or medications that decrease the body's ability to develop a normal immune response (known as immunocompromising diseases, or immunosuppressive medications, respectively) can increase the likelihood that your dog will be susceptible to a fungal infection of the skin, hair, and/or nails, as well as increase the potential for a more severe infection. Environments that are densely populated with animals (for example, in an animal shelter or kennel), or where there is poor nutrition, poor management practices, and a lack of adequate quarantine period, will also increase the risk of infection. DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a fungal culture of skin clippings, a microscopic examination of a sample of hair, and possibly a skin biopsy. TREATMENT Most dogs can be treated on an outpatient basis, but quarantine procedures should be considered due to the infective and zoonotic (transmittable to humans) nature of some types of dermatophytosis. If your veterinarian needs to prescribe antifungal medications, the use of an Elizabethan collar (a wide collar placed around the neck) is recommended to prevent ingestion of antifungal medications applied to the dog's skin. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT A fungal culture is the only means of truly monitoring your dog's response to treatment. Many animals will improve clinically, but remain fungal culture positive. It is advisable to repeat fungal cultures toward the end of treatment, and continue treatment until at least one culture result is negative. In resistant cases, fungal cultures may be repeated on a weekly basis, and treatment continued until two to three consecutive negative results are obtained. Complete blood counts should be performed weekly or biweekly for animals receiving griseofulvin, an anti-fungous antibiotic. Also, blood work to monitor the liver may be indicated for dogs receiving ketoconazole or itraconazole, two types of anti-fungal medications. PREVENTION To prevent reinfection from other animals, the use of a quarantine period and fungal (dermatophyte) cultures of all animals living in the household are necessary. Treatment of exposed animals should be considered to prevent the repeated development of infection. The possibility of rodents aiding in the spread of the disease should be considered. If you suspect that your dog has access to rodents, or that rodents are in your immediate environment, it is highly advised that you take the necessary steps to eliminate the pests. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever is one of the most commonly known tick-borne diseases to affect dogs and humans. It belongs to a class of diseases known as Rickettsia; rod-shaped microorganisms that resemble bacteria, but which behave like viruses, reproducing only inside living cells. Rickettsia rickettsii \u2014 the organism responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever \u2014 lives parasitically in ticks and is transmitted by a bite to vertebrate hosts. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Certain breeds are more likely to develop a severe reaction to the R. rickettsii organism than others; these include purebred dogs and German shepherds. The signs and symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever vary according to the type of disease the dog has. Most dogs will develop a fever within five days of contracting Rickettsia rickettsii. Other symptoms include: Depression Lethargy Anorexia Blood in the urine Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Discolored spots along the skin, often bruised or purplish in color Inability to walk normally, loss of coordination (ataxia) Swelling or edema (fluid retention) in the limbs Bleeding that occurs suddenly, most often from the nose, or in the stools Difficulty with blood clotting, which can lead to shock or death Swollen lymph nodes Pain in the eyes Inflammation, hemorrhage, or conjunctivitis in the mucosal membranes, most commonly in the eyes CAUSES The tick-borne rickettsial disease is caused by the R. rickettsii microorganism. The organism is carried by ticks and transmitted through a bite to a host animal. Most infections occur in the months from March through October. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, including a background history of symptoms, recent activities, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected (e.g., heart, kidney). Your veterinarian will make the diagnosis based on blood tests and skin biopsies from the affected areas, along with the symptoms that are presented. A heightened antibody count will show that an infection is present. Special stains can be used in a laboratory setting to confirm a diagnosis. TREATMENT Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a serious ailment that may result in fatality if your dog is not cared for properly. Treatment usually involves admitting your pet to an in-patient health facility where a health care team can monitor your dog until it shows signs of improvement. Your pet will be given antibiotics, the type will be based on your pet's age, and proper hydration and fluid balancing will be checked. If your dog is found to have low red-blood-cell counts, a condition known as anemia, or if there is a threat of developing a condition known as thrombocytopenia, where the platelets or substances in the blood become too low, a blood transfusion may be necessary to prevent these conditions from becoming life-threatening. Your veterinarian will also monitor the amount of fluid in the dog's brain to prevent edema, or excessive swelling of tissues in the brain, body, and lungs. Along with the prescribed antibiotics, your dog may also require corticosteroid anti-inflammatory medications. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT If you know your dog will be in an area that is tick infested, you will want to screen your pet for ticks and take precautions to prevent your pet from overexposure to ticks. Tick repellents and tick collars can be used, but checking your dog's skin and hair for the presence of ticks is the most accurate way of preventing infection. Infection typically occurs after five hours You will need to wear latex gloves and remove any ticks you find on your pet by hand, taking extra care to remove the mouth part of the tick. Your veterinarian may recommend the use of dips and sprays to help prevent further tick infestation. The type of repellent you use will be based on your dog's age and health status. The prognosis for pets is usually good, provided you seek prompt and early care and treatment. If you seek help within the first few hours of infection, your pet will likely survive with no long-term consequences. If you do not take prompt action, however, it is likely that your pet may suffer long-term consequences or even death. This could occur within days or even hours. Without proper treatment, the effects on the central nervous system can be devastating. Sago Palm Toxicity Dogs are known to chew on and eat plants, and sometimes they unwittingly eat plants that have toxic properties to them. Sago palms are one of these plants. The leaves from the sago palm can cause severe damage to the liver and potentially death when they are ingested by dogs. The sago palm is also known colloquially as coontie palms, cardboard palms, cycads, or zymias. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Symptoms seen with ingestion of sago palms include: - Vomiting - Blood in feces - Bloody diarrhea - Icterus (yellow coloration of skin and gums) - Increased thirst - Increased urine - Bruising - Bleeding easily (coagulopathy, DIC) - Neurological signs such as depression, circling, paralysis, seizures, coma - Death CAUSES The symptoms seen are the result of liver damage caused by a toxin called cycasin that is found in the sago palm. Liver disease may lead to bleeding deficits (disseminated intravascular coagulation - DIC), that is, abnormal bleeding and clots in the bloodstream, and neurological abnormalities. DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis is based on a history of ingestion of the plant and on blood and urine test results supportive of liver disease. TREATMENT If ingestion has just occurred and symptoms are not present, vomiting may be induced by a doctor using apomorphine, hydrogen peroxide, or ipecac. Consult your veterinarian immediately if you suspect or know that your dog has eaten any part of a sago palm. Activated charcoal may also be used to absorb the poison in the stomach. Gastric lavage(\"pumping the stomach\") may also be necessary. If evidence of liver disease is evident via clinical signs or abnormalities in blood and/or urine tests, then additional treatment will be necessary. Fluid therapy and blood or plasma transfusions will be required. Controlling vomiting with anti-emetic medications is recommended. Antibiotics, gastrointestinal protectants, and vitamin K may also be administered by your veterinarian. S-Adenosylmethionine, Ursodeoxycholic acid, or vitamin E may be of benefit as well. PREVENTION Avoid ingestion by keeping sago palms out of the reach of your dog. Ideally, remove the plants from your yard entirely if they are present. Salom Poisoning Disease (SPD) Salmon poisoning disease (SPD) is an often fatal condition, that occurs when a dog eats raw salmon that is infected with the Neorickettsia helminthoeca parasite. This disease typically begins in the tissues of the small intestine, where it causes hemorrhaging. It gradually becomes systemic, invading the entire body. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES The signs and symptoms of SPD include the following: - Fever - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) - Discharge from the nose and eyes CAUSES Dogs contract the Neorickettsia helminthoeca parasite when they consume raw fish, including raw salmon, trout, and other fish that contain the N. helminthoeca organisms, like the trematode vector. DIAGNOSIS To diagnose SPD, your veterinarian will need to rule out other conditions that are known to cause similar symptoms, including: - Poisoning from food products or toxins - Canine parvovirus type 2 (a contagious virus that is common in puppies) - Ehrlichiosis (sometimes known as canine typhus fever, or rickettsiosis) - Canine distemper (a virus known to cause stomach upset) Once these alternate conditions have been ruled out, your doctor will collect fluid from a swollen lymph node to test for Rickettsial bodies. This can be done using the Giemsa stain technique, which stains the DNA of parasites, making them visible under a microscope. Your doctor will also perform an examination of the feces to discover whether the organism Nanophyetus salmincola has laid eggs in the feces, which will also confirm a diagnosis of SPD. Other findings may include changes in the lymph tissue, which may show yellowish tissue in the lymph node, and blood within the intestinal contents. TREATMENT Very ill patients will need inpatient treatment. Treatment will involve intravenous fluid therapy to replace lost fluid, antibiotic therapy, and therapy to control diarrhea. Some dogs may also need electrolyte replacement therapy and/or blood transfusions. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Animals will need to be adequately cared for and proper hygiene will need to be maintained to help the animal return to good health. Your veterinarian may recommend that you keep your dog caged for a short time to prevent overexertion while it is recovering. This will also help you monitor your pet's progress toward recovery. PREVENTION The most effective way to prevent SPD in a dog is to preclude it from consuming raw fish. Submissive Urination in Dogs While a dog might be man's best friend, that puddle on the floor sure isn't. If your new housebroken puppy or rescued dog occasionally pees on the floor for no fathomable reason, then you might have a dog with submissive/excitement urination issues. So what should you do if you think you have a dog with excitement or submissive peeing problem? First off, take your dog to the vet to rule out other reasons for the inappropriate peeing. If you receive the all-clear from your vet, how do you know which problem your dog has? If your pooch doesn't pee when you're in a dominant position (i.e., looking your dog directly in the eye, bending from the waist, greeting your dog face on), then chances are your dog is suffering from an excitement issue. If the dog does pee when you arrive home, when you're in a dominant position, or when it is in trouble, then it's probably a submissive issue. Either way, the situation can be remedied. SUBMISSIVE PEEING Submissive dogs pee when they are greeted when someone approaches, when they are punished, and when there is a history of rough treatment or punishment after peeing; this is common in rescued dogs. This is also a common reaction with shy, anxious, and timid dogs. To fix this problem, avoid scolding or yelling at your dog after it has peed. Instead, try building its confidence by teaching it simple commands (sit, stay, come), and reward your dog after each success. The same applies to teaching simple tricks (roll over, fetch); go with the reward and praise route. You will also want to approach your dog in non-dominant postures. Avoid direct eye contact, approach from the side, and crouch down to your dog's level. When patting your pooch, go for under the chin rather than the top of the head. Keep all greetings low-key, and when the dog does pee, simply clean it up without fuss and go away. Do not forget to reward and praise your pup when it pees in the appropriate place. EXCITEMENT PEEING The good news for you is this usually happens to puppies under one year of age, and they will usually grow out of it. The bad news is it's not going to happen overnight. These are the dogs that pee while playing, when you come home, or when people visit. To help your puppy with this issue (and save that very expensive rug you just bought), try keeping all playtime outside, or on a specially prepared area of newspaper and puppy pads. This way, if there is a little accident due to over-excitement, it doesn't have to be a big deal. When there is an accident, just as with submissive peeing, do not reprimand or punish your pup. Simply clean it up quietly and leave the puppy (or dog, if this is happening with an older dog) alone. Give your puppy treats when it pees in the correct place, and keep all greetings to a minimum. You may even want to ignore the dog when you arrive home. Does this seem cruel? It's not really, as it gives your pooch a chance to calm down on its own. Ask guests to do the same. When the dog pees while out on walks, give it praise and treats. The same goes for when the dog pees in designated areas (which is not the rug or the designer bedspread). All these things should not only help your pooch break its habit of peeing when excited, but will also help you to cultivate a calmer, more confident dog. So good luck with your dog. And remember, patience and perseverance will always pay off. Canine Distemper Virus Canine distemper is a contagious and serious viral illness with no known cure. The disease affects dogs, and certain species of wildlife, such as raccoons, wolves, foxes, and skunks. The common house pet, the ferret, is also a carrier of this virus. Canine distemper belongs to the Morbillivirus class of viruses and is a relative of the measles virus, which affects humans, the Rinderpest virus which affects cattle, and the Phocine virus which causes seal distemper. All are members of the Paramyxoviridaefamily. Young, unvaccinated puppies and non-immunized older dogs tend to be more susceptible to the disease. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES OF DISTEMPER IN DOGS The virus, which is spread through the air and by direct or indirect (i.e. utensils, bedding) contact with an infected animal, initially attacks a dog's tonsils and lymph nodes and replicates itself there for about one week. It then attacks the respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. In the initial stages of Canine Distemper, the major symptoms include high fever (103.5 \u00b0 F, or 39.7\u00b0 C), reddened eyes, and a watery discharge from the nose and eyes. An infected dog will become lethargic and tired, and will usually become anorexic. Persistent coughing, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. In the later stages of the disease, the virus starts attacking the other systems of the dog's body, particularly the nervous system. The brain and spinal cord are affected and the dog may start having fits, seizures, paralysis, and attacks of hysteria. Canine distemper is sometimes also called \"hard pad disease\" because certain strains of the virus can cause an abnormal enlargement or thickening of the pads of an animal's feet. In dogs or animals with weak immune systems, death may result in two to five weeks after the initial infection. CAUSES OF DISTEMPER IN DOGS The disease can be acquired from improperly attenuated vaccines, though this occurs rather rarely. Bacterial infections of the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems may also increase an animal's vulnerability to the disease. Non-immunized dogs that come into any kind of contact with an infected animal carry a particularly high risk of contracting the disease. DIAGNOSIS OF CANINE DISTEMPER IN DOGS Canine distemper is diagnosed with biochemical tests and urine analysis, which may also reveal a reduced number of lymphocytes, the white blood cells that function in the immune system in the initial stages of the disease (lymphopenia). A serology test may identify positive antibodies, but this test cannot distinguish between vaccination antibodies and exposure to a virulent virus. Viral antigens may be detected in urine sediment or vaginal imprints. Haired skin, nasal mucous, and the footpad epithelium may be tested for antibodies as well. Radiographs can only be used to determine whether an infected animal has contracted pneumonia. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to examine the brain for any lesions that may have developed. TREATMENT FOR DISTEMPER IN DOGS Unfortunately, there is no cure for canine distemper. Treatment for the disease, therefore, is heavily focused on alleviating the symptoms. If the animal has become anorexic or has diarrhea, intravenous supportive fluids may be given. Discharge from the eyes and nose must be cleaned away regularly. Antibiotics may be prescribed to control the symptoms caused by a secondary bacterial infection, and phenobarbital and potassium bromide may be needed to control convulsions and seizures. There are no antiviral drugs that are effective in treating the disease. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT FOR CANINE DISTEMPER In the more acute stages of canine distemper, it is necessary to monitor for the development of pneumonia or dehydration from diarrhea. The central nervous system (CNS) must also be monitored because seizures and other neural disturbances may occur. A dog's chances of surviving canine distemper will depend on the strain of the virus and the strength of the dog's immune system. Recovery is entirely possible, although seizures and other fatal disturbances to the CNS may occur two to three months after recovery. Fully recovered dogs do not spread or carry the virus. PREVENTION OF DISTEMPER IN DOGS The best prevention for canine distemper is routine vaccinations and immediate isolation of infected animals. Special care must be taken to protect newborn pups from exposure since they are especially susceptible to the disease. Toad Venom Poisoning in Dogs Toad venom toxicity is relatively common in dogs. Being natural predators, it is common for dogs to catch toads in their mouths, thereby coming into contact with the toad's toxin, which the toad releases when it feels threatened. This highly toxic defense chemical is most often absorbed through the oral cavity membrane, but it may also enter the eyes, causing vision problems. Its effects are lethal if not treated immediately. The two most important species of toad that are known for their toxic effects on pets are the Colorado River Toad (Bufo alvarius) and the Marine Toad (Bufo marinus). Most cases of poisoning are reported during the warmest weather months when the toads are more active and humidity is high. In addition, pets typically come into contact with the Bufo toads during the very early morning hours, or after the evening has set. These toads are omnivorous, eating both living creatures, such as insects and small rodents and non-living food, such as pet food that has been left outdoors. Because of the latter, pets will often come into contact with these amphibians as they are eating from the animal's food dish. It is for this reason that it is recommended that pet food not be left outside in areas where Bufo toads live. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Symptoms usually appear within a few seconds of the toad encounter and may include the following: - Crying or other vocalization - Pawing at the mouth and/or eyes - Profuse drooling of saliva from the mouth - Change in the color of membranes of the mouth - may be inflamed or pale - Difficulty in breathing - Unsteady movements - Seizures - High temperature - Collapse CAUSES - Living in proximity and coming into contact with toxic toads - More commonly seen in animals that spend a lot of time outdoors DIAGNOSIS Toad venom toxicity is a health emergency requiring immediate treatment, as it can quickly lead to death. You will need to give the on-call veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, a description of the onset of symptoms, and the likelihood that this is occurring as the result of contact with a Bufo toad. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination, with blood and urine samples taken for routine laboratory tests. A complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will also be done. The results of these tests are often found to be normal in these animals, except for abnormally high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia). The dog may also exhibit an abnormal heartbeat, and if your veterinarian has time to conduct an electrocardiogram (ECG), the results will typically confirm an abnormal heart rhythm in conjunction with toad venom poisoning. TREATMENT Toad venom toxicity is an emergency with highly likely fatal outcomes. Time remains a crucial factor in the survival of the affected animal. If you suspect that your dog has encountered a toxic toad, immediately take the dog to a nearby veterinary hospital for emergency treatment. The first step of treatment is to flush the mouth with water for 5-10 minutes to prevent further absorption of the venom through the mouth membranes. The doctor will also need to keep the dog's body temperature stable, which may require keeping it in a cool bath. Heart abnormalities are a common symptom, so your veterinarian will want to monitor the heart's ability to function and respond to the treatment. An ECG will be set up and continuously monitored to evaluate your dog's cardiac activity. Drugs can be used to control abnormal heart rhythm, and also to reduce the amount of saliva your dog is producing in response to the toxin. If your dog is in an obvious amount of pain, your doctor may also decide to anesthetize it in order to reduce the severity of the symptoms. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Continuous monitoring will be required until the dog is fully recovered. Your veterinarian will continuously record the heart's rhythms using ECG to evaluate your cat's response to the treatment patient. Patients that have been treated before enough of the toxin has had a chance to reach the system, within about 30 minutes, have a good chance of recovery. However, the overall prognosis is not good for most animals, and death is very common in dogs that have been exposed to toad venom. Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a malignant (aggressive) and metastasizing (spreading) cancer arising from the transitional epithelium - the highly stretchable lining of the urinary tract system - of the kidney, ureters (the tubes that carry fluid from the kidneys to the bladder), urinary bladder, urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside), prostate, or vagina. Flea-control products (organophosphates and carbamate) and cyclophosphamide are possible causal agents in dogs. In addition, TCC occurs most commonly in female dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Straining to urinate - Frequent urination of small amounts (pollakiuria) - Blood in urine (hematuria) - Difficulty urinating (dysuria) - Wetting on the floor, bed, CAUSES Flea-control products (organophosphates and carbamate) and cyclophosphamide DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Urine should also be sent for culture and sensitivity testing since a concurrent urinary tract infection is common. X-rays of the chest and abdomen should be taken to look for the possible spread of cancer. Intravenous pyelography, a procedure that is used to take an X-ray image of the urinary system, will be used to examine the urinary tract, bladder, and kidneys. For this procedure, a contrasting dye will be injected into the bloodstream, to be picked up by the kidneys and passed through through the ureters, bladder, and urethra. The contrasting dye is visible on the X-ray imaging so that the internal structures can be seen and determined to be functioning normally or abnormally. Other contrast dye procedures that can be used to image the urinary tract may be used, either instead of or in addition to, a pyelography. They include avoiding urethrogram (x-rays of dyes as the patient urinates), or vaginogram (X-rays of dyes within the vagina). These latter X-ray techniques are indicated if the urethral or vaginal disease is suspected. Double-contrast cystography is the best way to visualize the mass(es) which are normally located at the trigone of the urinary bladder (a smooth triangular area inside the bladder). For a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy of the mass is the gold standard. Biopsies may be obtained through traumatic catheterization (jamming a catheter into the masses), exploratory laparotomy (abdominal surgery), or cystoscopy (using a small camera with instruments attached). However, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is not recommended, because this can easily cause further spreading of cancer. TREATMENT TCC spreads very easily. There have been multiple reports of surgery causing cancer to spread. Tube placement into the bladder (through the urethra) may greatly prolong survival times by preventing urethral blockage. Radiotherapy (ionizing radiation, like the type X-rays, given off) given during surgery is reported to result in longer survival times and better local control than chemotherapy. The potential side effects of radiotherapy during surgery are urinary bladder stricture and fibrosis with urinary incontinence. Antibiotics based on the culture and sensitivity results should be prescribed to resolve any concurrent urinary tract infections. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT TCC tumors cannot usually be surgically removed in dogs. While a cure is not attainable, the severity and speed of the spread of TCC disease can be slowed down and delayed. Your veterinarian will schedule your dog for a contrast cystography or ultrasonography every six to eight weeks to see if treatment is effective and to screen for lymph node spread of TCC. Similarly, chest X-rays should be retaken every two to three months to detect any new cancer spread. Traveling by Air with Your Dog For many people, it wouldn't be summer without a family road trip. Since most Americans consider their pets to be members of the family, that means bringing your pet along. But unless you want your vacation to resemble a National Lampoon movie, there are a few additional considerations you should follow when traveling with your pet. For starters, do your homework and make sure your destination is pet-friendly. For example, if you were planning to bring the family pooch with the rest of the family to Yosemite National Park to enjoy the great outdoors, you would be disappointed to learn that dogs are not allowed on the hiking trails, even on a leash. Although the national parks were established to make the great outdoors accessible, they were also set up to protect these lands. Unfortunately, even well-behaved dogs can disturb these delicate ecosystems. The main point is to do your homework and find out ahead of time. If you're okay with staying at the campground with your dog, then it may not be an issue for you. If you really want to take your dog on a hiking trail, you may have to choose another destination, like a national forest. Check ahead of time to avoid last-minute surprises that can put a damper on your trip. If this is your pet's first big trip, you should get them used to traveling well ahead of your planned trip. If you're traveling by car, this means taking them on frequent car trips to get them used to be in a car. I also recommend making the experience as positive as possible by giving lots of praise and treats. The same principles apply if you're planning to travel by air. Get your pet used to their travel crate and give them lots of rewards. If your pet becomes very anxious despite these measures, speak with your veterinarian about using a sedative. Another consideration is lodging. Fortunately, the Internet is a great resource for finding pet-friendly lodging. There are numerous websites and even apps for your smartphone to help you find pet-friendly hotels. Just call to confirm their policies and to get the details. For example, some hotels may have a size limit or a restriction on the number of pets. Some hotels even cater to pets and pet-friendly services to make your pet feel right at home. Finally, as seasoned travelers know, make a checklist of what you will need for the trip. Since your pet can't really eat at a food stop or restaurant, bring enough of their food for the entire trip. Don't forget to pack food and water bowls, their bed, and favorite toys. Bring a health certificate or their vaccine record and any medications they are taking. Don't forget to bring their collar with I.D. tags and a leash. And if your pet doesn't already have a microchip, I highly recommend getting one for your pet since collars and tags are not foolproof. Finally, it goes without saying, never leave your pet in an unattended car since they can overheat and die within minutes. Traveling with your pet may require some additional planning, but with a little foresight, it can give you and your family some priceless memories. Trichinosis (Pork Roundworm) Trichinosis (trichinellosis or trichiniasis) is a roundworm (nematode) parasite called Trichinella spiralis. T. spiralis is also known as \"pork worm\" because in most cases infection is seen due to eating contaminated raw or undercooked pork. This parasite is responsible for causing infection in dogs, people, and pigs. In the developing stage of this parasite's life cycle, infection occurs in dogs and people when they ingest contaminated, poorly cooked meat. The T. spiralis parasite is known to cause severe disease and even death in humans. Severe inflammation of the body muscles is seen as the parasite (larva) migrates into the muscles. Puppies are reported to be at higher risk of infection than adult dogs. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Gastrointestinal upset Vomiting Diarrhea Inflammation of the muscles Muscle pain Muscle stiffness CAUSES Infection is caused by the roundworm parasite called T. spiralis, which enters the gastrointestinal system through contaminated raw meat. The developing stage of this parasite reaches into the muscles and is capable of remaining there for years. DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will take a detailed history from you, with attention to your dog's diet or anything your dog has eaten out of the ordinary. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis, and a fecal examination. The complete blood count may show a high number of a type of white blood cells (WBCs) called eosinophils (eosinophilia), which are typically found in the blood as a response to allergies or in response to parasitic infections. If the fecal sample shows evidence of roundworm fragments, a follow-up series of fecal testing may be required for confirmation of the diagnosis. As these parasites end up in the muscles, a muscle sample may be taken to find the parasite in the muscles. TREATMENT In the case of mild disease, usually, no treatment is required in the affected animal other than the use of roundworm-specific antiparasitic drugs to reduce the number of parasites in the muscles. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT After the initial treatment, monitor your dog for ongoing muscle pains or any other untoward symptoms. Consult your veterinarian if any symptoms reappear in your dog. Prevention of this infection is achieved simply by not feeding your dog undercooked pork products and blocking access to waste that includes pork leftovers. Urinary Issues in Dogs Urinary tract obstruction is a medical emergency causing the dog to strain while urinating, producing little or no urine each time. The obstruction may be due to inflammation or compression on the urethra, or simply a blockage. Treatment is available and the prognosis of this issue will depend on the severity of the obstruction. SYMPTOMS The first sign of a urinary obstruction is straining to urinate. This may actually look like constipation because the dog will hunch over while it is urinating. Because of the abnormal passage of urine, the stream or flow of urine will be interrupted and may appear cloudy. If any urine is seen, it may appear dark or blood-tinged. The pain involved causes many dogs to cry out and they will stop eating and become depressed. Vomiting or retching may also occur. If the dog does not receive medical treatment, renal failure can develop, which can be life-threatening within three days of symptoms. CAUSES There are several known risk factors for urinary tract obstruction including urinary tract stones, urinary disease (particularly common in female dogs), and prostate disease (in male dogs). The accumulation of minerals in the urinary tract can also cause the formation of an obstruction (crystals or stones). In addition, tumors, lesions, and scar tissue can lead to an obstruction. DIAGNOSIS The veterinarian will carefully feel the dog's abdomen. Acute renal failure results from increased pressure in the renal system and the inability to eliminate urea and other waste products usually eliminated in urine. This results in increased waste products and potassium in the bloodstream. An initial baseline blood panel is important to determine the appropriate fluids and other treatment that may become necessary. As the treatment progresses, additional blood samples will likely be taken to determine changes in the dog's condition. Additional blood analysis and imaging, including X-rays or ultrasound may be helpful to determine the cause of the obstruction or other contributing diseases or illnesses. TREATMENT The obstruction must be relieved as soon as possible. Sedation is often necessary. Depending on the severity of the obstruction, several methods may be used by the veterinarian to remove the obstruction \u2014 urethral massage and using fluid to push the obstruction out of the urethra and into the bladder are two examples. Once the obstruction is removed or pushed back into the bladder, a urinary catheter is sometimes left in place and is maintained for at least 24 hours, depending on the cause of the obstruction. Intravenous (IV) fluids are usually administered to rehydrate the dog and normalize its electrolyte levels. Because of the pressure buildup and the inability to eliminate urine and its components, the entire renal system is affected and kidney damage can occur. In most cases, this damage is repaired with adequate fluid and electrolyte administration. Medications to treat the pain may also be necessary. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT It is important to monitor the flow of urine to ensure that there are no visible signs of complication. Some causes of urethral obstruction can be treated and eliminated, others cannot. Therefore, carefully monitoring the pet is very important. Dietary changes may be necessary to prevent crystals, stones, or other potential causes of the obstruction. Ensuring your dog is able to urinate frequently can also help. Urinary Tract Infections in Dogs The invasion and colonization of bacteria in the urinary bladder and/or the upper portion of the urethra may result in infection when the local defense system, which helps protect against infection, is impaired. Symptoms related to this type of infection include inflammation of the affected tissue and urinary difficulties. Dogs of all ages can be affected, but vulnerability increases with advancing age. In such cases, stone formation, prostate disease, and tumors are frequently seen. Additionally, female dogs are more susceptible to bacterial infections of the lower urinary tract than males. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES Some dogs with bacterial infections of the lower urinary tract may not show any signs, but many more do. A few of the more common signs include: - Difficulty urinating - Blood in urine (hematuria) - Cloudy or malodorous urine - Frequent urination, but only in small amounts - Urinary incontinence, especially during confinement or at places that are not customary (i.e., locations he has not peed before) - Urination when bladder is touched (occasional) CAUSES E. coli, Staphylococcus, and Proteus spp. account for more than half of all cases of bacterial infections of the lower urinary tract. Less common bacteria include Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Corynebacterium spp. DIAGNOSIS You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Although the results of the CBC and biochemistry profile are often normal, urinalysis findings will provide valuable information for initial diagnosis. For instance, pus, blood, or proteins are often seen in the urine. The urine sample, which is taken from the bladder with a syringe, is then cultured to grow the causative bacteria (allowing for sensitivity testing). Once the bacteria is identified, your veterinarian will recommend suitable antibiotics for treatment. X-rays and ultrasonography of the lower urinary tract may also reveal the presence of a stone or another abnormal lesion. TREATMENT Most dogs recover without complications once the appropriate antibiotics are administered. However, it is important to identify the issue quickly, as such forms of lower urinary tract infections can travel up to the kidneys, heart, and other areas, resulting in more severe complications. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Prognosis will ultimately depend on the diagnosis; however, most dogs require little more than antibiotics to resolve the infection. In cases of severe and complicated infections with obstructions, surgery may be required. Dietary changes may also be implemented to prevent future episodes of stone formation. Antibiotics should always be administered at the prescribed dosage and frequency. In addition, do not stop or alter treatment without prior consulting your veterinarian. If long-term antibiotic treatment is recommended, watch your dog for adverse effects, such as allergies, and immediately call your veterinarian if they should arise. Urine cultures are done 7 to 10 days after the completion of therapy. If the infection is still present, more prolonged antibiotic therapy or changing the antibiotic may be required. Vestibular Disease in Dogs Observing a dog tilting its head frequently is an indication that the dog feels imbalanced. The medical description of head tilt involves tilting the head to either side of the body, away from its orientation with the trunk and limbs. The dog may appear to be trying to prevent itself from falling or struggling to retain a balanced posture. A common cause of head tilting in dogs is disorders of the vestibular system, a sensory system located in the inner ear that provides information needed to hold the body in an upright position and move about confidently. In essence, the vestibular system \"tells the body where it is in relation to earth \u2014 whether it is upright, up-side-down, moving, being still, etc. Head tilting may also occur from time to time in elderly dogs, and may not need medical treatment, but it is always best to have the condition checked for a more serious underlying condition. SYMPTOMS AND TYPES - Abnormal head posture - Head tilt to either side - Stumbling, lack of coordination (ataxia) - Constantly falling over - Eye movements erratic, apparent inability to focus - Circling (turning in circles) - Nausea, vomiting CAUSES Although the underlying cause of the vestibular disease is unknown, the following factors may contribute to the condition: - Ear injury - Brain disease - Metabolic diseases - Neoplasia (abnormal tissue growth) - Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., thiamine deficiency) - Toxicity (e.g., use of toxic antibiotics in the ear) - Upper respiratory tract infection - Inflammation of the central and inner ear canal due to bacterial, parasitic, or another type of infection DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a complete standard physical exam, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, and you will need to give a thorough background history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The results of the blood tests are usually normal, though changes may be present depending on whether there is an existing disease, such as an infection. Further tests will be required to diagnose underlying systemic diseases like thyroid problems, and infections. The nutritional status will be evaluated, and you will need to recount your dog's normal diet, along with supplements or additional foods you may feed your dog. Thiamine deficiency, for example, can result from overconsumption of raw meats and fish. To determine if an ear infection is present, your veterinarian will thoroughly examine the ear canal and will take a sample of the material present within the ear canal for further testing. Visual diagnostic tools, X-rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required to confirm a middle ear disease. Another important test used to diagnose this disease is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. (CSF is a clear, watery liquid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.) The results of a CSF analysis are useful in the diagnosis of inflammation and/or infection within the brain. A bone biopsy may also be performed as an advanced test to confirm the involvement of the bone due to a tumor or infection. TREATMENT In case of severe disease, your dog may need to be hospitalized for treatment and supportive care. Fluid replacement therapy is required in patients with fluid deficits due to frequent vomiting. These patients don't require a special diet except in those cases where some nutritional deficiency is present. For example, thiamine supplements are often required in patients with head tilt due to thiamine deficiency. In some cases, surgery is required to treat the underlying disease. If an ear infection is present, your veterinarian will prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics that can enter and eradicate the infection in the brain and middle ear. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT The prognosis is highly variable depending on the underlying disease. If the head tilt is due to involvement of the ear, chances for complete recovery are fairly high. In some cases, head tilt may persist. You will bring your dog to your veterinarian for regular follow-up examinations. Follow treatment guidelines strictly and give medications at proper doses and times. Incorrectly medicating your animal is one of the most preventable accidents with pets. In addition, do not use any drug of your own, or any drug that has not been approved by your veterinarian, especially in the ear, as it may complicate symptoms further. Von Willebrand's Disease in Dogs Von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is a blood disease caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), an adhesive glycoprotein in the blood required for normalplateletbinding (i.e., clotting) at the sites of small blood vessel injuries. In addition, vWF is a carrier protein for coagulation Factor VIII (necessary for blood to clot). A lack of vWF impairs platelet stickiness and clumping. Similar to hemophilia in humans, this condition can lead to excessive bleeding following an injury, due to the lack of clotting. VWF is an autosomal (non-sex-linked) trait, which both males and females express and transmit genetically and with equal frequency. The expression pattern of the severe forms (Types 2 and 3 vWD) is recessive while the milder form (Type 1 vWD) appears to be recessive or incompletely dominant. This is the most common hereditary blood clotting disorder in dogs, occurring with more frequency in some breeds, including German shepherds, Doberman pinschers, standard poodles, Shetland sheepdogs, and golden retrievers. SYMPTOMS TYPES - Spontaneous hemorrhage from mucosal surfaces: - Nosebleeds - Blood in the feces (black or bright red blood) - Bloody urine - Bleeding from the gums - Bleeding from the vagina (excessively) - Bruising of skin - Prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma - Blood loss anemia if there is prolonged bleeding CAUSES Hereditary vWD is caused by mutations that impair vWF synthesis, release, or stability. DIAGNOSIS Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of your dog's health and the onset of symptoms. A blood chemical profile will be performed, with a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. If there has been blood loss, regenerative anemia will be seen on the complete blood count. Typically, the platelet count will be normal (unless your dog has experienced recent, massive bleeding), and coagulation tests will show normal results. A clinical diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is based on a specific measurement of plasma vWF concentration bound to the antigen (vWF: Ag). The length of time that it takes for platelets to plug a small injury will be measured, with a test called the buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT). The BMBT test, along with the platelet function analyzer (PFA 100), are point-of-care screening tests where the endpoints are prolonged in patients with platelet clumping defects and vWF deficiency. Prolongation is nonspecific and may accompany numerous severe disorders of the blood. TREATMENT Transfusion of fresh whole blood, fresh plasma, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate will supply vWF to the blood. Component therapy (fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) is best for surgical prophylaxis (prevention) and nonanemic patients, to prevent red cell sensitization and volume overload. Patients with severe vWD may require repeated transfusions to control or prevent hemorrhage. If a dog lacking vWF requires surgery, a pre-operative transfusion should be given just before the procedure. LIVING AND MANAGEMENT Most dogs with mild to moderate vWD will continue to have a good quality of life, requiring minimal or no special treatment. Dogs with more severe forms will require transfusion for surgery and should be transfused if supportive care fails to control a spontaneous bleeding episode. Most of these dogs can be maintained comfortably, but their activities will need to be monitored and limited. If your dog has von Willebrand Disease and it has an episode of prolonged bleeding, call your veterinarian and take it to a veterinary clinic immediately for emergency treatment. What to Consider When Boarding Your Dog Every day people face the question of what to do with their pets when travel, illness, or family emergencies disrupt normal care. Some pet owners attempt to solve this problem by taking their pets with them, only to discover that hotel restrictions, travel-induced pet illness, and runaway pets can turn their trip into a disaster. Other pet owners turn over the care of their animals to well-meaning but untrained neighbors or friends. Again, the results are often unsatisfactory. Pets entrusted to such part-time custodians frequently escape or become seriously ill because of a lack of reliable, frequent, and knowledgeable supervision. Fortunately, the majority of pet owners who find themselves in need of substitute pet care utilize the services of professional boarding kennels. Annually, more than 30 million pet owners recognize that full-time, knowledgeable, and experienced boarding kennel operators provide the most dependable, secure, and safe pet care available. Because competent, ethical boarding kennels are an important part of your pet care program, and because the selection of a boarding kennel can be a confusing and disconcerting process for pet owners, the American Boarding Kennels Association (ABKA) has assembled this data to assist you in evaluating, selecting, and working with your local boarding kennel. Our goals are twofold: 1. To give your pet a happy and safe boarding experience. 2. To enable you to enjoy your time away from home content that your pet is receiving the best care possible. WHAT IS A BOARDING KENNEL? Throughout the United States and Canada, there are approximately 9,000 boarding kennels offering their services to more than 30,000,000 pet owners annually. Boarding kennels are businesses designed and operated specifically to care for pets, as distinguished from breeding kennels, which are devoted to producing puppies; training kennels, which take in dogs for hunting, protection, and other types of specialized training; and veterinary hospitals, which are designed to care for sick and injured animals. Most boarding kennels provide a variety of pet services, such as boarding, grooming, training classes, pet supply sales, and pet shipping. Although the vast majority of boarded pets are dogs and cats, many kennels also offer to board horses, birds, reptiles, and exotic pets. WHAT IS THE AMERICAN BOARDING KENNELS ASSOCIATION? A characteristic common to all boarding kennel operators is a deep love and respect for animals. This is their basic motivation for establishing their kennel. In 1977, however, a dedicated group of kennel operators recognized that the love of animals, by itself, was not enough to guarantee the development of professional standards of pet care within the industry. What was also needed where educational opportunities for kennel operators, to enable them to stay abreast of developments in pet care and to establish a method for promoting a high level of ethical conduct within the industry. To achieve these goals, these concerned kennel operators founded the American Boarding Kennels Association (ABKA). Today the ABKA has a membership of almost 1,600 kennels throughout the U.S. and Canada. By means of its publications, conventions, seminars, regional meetings, ethics program, a certification program for kennel operators, accreditation program for kennels, and industry committees, the Association helps member kennels to develop and maintain the highest professional and business standards. This in turn enables ABKA members to offer you, the pet owner, the most knowledgeable, ethical pet care available anywhere. SUCCESSFUL BOARDING The goals of the ABKA member kennels are happy, healthy pets and satisfied pet owners. This requires a cooperative effort from the kennel owner and pet owner. In the following pages, the ABKA, in response to numerous requests from pet owners, lists the features you should look for in selecting your kennel and suggests what you can do to ensure that your pet receives the best care possible. Let's start at the beginning. There are several ways of locating the kennels that are convenient to you: 1. Yellow Pages: Yellow page advertising is the primary method of kennel advertising. Remember though, that the size of the ad is no indication of the facility's quality. 2. Recommendations of friends: Satisfied customers are the best recommendation that a kennel can receive. Ask your friends and neighbors about their experiences. Check with your veterinarian or ask the kennel in question for references. 3. Better Business Bureau: If your community has a Better Business Bureau, a phone inquiry about your local kennels is appropriate. Ask about a specific kennel's reputation and if any complaints have been lodged against them. EVALUATING A KENNEL After finding your local kennels, you can determine the one to use by: 1. Telephoning the kennel. Call to see if the kennel can accommodate your pet. During peak times such as the Christmas season and summer vacations, many kennels are booked up and cannot accept your pet. Also, because some pets require special handling or accommodations (very young puppies, animals on special medication or feeding schedules, or giant breeds, for example), all kennels may not accept them. While you are on the phone, make an appointment to visit the kennel. 2. Making a personal visit to the kennel. A personal visit is essential to determine whether the kennel will be satisfactory. During your visit, observe or ask about the following ... GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE KENNEL PROPER Following regular daily clean-up procedures, the kennel should look (and smell) neat and clean. Kennel operators are proud of their kennels and like to show them off, but some of them do not permit visitors into areas where animals are housed. There are two key reasons for establishing a \"No Visitors\" policy. First, some dogs react unpredictably to strangers (They become excessively fearful or aggressive). As a result, the presence of strangers in the kennel can cause such dogs to injure themselves or develop intestinal problems. Second, visitors do not follow the same stringent disinfecting procedures used by kennel personnel and can transport contagious agents (bacteria, viruses) into the kennel. However, kennels with a \"No Visitors\" policy should provide you with some type of viewing window so that you can see where your pet will be staying. In visiting your local kennels, you will observe that there are several types of kennel designs currently in use. Some kennels have indoor/outdoor runs; some have totally enclosed facilities, and some house pets inside, but utilize outside exercise areas. Each of these designs has its own advantages, and you should ask the kennel operator to explain the advantages of the system in use at that kennel SECURITY When you are on a trip, your pet may decide to try to \"find\" you. Because of this tendency, and because very few homes are designed with pet security in mind, pets can escape from inexperienced individuals who might be asked to watch your pet. Boarding kennels, on the other hand, are designed to prevent this kind of accident. During your kennel visit, look for sturdy, well-maintained fencing and gates, and dividers between runs. If your dog is a climber, digger, or some other type of \"escape artist,\" tell the kennel operator so that extra precautions can be taken (wire-covered runs, locks on gates, etc.). Cats always require covered facilities. SAFETY Kennel areas where your pet will stay should be free of sharp objects, harmful chemicals, and objects your pet might swallow. Primary enclosures (sleeping quarters) should provide solid dividers between your pet and the other boarders, both for reasons of safety and so that your pet will be able to relax and sleep without feeling challenged by his or her neighbors. Exercise areas should include barriers between runs high enough to prevent male dogs from urinating into adjacent runs. Surfaces should offer good traction even when wet. Firefighting equipment should be readily available. SUPERVISION Proper supervision is the key to good boarding. Pets should be checked frequently during the day by someone who is trained to recognize the signs of illness and distress. Experience and practical knowledge are required to detect or interpret such symptoms as lethargy (\"I thought he was just sleeping\"), severe intestinal disorders (friends or acquaintances rarely check the backyard for bloody stool), urinary problems (it is almost impossible to detect blood in urine when pets urinate on grass), loss of appetite, coughing, sneezing, or discharges from the eyes or nose. Yet, all of these signs can be significant. Competent kennel personnel is trained to recognize and evaluate such signs and to seek veterinary assistance when needed. Therefore, you should try to evaluate the competence of the kennel personnel. One good indication that the kennel operator is keeping abreast of the latest developments in pet care is his or her ABKA membership. Check for a current ABKA membership plaque on the office wall. If your kennel operator has been awarded the CKO (Certified Kennel Operator) designation by ABKA, it means that his or her competence and ethical fitness have been acknowledged publicly by the Association. If the CKO plaque has been awarded, it will be displayed proudly along with the kennel's ABKA membership certificate. Accredited kennels will display a certificate that attests to the fact that the kennel has been inspected and accredited by ABKA and has met over 200 standards of excellence. SANITATION The kennel should be free of dirt, fecal accumulation, odors, and parasite infestation (flies, fleas, ticks). There should be a strict schedule for disinfecting with effective chemicals. Note: Since 1978, there have been worldwide outbreaks of an intestinal disease called canine parvovirus. This disease is spread when dogs come into contact with a contaminated surface (clothing, shoes, grass, carpeting, etc.). New vaccines are now available to combat this disease, but until the dog population develops immunity to the disease it will remain a potential problem. Several professional disinfectants, including bleach at a 1:30 solution, are effective against parvovirus. Therefore, if there have been any reports of parvovirus disease in your area, your kennel should be using one of these products for routine disinfecting in addition to requiring parvovirus immunization. HEALTH CARE Inquire about the following ... 1. Water: Individual containers filled with clean drinking water should be available to each animal. 2. Food: Feeding procedures vary from kennel to kennel. Some kennels supply preferred brands of feed, which they serve to all boarders. However, they usually allow you to bring your pet's favorite food if you wish. Other kennels maintain a stock of the most popular brands and feed whatever you request. Still, others require that you bring your pet's food when you check-in. Determine the kennel's policy and whether there are any additional charges for special feeding arrangements. 3. Veterinary services: Ask about the procedure for obtaining veterinary service, if required. Some kennels retain a veterinarian on the premises. Others prefer to use your pet's veterinarian so that there will be a continuity of care. Remember that it is customary for you to be financially responsible for any veterinary care required for your pet while it is being boarded. 4. Immunization requirements: Dogs should be immunized against rabies, distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, parvovirus (DHLPP), and Bordetella. Cats should vaccinated against rabies, panleukopenia or distemper, feline rhinotracheitis, calici virus, and pneumonitis (FVRCPP). 5. Medication policies and procedures: If your pet is taking medication, advise the kennel operator of the nature of the problem and the type and frequency of medication. Many kennels will not accept animals requiring excessive medication (more than three times per day or nighttime medication, for example) or animals requiring potentially dangerous medication (diabetes shots, for example). Remember, it is essential that heartworm preventive medication be continued during boarding if your dog is presently taking such medication. Inquire whether the kennel provides such medication or if you should bring a supply. Ask if there is an additional charge for medicating. 6. Parasite control: If you live in an area in which fleas and /or ticks are a problem, your kennel should utilize procedures for controlling these parasites (pre-entry examinations for boarders, sprays, dips, etc.). PROVISION FOR ANIMAL COMFORT 1. Temperature control: The kennel should be able to maintain temperatures within healthful, comfortable limits for your pets. If you have an older pet, or a pet that requires warmer or cooler accommodations than are normally provided, determine if special arrangements can be made. 2. Protection from the elements: Exercise areas should provide shelter from wind, rain, snow, and direct sunlight. 3. Ventilation: Good ventilation (no drafts) helps minimize the spread of airborne bacteria and viruses. 4. Light: Lighting should be at comfortable levels during the day. 5. Bedding: Find out what arrangements are made for pet bedding. Some kennels provide resting platforms, bedding, or newspaper. Others require that you bring bedding from home. Check if there are any restrictions on owner-provided bedding (wicker beds and feather pillows, for example, may not be accepted). 6. Sleeping Quarters: As you know from observing your pet, most of his or her time is spent resting or sleeping. Your kennel should provide a place for this purpose (a primary enclosure). It should be clean and dry, and roomy enough for your pet to stand up comfortably, turn around easily, and stretch out. 7. Exercise Area: All animals require exercise, but the requirements for dogs and cats are different. Let's discuss their requirements for exercise individually: DOGS Dogs should have enough space to enable them to break into a run. Exercise time will depend upon the kennel's layout. In some kennels, dogs are allowed free access to their own individual exercise runs during the day. In such kennels, you may want to make arrangements to limit your dog's exercise time, if there is any reason he or she should not be allowed to exercise at will (an older dog with a heart condition or a \"hyper\" dog who tends to run too much weight off, for example). Other kennels use a \"time-sharing\" method for scheduling exercises. In such kennels, make sure that the time allowed and the frequency of exercise periods are adequate for your dog. CATS Because cats exercise isometrically (by stretching), and because they are not \"pack animals\" that need or enjoy the company of other animals (as dogs do), they do not necessarily require separate exercise areas but are content when housed in roomy primary enclosures. However, some kennels also provide \"play areas\" for those cats that appear to enjoy the additional space. Whether or not your kennel provides such play areas, your cat's primary enclosure should be large enough to permit stretching and moving around and should contain a regularly cleaned litter box. 8. Additional services: Many pet owners find it convenient to schedule grooming, bathing, or training for their pets while they are in the kennel for boarding. Ask if such services are available. If you are in the process of moving, the kennel may even be able to take care of shipping your pet. Such a service can save you time and trouble and helps ensure the safety of your pet. BUSINESS PROCEDURES As a customer, you are entitled to be treated in a friendly, business-like manner. Furthermore, a kennel's customer-handling practices are a reflection of their awareness of their responsibilities to you, the customer, and to themselves as professionals. Therefore, you should observe the following: 1. Personnel: Kennel's work is physically demanding and difficult. Nevertheless, kennel personnel should appear clean and neat. They should also demonstrate a high level of understanding and concern for your pet through their questions, their animal handling techniques, and their attitude. 2. Appearance of kennel grounds and office: Kennel property should be neat and well maintained. 3. Rates: Rates should be available in the kennel office. Be sure that you understand the method of calculating boarding charges. Some kennels have a checkout time, after which you are charged an additional day. Others charge by the night or day. 4. Boarding agreement or contract: Your kennel should have some type of boarding agreement that clearly states your rights and the kennel's responsibilities. This type of form protects you and the kennel from any misunderstandings in these areas. 5. Hours of operation: Days and hours of business should be clearly posted. If your kennel is closed on weekends or holidays, note and respect that policy. On those days all pets are fed and exercised and the facilities are cleaned and maintained, but the kennel office is closed and there is no one in the office to meet customers. 6. ABKA Membership Certificate: Your kennel's membership in ABKA is a public commitment to ethical practices, and is your assurance that the kennel is subject to the ABKA Ethics Program. As a pet owner patronizing an ABKA kennel, you also can call on the ABKA for information and assistance should you experience a problem with a member kennel. If the kennel also displays an ABKA accreditation certificate, you can be assured that they have met the stringent standards of the Voluntary Facilities Accreditation Program, which inspects over 200 areas of kennel operation. The ABKA Code of Ethics and the Bill of Rights for Boarded Pets should also be posted in your kennel's office for your inspection. It is a public statement of the standards by which your kennel should be judged. Using the information listed above, you have now located, evaluated, and selected your boarding kennel, and have completed most of the steps necessary for successful boarding. However, there is still one thing required to assure that your pet receives the best care possible, and that is that you fulfill your part of the boarding. Even the best kennel in the world cannot take proper care of your pet unless you assist them by observing the following recommendations ... PREPARING FOR BOARDING 1. Make your reservations early: Most kennels are booked up on holidays and during vacation times. If you wait until the last minute to make your reservations, you may be disappointed. As you make your reservations, verify those items which you should bring with you to the kennel (immunization records, special food, medication, bedding, and toys). Make arrangements for any special services you wish to have performed while your pet is in the kennel (grooming, training, or shipping). As you make your reservations, find out what type of payment arrangements are acceptable (credit cards, personal checks, money orders). 2. Prepare your pet for boarding: Remember that pets, like people, usually appreciate a vacation in new surroundings with new friends. Dogs, once they become familiar with their new surroundings, have a marvelous, exciting time, almost like kids at summer camp. (If your dog has never been boarded before, you might consider short, overnight stays at the kennel prior to an extended boarding stay to help him or she get used to boarding. Every time you return, your dog is less likely to be affected by \"separation anxiety\" and can enjoy boarding more.) As a rule, kittens take to boarding easily and have a wonderful time. Adult cats usually display a very nonchalant attitude towards boarding and prefer to sit quietly and observe the daily kennel routine. They don't seem inclined to make new feline friends or participate in group play, but seem content to rest, eat, make friends with the help, and purr. Make sure that all immunizations are current (and have immunization records, if your kennel requires them). Don't overfeed your pet right before going to the kennel. The extra food is not really necessary and the result might be an upset stomach. Finally, because pets sense and reflect our emotions, DO NOT allow any member of the family to stage an emotional \"farewell\" scene. Your pets can be made to feel unnecessarily anxious about the kennel visit if they are subjected to this kind of dramatic display. 3. Check in during business hours: Bring all agreed-upon medications, etc. Make sure that medications list the prescription number and name of the pharmacy so the kennel can obtain a refill if your return is unexpectedly delayed. Allow enough time in the kennel office to fill out the necessary paperwork. The kennel needs to know such things as name, address, phone number, return date, additional services requested, where you can be reached in case of an emergency, the name of a local contact, your veterinarian's name, and phone number, special feeding instructions (if any), medication instructions, etc. If your pet has any special problems that are not covered on the check-in forms, such as fear of thunder, epilepsy, or deafness, point them out to your kennel operator. All of this information helps your kennel take better care of your pet, especially if there is any type of emergency requiring special action. And this is what professional care is all about. Anyone can feed your pet, as long as nothing goes wrong. But what you want for your pet is supervision by someone who can assess and respond properly to emergencies. Don't be surprised if your kennel operator asks you to leave your dog in the kennel office rather than allowing you to place your dog in his run. This is done so that your dog will see you leave and will realize that you have entrusted him or her to the care of the kennel operator. It also eliminates the possibility of your dog getting the erroneous impression that you are placing him in the run to \"guard\" it. When dogs get that impression, they sometimes become aggressive. 4. Relax and enjoy your trip: Remember that you are leaving your pet in the hands of capable professionals. Pets in the kennel probably receive more care and attention than they would at home. PICKING UP YOUR PET When you return from your trip, here are some things that can help you and your pet to have a happy homecoming: 1. Pick up your pet during the kennel's normal business hours: Attempting to conduct business after hours is not only an imposition on the kennel operator and possible disruption of sleep for the boarding animals but can also result in a wasted trip to the kennel (because all personnel may be working in the kennel area and unable to hear the doorbell). For these reasons, many kennels assess an additional charge for after-hours pickup to discourage the practice. 2. Ask about your pet's stay at the kennel: Did your pet adapt well to kennel food, routine, and environment? Did he or she display any unusual behavior or require any special handling? This information will be entered into the kennel's records to assist kennel personnel in caring for your pet during the next stay, but you should also be aware of it in the event that you move or use the services of another kennel in the future. 3. Do not feed or water your dog for at least four hours after returning home: Cats adapt to their return home with the same easy acceptance with which they adapt to boarding, but dogs can become very excited when you return. And when dogs become excited, they tend to gulp food and water, which frequently triggers vomiting and/or diarrhea. Even if you normally provide unlimited access to either food or water, do not do so immediately after returning home. If your dog appears to be thirsty, provide a few ice cubes rather than water. Let him or her calm down for about four hours before offering food. 4. Contact your kennel operator if you have any questions about your pet's behavior after returning home: Sometimes pet owners become unnecessarily concerned about their dogs' behavior, which is completely normal. (For example, many dogs tend to sleep almost continuously for a day or two after returning home. This is usually a result of being back in a relatively calm environment after the excitement of the kennel). However, if you observe anything that appears to be out of the ordinary, contact your boarding kennel operator to discuss your observations. Your ABKA kennel operator wants you to understand the boarding process and your pet's reaction to it and will be happy to discuss any questions you might have. "}
