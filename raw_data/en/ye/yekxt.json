The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:37 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton, (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Biggert, Ose, and Staff present: Kevin Binger, staff director; R. Moll, chief counsel; David of communications; Carla J. deputy Petrocino, legislative aide; minority minority Ellen Rayner, minority chief clerk; JeanGosa, minority staff assistant; and Andrew Su, minority researchassistant. Mr. B URTON . Good morning. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' writ- ten opening statements be included in the record. Without objec-tion, so ordered. We will have other Members \u2014I see some of them coming in right now\u2014joining us, so they will be coming in just a few moments. We are here today to talk about a subject that has probably touched every family in America, cancer. Specifically, today we aregoing to talk about women 's cancers. At hearings in the future, we will be talking about some of the major concerns that men have,prostate cancer. I have talked to Michael Milken 's staff. We are going to be talking to Senator Dole 's staff. We will be talking to the minority also about people that they might want to have testifyabout men 's problems, prostate cancer and other issues, as well as diets that might assist men in fighting this dreaded disease aswell. But today, we are going to be talking about women 's cancers. In this country, every 64 minutes a woman is diagnosed with a repro-ductive tract cancer. One in eight women today will get breast can- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 in eight. It is an absolute epidemic. Some people believe that that figure will grow to as many as one in three or four. This is turning out to be a very busy week in Washington for cancer issues. Last Sunday, over 60,000 people participated in theNational Race for the Cure, sponsored by the Susan B. KomenBreast Cancer Foundation. This foundation has done a phenomenaljob raising awareness of breast cancer and raising money for re-search and treatment. I applaud their work, and my colleagues doas well. Today the Government Reform Committee will receive testimony from researchers, health care providers, and patients on the role ofearly detection and complementary and alternative health practicesin women 's cancers. This coming weekend, the Center for Mind, Body, Medicine, and the University of Texas, Houston MedicalSchool, in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute and theNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine isconducting the second annual comprehensive cancer conference.They will bring together researchers, practitioners, and patients, todiscuss research advances and patient needs in both conventionaland alternative medicine. This week, this same week, 1,355 women in America will lose their lives to one of these cancers. Overall, more than 10,000 men,women, and children, will die from cancer in America this week,10,000. We say to their families and loved ones, we in Congressrecognize that the war on cancer declared by President RichardNixon in 1971 is far from over. We cannot, after 28 years and tensof billions of dollars in research declare victory, because we are notyet close. My wife suffered from breast cancer several years ago. Thank- fully, she is a 5-year survivor. Last year, I lost my mother and mystep-father to lung cancer. So I know, as well as many of my col-leagues, what families go through when loved ones have to fightcancer. Every additional year a patient lives is a victory. Everynew treatment, drug, or surgical technique is a potential victory.However, we have not won this war on cancer. But we will not giveup. The committee has been working to break through barriers of in- stitutional bias to get more research done in complementary andalternative therapies for cancer, and to improve the informationavailable to the public from the Federal Government on treatmentoptions. We cannot abide by institutional biases within the Govern-ment that says something is not acceptable because it is alternativeor unconventional. We must ensure that there is a balance betweengenetics, drug development, natural product development, and al-ternative therapy research within the National Cancer Institute. To combat this bias, I am introducing the ''Inclusion of Alter- native Approaches in Cancer Research Act. '' This bill, my bill, would ensure that every advisory group of the National Cancer In-stitute would have at least one member who is an expert in com-plementary and alternative medicine. One leading drug treatmentfor breast cancer and ovarian cancer, Taxol, was originally derivedfrom the yew tree and was developed through the natural productsprogram. It is important to continue to look to nature for other op-portunities for drug development. It would be a shame if reductions VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May the natural product drug program resulted in miss- ing the next Taxol that might save lives. I have previously mentioned that less than 1 percent of the Na- tional Cancer Institute 's $2.7 billion annual budget goes to re- search in complementary and alternative medicine. That is verydisappointing. Unfortunately, the director of that institute does notsee the need to change that ratio, and told me in December thathe has no plans to extend that, even though half of America 's can- cer patients will include a complementary or alternative treatmentin their plan to fight cancer. I believe that since we are giving them$2.7 billion, 1 percent is not enough. We will do everything in ourpower to make sure that more of those funds are given to alter-native and complementary research. Taxol, Tamoxifen, and other drugs are important tools in the fight against cancer, so are pap smears and mammograms, and sois an integrated treatment plan. We have been pleased with the as-sistance we have received from several of the professional medicalassociations involved in these areas, including the Society for Gyne-cological Oncology, and the American Society of Clinical Patholo-gists. Dr. Edward Trimble will present information on the National Cancer Institute 's research in early detection and the integration of complementary and alternative health practices in women 's can- cers. Cancer is a disease, but its victims are heros and heroines.They are people, real people with families, jobs, and communities.They make a difference in our lives. People like Sally McClain,from Indianapolis, IN, who lost her life to breast cancer that me-tastasized to her spine. Sally was a friend of Claudia Keller on mystaff. She also was the daughter of a man who taught me in highschool, who was a good friend of mine. It is a shame that one soyoung should die so young because of a disease like this. But Sallydidn't give up the fight, not one single day. Or Lynn Lloyd, a high school English teacher in Montgomery County, MD. After twobouts with breast cancer, she is now hospitalized with cancer inher brain and her lungs. Even when she was receiving chemo-therapy last year, she scheduled it around her classes so she couldkeep teaching and stay involved with her students. Now that 's real dedication. Most of her students didn 't even realize that she was battling cancer until her most recent hospitalization. We are honored today to have another one of those heroines with us, a lady that 's a very, very good friend of mine. Her husband and I were elected to Congress together back in 1982. We are going tomiss Senator Mack in the U.S. Senate. His lovely wife, Ms. Pris-cilla Mack, is the executive co-chair of the National Race for theCure. As a breast cancer survivor, she knows from personal experi-ence the importance of early detection. She has worked hard toraise awareness about women 's cancer issues. With the energy that Ms. Mack brings to this fight, we will hopefully begin winningmore of these battles, saving more lives, getting research fundedthat will get the answers about prevention, early diagnosis, treat-ment, and hopefully one day very soon, a cure. Biomedical research already knows that there is not a magic bul- let cure for cancer. What we do know at this time is that the ear-lier cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chances of long-term sur- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 pap smears are such an effective tool in saving lives. We do know from good research and practice, that whensomeone develops a holistic cancer treatment plan, including atten-tion to mind, body, and spirit, then recovery is more likely, withbetter quality of life and extended life as well. Dr. James Gordon, director of the Center for Mind Body Medi- cine here in Washington, and an internationally recognized leaderin the field of complementary medicine and alternative medicine,will be testifying also about advances in complementary and alter-native medicine cancer research. When Jane Seymour, a very prominent movie star, testified be- fore our committee in February, she shared the story of several ofher friends who had gone the conventional route of cancer treat-ment and then been told by their doctors that they had done every-thing they could and it was in essence hopeless. They were basi-cally told to go home and die. These women did not accept thatdeath sentence. They sought other healthcare professionals and ad-vice from friends and family on other approaches to treating can-cer. They learned, as many others have, that in order to survivethe conventional treatments for cancer, radiation and chemo-therapy, that a body needs to be strengthened through good nutri-tion. I am delighted that Michio Kushi is here today to talk to usabout the macrobiotic diet, and that the importance of nutrition isessential in cancer patients. Mr. Kushi is recognized throughoutthe world as the foremost authority in this field. The SmithsonianInstitute has just opened the Michio Kushi family collection on thehistory of macrobiotics and alternative and complementary healthpractices at the National Museum of American History. We'll also be hearing from Susan Silver of the new Center for In- tegrative Medicine at George Washington University. This centerhas developed a program for women in cancer treatment with anintegrative approach. Dr. Daniel Beilin is here today to update us on a new tool in the arsenal of early detection, regulation thermography. This low costtest can be used as a complement to mammography for early detec-tion of changes in breast tissue. It has been used in Germany, Ibelieve, for about 10 years extensively. It is also proving to be avaluable tool in detecting other cancers like ovarian cancer andprostate cancer. We are looking into advances in research in pros-tate cancer, as I said earlier, and we plan to have a hearing earlythis fall. We expanded this investigation to cover all women 's cancers be- cause there is so much that needs to be done in breast cancer andother areas as well. For example, there is no reliable early detec-tion test for ovarian cancer; 75 percent of ovarian cancers are notdetected until the late stage, three or four, and there is only a 25percent survival rate of more than 5 years. However, of those thatare discovered in early stages, there is a 95 percent survival rateof more than 5 years. The symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague. They are bloating, sudden weight gain, gas, pressure, and lethargy. There is researchto indicate that eating lots of meat and animal fats may increasea woman 's risk of ovarian cancer. We need more good research in these areas to find solutions. The members of this committee on VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May of the aisle are very involved in these areas, including Congresswoman Mink, who introduced H.R. 961, the Ovarian Can-cer Research and Information Amendments of 1999. Linda Bedell-Logan 's sister died from cancer. During her battle, Linda 's sister, like many cancer patients, suffered with lymphedema. Linda, who was involved in healthcare, researchedher sister 's treatment options and learned about combined decon- gestive therapy. As a result of this experience, she has helpedmany cancer patients gain access to this treatment by getting theirinsurance companies to cover the costs. Lymphedema is a seriouscomplication for many cancer survivors. It causes swelling, usuallyin an arm or leg. It can be very painful, and it reduces a cancersurvivor 's quality of life. We are also going to hear from two cancer survivors. Their sto- ries show the struggles that women face with cancer and how theygo through them, the need to develop an individualized treatmentplan to find reliable information on all treatment options, and tobe comfortable with the treatment choices they make. Lee Gar-dener and Carol Zarycki are two more cancer heroines. I hope Ipronounced your names correctly. If I didn 't, correct me when you come forward. Even though they have faced the most dauntingenemy you can imagine, they have recovered, returned to livingand to helping others face cancer. The hearing record will remain open until July 25th for all those who wish to make written submissions on the record. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I now recognize my friend Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that we are having this hearing on such an importantissue. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deathamong women. Cervical cancer will kill close to 5,000 women thisyear. At least another 20,000 women will die this year from uterineand ovarian cancers. The real issues before us are how can we safely and effectively prevent, detect, and treat cancer, and how can we make sure thatall women have access to good treatments and to accurate informa-tion about their treatment choices? Proper screening techniquescan and have lowered mortality rates for breast and cervical can-cer. We must continue to work hard to ensure that women have ac-cess to the screening techniques currently available, and we mustcontinue to educate women about the importance of being screenedfor these cancers. But this is not enough. We also have to makesure that healthcare providers follow up with women, notify themof their test results, and encourage them to return for further testsif necessary. We also have to make sure that quality treatmentsare available to all women. At the same time, we need to continue to research better ways to detect cancers. Currently there is no good test for ovarian can-cer, the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in theUnited States. While mammography has been proven to reduce thenumber of breast cancer deaths in women over 50 years old by atleast 30 percent, it has not been as effective in reducing cancerdeaths among younger women. We need to continue to researchscreening techniques. We should also be looking at ways to prevent cancer. In 1993, I sponsored legislation that mandated a study of why certain local-ities were experiencing elevated incidence of breast cancer and ele-vated mortality rates. Studies such as these are important tools inunderstanding why women get cancers and how to prevent it. Weneed to know whether the causes are environmental, genetic, die-tary, and any other plausible theory. We need to understand whatis going on, and why some localities, for no reason that we can oth-erwise understand, seem to produce an extraordinarily high num-ber of breast cancers. We must concentrate our efforts on developing safe and effective ways to prevent cancer, to detect cancer, and to cure cancer. Weneed to make sure that these therapies are available to all women.We have an extraordinarily high rate of Americans who lack insur-ance; 42 million was the last figure of uninsured people in thiscountry. No one is served by battling over the relative merits of al-ternative versus traditional medicine. Instead, our goal should beto develop the most safe and effective therapies possible, regardlessof how they are classified. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we are going to hear from so many important witnesses today. I want to apologize in advance,because I have a conflict in my schedule. There is a markup in an-other committee, so I won 't be here to listen to all of the witnesses. But I will have an opportunity to review the testimony, and, I look VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May doing that, and to working with you and our colleagues to accomplish the goals that we all share. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Mica.Mr. M ICA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don 't have a formal open- ing statement, but I want to congratulate you on conducting thishearing, and again reminding us of the importance of early detec-tion, prevention, and treatment. I again compliment you on this,and also reserve some time to introduce one of our witnesses.Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Mica. Mr. Sanders.Mr. S ANDERS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chair- man, I think you know as well as anybody that this has been avery contentious committee over the last couple of years. You haveheard that, I know. Mr. B URTON . You 're kidding. Mr. S ANDERS . Yes, I know. You and Mr. Waxman know that. It is very nice to see us getting away from that type of partisan hos-tility to focus on an issue of enormous concern to every man,woman, and child in this country. I thank you very much and thestaff very much for putting on this hearing. The remarks that you have made and Mr. Waxman have made cover a lot of what my opening statement was going to be. But Ijust want to say a few additional words. You know, first of all, thefact that we are having a hearing on cancer today, probably 30years ago, there would never have been a hearing like this becausepeople said well cancer, we don 't know why it happens. God strikes somebody and that 's the way it goes. There is no cause for cancer. In fact, we don 't even talk about cancer. It 's such a terrible thing. We use the ''C'' word, but we don 't even talk about it because there is just nothing that can be done about it. So as a result of the work of a lot of people, we have come a long way. We are now beginning to take a rational look at the causesof cancer and how we can effectively treat it. Just think, not somany years ago, when you and I were younger, we watched on tele-vision and we saw physicians telling us the particular brand of cig-arette they smoked. Remember that? Telling us that they liked thisbrand of cigarette. That was physicians advertising cigarettes.Well, we have come a long way from that ''conventional '' wisdom of doctors telling us about which cigarettes to smoke. Twenty or thirty years ago, forty years ago, breast feeding was told to women and mothers as to be a terrible thing. You certainlydon't want to do that. That was physicians. That was the norm. That was what doctors were telling mothers. I can remember 15 years ago in the city of Burlington, talking to one of the leading physicians at our local hospital. I said, ''Well what do you think about diet and disease? '' ''Oh, there 's no connec- tion between diet and disease. It doesn 't matter what you eat. '' Now I think every American understands the important connectionbetween diet and disease. Every day, we are learning more andmore about the relationship between indoor air, between pollutionin general, between stress and disease, the fact that there is nota huge gap between mind and body, as you indicated. People who VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May people who are under stress are more likely to come down with a variety of illnesses than other people. We have also learned in recent years that some of those thera- pies and treatments that people around the world have been prac-ticing for thousands of years are not quite as crazy as some of our''leading specialists '' have told us. It was maybe 20 years ago \u2014I may be wrong, it was James Reston of the New York Times endedup in China, and he was ill. They practiced acupuncture on him.Suddenly acupuncture became acceptable in the United States,where for years our leading specialists had told us what a quackyand ridiculous idea that was. My point is that we are learning more and more about causes and treatments. I think this hearing is an important part in thatprocess. I agree with you that we should be doing a lot more in ex-panding the Office of Alternative Medicine, for example. I shouldtell you that we had Wayne Jonas, who was the very capable headof that office in Vermont a couple of years ago. Five hundred peoplecame out to a town meeting on alternative health in the State ofVermont on a snowy day in the central part of the State. I am working on legislation, I know many other people are, to begin expanding complementary healthcare, making sure thatAmericans have access to that type of care. The other point I wouldmake is that one of the very sad aspects of what is going on in thiscountry today is even when there are treatments available for can-cer, we have millions of people who do not have health insurance.So I would hope that we will join the rest of the industrializedworld, and on this issue you and I may disagree or we may not,but the time is now that the United States should join the rest ofthe world and have a national healthcare system, guaranteeinghealthcare to all people. What is the sense of having treatmentsout there if you have millions of people who cannot afford thattreatment? Where we do agree is I think we should expand and broaden our knowledge in terms of complementary healthcare. Europe is al-ready way ahead of us, maybe less dependency on some powerfuldrugs if there are natural cures out there. Mostly as I think youhave indicated, let 's study what 's going on out there. Let 's learn. Maybe the treatments don 't work, fine. But there is nothing wrong with exploring all of the options that are out there. So I really do appreciate your holding this hearing, and look for- ward to working with you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Bernard Sanders follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 much, Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you also for holding this important hearing. During my tenure in Con-gress, I have been very actively involved in women 's health issues, as you know, as a member of the Congressional Caucus on Wom-en's Issues, and former chair. I have been working with my col- leagues very diligently to increase the funding for women 's health, including breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer research. As Chair ofthe Technology Subcommittee of the Science Committee, I havebeen working to facilitate technology transfers between Govern-ment agencies and the private sector. Efforts such as missiles tomammograms, that project between the Public Health Service, theDepartment of Defense, the intelligence community and NASA, arecritically important in applying new technologies to the fightagainst breast cancer. The Congressional Caucus for Women 's Issues has spent a great number of years attempting to address the neglect of women 's health research at the National Institutes of Health, which as youknow, is in my district. The caucus asked the General AccountingOffice back in 1989 to investigate the NIH policy regarding the in-clusion of women in clinical studies. Women had been routinely ex-cluded from many studies, such as the physicians health study,which studied the effects of aspirin on heart disease on 22,000 malephysicians. Just this week, however, I found it astounding. I readin the Washington Post that ''drinking at least two cups of caffeinated coffee a day lowers a man 's risk of developing gall- stones. '' Now more than 46,000 men took part in this study that spanned a decade. But what about women? In 1990, the caucus introduced omnibus legislation, the Women 's Health Equity Act, which included the establishment of the Officeof Research on Women 's Health, and the requirement that women and minorities be included in all the clinical trials and protocolswherever appropriate in research studies funded by NIH. That hasbeen working. In the fall of 1990, in a meeting of caucus members,NIH announced the formation of that office and quite frankly, wecodified it in Congress, so it is a permanent office. Since that time,great progress has been made in funding for women 's health con- cerns, particularly breast, ovarian, cervical cancer, osteoporosis,and the Women 's Health Initiative. For example, breast and ovar- ian cancer funding at NCI, the National Cancer Institute, has morethan quadrupled since 1990. Recently, I initiated a letter to the House Subcommittee on De- fense Appropriations, asking for continued funding for the Depart-ment of Defense peer-reviewed breast cancer research program forfiscal year 2000. You know that we have 223 Members of thisHouse who have signed onto that letter. However, our job is far from over. Despite great strides in wom- en's health research, we still have to be vigilant, have to address issues that aren 't receiving public attention and research priority that they deserve. That is why I think we are all open to the sug-gestions and enhancing alternative medicines too. More than 14,000 women will die of ovarian cancer this year. Early detection is essential in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Yet VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May no reliable early detection test. We know that if diagnosed and treated early, the survival rate for ovarian cancer is 95 per-cent. However, there are no obvious signs or symptoms until latein its development, and only about 25 percent of all cases are de-tected at the localized stage. Congresswoman Mink has been verymuch involved in that project. There are 2.6 million women living with breast cancer in the United States today. Each year, approximately 175,000 women arediagnosed, 43,300 women will die of breast cancer, which is theleading cancer among women. Despite these frightening statistics,there are only three methods for detecting breast tumors, self ex-amination, a clinical breast exam by a physician, and the mammo-gram. I do want to comment that the first panelist is Priscilla Mack, as you mentioned. I am just very proud of the fact that she is theexecutive co-chair of the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. I havea picture of Priscilla that was taken of my running in the race justlast Saturday. It was the 10th anniversary; 67,000 people ran inthat race, bringing in a great deal of money which will help withall the research projects. I am sure you will tell us about that. As an aside, since we are all affected in some way by cancers that affect women, my sister died 23 years ago of cancer. At thattime, we began raising her six children, I think successfully. Lung cancer kills more women than breast cancer. Yet there has been very little emphasis on lung cancer in general. In 1998,23,000 women died of lung cancer. Between 1974 and 1994, therewas a 147 percent increase in women diagnosed with lung cancer.Lung cancer tends to be a silent disease, and there are no goodearly detection programs in place for women or for men. So, Mr. Chairman, I applaud you for holding this important hear- ing on the early detection and alternative treatment of women 's cancers. I look forward to the testimony from the experts and fromthose who have had some experience. Again, I applaud you. Thankyou. I yield back. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. I was looking at this pic- ture of you in the race. What was your time? [Laughter.] Mr. Kucinich.Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your continuing leadership in this area and for the participationof members on this panel, as well as our guests here today. Over 500 years ago, people thought the Earth was flat. It caused many not to want to go on a voyage that could cause them to falloff the corner of the Earth. Today there are still people who thinkthat illness and disease is something that 's outside of us and that we can turn our health over to other people who will then tell ushow we can be healthy. But through the work of people like MichioKushi, who is one of the panelists today, we have learned that wehave the ability to take responsibility for our own health. What amiracle that is. Think about that for a moment. That the conditionswhich create disease may come from things that we do. So if thatis in fact the truth, how empowering it is that we can have somecontrol over the conditions which are internal to our disease andwhich become externalized and can cause us to have a debilitationin our quality of life. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 joining this panel today, brings to it a tremendous amount of experience in his work as one of the foremost proponentsin the world of macrobiotics. As all of the students of Greek andof medicine know, macrobiotics comes from the word ''macros '' and ''bios'' in Greek, which means a great life or long life. That was a term that was coined by Hippocrates about 2,500 years ago. Today people know macrobiotics in a much more popularized way through foods like brown rice and seitan, which is a wheat cutlet,whole wheat sourdough bread, vegetable sushi, and rice cakes. Thestandard macrobiotic diet has been practiced widely throughouthistory by all major civilizations and cultures. The diet centers onwhole cereal grains and their products and other plant qualities. Over the last 30 years, Michio Kushi has taught throughout the United States and abroad, giving lectures and seminars on diet,health consciousness, and the peaceful meeting of eastern andwestern philosophies. In 1978, Mr. Kushi and his wife, Adaline,founded the Kushi Institute, which is an educational organizationfor the training of future leaders of society, including macrobioticteachers, counselors, and cooks. The Kushis in 1986 founded OnePeaceful World. It is an organization which provides information onmacrobiotics and helps to guide society toward world health andworld peace. Now one of the things that I think ought to be called to the at- tention of the Members before we begin hearing from the witnessesbecause many of you are already aware of this, later this year, theNational Institute of Health is expected to issue a long-awaitedstudy on the macrobiotic approach to cancer, which is currentlybeing completed by researchers at the University of Minnesota andat Harvard University. Another report, which is a case controlstudy from Italy, shows that macrobiotics can significantly lowerthe risk of breast cancer. That report is awaiting publication. The American Cancer Society describes macrobiotics as ''the most popular anti-cancer diet '' today. On its Internet site, the American Cancer Society states, Macrobiotics may help prevent some cancers. It may reduce the risk in developing cancers that appear related to higher fat intake such as colon cancer and possiblysome breast cancers. The macrobiotic diet, like other fat free diets, can lower bloodpressure, and perhaps reduce the chance of heart disease. Taking part in amacrobiotics program may provide some sense of balance with nature and harmonywith the total universe, and as such, promote a sense of calmness and reduce stress. So when we think in terms of health today, perhaps rather than thinking in terms of simply winning a war with cancer, we can alsolook toward changing the analogy and talk about prevention of can-cer, because some see cancer as a lack of balance. As we bring ourbodies more into their natural harmony, as Mr. Kushi I 'm sure will be testifying about, we can find that conditions of health can becreated where some may have thought previously it was impossibleto do so. So this hearing today, through the testimony of the witnesses and through the testimony of other experts, such as Mr. Kushi, willbe an exercise in raising the Nation 's consciousness over the impor- tance of looking at alternatives to healthcare, the importance offinding better ways to treat disease, and the importance of givingindividuals an opportunity to reclaim power in their own lives to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May quality of their lives, and through their courage and example, give others hope that they can do the same. So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for your ef- forts in calling these hearings. I look forward to the testimony ofthe witnesses. I am awaiting a call to go to the floor for the debateon the Kosovo spending bill, so I may not be able to be here thewhole time, but I appreciate being here now. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. You have been a big help. I appreciate your continued assistance. I might just hold up before our next member speaks, that these are some of the books that Mr. Kushi has, co-written by Mr. AlexJack. Here 's a book also, ''Let Food Be Thy Medicine. '' There are a number of books out like this. I am not just touting these par-ticular books. I don 't get a commission. But I think it 's really im- portant for anybody who is watching on television, who is in theaudience, to take a look at some of these books because change indiet I think has been proven, and will be proven in the future, tobe a real help in preventing various forms of cancer. With that, Ms. Norton.Ms. N ORTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. May I, like my col- leagues, thank you and compliment you on your initiative in hold-ing this hearing. As a Chair last year, along with Nancy Johnsonof the Women 's Caucus, I am particularly appreciative for this ef- fort. The Women 's Caucus has perhaps devoted more of its time to cancer, and especially breast cancer but other forms as well, includ-ing ovarian cancer, than it has to any other women 's issue. Last year, when Tamoxifen was announced as a drug that had provedso effective in treating breast cancer that they were stopping thetrials and letting it go forward, we held a whole hearing on thatwith the Surgeon General, the FDA, and others coming in, includ-ing women who had participated in the trials. The progress in dealing with women 's cancers is so extraor- dinarily hopeful today. Just yesterday a major controversy resur-faced that arose last year about whether women should begin tohave mammograms at 40 or 50, where the women in Congress tookthe position that they should begin at 40. Where there is some dif-ference among the experts, then for goodness sakes, let 's err on the side of the expert that may save the most lives. Now there is anadditional study just announced yesterday that affirms 40 as theage that you should start mammograms. Just today, I believe \u2014again, I 'm thinking it was yesterday, per- haps reported yesterday \u2014a study again reported confusion among women and families about the role of estrogen. We are told that es-trogen in fact does tend to be a factor in some breast cancer, butthose are the breast cancers that are easiest to combat, and thatapparently it is not as much of a factor as we thought. We all know that the most effective thing that a woman and a family can do to prevent breast cancer is early screening, and thatan early mammogram could not be more important. We had cometo the point where breast cancer was breaking down along incomelines and insurance lines. I am very pleased at the way in whichmammograms, or mammography, has become available to low in-come women and minority women who were being left out, and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May subjected to discovery of their cancers much later, when they are often not curable. The fact is that breast cancer, for example, and ovarian cancer are becoming curable diseases based almost entirely on early detec-tion. Therefore, the emphasis on prevention in this hearing couldnot be more important. We are learning that cancer is many dif-ferent diseases that act like, or at least a disease that acts likemany different diseases. I am going to say for that reason, canceris nothing to play around with. Prevention and, once the diseasesets in, responsible treatment is going to be very important. Thenotion of alternative medicine, it seems to me, is critical here. Ifyou believe that prevention is the best cure, the developing scienceon the role of fat and diet must be taken very seriously, not onlywith respect to women 's cancers, but generally. What I would like to leave the hearing with \u2014and I hope to be able to stay through most of it, I am going to have to come andgo because of other hearings \u2014is with what I regard as the great need. That is a word that I will take from what the chairman said.He used the word ''integration. '' That is to say the integration of so-called alternative medicine with traditional medicine as is prac-ticed largely in the West. The fact is, that the reason that we areable to cure so much cancer has to do with the genius of Americanmedicine. Now if we look further into alternative medicine, we mayfind the genius that enables us to help prevent cancer. Then wewill be able to bring the two together in a successful integration. I would hate to see the development of polar notions of medicine, that there 's alternative medicine, and then there 's the other medi- cine. That is a tragedy. That is a false dichotomy. Moreover, weshould not allow different sets of standards to develop for testingwhat is effective. Women have a right to know from their govern-ment what is effective, whether it comes out of nature in some puresense or whether it is manufactured by a pharmaceutical company,and the role of government is to make sure that somehow, we cando our best work by finding safe, economical ways to integrate so-called alternative medicine with more traditional medicine so thosewords disappear and it 's all medicine. Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say that with the members of the Women 's Caucus, I went to the Labor, HHS, Appropriations Com- mittee where we go every year. Instead of talking about the dis-eases of women, I proposed a new program which I call LIFE. Ichose that acronym for lifetime improvement in food and exercise,because I am appalled at the way in which, particularly the baby-boomers and children, are setting themselves up for cancer, diabe-tes, arthritis, and every deadly disease known to man throughoverweight and obesity. The notions of fat and diet are very impor-tant, but they are important because of the natural ways in whichthey prevent disease. I look forward to what our witnesses will have to say about not only their experiences, but also about these ways of preventingsimilar experiences. If I could just say on a personal note that Iparticularly am pleased to welcome Mrs. Connie Mack, because herhusband and I have worked as closely together as I have with anyMember of the Senate or the House. He is not of my party. He hasbeen extraordinary in the way in which he has used his problem- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 to work with me on tax matters. I know any man that is as good as that must have an awfully good woman for awife. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . I am sure that Priscilla guides him in everything he does. Mrs. Mink.Mrs. M INK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, want to join my colleagues in commending you for calling these hearings on such animportant matter as the discussion on the needs for early detectionand discussions of other kinds of preventive measures that could betaken with respect to women 's health issues. Mr. Chairman, for 8 years I have been trying to get the Congress to focus on the one issue that I thought was terribly neglected, hav-ing to do with the research necessary for finding some way inwhich we could detect the presence of ovarian cancer early enoughto assure that the life of the woman could be saved. I discoveredin 1991 through efforts by researchers at NIH and elsewhere, thatonly $8 million of the entire NIH budget was devoted in any re-spect to the research needed in ovarian cancer. Notwithstanding ef-forts of hundreds of women on this specific issue, we have onlyrisen to a paltry level of $40 million. I have legislation, and Mr.Chairman, in which I invite your cosponsorship, calling for a budg-et of $150 million, which even by itself is modest if we are to reallyput the research efforts that are there to discover a reliable earlydetection test that could save lives. It is important to talk about prevention and all the other aspects of your hearing today, but it seems to me that with the scientificknowledge and the intelligence and training and research capabili-ties of our health researchers throughout the country, that weought to be able to find a reliable test that could save thousandsof lives of women who are diagnosed today, too late to have theirlives saved. So many of these women are young, just beginning intheir life situation. It is something which I feel very, very stronglyabout that has been neglected. Mr. Chairman, this is really the first hearing in all these years of effort to call attention to this deplorable situation and neglect,that we have allowed. I have been to the Appropriations Com-mittee, as my colleague here has indicated, every year, asking forearmarked money for this research effort. The Appropriations Com-mittee has refused to earmark any money for ovarian cancer re-search. They have included report language, but never any ear-marked money. So I urge my colleagues to consider the legislation that is before this body, and join me in cosponsoring. I believe it is essential, andI believe that we are on the threshold of a research breakthrough.What is required is a commitment on the part of this Congress tosteer our health research industry to focus on this very, very pa-thetic neglect. If we can clone sheep and mice and other thingswith our incredible intellectual capability, it seems to me that with-in a few short years, we ought to be able to come up with a reliable VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May save thousands of lives each year. I implore this committee to continue this effort in calling attention to this serioushealth research neglect. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Hon. Patsy T. Mink follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 will be happy to cosponsor your legis- lation. I think Dr. Beilin may have some information that might behelpful in the research toward these cancers. Mrs. M INK. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Are there any other Members that wish to be heard? Mr. Ose. Mr. Cummings. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As I look down our list of witnesses, it makes my heart glad to know thatthey are all in this room. They are special people who have decidedthat they want to touch other people 's lives and are doing so every day. So I thank them for being with us today. I look forward toyour testimony. Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased that this hearing regarding de- tection and treatment of women 's cancers has been scheduled today. The medical and scientific community has made tremendousbreakthroughs in the early detection and treatment of women 's cancers in the past few years. Even with all the options currentlyavailable for the early detection and treatment, the estimates fornew incidences of these cancers are unacceptable. The NationalCervical Cancer Coalition estimates that 2 million Americanwomen will be diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in the1990 's, and half a million will lose their lives. A disproportionate number of deaths will occur among minorities and women of lowincome. It is interesting that in my district in Baltimore, sits Johns Hop- kins Hospital. Johns Hopkins does a tremendous job of outreach,but at the same time, I know many women who are dying of thesecancers every year. Virtually all of these deaths can be preventedby making life saving screening services available to all women atrisk. Common barriers to early detection screening include, andthis is very interesting, women attempting to escape knowledgethat they have cancer, prohibitive costs and unawareness of theavailability of low cost programs, lack of access to transportationto screening locations, communication barriers, lack of physicianreferrals, and lack of childcare. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 authorized the Center for Disease Control to implement a nationalcancer screening program. Through September 1996, the CDC hasprovided more than 1.2 million screening tests to low income, unin-sured, or under-insured minority women. Alternative and complementary approaches to treating these can- cers have also gained momentum. In 1998, the National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medicine was established withinthe National Institutes of Health. This has effectively engaged tra-ditional biomedical research in the evaluation of alternative med-ical treatment using scientific models. However, until more isknown about the many alternative and complementary treatments,conventional treatment methods hold the most promise. We hopefor a cure in the near future. In the absence of a cure, the ability to implement a national program to detect and treat women 's can- cers depends in large part on the involvement of various partnersin State and local governments, physicians, national and privatesector organizations, and consumers. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 spirit of greater understanding and education of varied treatments of this disease, I look forward to hearing the experi-ences and opinions of today 's witnesses. Thank you. [The prepared statements of Hon. Elijah E. Cummings, Hon. Edolphus Towns, and Hon. Louise Slaughter follow:] VerDate you, Mr. Cummings. We have two votes on the floor. We should be back here in about 15 minutes. I apologize to the people who will be giving testimony,but we will get right to you, just as soon as we get back. So pleaseexcuse us. We stand in recess to the call of the gavel, about 15 min-utes. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . The committee will come to order. Sorry for the delay. We had some votes on the floor of the House. I am sure Members will be coming back in here as they leave thefloor. I would like for our first series of witnesses, Ms. Mack and Mr. Kushi, to come forward please and take their seats. Ms. Mack, youcan sit on the left. Mr. Kushi can sit on the right. I think I will recognize my colleague from Florida for an intro- duction. Mr. M ICA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am, indeed, delighted to have this opportunity to introduce someone very special to me. Forthe past two decades, I have known the Mack family. I had an op-portunity to be a friend and also recently to be a colleague of Sen-ator Mack. I think that there have been several comments alreadyabout the Mack family. Certainly Senator Mack is a gentleman. Wehave a gentlelady with us today, his wife. Both are very accom-plished in their particular areas of endeavor. The Mack family, like many American families, and we have also heard that among our Members of Congress cited today, have beenafflicted by the rages and ravages of cancer. Their family, the Mackfamily, has been victimized by this disease. Mrs. Mack, PriscillaMack is a cancer survivor. What is great about Priscilla Mack isthat she took this adversity and this disease and she turned it intoa personal campaign of public awareness, a public education effortto have millions and millions of American women become aware ofthe need for prevention, self-examination, and the problems thatare related to breast cancer. So I am, indeed, delighted and privileged to introduce a leader in our State and in our Nation. She is really our first lady in Flor-ida in the fight against cancer, and really our first lady in the Na-tion who has brought to the public, to the American women, theneed again for early prevention, detection, and treatment. So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for this honor and welcome, Mrs. Mack. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Mack. I can recall back when Connie and I first got elected in 1908. Mrs. M ACK. It seems that long. Mr. B URTON . It was 1982. Connie came over to my condo over in Alexandria. We sat on the floor and watched Chariots of Fire. Youwere down in Florida at the time. So Connie and I have been goodfriends for a long time, as well as you. I remember watching yourboy grow up. So I am really happy you are here today. Mr. Kushi, we are very happy you are here today. I am going to read your book. Hopefully that will save my life for a couple ofyears. So we will start off with you, Mrs. Mack. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May EXECUTIVE CO-CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL RACE FOR THE CURE; AND MICHIO KUSHI,THE KUSHI INSTITUTE, BROOKLINE, MA Ms. M ACK. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Com-mittee on Government Reform, and I commend you for holding thisimportant hearing. I am here both as a breast cancer survivor, aswell as executive co-chairman of the Susan G. Komen Breast Can-cer Foundation 's National Race for the Cure. In October 1991, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Prior to the time of my diagnosis, I had followed all the recommendations withregard to having annual mammograms and clinical breast exams.However, it was through breast self-exam that I discovered mylump in my left breast. I underwent a modified mastectomy, fol-lowed by 6 months of preventative chemotherapy, 5 years ofTamoxifen. In May, the following year, I completed my reconstruc-tive surgery. I also want to note that I had had my mammogram 9 months before I found my lump. I had had my clinical exam 3 months be-fore I found my lump. Early detection saved my life through mybreast self-exam. Today I am a breast cancer survivor. My goal is to share with as many women as possible the lessons I have learned as a breast cancer survivor. The most important les-son is a simple one, educate yourself. When confined to the breast,the 5-year survival rate is more than 95 percent. But women haveto do three things, and through the American Cancer Society, ofwhich I work also in Florida, we call it triple touch. You 'll see when I mention these three things, why triple touch saved my life. Oneis your breast self exams monthly. Two, mammograms, as indi- cated by your physician. Three, your clinical exams. My messageto women is simple but important. Early detection saved my life,and it can save yours too. One of my efforts to help in the fight against breast cancer is my work on behalf of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation 's National Race for the Cure. Since its inception 10 years ago, therace has grown to the world 's largest 5K walk/run. The 10th Anni- versary Komen National Race for the Cure took place this last Sat-urday, June 5, with the record number of 66,148 participants. Ialso found out that 43,000 crossed the finish line. I believe Con-gresswoman Morella was 1 of those 43,000. We were honored that Vice President Al Gore and Tipper Gore served as our honorary chairs for the race. Breast cancer survivorstook part in a special salute to survivors which began with an in-spirational walk at the foot of the Washington Monument. We alsohad a large bipartisan contingency of Washington lawmakers andmore than 2,500 participants from 72 countries around the world.Most importantly, thousands of my breast cancer survivors, wear-ing pink T-shirts, all participated from all across this great land. Last year, the Komen National Race for the Cure awarded $1.8 million in grants to 24 Washington, DC, area hospitals, researchcenters, breast health organizations, and the national grant pro-grams of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Thesegrants provide funding for breast health programs including re-search, screening, treatment, and education programs. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 to announce that we will give approxi- mately $2.5 million in grants, to be awarded from this year 's race. Since its inception, the Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Foundationhas raised more than $136 million through the work of its local af-filiates in more than 100 communities across the country. Once again, let me offer my heartfelt thanks to the many Mem- bers of the Senate and the House of Representatives who partici-pate in the Komen National Race for the Cure series throughoutthe year. With each advance we make in finding a cure for breastcancer, we are one step closer to winning the race. I would like to, before I close, mention to you all how cancer has touched our lives personally. Through this all, I want you to keepin mind that many of us are alive today because of early detection.My husband 's mother was a 25-year breast cancer survivor. My husband 's brother died of melanoma at the age of 35. His was not detected early. My daughter is a 10-year survivor of cervical can-cer. Early detection saved her life. Because it was detected early,we now have a third grandson after the fact. She is in perfecthealth. My husband was diagnosed with melanoma right after hewas elected to the Senate. Early detection and due to the profoundexperience we had with his brother, early detection saved my hus-band 's life. Then I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Early detec- tion saved my life. Unfortunately, Connie 's mother died of renal cancer. Connie 's father died of esophageal cancer. My stepmother died of ovarian cancer. When we say early detection until we find a cure saves lives, meaningful things like this hearing and all that the doctors andthe researchers are doing, I pray to God we 'll end this dreaded dis- ease. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before this committee. [The prepared statement of Ms. Mack follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Priscilla. It is good seeing you again. I was not aware of all the tragedies that your familyhad to endure. We have had some ourselves, but, that 's a lot. So you are to be commended, and Connie is to be commended, for allthe extra efforts you put forth to help out. Mr. Kushi.Mr. K USHI . Thank you very much for this opportunity, Mr. Chairman and committee members, I very much appreciate the factthat conventional medicine has developed its technology with thegoal of diagnosing and treating various illness. We desire the con-tinuous support of the physical and the other approaches that con-ventional medicine offers for the treatment of sickness. On the other hand, the conventional approach is a symptomatic approach, and therefore, does not focus on revealing or applyingunderstanding of the cause which underlies disease. No. 2, profes-sionals engaged in the practice of conventional medicine often lackan understanding and support of other healthcare approaches. No.3, conventional treatment, including its methods of diagnosis hasalways produced side effects. This is especially true when treat-ments are over-applied, and often results in the severe suffering ofthose who receive such treatments. Four, conventional methods ofdiagnosis and medical treatment are always expensive and oftenbeyond the average person 's income. As a result, costs often become the responsibility and burden of the government, the public, andthe insurance systems. Based upon these points, the tendency of individuals to search out these alternative approaches, so-called alternative and com-plementary health practices, has increased over the past manyyears beginning, commencing from about 40 years ago. Currently,approximately 50 percent of those who are suffering from diseaseare searching for and receiving unconventional methods of treat-ment. As a demonstration of these trends, consider the example of can- cers that affect women. One, over the past 40 years, it has beenmy experience, as well as that of my associates, that many womenare hesitant to receive chemotherapy, radiation, and the other in-tensive treatments. Two, many women who receive conventionalcare seek alternative methods as a result of intense suffering, bothphysical and emotional, that they experience by conventional med-ical treatment. They seek out milder approaches. Three, many pa-tients desire to know the cause of the cancer from which they aresuffering, yet they do not receive satisfactory answers. The causes of women 's cancer, as is true of the majority of phys- ical and emotional sicknesses, lie in daily lifestyle and dietary prac-tices. For example, in the case of breast cancer, the major causesare over-consumption of high-fat foods, including dairy food andsimple carbohydrates such as refined sugar and sweets. In the caseof ovarian cancer, the major dietary factors are the over-consump-tion of eggs and poultry, as are high fat, high cholesterol animalfoods. In the case of uterine cancer, dietary causes include over-con- sumption of animal foods and heavy dairy fats such as those foundin cheese. In the case of cervical cancer, similar to prostate cancerin men, the primary dietary factors are the over-consumption of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 foods, salty foods, hard baked flour products, and heavy animal foods. In the case of thyroid cancer, the primarycauses are the over-consumption of eggs, poultry, dairy fats, andhard baked flour products. In the case of pancreatic cancer, con-sumption of poultry, cheese, shellfish, and hard baked flour prod-ucts are contributing factors. In the case of skin cancer, causes include over-consumption of oily foods, sweets, and dairy fat, high-fat foods. In the case of leu-kemia and lymphoma, dietary causes include over-consumption ofdairy fats, sugar, and sweets, as well as oily and greasy foods.Over-consumption of stimulants and aromatic substances, such ashot spices, alcoholic beverages, and caffeine, accelerate the spreadof the cancer condition. Other lifestyle factors, such as cigarette smoking, physical inac- tivity, exposure to high levels of electromagnetic fields or radiation,and the consumption of chemically treated foods and water alsocontribute to the development of cancers. Non-organic chemicallycultivated agriculture, irradiation, microwave cooking, and similarmethods of unnatural food production and artificial processing, aswell as daily unnatural lifestyle, are potential factors as well. The macrobiotic approach, which attempts to correct these unde- sirable characteristics of the current American lifestyle and dietarybehaviors, has been practiced by many individuals since the 1960 's. Beginning as a grassroots movement, the macrobiotic approach hasled to the initiation of the natural food movement and organic agri-culture. The macrobiotic approach continues to gain popularity,and currently influences many millions of people. As a healthcarepractice, this approach has helped to prevent disease and speed re-covery times associated with numerous sicknesses, including manytypes of women 's cancers. Among those in today 's audience, the following six or seven la- dies are present that have experienced various types of cancer andalso have recovered through the macrobiotic approach: ChrisAkbar, a former physicist from Pennsylvania, who recovered 14years ago from inflammatory breast cancer, which is predicted tohave a lifetime of 2 or 3 months; Marlene McKenna, a mother offive, radio/television commentator, and investment broker fromRhode Island, who recovered 16 years ago from malignant mela-noma spread to the small intestines; Judy MacKenney, a clothingdesigner from Florida, who recovered 8 years ago from non-Hodg-kins lymphoma, stage 4; Kathleen Powers, Stone Mountain, GA, di-agnosed in 1985 with endometrial cancer, stage 4, and diagnosedin 1993 with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, stage 3, terminal; DeboraWright, Athens, GA, diagnosed in 1995 with infiltrating ductal can-cer, stage 2B; Lynn Mazur, Arlington, VA, stage 4B; Lizzz Klein, Tampa, FL, diagnosedin 1985, 30 various kinds of symptoms, including brain damageand breast cancer, suspected results due to breast implants; Mr.Norman Arnold, a business leader and philanthropist from SouthCarolina, who recovered 17 years ago from pancreatic cancerspread to the lymph and liver. These ladies and gentleman will be available for interview later, if you wish. Not only have they survived their illnesses, but theyhave actively contributed to society for many years following recov- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 recurrence of cancer. The majority of those cases were all terminal. These people are only a few examples of many whohave recovered from cancer. In addition, many hundreds of womenand men have received benefits from the macrobiotic approach. The National Institutes of Health made a small grant of about $30,000 to the School of Public Health at the University of Min-nesota. This fund was applied for the collecting of data and gath-ering of medical records. The data are now under review by a re-search group from Harvard Medical School and oncologists fromBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In contrast to the conventional approaches, the macrobiotic ap- proach also includes \u2014not denying the conventional approach also, but also such practices as oriental herb medicine, acupuncture,moxibustion, and shiatsu massage, as well as other physical bodycare, emotional meditation, and psychological therapy practices, asthey are necessary. We highly recommend that the Government support the fol- lowing: One, please make available public education regarding aproper healthy way of eating, mainly using grain and vegetablebases; and more natural lifestyles. Two, increase funds available for research regarding the effec- tiveness of alternative and complementary approaches for both pre-vention and recovery, including diet and lifestyle as the base. Three, make recommendations to all health facilities and medical schools to accommodate healthful menus and cooking instructions,as well as to teach a proper healthy lifestyle. Four, advise selected hospitals or healthcare centers to establish a pilot plan for macrobiotic diet or similar diet and lifestyle, to-gether with data creation as a clinical trial. Five, please advise medical and healthcare professionals of sim- ple, practical ways of diagnosis, based upon oriental diagnoses ofthe face, pulse, meridians, and vibration, in order to effect low-cost,early detection. Six, establish community-based and school-based educational programs, including school lunch programs and high school homeeconomics classes, to recover home cooking and healthy lifestyles. Seven, we would be happy to cooperate with such governmental efforts or public efforts by dispatching or sending well-experiencedmacrobiotic educators, counselors, and cooking instructors to anypotential facilities. We recommend the funding of educational train-ing centers at the level of college or professional schools. Women are, in my humble opinion, strong opinion, the center of love, beauty, health, and longevity, and happiness among human-kind. Home and family are the base for health and happiness. Ifthis country establishes these ways of health and happiness, andprevents and treats physical and emotional disorders in a morenatural way, America will become a symbol of health and happi-ness for the entire planet. America will become a leading light forall humankind, beyond the establishments of power, politics, andeconomies. This is the way of a great America, to open a new era VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May for the 21st century. In this way, America will become the creator of one peaceful world for a healthy mankind. Thank you very much for this wonderful opportunity.[Applause.][The prepared statement of Mr. Kushi follows:] VerDate Sounds like some people like you quite a bit. I don 't even get that kind of applause when I go home. [Laughter.] First of all, let me ask a few questions here.Ms. Mack, when you had your breast cancer, did you have it in any of your lymph nodes? Ms. M ACK. No, I did not. It was diagnosed early enough. I had no lymph node involvement. Therefore, my prognosis was muchbetter. Mr. B URTON . Did you have any chemotherapy? Ms. M ACK. Yes, I did. I had 6 months of preventative chemo- therapy. At the time I was diagnosed, the protocol for breast cancerwithout node, lymph node involvement, had gone to 6 months ofpreventive chemotherapy following a mastectomy. That wasn 't done even a year before. Usually they didn 't follow along with anything. And then the 5-years of Tamoxifen after that. Mr. B URTON . Did you have radiation, too? Ms. M ACK. No, I did not. Mr. B URTON . Did not have to have radiation? Ms. M ACK. No, I did not. Mr. B URTON . I recall when my wife had her breast cancer and she did have it in five of her lymph nodes, and that 's why the prog- nosis was not that good. One of the most tragic things that peoplego through is, when they start, women start to lose their hair afterthe chemotherapy. So I just wish everybody in America could havethe opportunity to share the kinds of pain, mental pain, thatwomen and their husbands go through when that sort of thing oc-curs, in addition to the other side effects of cancer that affect thefamily life. You are to be commended for what you are doing. We really ap- preciate it. I am sure other Members will have questions for you. I do want to ask Mr. Kushi a few questions. You have \u2014appar- ently a lot of these people had diseases that would have beendeemed terminal illnesses before they went on your program. Someof those people you mentioned had lymphatic cancer and they alsohad cancer that had spread into the stomach and into the pan-creas. I heard one that said the liver, which I always thought wasa terminal situation. How do you account for the reversal of theirproblems? Is it strictly because of the macrobiotic diet you talkedabout? Mr. K USHI . All cancers are heavily related to and caused by daily eating. For example, pancreatic cancer, as I mentioned, is causedby heavy poultry eating. Mr. B URTON . Poultry? Mr. K USHI . Poultry and egg eating, and also shellfish eating, and hard-baked flour, et cetera; of course heavy fatty, oily foods. So nowwhen we approach this cancer, we must reduce, eliminate or reducethose foods which we 're eating, and we are recommending more grain, vegetables, and other healthy ones. We try to eliminate assoon as possible from her body or the patient 's body the effects of accumulated fat and those accumulated bad influences. Mr. B URTON . How do you eliminate that? Some people talk about these like chelation therapy. Do you just do it by diet? Mr. K USHI . Through the diet, a very simple way. I would like to present maybe one example. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May ahead. Ms. A KBAR . Hi. My name is Chris Akbar. I am one of Michio 's assistants in Boston. In 1985, I was diagnosed with inflammatorybreast cancer at Yale-New Haven Hospital. I was a grad. studentworking on a Ph.D. in physics at the time. My diet consisted pri-marily of ice cream, chocolate, cheese omelets, and pizzas. I wasvery fat. I weighed 170 pounds. Primarily dairy food and sweets. I discovered a red hot inflammation in my breast, very painful. I went and had penicillin for 2 weeks and nothing happened. ThenI had a mammogram that showed nothing. I had ultrasound; itshowed nothing. I finally had a surgical biopsy. They told me I hadinflammatory breast cancer. This was in 1985. They told me I had2 or 3 months to live. They said it was the most lethal; it was im-mediately in my lymphatic system. I said ''Why do I have cancer? '' to my doctors. This was at Yale Medical School, and they had a lot of research there. They said,''It's genetic. '' But nobody ever had cancer in my whole family. Then I said, ''What can I eat? I am huge. I am obese. What can I eat? '' They said, ''Don't lose an ounce, because if you lose any weight, the cancer is going to be killing you even faster, if yourbody is starting to waste away. So have some Chocolate Ensure,which is made out of basically sugars and oils. '' They served us chocolate-covered donuts in the waiting lounge of the radiation lab-oratory where I was going. I thought something was a little bitstrange. Anyway, I started chemotherapy the next day. It was CAF. It was adriamycin, 5-FU, and cytoxan. Adriamycin made my hair fallout within 3 weeks, and I was devastated by that, plus nauseated.I went through menopause at the age of 33, basically, because ofthe drugs. Then I did radiation twice a day for 6 weeks. That wasa very intense experience also. Meanwhile, I had read a book about macrobiotics. It was by a physician from Philadelphia who had prostate cancer that hadspread throughout his bones. He was basically a hopeless case. Hewas the chairman of Methodist Hospital. He picked up some hitch-hikers who were hippies back in the late 1960 's who said ''Try a macrobiotic diet, it will save your life. '' Well, he did. After 1 year of macrobiotics, he was completely cancer-free, with no other med-ical treatment. He was on a gourmet French diet, with heavy fats,heavy meats, heavy sauces, wine, everything. He was from Phila-delphia and he went to Le Bec Fin Restaurant, basically. I was on a gourmet chocolate diet. I said this is the cause of my problem. I really think dairy food goes to the mammary part of mybody and creates a problem. It just makes sense. I picked up abook, the Cancer Prevention Diet Book you have. It said, ''Dairy food and sweets is the primary cause of breast cancer. '' That was the main thing I was doing. It said, ''Stop those things and start taking some things to clean it out. '' Well, I came to Michio for counseling. His wife had just done her cookbook. I said this is my bible. I am just going to follow thisbook. I did. Michio gave me very simple remedies. He gave me aplaster made out of barley and cabbage that I just put on mybreast every night. In 5 days, I felt the tumor getting smaller andsofter. He gave me something to reduce my weight, simple vegeta- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 long white radish, and carrots. I just grated them and ate that every day. I lost 50 pounds within like2 months. All this fat came off of me. I had a really bad pancreas from so many eggs and cheese I had eaten. He gave me a simple drink made out of cabbage, carrots, on-ions, and squash, called Sweet Vegetable Drink. I took that and mypancreas cleaned out. I no longer had sweet cravings. I didn 't want chocolate every afternoon at 4. I had chronic constipation. I thinkthat is often associated with breast cancer, because the toxins sortof buildup in your body and you can 't eliminate them. He gave me something to strengthen my intestines, a simple like oriental drinkmade out of a white powder, a root powder, like a starch thatstrengthened my intestines. I just did his diet. I never have touched, in 14 years since, I haven 't touched any ice cream or chocolate or dairy food or meat, and I don 't miss it at all, or sugar. After 2 months, I got incredible diarrhea one night. I wondered what was happening. The nextmorning I had realized that my entire tumor that was hanging onhere was completely discharged out of my body naturally. What had happened was in your intestines, when you eat, the nutrients from the foods that you are eating are absorbed and itchanges the quality of your blood. If you are taking these thingslike I mentioned, these macrobiotic-type things, it actually goesthrough like a solvent and goes in and through your body andcleans everything out. So as I was losing all of this fat, everythingwas literally, along with the tumor, was just absolutely dischargedout of my body. It was very effective. I am a scientist, so I kept very careful records of what I was doing and how my body was reacting. I found if I took any extraoils\u2014he had told me oil is like throwing oil onto a flame, which was this inflammatory tumor \u2014if I ate any oil, the redness would come back. In fact, it did, the inflammation. I could actually causethe inflammation to come back. I just literally eliminated all ofthat stuff that caused the cancer, took these things, these vegeta-bles and grains and beans and seaweeds, and whatever, to cleanout. Literally it flushed out of my body and saved my life. So in 2 months, when I was supposed to be dead even with the medical treatments, it saved my life. It was so effective. It literallyused the food as a cleaner to go through and clean out my body,very effective. I was really impressed. So I 'm alive; 14 years later, here I am. Mr. B URTON . I would guess you would be impressed. [Applause.]Mr. K USHI . Those friends, besides many hundreds of other peo- ple, have been experiencing similar ways. Mr. B URTON . Well thank you, Doctor. My time has expired. Let me yield now to my colleague, Ms. Nor- ton. Ms. N ORTON . Thank you very much. Both of these testimonies have been very, very impressive and very important. I would like to know, Mr. Kushi, what is your training or your background that led you to the development of your approach? Mr. K USHI . Fortunately, I was not in medical school. I was a po- litical science student, international law. After the end of the war, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May War, I wanted to have world peace. So I became a world federalist. Mr. Norman Cousins and a friend sponsored me, and Icame at the age of 23 years old to America, 50 years ago. Thenwhile I was studying in Columbia University 's graduate course, ac- cumulating various kinds of documents, the drafts of world con-stitutions and other related documents, I started to wonder wheth-er even if this world government, world federation is born, howabout sickness, how about love, how about sharing of people, howabout prejudice or discrimination, those mental problems. And thenI wondered, unless those things were corrected, there is no worldpeace. So I started to search for a solution, including visiting Dr. Ein- stein and Mr. Norman Cousins and various others, Thomas Mann,and so forth. But there were no active clear answers. But we havemade religions, hoping to make people better. But between reli-gions, then fights arise. Then we hoped education had high expec-tations, and also material prosperity; then again, unfortunately,sickness spread, crime spread. So I started to \u2014I gave up all political science studies and I start- ed standing on a corner in New York 's Times Square. Since I had been here, I started to watch people. What is humanity; what ishumanity? It took 2 12months; then I understood. Everyone had been, mankind has been made by two factors: one, environment,and two, what we eat. What we eat is entirely in our hands, freedom. Individual people are freely choosing, freely cooking and so forth. Now if proper dietis eaten, and the environment, certain clean environment is done,then happy conditions come. If not, then sickness arises, crimearises, violence arises. So then I found that in the American dietof the 19th century, 20th century, comparing 19th century and20th century, tremendous change occurred. More increase in ani-mal food. More increase in dairy food. More increase in refinedsugar. More increase in mass production of food, agricultural prod-ucts, et cetera, and so forth. Exactly parallel with this change of diet, heart disease is increas- ing, cancer is increasing, and various kinds of so-called degenera-tive diseases are increasing, as well as so-called virus diseases andalso mental problems have increased. So I wanted to change ourcurrent way we're eating. Then we began the so-called natural foodmovement and cooking classes. This is my background. Ms. N ORTON . It is certainly true, particularly when studying pop- ulations of different countries, research has begun to show the as-sociations that you indicate. I also note that in your testimony youseem to have an integrative approach as well. You indicate thedebt we owe to conventional medicine, and then you indicate thatthere are certain things that medical schools and others can do tointegrate these approaches in order to get better results for peoplewho have the disease or to prevent the disease. May I ask if the people who are under your care, if you require that they not engage in conventional treatment or if some of themhave also been engaged in conventional treatment while being in-volved with your diet? Mr. K USHI . Those things are up to the patient. The entirety of patients have entire freedom. However, because the cause is diet VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May so basically the cure is, basically the diet, proper diet and proper lifestyle. Then in addition to that correction, patients,if they want chemotherapy or radiation or acupuncture or herbalmedicine, that 's fine. They can attach these. But I hope this treat- ment can be mild and not overdosed. Because in my opinion, andin other people 's opinions, by overdose of chemotherapy, overdose of radiation, this often affects so much the suffering of the patients,not only suffering, I wonder maybe shortening their life also. Amoderate approach, I hope, the medical treatment can take. Ms. N ORTON . I just want to say to Mr. Kushi, I think increas- ingly many people adopt the point of view you just expressed, thatthe treatment is worse than the cure, and many people forego suchtreatments. I just want to say in closing to Ms. Mack, how important her leadership has been, that when you have come forward and otherslike you have come forward, you cannot imagine the effect you havehad on people who would not otherwise come forward. By doing therace, there are women whose attention we could not possibly getexcept through the dramatic intervention of well-known womenwho are first, willing to indicate that they have had the disease,and then willing to show that the disease can be defeated. I cer-tainly want to thank you for that. I have a sister who is now president of a college, who has had breast cancer and feels herself entirely cured. Since I am her sister,not only do I want her to be cured for that reason, but because thisthing may also run in families. I certainly appreciate the leader-ship you have given to this work. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Norton. Mr. Mica.Mr. M ICA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. Mack, I just had a couple of questions. First of all, your leadership has been tremendous in the private sector in providingawareness and also raising funds. You cited in your testimony howmuch money had been raised privately just by the activities youhave been involved in. Maybe you could comment to the committeeon your suggestions for research and for funding, and what do youthink would be an appropriate private-public mix of funds? Ms. M ACK. Well, I believe the Congress is doing an awful lot in the doubling of the moneys for NIH which Connie has been in-volved with. Getting the funding doubled for NIH will help all dis-eases. I believe that all that we do in research is where we aregoing to find the true answer to not just cancer, but all other dis-eases, and through research, through alternative medicines. Re-search in every way is going to make the difference. Public and pri-vate, we all have to work together. It is a large problem. The Gov-ernment can 't do it alone, and neither can the private sector. I think whenever we can partner and whenever we can work to-gether, the cures and the research will come to make a difference. Mr. M ICA. One of the other things that I wanted to ask about was that you had talked about awareness and self examination.There seems to be somewhat of a lack of public awareness. Howdo you think we should best approach these campaigns from a pri-vate sector 's standpoint or public or a combination? What do you VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 most effective in getting the message that you are trying to get out to women and others? Ms. M ACK. Well, I believe it is through hearings like this, through races, through advocacy, that all the women in this room,and all the people in the cancer communities do. We are blessedin this country with many generous, wonderful people who raisemoney in the private sector, but also our Congress and our admin-istration, work diligently to find the answers to cancer, in par-ticular, and diseases in particular. But I just think we have to con-tinue. We can 't sit, rest on our laurels. We have to continue to be out front and continue the fight, and to make more people aware. I mean, as obvious or as outfront as I have been and Dr. Kushi and everyone else, there are many, many people out there whohaven 't heard a word we have said. We have to continue to get to the underserved. We have to continue to get the message out thatearly detection, until we find a cure, is the way to deal with mostdiseases if you find it, or prevention through ways that have beenproven to make a difference. It takes a lot of money. It takes a lotof time, and it takes a lot of heart. Through public and private, wecan do it together. We cannot do it alone. Mr. M ICA. Thank you. Mr. Kushi, you spoke quite a bit about diet and changes in life- style and prevention. What do you see as the role of research todayand how important do you think that is in finding a cure for canceror addressing cancer treatment? Mr. K USHI . There are many approaches for cancer treatment and many ways we should also examine, and research should be done.However, as I pointed out, basic problems of cancer and other dis-ease are what we are eating and daily life. Therefore, do researchto associate diet and daily life with cancer, and if more researchgoes there and finds what kinds of results are coming, such as testin the clinical trials, in the hospital, this and that, et cetera; anddata accumulation. For example, it 's very easy to confirm that blood pressure comes down or cholesterol comes down, it is veryeasy by changing diet. Same thing, like for diabetes, it is very easyto offset, even though insulin has been consumed. Situations arealso very easy by dietary control. In a similar way, if you subject patients to a study about this type of cancer, or just study this type of sickness, how diet is re-lated. I suppose I or someone else, we will be very happy to confirmthat this kind of diet will offset or reduce or prevent that; while,if the current way of eating continues together with any medicaltreatment, how different outcomes will result. It is very clear, youcan see that. Then after you have accumulated those data, thenyou can apply these clinical tests in the hospitals, you can applyit in other health clinics. Those data can be created easily in 6months, 1 year, or at most 2 years ' time, enough data which we can convince the people who are watching the healthcare field and edu-cational field. Mr. M ICA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Mica. Mrs. Mink.Mrs. M INK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to compliment both of our witnesses. You have very inspirational messages, not VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May committee and the Congress, but to the American peo- ple at large. I detect the common theme of both of your testimonies, is a sense of personal responsibility. In your case, Mrs. Mack, your detectionwas by yourself through self examination. The message there isthat notwithstanding all the medical instruments that are nowavailable for detecting breast cancer, there is really no substitutefor the once-a-month self-examination procedure. In your case, Mr. Kushi, the knowledge that what you eat is what you are, I think, is an important message that we have totake very, very seriously. I do think that the points you make inyour testimony, Mr. Kushi, have been well expressed by nutritionexperts, by people in the medical profession who are constantlyhammering on your diet, don 't eat fats and stay away from this or that. So I think the general message is not that different in termsof the medical profession and what you are espousing. The point, however, of getting the message earlier in life, par- ticularly in places like the school lunch program in our schools andin our training programs. I have been told that medical doctorshave less than one course subject on nutrition and the diet. Theygo out and they are treating patients with very serious illnesses,with very little perception about the importance of diet. So I thinkwe have to carry the message to the professionals and convincethem that the words they expound about diet truly have meaning.I think that that is what you have brought to this committee. Icommend you for your work and for your leadership, and commendyour book. I will get a copy and read it from cover to cover. Thankyou very much. Mr. K USHI . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Mink. Mrs. Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to have heard both of you and to Mr. Kushi, to have had the womenwho have appeared here and gentleman to comment on the suc-cesses. Priscilla Mack, you are so right. You know, over and over again, you said early diagnosis makes the difference. I am pleased that inmy area with the American Cancer Society, with a number of hos-pitals involved, with Hadassa, we have been bringing a programcalled Check it Out to high schools, and inviting the 11th and 12thgrade females to come together in an assembly and to learn self-examination. They ask very graphic questions. They learn it notonly so they can get into the habit of doing it, but so that they canbe the messenger, to bring the message to their older sisters, theirmothers, their grandmothers, their friends. I guess that this issomething from what you said, in terms of how you even discoveredthat you had a challenge, it is through the self detection. So I want you to know how much I appreciate what you have done, and the fact that you have brought an enthusiasm and such strength to the whole concept of research and our own personal in-volvement, and certainly the Komen Race for the Cure. No wonderthe money has doubled over the last year, because we have had in-spirational people. So thank you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 Kushi, whether or not first of all, these peo- ple who are such great testimonials to the concept of the dietaryfacet of it, do they come to you as a last resort? And how do theyhear about you? Do you have any centers in Maryland? Mr. K USHI . Your home, I hope your house will become a center in the near future. First of all, many people are coming to see me or my associates, or teachers. Many of them have already received medical treat-ment. They were declared \u2014no way, terminal cases, or they them- selves were dissatisfied with the results of the medical treatment.Those people come. Of those people who come, maybe 40 percentof people are this type. Second is the people who got sickness and got diagnosed. Then they start before they receive conventional treatment, they start tosearch for alternative ways and come to us. That is the second ap-proach. That may be about 30 percent or so. Another number of people for the sake of keeping their health, for the sake of precaution, they also come. And people who havecome to us because they found at that time maybe stage one, two,or three of cancer, different stages. But as I said, and as you know,many women are hesitant to go in for drastic treatment. So beforereceiving treatment, they search. Otherwise, after they receivesome drastic treatment, then they still are told there is no hope.Then they start to search. Mrs. M ORELLA . Do they hear about you basically through your book? Mr. K USHI . Yes, through words, through books. Mrs. M ORELLA . Word of mouth, words spread. Mr. K USHI . Yes, that 's right. We are not a commercial venture, so we never advertise. But through books, through education, andalso our educational center, the Kushi Institute in Massachusetts.However, through that dedication for many years, many graduateshave come. I develop those teachers. Throughout the world, severalthousand teachers are out there. In this country, many States,many cities have also macrobiotic teachers. They are doing cookingclasses, they are doing health advice or various social work. Mrs. M ORELLA . You would, it seems to me, suggest that doctors, that all doctors, all of the health practitioners include as part oftheir treatment that there be the recognition of how food as wellas exercise and other moderate lifestyles, the role that food plays. Now she mentioned some of the mixtures that you made. I mean do you have to have it in mixture form? Can you just have likegood vegetables and have a list of dos and don 'ts? Does it have to be mixed in a certain proportion? Mr. K USHI . It depends on the condition. For example, you know, like colon cancer, that more is caused by beef and pork and cheese,eggs. Eliminating that effect, then we need like grated daikon,grated carrots, green leafy vegetable juice, and so forth. More oppo-site factors we bring, and other factors to balance the condition. Inthe case of, like I would say intestinal problems, then there, tradi-tionally the oriental countries have been using kuzu and also pick-led plums, which are very good for digestion; and also, suppose, ifyou want to straighten out pancreatic cancer, then you better havesweet vegetables like cabbage, carrots, squash and onions: those VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 in equal amounts, and with three or four times water, cooked 25 minutes. That 's a sweet vegetable drink. Drink every day, one cup, two cups. That makes it easy to solve the can-cer. In the same way, our approach is, No. 1, the safest approach. No. 2, cost value is low. No. 3, at home they can practice and use foods,food which they can get very easy. Using them, they make homeremedies. Mrs. M ORELLA . I guess I am going to have to buy the book. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Mr. Cummings. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. To Ms. Mack, I want to thank you for being a leader in this area. So often what happens is, I think it was Martin Luther King, Sr.,who said that you cannot lead where you do not go, and you cannotteach what you do not know. So often people go through difficulties.Once they get through their difficulties, they almost act like itnever happened. But not only have you remembered, but you haveacted on them to try to help other people. I think that there is nogreater thing that we can do as human beings than to use ourpains and our problems to turn them around and use them as apassport to help other people. So I thank you for your leadership. As I was looking at the statement of our good friend Mr. Kushi, I just want to ask you a few questions because I am truly fas-cinated. Mr. Chairman, I am so glad you had this panel becauseI did not expect it to be so interesting. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . Are you inferring that this committee is not inter- esting? [Laughter and applause.] Mr. C UMMINGS . One of the things that you talk about is cost,* [see below] that so many people, they can 't get healthcare because of the cost. I guess they may not have insurance or whatever. I amsure it must be very frustrating to you and probably I 'm sure you too, Ms. Mack, when you are on this mission to help people and toknow that cost of treatment is something that because people can 't afford certain treatments, that people are literally not only suf-fering, but dying. I mean that must be a very frustrating thing foryou all. I just would like for you all to comment on that. Mr. K USHI . I agree, and for example, more in conventional medi- cine, doctors learn in medical school training there is no singlecourse for nutrition, and diet; but by eating we form blood, we formour limbs, we form all sides of our bodies. Without understandingthat, there is no way to understand cause.* [It seems that Mr.Kuchi heard ''cause '' instead of ''cost'' in the question of Mr. Cummings. Therefore, he addresses the frustrations of sympto-matic medicine where ''cause '' is not eliminated.] Therefore, all pa- tients are frustrated. If treated with a symptomatical approach,symptoms maybe might be temporarily eliminated; but then thecause still continues, still taking heavy meat, et cetera. Then again, symptoms come back 2 years later, 3 years later, all very shortly.Again, in the hospitals, even in hospitals, what are patients fed inthere? They are fed the cause of the sickness, that beef or ice creamor whatever. This is a very ironic situation! VerDate 11-MAY-2000 to help sickness, they are creating more sickness, and endless heavy treatment, more increasing chemotherapy; moreradiation is needed; and doctors themselves, I know, many doctorsare frustrated. Why should we not open our eyes to the cause.Without knowing the cause, there is no way of cure. That 's the medicine of symptoms, but not cure. But cause is, day to day ourown way of eating, our own way of lifestyle! There probably, ourthinking, consciousness must change. We want to have the pros-perity, we want to have that. Our thinking must need to change,but at the same time, we can begin from day to day life now. We lost family cooking, with all outside fast food and this and that, et cetera; and together we are losing family cooking. Our fam-ily relations between father and mother and the children are be-coming more and more troubled. Also in school, the concentrationof students becomes troubled. The school lunch program is morefatty food, more heavy food, more sugary food. They can 't con- centrate in the school. Then unless we bring back to America andthe entire world, which is influenced by America, good way of eat-ing again, there is no way to solve this. America and other coun-tries are all sinking down physically and economically. Mr. C UMMINGS . I must tell you that you already had an impact on me. I have gone back there to the little room here to eat my po-tato chips, roast beef, and my Coke, and I could hardly get it down.[Laughter and applause.] As a matter of fact, I left three-fourths of the bag of potato chips out there. I think I am going to throw them in the trash. Mr. K USHI . Let us think of our ancestors, your ancestors, all mankind 's ancestors. Traditionally, we have been eating whole grains day to day. Right? Either bread form or rice form or what-ever, and then vegetables, then beans. From beans, bean productswe have been getting more vegetable quality proteins. Some coun-tries may be getting seaweed, and so forth, a mineral source. Thenwe are doing home cooking. Animal food, like beef, our ancestorsconsumed much, much less. I have no objection to having that, ani-mal food, but much less percentage, and not like currently, likeantibiotics \u2014or hormone-treated beef, and so forth. Then we didn 't have cancer in the 19th century, 18th century. Why not? The tre-mendous change in the diet. Tremendous decline of what we areeating! Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair- man. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Cummings. I didn 't know you were a standup comedian, but you are pretty good. [Laughter.] Mrs. Biggert.Mrs. B IGGERT . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kushi, your diet seems to be quite the opposite of several diets that are popular right now in this country as far as losingweight. Mr. K USHI . For example? Mrs. B IGGERT . Like the Zone diet or sugar busters, those high protein diets, which are high in fat, animal and dairy. But do youthink that these type of diets then will contribute to greater cancerrisks? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 certain period, for certain period, to certain symp- toms they maybe contribute. But what macrobiotics recommends isvery traditional, thousands of years or maybe a million years, man-kind 's experience, generations to generations, whole grain and vegetables, beans, et cetera. And that is the base. It then dependson climate, depends on where you live. Cooking methods change,and also combination of vegetables, combination of foods change.But the base is there, grains and vegetable base. Animal food youcan add 5 percent, 10 percent, depends on your condition. Fruitsalso you can add, it depends on the seasons. Suppose we didn 't have in Washington, DC, our 20th century ba- nana, because it simply didn 't grow here. Now we are taking a ba- nana every day. Or sugar, we didn 't have sugar cane. We are not growing it here. All climates are different. Therefore, we need forthose things to have moderation \u2014tropical products, et cetera. That means environmental consideration is needed. Mrs. B IGGERT . What about the role of exercise then? Mr. K USHI . Oh yes. The role of exercise is great. However, re- cently they are recommending that some special exercise is verypopular now, certain types of exercises. I would say yes, you maydo so. However, more important is day to day work, day to day ac-tive living. I am recommending to the sick people, the people whoare sick and my associates, I am recommending every day with hotwet towel squeeze, scrubbing their whole bodies twice, morning andnight, making blood circulation active, and so forth. Then take awalk at least a half hour, taking a walk if they can walk. Then ifthey can do any light exercise, fine. But not strenuous exercise.Then every day, singing a song, happy song \u2014''You Are My Sun- shine '' or whatever, not a depressing song \u2014every day. That opens the chest and makes the breath and circulation better, and theemotions up. Also I am recommending people wear cotton clothing,and more cotton bedsheets and pillow case, instead of syntheticones; and more also putting green plants in the home, which emitoxygen and keep the house better. Also, this may be a problemnow, not using a computer much if you are sick. Mrs. B IGGERT . It sounds like a whole positive attitude. Mr. K USHI . Yes. Also microwave cooking is very questionable, microwave cooking. Now 75 percent of the American families areusing microwave cooking. This is a big problem, question. Tradi-tional cooking, like charcoal cooking, or the gas stove is much,much better. Furthermore, the like electromagnetic environment itis better to examine. Also, as home family cooking will be recov-ered, and I hope they have a chance, the whole family has a chancesome evenings at dinner time, to talk to each other. They shouldsleep not at midnight, more like 10 or 11, and so forth. In otherwords, healthy, normal healthy life! Mrs. B IGGERT . Thank you. Mrs. Mack, I really appreciate your testimony and your presence here after the Race for the Cure last Saturday. It is amazing howacross the country this type of activity is being conducted. I knowin Illinois we had a big event there. I have to say that we didn 't have quite the 66,000 people that were here in Washington, DC.But I think that does so much to raise the consciousness of theproblem. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 with breast cancer survivors, are there charac- teristics that you find that people have in common that are suc-cessfully overcoming their cancers? Ms. M ACK. Well, I will have to speak only for myself and the peo- ple I speak to, my impression of that. But I find like Mr. Kushisays, if you have a higher power and you do everything on your be-half that you can do to further your recovery, take care of yourselfto find out what 's out there to take care of it, and then what you can't do, let go and let God handle. Also, if you can do that and you have the serenity to do the right things for yourself and havethat positive attitude, I find that through all of these things, weare changing the mindset that cancer is a deathnell. When we con-tinue to do that, we also bring to that good mental health, whichalso affects your physical health. Mrs. B IGGERT . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Well, thank you, Priscilla. You have been lovely as always, and we really appreciate your comments, especially the lastones you made. I think those are very important about having thehigher power, the supreme being. A little prayer doesn 't hurt. It doesn 't hurt a bit. It kind of calms the soul and helps stabilize ev- erything. Mr. Kushi, I pledge to you, every morning I am going to start singing ''You Ain 't Nothing But a Hound Dog '' so I can get myself off to the right start. Let me thank you both. I think it has been very, very enlight- ening. We really appreciate it. Mr. Kushi, your book, I am goingto recommend it to a number of my colleagues. I think they wouldlike to read it as well. So thank you both very much. Mr. K USHI . May I just add one thing about diagnosis? Very sim- ple. For the family, to know where diagnosis is about cancer condi-tions, in the beginning stage. At this place,* [Mr. Kushi points tothe outside edge of his hand, below the little finger] if green colorcomes out, then we have to suspect in the near future cancer maybegin. Mr. B URTON . Here? Mr. K USHI . Yes. In the case of breast cancer, this center, green straight line * [Mr. Kushi points to an imaginary line running downthe center of the underside of his arm, up through the center of thepalm, to his middle finger] comes, in the case of risk. This begins6 months before cancer, one of the symptoms. This is an acupunc-ture meridian, the so-called ''heart governor '' meridian. It goes across this breast. If that meridian is clogged from the breast, thendown the arm, it then becomes a green color in the case of cancer. In the case of the uterine cancer or ovarian cancer, here * [Mr. Kushi grasps his chin with his thumb and index finger] if we havea very fatty, large deposit, and especially a hard one, then uterinecancer, ovarian cancer or cervical cancer is very suspected. Prostatecancer too, is very suspected for men. Mr. B URTON . Right here under the chin? Mr. K USHI . This. It 's because low in the head reflects low in the body. It 's very accurate. Various simple way of detection are avail- able also, as information for home use. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May Thank you, Doctor, very much. Thank you both. We really appreciate it. Thank you all those who are applauding. I ap-preciate that as well. We would like to now have Dr. Gardener, Ms. Zarycki, and Ms. Bedell-Logan come forward, please. Dr. Gordon, since you have time constraints and you have to leave right away, you said you have a relatively brief statementyou would like to make. So we will allow you to do that. Then wewill go right to our ladies. Dr. G ORDON . Sure. I wanted to be able to stay around for ques- tions though, if you would like to ask the questions too. I just wassaying that I have to be back there by 3. Mr. B URTON . In that case, if you wouldn 't mind, Dr. Gordon, I think we will go ahead with this panel, and then we 'll hold you, because I think we will be finished by 3. Dr. G ORDON . OK, great. Mr. B URTON . Let 's start with Ms. Zarycki. Did I pronounce that correctly? Ms. Z ARYCKI . It's Zarycki. Mr. B URTON . Zarycki, I 'm sorry. STATEMENTS CAROL YORK; N. LEE GAR- DENER, PH.D., LINDA BEDELL-LOGAN,SACO, ME Ms. Z ARYCKI . I was going to say good morning, but it 's really good afternoon. Mr. B URTON . Well, these hearings sometimes run a little ways into the afternoon, but they are very important. Ms. Z ARYCKI . Yes, they are. Thank you for the opportunity to tes- tify regarding complementary and alternative practices, which Iwill call CAM, and the role of women 's cancer treatment. I am Carol Zarycki, an advocate and breast cancer survivor of 2 years.In my written testimony, I have outlined issues and instanceswhere we as patients have had to do most of our own research inseeking out CAM protocol. I will highlight some of these points andsummarize my personal approach. I am speaking for myself and other patients and advocates whom I'll call we, to request legislation for CAM medical research and funding rather than to continue regulation of standard allopathictreatments, the costs of which are ultimately borne by the taxpayerand the Government, and which do not show an increase in cancersurvivor statistics. We are tired of hearing about measures such astime to recurrence, tumor regression rate, or time to disease pro-gression, when the real issue is preventing cancer in the first place.We would like to see a shift of funding and research attention tothe review of a standard cancer protocol that is less toxic, bettertargeted, and more effective, while at the same time, focusing onCAM therapies. The role of insurance coverage is a primary factor in the CAM choice process, and needs to be addressed, not just for patenteddrugs or diseases with a name, thereby endorsing insurance cov-erage, but for natural alternative treatments, so that we don 't have to invent new names for new types of cancers. We need to have ac-cess to treatments and clinical trials that will work with us as indi- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 in choices. Some toxic medical proce- dures given routinely can leave the immune system in deep dis-repair, making one more susceptible to recurring disease for thisvery reason. Ironically then, one would have to seek alternativetreatment not covered by insurance to alleviate or attempt to al-leviate this previously non-existing damage. Information needs to be made available so that individuals are fully informed of options and possible treatment outcomes, includ-ing quality of life and survival rates for the treatments they arechoosing. Most women given Tamoxifen do not need the drug, andmay even get the danger of side effects of blood clots in the legsor lungs, uterine cancer, strokes or heart attacks. A few of thesewomen will have disease progression or recurrence anyway. New legislation is required for alternative therapies in cases where old or even new drugs may not demonstrate an increasedsurvival rate or even a better rate of progression-free survival. There needs to be a recognition of chemicals in the environment and their effect on hormones from the fish we eat to our plastic-bottled drinking water. Our country regularly imports fruits, vege-tables, and foods that have been treated by toxic methods, evenwhen the imported food is labeled organic. Since it has been dem-onstrated that hormonal imbalances are an underlying factor in agrowing number of breast and reproductive cancers, wouldn 't it make sense to research natural hormones rather than add syn-thetic tamoxifen, raloxifine or premarin to an already overloadedhormonal testing methods and not just scientific competi- tion within the medical community, without regard for the popu-lation being studied, need to be employed. Trials which indicate lifeextension should additionally be able to demonstrate that thismeans for more than a few weeks, and should also discuss qualityof life issues. Non-toxic and non-invasive methods of cancer detection should be standardized, instead of encouraging mammograms whichstrongly increase a woman 's chances of getting breast cancer in her lifetime. Also, for younger women with dense breasts and therefore,unidentifiable or undetectable cancer, mammograms can weakenthe still growing tissues, thereby promoting future malignancies. A focus on preventive measures which strengthen the immune system rather than early detection methods, which can also be toolate detection, and with their own set of risks and hazards, can beincorporated into an individual 's lifestyle. Allopathic medicine used on its own needs to clinically understand the traumas anddebilities it is in itself creating, not curing. We want to be able tolive in peace with the treatment decisions we are making, withoutfear that mammograms, therapies, toxic and synthetic drugs aredoing a potential future harm to another part of our bodies. We donot want to hear about 5 or 10 year guidelines that we are beingmeasured against, but rather experience peace by knowing aboutimmune strengthening practices which will eliminate the need forthese guidelines and also the topic of recurrence. We are requesting a sharing of both conventional and alternative medicine, so that it can truly be called an integrative complemen-tary medical practice. We must try a new approach because the old VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May simply not effective in reducing mortality rates. We must try a new approach because the old ways are simply not saving ourbest friends ' lives. For my personal approach and upon initial diagnosis, I spoke to my herbalists, each of whom had started their practices due to fam-ily members ' involvement with cancer. I contacted local and na- tional organizations, including SHARE in New York City, becominginvolved in support groups and informational workshops. I spokewith whomever I came in contact with who had gone through asimilar experience. I started keeping a daily journal, prayed more,and learned about meditation. I made appointments with alter-native naturopaths and noted visualization authors. I began juicingand nutritional therapy, checked out nutritional cleansing, enzymeand vitamin therapies, started ancient Eastern practices of QiGong and Jin Shin Jitsu, went to healing services and ceremoniesof different cultures, bought more herbal books, and took classes tobegin making my own combinations. I became a devout fan of acu-puncture and studied homeopathy. I wouldn 't say I did anything radically alternative, but then some consider meditation or acu-puncture radical. I began to teach others what I was learning about my favorite non-toxic personally tested alternative methods of healing. I havebeen blessed with a team of surgeons, oncologists, and alternativepractitioners who have come into my life exactly when I neededthem, and with whom I continue to discuss alternative informationand ideas, even though they express doubt about the methods I amusing. There is, I found, a fine line between being cured and being healed. While we all want to think of ourselves as being cured oron the way to finding new cures, the only way this can happen isby allowing a healing to take place on all levels, mind, body, andspirit, and which standard allopathic medicine does not fully ad-dress. This is a highly individual process involving reflection andrecognition of our relationship with surroundings, why we are here,and what we are called here to learn, and then working with thisprocess rather than fighting it or attaching blame. When we ap-proach this awareness, we have already begun to heal and our ownenergy, spirit, vital force, qi, and prana, are strengthened fromwithin, turning the healing process into a curative journey. Thankyou. [The prepared statement of Ms. much, Ms. Zarycki. Ms. G ARDENER . I wanted to say thank you, Mr. Dan Burton, and also committee members, for your role as David in confronting Go-liath. I appreciate and admire you. I had originally planned to sort of talk about my story and that 's not what happened. But my story has led me to where I am now,the place I am now, and to what I have to share with you. I also have an intimate knowledge as a result of my personal od- yssey with breast cancer, of both conventional and non-conven-tional approaches. I probably would have just \u2014I knew nothing about breast cancer or cancer really, but that people died from it,and was frightened by it. But ended up really very much usingboth of them in depth. Up front, I want to say two things. I do not think any one ap- proach, any one approach within either of those systems also, isright for anyone or for everyone. I have suffered no irreparableharm from any non-conventional approach, despite having had ex-tensive exposure to many. I feel that every one of them has helpedme in some way, some more than others. I say that because I knowthat's a concern that a lot of people have and a reservation they have about supporting the use of non-conventional therapies ormaking them available to people. On the other hand, unfortunately, I have to say that \u2014well, let me preface it by saying that I think that conventional physicians,most of them are very well-meaning and competent in what theydo. I think they are often more fearful of cancer than the patients,and perhaps it 's because they are being expected to cure something that they know they really don 't understand. So that can be a very frightening thing, and maybe can lead them to be very rigid in theway they treat us as patients, feeling like we can 't have any devi- ations and we can 't waste any time because they are really so very frightened themselves. But basically in contrast to my experience with non-conventional approaches, I do feel that I have suffered considerable and irrep-arable harm because of my treatment with conventional methods.I think most of us have. Some of us are more willing to acknowl-edge it than others because there 's kind of a cognitive dissonance there that we want to believe that what we did was the best andthat everything is OK, and we want to minimize I think, the pricewe have paid in many instances. Of course some people have had less treatment than others. I guess part of my situation too is that I do not feel that if my pointof view had been respected, I don 't believe I would have ever ended up with the number of very invasive kinds of procedures that I didhave to undergo, from which I continue to suffer the effects. Oneof them is lymphedema, which no one has mentioned so far, canbe life threatening because if you have chronic swelling of the limb,there is a rare type of sarcoma which is a very lethal kind of cancerthat can develop. It is rare, but all of these things are statistics. So I guess every day there are people who conventional medicine has sent home to die that are finding their way back to life, evenafter they have had, been subjected to the often times brutal proce-dures of conventional medicine. I just wish I didn 't have to say these things. I really do. I wish that my experience had been dif- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 wish the experiences of many, many of my friends, some of whom I have lost and some of whom I have seen gothrough terrible suffering, who have sometimes made it throughand survived. I wish I didn 't have to say these things and have those perceptions. I wanted to say a lot of things which I am not going to have time to say. I guess maybe I can say that \u2014it's hard to, and I know ev- eryone is wanting to go and I am too, because I have had a peachto eat today, that 's it. I guess maybe let me say this. I think we have to find another way to approach cancer than conventional ap-proaches, because conventional approaches are based on killingcancer. That does not guarantee in any way that it is going to healus or keep us alive. There are no guarantees made of that. It iskind of like killing alligators instead of draining the swamp. Weare not dealing with causation, and we are not dealing with heal-ing. I had planned to give you some evidence to back up some ofthat, but we won 't have time for that. I'll just, in ending here, I will say that if anything that you hear today makes a difference to you or enough of a difference to you,then you will have to do something to make some changes. You willhave to make some choices. I believe that when we choose, we arenot choosing just for ourselves. We have to keep in mind that weare choosing really now for all because it is one world. We arestarting to realize that, and see that vision I think more and more,that we are choosing for the human race and for the survival ofEarth. In one sense, both David and Goliath are within us, within each individual. So we have to decide whom we are going to serve,whom we are going to choose to serve. I do pray that each of uswill choose well for the well-being of all of us. [The prepared statement of Ms. Gardener follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much. Any information that you want to submit for the record, we can enter that into the record,even though you haven 't had a chance. Maybe during questions and answers, we can cover some of that. Ms. Bedell-Logan.Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Thank you, Mr. Chair, for this opportunity. In 1987, my sister was diagnosed with a Ewing 's Sarcoma in the calf of her right leg. The protocol for Ewing 's is amputation, chemo- therapy, and radiation. This was a very aggressive cancer. Thank-fully, the physicians found it in time. I remember her fear of hav-ing her leg amputated at 25 years old. We were in her room when an oncologist came in and said that there was a new experimental treatment for Ewing 's Sarcoma where they would take a tube and slide it down through her vein,starting at the groin, and drop chemotherapy directly on hertumor. She was told that the likelihood of survival would not bechanged, and that it very well may save her leg. On the strengthof this, my sister opted for the new therapy. At the beginning of the fourth treatment that she had, the tech- nician couldn 't get the tube down through her groin any longer, and they took her down to sonogram and found a grapefruit-sizedtumor right where they had been going down with the tube. Be-cause of the obstruction of the tumor, my sister developed massivebilateral lymphedema in both legs, which is a swelling of the limbsdue to the inability for lymphatic fluid to move in and out of thelimb appropriately. This is a very debilitating and very painfulprocess, and because of that pain, the surgeons cut incisions intomy sister 's thighs and put permanent drains in them to continue to drain the lymphatic fluid. Both of these sites became extremelyinfected, and my sister was put on large doses of morphine andantibiotics and was dead in 4 months. After her death, we found out that she had been a guinea pig. They had never done this procedure in this hospital before, and thephysicians were not trained to perform the procedure appro-priately. We have also found out that the worst thing you can doto a lymphedema patient is cut into them. This was never sub-jected to randomized control trials, and it 's not used today as standard protocol. A month after my sister 's death, I started working for Medicare. My goal was to get into the trenches of the healthcare system tofind out what makes it tick. I received an excellent education fromthe Federal Government, and went to work after that for a verylarge family practice and urgent care center. I have seen the sys-tem work from the perspective of the patient, the payer, and theprovider. I opened my company, Solutions in Integrative Medicine, 10 years ago. My company provides billing and practice management,consulting, and education services for patients, providers, and in-surance companies. We have been at the forefront of a change, ac- tively advocating for patients whose insurance companies deniedpayment for effective, but unconventional services. One of thethings that I have heard here today was talk about the uninsured.For those people who are insured, there is a very big problem with VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May for anything outside of opening a flower with a hammer. We have been instrumental in developing the administrative and clinical basis for coverage of a host of integrative therapies, oftenat greatly reduced cost. But this effort has been very tedious, whichmakes it difficult to make a large enough impact for global change.One of the problems with research is that the researchers sit intheir ivory towers and do research, and come up with sometimesvery good outcomes for randomized control trials, but we can 't im- plement them at the insurance level. Sometimes it takes 10 yearsto get a randomized control trial accessible to patients. The U.S. Public Health Service estimates that 70 percent of the current healthcare budget is spent on the treatment of approxi-mately 33 million chronically ill individuals. As the populationages, such conditions will consume an even larger portion of thenational healthcare dollar. With this in mind, my company 's vision is to change the perspective of the healthcare industry by providingprofessional education to insurance carriers, Medicare, physicians,and patient consumers. An example of this education is lymphedema. Twenty percent of all women who have breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection,mastectomy, will have lymphedema. Those numbers are even high-er for men with prostate cancer. These survivors have now con-tracted lymphedema, the three consequences of lymphedema areswelling, recurrent infections, and tumor formations, calledlymphangeosarcoma, which is untreatable. The lymphedema pa-tients who do not receive early intervention may develop elephan-tiasis, which can lead to amputation of a limb. Prompt treatment by specially trained lymphedema therapists who manually drain the engorged tissue has been shown to savelimbs, save lives, and save healthcare dollars. The therapy is calledcombined decongestive therapy [CDT]. It has been a standardtreatment in Europe for decades. But today, it is considered an ex-perimental therapy in the United States, and is not a typically cov-ered service. In the United States, our standard approach is to useexpensive pumps that mechanically compress and decompress theaffected limb, even though this therapy has been shown to have lit-tle benefit. In fact, it can press lymphatic fluid in the wrong direc-tion and lead to a worsening of symptoms. For this reason, me-chanical pumps for lymphedema have actually been banned in Eu-ropean countries. In the past 2 years, we have been able to begin educating the in- surance industry about CDT. We have been able to obtain coveragefor Medicare patients in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massa-chusetts, and Florida, as well as many commercial insurance bene-ficiaries all over the country. This type of education and commonsense is extremely important when it comes to medicine. Unfortu-nately, the rest of the public receives conventional treatment, cost-ing insurance companies millions of dollars each year. The treatment of lymphedema is just an example of the edu- cation and common sense needed in the insurance industry. The il-lusion is that the best medical practices are based on the result ofrandomized control trials. It was recently estimated that only 15percent of medicine today has been subjected to randomized control VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 is a sad fact that since there is little to be gained by drugs or medical equipment companies from the lymphedema treatmentregimen I described earlier, little attention or marketing is focusedon such common sense therapies. This is why healthcare cannotsimply be left to the private sector. Too often the perverse incen-tives of our system lead to short-term thinking and pharmaceuticalband-aids, rather than comprehensive chronic disease manage-ment. The result, strangely, is poor quality healthcare at a highercost. Those who can break out of the system can afford to pay outof pocket. Integrative medicine is becoming rich people 's medicine. We must put prevention of chronic illness in the hands of pa- tients, treatment of chronic disease in the hands of integrativemedicine teams, and acute and traumatic episodes in the hands ofconventional medical providers. I will say in closing that my brother died of AIDS in 1994. He was diagnosed in 1980. He was on the television show, 48 Hours,as one of the longest living AIDS patients in the country. Theyasked him how he did it. He said, ''I stayed away from conventional medicine. I used my conventional medicine doctors to help me de-cide what were the best alternative treatments for me, and didnothing but alternative therapies, '' and he lived 14 years with a very high quality of life, and died of Karposi Sarcoma. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Well, thank you very much. That last, not the last thing that you said, but the second-to-last thing that you talkedabout was very interesting. You are saying that in Europe, theyhave been using for lymphedema a different approach and it 's been done for a good many years, and they have actually outlawed ordone away with the pumps that are still being used as conventionalmedicine here in the United States? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . How do you account for that? You mentioned the pharmaceutical companies and some of the companies that producethese things. Do you think it is because of influences of these insti-tutions? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . I do. In 1997, which I have the report with me, Medicare spent on the East Coast alone, $13 million onpnuematic pumps. Most of those pumps are contraindicated. Thisis because when lymphatic fluid is simply pushed from the arm orthe leg back into the body, it can create genital lymphedema inmen and it can create lymphedema built up in the chest of women,which can create lymphangeosarcoma. What these specially trained therapists do, who are trained by the Vodder method, which was really born in Germany, is theymanually through a massage technique open up the passages forthe lymphatic fluid to move out of the arm appropriately, and thenthey bandage the patient with a compression bandage to stop thearm or leg from filling back up. Through this process, they are actually teaching the patients to take care of themselves at home. We don 't want to have patients keep coming back and coming back for treatment because that isnot cost-effective. But what we do want to do is make sure thatthese patients are completely self-sufficient in taking care of theirown lymphedema. There is no cure for lymphedema, but we cancertainly \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Minimize it. Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Minimize it, exactly. Mr. B URTON . So through massage and through the bandaging? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Exactly. It is a very inexpensive treatment. They usually last anywhere between 2 to 4 weeks, depending onthe severity of the case. Mr. B URTON . Well, now some women are told by their doctors to wrap their arms or put a casing on their arm every day. Are youtalking about that as well? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . That can be helpful with minimal lymphedema. But when lymphedema becomes fibrotic and the limbgets very hard, the compression bandaging doesn 't work unless those fibrosis are broken down through massage therapy. Mr. B URTON . Through massage therapy. Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Right. Mr. B URTON . OK. Thank you. Ms. Zarycki, you were very critical of a lot of the conventional thinking. I presume you have done a lot of study on this. How didyou come to all these conclusions that you came to? It 's very inter- esting to me. Ms. Z ARYCKI . I initially used conventional treatment. When I first started out, I wanted to take a chance and explore alternative VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May was told by a myriad of conventional doctors that I went to that basically it was OK if I did alternative and it was OK ifI did some herbs and this and that, but if I really wanted to makean impact and to live, I should really go with conventional treat-ment and I should not wait, and if I wanted to do alternative, Icould always do that later. That was the comment that I got. So instead of feeling like I had time to do more research, I felt like I really had to jump in and do the standard treatment. So ina sense, it would have been nice if both of those practices couldhave worked together as they do in other countries, as they doaround the world, but not always in this country. Mr. B URTON . From a personal standpoint, how do you account for those in Europe having more advanced treatments or optionaltreatments and the United States doesn 't? Ms. Z ARYCKI . I think they are more open to research than we are, and I think that they are putting funding in other areas andconcentrating it in other areas, rather on prevention more so thanwe are. We are using machines for detection when we should beusing ourselves and our own inner energies to understand andwork with our immune systems. Mr. B URTON . You don 't think that the companies that manufac- ture pharmaceuticals and products are exerting any influence herein the United States, or you haven 't had that experience? Ms. Z ARYCKI . Well, I feel that is a large part of it, yes, in terms of the conventional side, sure. It is all tied together. But when theystart getting the funding and when the smaller alternative organi-zations don 't have a chance and they don 't have the money to run any trials, clinical trials, randomized trials, that is what is hap-pening in this country. So that is why we need more funding to gofor those sorts of efforts. Mr. B URTON . For alternative therapies? Ms. Z ARYCKI . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Gardener, you mentioned that you suffered a great deal because you weren 't exposed to or aware of alternative therapies and you continue to suffer because of those. Do you wantto elaborate? Can you pull the mic closer? I can 't hear you. Ms. G ARDENER . No, that 's not what I said. Mr. B URTON . OK. I must have misunderstood. Ms. G ARDENER . Yes. I said it was not because I wasn 't aware of them. I became aware of them. But it was because I was not \u2014con- ventional medicine, first of all, did not respect my right to makechoices about myself, about my own situation. It started out, for ex-ample, I wanted to have a needle biopsy of the lump, and theywanted to take it out right away. Mr. B URTON . In the form of a mastectomy? Ms. G ARDENER . No. No, not before they did a biopsy, no. Not be- fore they did a biopsy. Mr. B URTON . They didn 't want to do a needle biopsy? Ms. G ARDENER . They didn 't want to do a needle biopsy. They wanted to just remove the lump. I wanted to just have a piece ofit taken out, to see if it might be cancerous. At that point, we hadno idea. I was in very excellent health. I had never felt better, in VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May I have heard other people say that too, just before they are diagnosed. Mr. B URTON . OK. Thank you very much. Mrs. Mink.Mrs. M INK. Thank you very much. I certainly compliment all three of you for your very interesting and informative, provocativetestimony. I know the time doesn 't permit me to go into details of what you have to offer this committee and the Congress. I do haveone or two points that I think need clarification. Carol Zarycki, on your page 4 of your testimony, you said that you were personally not planning to have mammogram followups,and went on to discus the reasons for that conclusion. You heardearlier that there is still overwhelming dependence on mammo-grams, and that it is one of the major educational thrusts that themedical field is promoting and all the people that are into breastcancer are promoting. I would like to hear some amplification onthe reasons you have come to, your own personal conclusion. Ms. Z ARYCKI . Well, I think mainly, using it as a personal experi- ence, I suffered immense pain and suffering and that had contin-ued on after a mammogram. That had nothing to do with just hav-ing a mammogram for having your breast analyzed. So the intensepain and the trauma and that sort of thing which can lead to achronic condition, is something that women aren 't really made aware of. The other thing is that I think as we know, not all mammograms detect all cancers. So in other words, it can be a hit or miss situa-tion. So why should I not subject myself to more immune-enhanc-ing procedures, such as daily breast massage, which is much moreimmune enhancing when used with a castor oil and almond oilbase and protects the person, and we can start our daughters andour children and our nieces on these. It will protect them. It willprotect their endocrine, their reproductive systems. If anything isgoing to protect us, we need to strengthen our bodies. So why tearourselves apart with machines and biopsies and synthetic drugswhen we should be building up our systems. Ms. G ARDENER . Could I speak to that also? Mrs. M INK. Yes, please. Ms. G ARDENER . Also we know that mammography is extremely ineffective for young women. Even for myself, I was not that young,but my lump which was very easy to feel, did not show up on amammogram. Also, there is I know of one researcher at the Univer-sity of North Carolina, who submitted a proposal, and this is anestablished researcher, well published, et cetera, who submitted aproposal to the Department of Defense to have funding to studysub-populations of women who were particularly susceptible to theradiation from mammograms. There is considerable evidence whichwas the support for this proposal, that there are these sub-popu-lations in which breast cancer is increased when they are subjectedto mammograms. There are alternatives such as thermography, which are com- pletely non-invasive and completely harmless. Mrs. M INK. So what is your comment then on the lowering of the age to 40 years for suggested annual mammograms? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 don 't plan to have any mammograms the rest of my life. I tell my daughter not to have them. I think they aredangerous and potentially very damaging. I think there are alter-natives equally or more effective. Mrs. M INK. I thank you for those personal comments. I want to add to the record that I was astonished to find that nurses in oneparticular hospital that I am familiar with, all indicated to me thatthey were not going to take any of the mammograms, for preciselythe reasons that you have indicated. So it strikes me that we reallyneed to open up the dialog on this issue and not put such tremen-dous reliance on this one technique as the way to make sure thatwe have early diagnosis and early detection of breast cancer. Mrs. Mack certainly reemphasized your point, that notwith- standing the fact that she had had the mammogram and other clin-ical examinations, it was her own self examination that detectedher cancer. So I think there is a great deal in your testimony thatneeds to set our thinking machines back on again in this very, verycritical and vital area. Ms. Bedell-Logan, one point that disturbs me which some of my constituents point out to me frequently, is that when they partici-pate in trials or other types of research endeavors, that they arenot covered by their insurance, not covered by Medicare, not cov-ered by any health plan, and that they have to assume the costsof these trials individually and personally. Is that your personalunderstanding to what happens in these medical trials? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Absolutely. What we have been doing with insurance companies to try to bring randomized control trials thatare very positive to a point of coverage and accessibility for pa-tients much sooner than they are right now, is by creating relation-ships with insurance companies at the integrative medicine centerlevel, where we treat that particular treatment as a petri dish atthat one place. So the insurance company covers that particularservice for a period of time, and we measure the outcome of a num-ber of patients using that particular service. The patients get reim-bursed for what they do, what they get out of those services, andwe look to see what the long-term outcomes are. But this is, as I said, one center at a time. It is tedious and very slow. But in the big picture, it can take up to 10 years to get a ran-domized control trial accessible to patients. That is extremely frus-trating. It 's frustrating for researchers. A lot of the healthcare dol- lars that are going toward research, by the time they actually getaccessible to patients, there is something better that can be used.So it 's really, to a degree, a waste. Mrs. M INK. Mr. Chairman, that is really a very, very important point that we need to pursue why it is that our health policies es-tablished by Congress do not recognize the important contributionsthat these health trials, research trials are making to the abilityof cures and other kinds of processes being developed. Unless theyare covered by the medical insurance plans and health insurance plans, even our own Federal insurance plans, or Medicare, Med-icaid, it is a real gap in our policy understanding. Mr. B URTON . Why don 't I work with you, and maybe we can draft some amendments to some of the healthcare legislation? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 INK. I would be very happy to. I believe there is a bill pending somewhere, but it needs to really be focused. Mr. B URTON . I will have Beth check on that. But let me just say before I yield to my colleague, Mrs. Morella, my wife had a tumorin her breast for the estimated 7 to 8 years that was not pickedup by mammograms. She picked it up by accident through physicalexamination. When she told me about it, I said to her, you reallyought to have the doctor check it. She thought it was a fibroustumor. She went to the doctor and almost walked out of the officewithout having it checked because she didn 't think it was anything, and of course it was. Not only had she had it, but it had spreadto her lymph nodes. So they miss about 15 percent of them. Thatis why you cannot look at a mammogram as a panacea, as theseladies have mentioned. Incidently, our next panel is going to talk about some alternative machines, I believe, that are being used in Europe through heatthat will tell whether or not there 's a cancer present. We ought to take a look at those too. So I hope you will stick around for thenext panel. Mrs. Morella.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the three of you for putting a personal face on it and giving us yourexperiences. As I try to pull this together, it seems to me we aresaying first of all, self examination is probably the best way of di-agnosing or noting that there is a problem with breast cancer. Ialso, and I 'm going to let you all comment on these observations, second, that there is not enough research that is being done on al-ternative therapies. Third, is there a problem that researchers whoare doing research on medicine, maybe the conventional medicine,don't want to share? I mean do we have a problem of territoriality and possessiveness? I mean should there be some sharing? Andthen how do people find out about alternative therapies? Shouldthey just experiment, read a book? Finally, do you see a role for diet, exercise, as we heard on the previous panel? What kind of a role does that play? I guess thatgets you started, and then if I have more time, I will fire away withsome more questions. I guess you could do it in any order that youwant. Ms. Z ARYCKI . I will start out. I will just say that I think, as you mentioned, I think sharing is very important. I have come up withthe same question between the two communities, because I in someinstances had to be a go-between. I would ask my conventional doc-tor and tell him something that I was doing alternatively, that analternative doctor would tell me, and they had worked at the sameorganization. I said well, why don 't you two talk. He said, ''No, no. Why don 't you arrange a meeting for us. I don 't have time to talk to him. '' So I would get comments like that. So my question was, do they really each just want to stay in their own little area of expertise, or do they really not know abouteach other 's expertise? That was my question throughout the whole process. I think it may be half and half. I am not sure. So I thinkthat's real important in terms of sharing. I mean it would be won- derful to share all the information together and come up with somebetter protocol. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 It could also be difficult for a person to make a determination about what alternative therapy to use too. Ms. Z ARYCKI . Well, when you are first diagnosed, you are kind of hit with everything. My whole learning in this has been if youwant to find something, you will. So you have to trust yourself andin a sense, just in the beginning it 's very hard, which obviously a lot of us kind of go to whatever seems to be the appropriate thing,which it is at the time. But eventually, you learn about a lot of dif-ferent things, and then you learn specifically what works. Then youlearn that there is a lot out there in terms of the alternative field,but it 's not necessarily for breast or women 's reproductive cancers. So while I see a lot of my friends doing a lot of different things,a lot of those things may not be as specific as we can be. So I feelmy personal responsibility, and I do that with colleagues andfriends, and I do that on a personal basis now, is to inform themas to what they really need to do, not to add negative informationinto their system, be it in the way of a supplement that they maynot need or a lot of different things that are just thrown out thereon the market as a marketing tool. Mrs. M ORELLA . And diet? Do you want to comment? Ms. Z ARYCKI . Diet is very important. I initially started out look- ing at a few different programs that basically eliminated fat, elimi-nated meats, eliminated dairy, a lot of that. Then I integrated that.I spoke to a few different noted practitioners and noted people whohad successfully gotten rid of cancers. They all have very positiveprograms. What I found worked best for me is not to take just onespecific program and say I am only going to stick with this pro-gram and I am never going to eat this or that, but to really com-bine them and to use them all and come up with my own program.That is what I teach others today. Mrs. M ORELLA . I would like to give Dr. Gardener and Ms. Bedell- Logan an opportunity to quickly comment on it too. Ms. G ARDENER . You ask some great questions, and a lot of them very quickly. Self exam is best. OK, I have to really question that.First of all, early detection is too late. We need to get it way beforethat. Thermography actually, if we could start to use that, thatwould actually detect things much before you could even find yourown tumor, find your own lump. In the 1960 's, they were doing trials \u2014and thermography came out of the space satellite age, Sputnik and all that. They wereusing it to be able to sense. Anyway, sorry. I got off into a tangent.But basically, they were finding a lot of false positives. So they saidwell, this isn 't working, we need to find something else. We are get- ting too many. False positives are when you say the person has aproblem and they don 't. OK? What they did in a followup study of those that they had as- sessed was that they found that really those people did develop asignificantly higher rate. They did develop breast cancer. So thiswas in effect a very early detector of cancer. Those are studies thatwere being done in conjunction with radiologists. Also, the problem that you said about researchers, not enough re- search. I have to say we need not more research, necessarily, butbetter research. We need to look at interactions. Right now wehave rigorous trials, but they are very simplistic. The answer is not VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May know about breast cancer, and we need to look at psy- chosocial factors, diet, environment, exposures, all of that sort ofthing. So we need international sophisticated studies. The third thing, researchers don 't want to share. Many people are not aware that a publicly funded, Government-funded study,that data that is collected is not available to any other researchersunless those researchers choose to share it with them. There areprecedents now, an increasing number of research centers who areputting their data on the web. It is called public use data bases.That is something that can help us to break down the real barriersto progress that exist now because of political turf issues and want-ing results to come out the way you want them to come out, basi-cally. It is research but it 's not science. Then the role of diet and exercise \u2014lifestyle is critical. Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Let me take 30 seconds, if that 's OK. Mr. B URTON . Sure, go ahead. Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . Self-care and diet, in my opinion, only works for those people who really believe they are going to get cancer.Most people don 't. So it takes a wake-up call to stop eating sugar and fat and all of that. Second, the research needs to be more pointed and integrated with complementary and alternative medicines, so that we get allsides of the research instead of just one. I believe we have diseasein this country called academic constipation. I think we need a leg-islative colonic to change that. [Laughter.] Third, I think we need to heal the business of healing and really get information out to the public as to what is going on in thiscountry. Mr. B URTON . Legislative colonic? Well, you know, you hear every- thing up here after a while. Mr. Cummings.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I, as I was sitting here, I was trying to listen very carefully to the last two re-sponses. I guess when I sit here and I think about this being themost powerful country in the world, and we 're able to do all kinds of things, and here you are here before this Congress of the UnitedStates and we can 't solve all problems, but certainly we are here to solve problems and lift up the people of this great country. I was just wondering, and sort of piggy back on what you just answered, but a little bit more specific. Sometimes I do believe thatthere is a disconnect between the public and the Congress. Some-times I think we don 't get it. I speak for all of us. At some point and on different issues, we don 't get it. You all have been kind enough to come here and open your lives to us. Believe it or not,open your lives to America, because C -SPAN is covering this. So this is your moment. What do you want us to do? What would you like to see us do as the folks who represent you, the 435 of us on this side and the100 in the Senate? I mean what do you want to see us do? And do you think we get it? Ms. Bedell-Logan. Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . First, I would like to see the Access to Med- ical Treatment Act looked at a little more closely. I think it is anextremely important bill. I think it needs some attention. Raising VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May Alternative Medicine to NCCAM was an extremely smart move on the part of the legislation. I think that you are right. There is definitely a disconnect be- tween the people and Congress. So many people just don 't know what happens here, but they do know what happens at home.What was very interesting in my personal experience is that mysister, who had a very treatable cancer, was dead in 6 months, andmy brother who had a terminal illness, was dead in 14 years. Weneed to get that kind of information out to patients. One of the worst things and one of the best things that has hap- pened recently is the Internet. Unfortunately, it can be a veryscary thing to surf the Internet about cancer treatments when apatient has no idea what of it is bunk and what of it is actuallyreal. So I think that to a degree, people are getting scared to death,literally. In order to really change that, we have to start to takeconventional medicine and move it into an area that allows patientaccess to the types of things that will soothe the soul as well asthe physical body. We don 't have those things available to us right now. In every single oncology center, there should be anacupuncturist who controls nausea, instead of giving people contra-indicated medications. There should be a massage therapist inevery emergency room, to be dealing with migraine headaches. Allof these things, we tend to open flowers with a hammer, as I saidearlier. Adverse drug reactions are a huge part of that. What I believe that is going to start with is things like the Ac- cess to Medical Treatment Act, which I hope is very much sup-ported in this room. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield, real briefly? Mr. C UMMINGS . Certainly. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say that I met with Congressman DeFazio this morning \u2014yesterday. We are working to get the Ac- cess to Medical Treatment Act in proper form. We will be con-tacting all of you. If you are so inclined, we would love to have youas cosponsors. He will be the primary sponsor. He is the one whocame up with the idea. It is a Democrat sponsor. I will be a cospon-sor, and we will see if we can 't get enough Members to move that thing through. Mr. C UMMINGS . I am so inclined, Mr. Chairman. I think that, just to say to you, I think that 's wonderful that we can move in a bipartisan manner. That is what I want you all to understand, that you put a face on what we do here. I mean sometimes things happen, somethinghappens over here, something happens in Iowa, something happensin Baltimore, something happens in Nevada, and all these thingsare happening and here we have an opportunity. You represent somany people who are in pain. That is why your testimony here isso very, very important. We just want you to understand that wehear you and we want to connect. We want to get it. So I want tothank you. May I just ask one more question? I would like to have Ms. Zarycki, could you answer that same question? I think the doctorhad pretty much answered the last time. Ms. Z ARYCKI . Sure. Mr. C UMMINGS . What would you like to see us do as a Congress? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 I think most importantly, since in this country, women faced with cancers initially go to conventional doctors andfor conventional treatment, I would just like them to be aware ofall the options and to let people, and let us know as patients whatoptions are out there in terms of other things that they may notbe promoting, but at least make us aware of them. I think that isall we 're asking, so that we can each make our own choices, be- cause it really is an individual process for each of us. Mr. C UMMINGS . So I take it if you don 't\u2014somebody, I mean you hear this all the time, Mr. Chairman, the statement that the bestpatient is the well-informed patient, the one who goes out thereand learns as much about his or her illness and whatever, so thatthey can ask the right questions and I guess do the right things.I guess that 's another thing that the American people have to do. Would you all agree with that? Ms. B EDELL -LOGAN . I don 't really, because I have heard many physicians say to me that the informed patients are the ones whocause the most trouble, so to speak. What happens in many casesis that patients come in after reading off the Internet about acu-puncture and herbs and all of this, and their doctors say, ''We don 't know anything about that. That 's not efficacious. '' My sister had a bottle of garlic on her nightstand, and the oncologist walked in theroom and threw it in the trash and said, ''We don 't want to give you false hopes. Garlic isn 't going to help you. '' What we need is a healing between the complementary, alter- native medicine community and the conventional medicine commu-nity so that each one of those sectors of medicine come togetherand know what the other person is doing. There is nothing morefrustrating than a physician getting caught with his shorts downby not knowing what acupuncture does. The physicians get veryfrustrated, and they say it doesn 't work because they don 't under- stand it. We need to change our medical education, which is a hugepart of this process as well. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Cummings. The National Cancer Institute gets $2.7 billion, and less than about 1 percent of that is used on alternative therapy research. Ithink what we need to do is get them to realize that there is astrong sentiment in the hinterlands that we take a hard look atthese alternative therapies, and maybe more money should betaken from that budget for alternative therapy research as well asconventional research. So thank you, ladies, very, very much. We really appreciate your testimony. We will now go to our last panel. I think this will be a very en- lightening panel as well. We have Dr. Edward Trimble with theNational Cancer Institute; Daniel Beilin, from Aptos, CA. I havenever heard of that one before, Doctor; Susan Silver, from GeorgeWashington University Integrative Medicine Center; and James Gordon, M.D., Center for the Mind Body Medicine out of Wash-ington, DC. Thank you all for being so patient. Dr. Gordon has to leave very shortly, so Dr. Gordon, we 'll start with you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May GORDON, M.D., CENTER FOR MIND BODY MEDICINE, WASHINGTON, DC; SUSAN SILVER, GEORGEWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY TRIMBLE,M.D., HEAD, SURGERY SECTION, DIVISION OF CANCERTREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS, NATIONAL CANCER INSTI-TUTE; AND JEFFREY WHITE, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF COM-PLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, NATIONALCANCER INSTITUTE Dr. G ORDON . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am really glad to be here. I appreciate the Members who are here. It hasbeen wonderful listening to the presentations and listening to thedialog and seeing the composition of these panels, because what wehave here is the kind of integration that we are talking about andthat you are talking about. We have on this panel, we have conven-tional physicians, people who work with complementary and alter-native therapies, we have patients, and patient advocates, and peo-ple who are using healing systems of other cultures. I think it isexactly this kind of integration that we need in our healthcare sys-tem. I am a physician. I work here in Washington, DC. I have a pri- vate practice. I also for the last 9 years, I have founded and haveled a non-profit called the Center for Mind Body Medicine. I was for 10 years before that, a research psychiatrist at the National In-stitute of Mental Health. I was the first chair of the AdvisoryCouncil to NIH 's Office of Alternative Medicine. I have been interested in therapies other than conventional therapies for 35 years. In fact, I was reminiscing with MichioKushi that I met him some 35 years ago when I was a medical stu-dent at Harvard and his teacher, George Osawa, had come over tothis country and was bringing macrobiotics here. So this is a move-ment with some history, and I have some history with this move-ment. I want to focus today on what I hope is one specific answer to some of the questions that are being raised, which is the com-prehensive cancer care conference integrating complementary andalternative therapies that you mentioned when you introduced meat the beginning, which is a conference that was created by theCenter for Mind Body Medicine, but is now cosponsored by the Na-tional Cancer Institute and by the National Center for Complemen-tary and Alternative Medicine, as well as the University of Texas. This conference is particularly relevant here. Incidently, I would like to invite anybody who would like to come to please come tothis conference. We are in pre-conference workshops now. The con-ference begins tomorrow morning at 9 at the Hyatt Regency inCrystal City. We welcome everybody, whether or not they can af-ford the full fee. We have generous scholarships and no one is everturned away from any of our activities for lack of money. So I wantto invite you to participate in this. This conference was in a very real sense created to answer some of the questions that have been raised here, and questions thathave been raised particularly by women. The questions are, arethere any things other than conventional cancer care that I can usefor my treatment, complementary or alternative? How do I know VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 work? How do I know if they are safe? How do I integrate them with complementary and alternative care? Who doI find who knows something about these things? How can I informmy oncologist about them? And how can I get them paid for? So we created this conference last year and brought together about 120 presenters from all over the world. This year we haveabout 130 presenters. What we are doing is trying to answer thesequestions in a thoughtful way. We are having people like MichioKushi. In fact, the study that you heard about on macrobiotic treat-ment of cancer, an early phase of that study was presented lastyear. We are having the people who are doing the most interestingwork in complementary and alternative therapies present theirwork to the pillars of the American cancer establishment who areopen-minded, who are interested in critiquing the work, interestedin creating a dialog, and interested in developing the most effectivekind of cancer care. I particularly want to acknowledge the National Cancer Institute as well as the National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine, and Dr. Klausner, who at one of your hearings actuallycame up to me and said, ''We love the conference you are doing. Is there anything we can do? '' I said yes, you can cosponsor it and help support it. He said great. Dr. Wittis, his deputy director, whoparticipated with us last year, and Dr. Jeffrey White, who is here,who has developed a whole series of panels for this year 's con- ference. We hope we will continue to collaborate with them on thisconference in the years ahead. What we have done is both to have the material presented and critiqued at the conference. If you look through the program, youwill see the whole variety of plenary sessions and panels that arepresented. Then we have also put this information, the presen-tations together with the critiques, up on our website, which iswww.cmbm.org, www.cmbm.org. So the information is there. I think the kind of information that the last panelists were look- ing for, and that I think everybody with cancer is looking for, islet me see the best that is being done around the world, not onlyin the United States, but in Germany and China and Japan andSouth America. Let me see it presented, and let me see some peo-ple who really know their stuff scientifically, but who are open-minded, take a look at this literature and tell me what they think,and then let me make up my own mind. I say this conference began with questions about these therapies for cancer, and that those questions were mostly asked by women.I am talking of course about cancers that women have, but I amalso talking about cancers in other members of the family. The Of-fice of Alternative Medicine, 60 to 70 percent of the calls the officereceives were about questions about cancer. Most of those callswere from women. In my practice, at our center, it 's women not only asking about themselves, but asking about their husbands andparents and children. So women are the ones who are doing muchof the investigation. It is their questions we are trying to answer. Let me just share with you three broad areas where I think it is very important to make advances and to make changes, and thenI will be happy to answer some questions before I have to leave togo back and give a talk there. The first has to do with this issue VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May knowledge. We have knowledge available on our website. The National Cancer Institute is beginning to provide some of thatknowledge as well. We need to make knowledge, the best possibleinformation about these complementary and alternative therapiesavailable, just as we need to make the best possible informationabout conventional therapies available. Second or as part of that issue of sharing knowledge, I spoke with Dr. Klausner about a year ago and I want to continue speak-ing with him about training oncologists, physicians, nurses, oncol-ogy nurses to provide this kind of counseling, to provide enoughtime, enough emotional support, enough thoughtful guidance, andenough information about complementary and alternative therapiesso that each person who comes who has cancer can have that kindof guidance. This is crucial. I think it is a missing element. Peopleoften feel pressured into doing one or another kind of therapy. Ithink there needs to be a time for reflection. We are very eager atthe Center for Mind Body Medicine to create a training programfor these counselors. We do it at our center. We believe it needs tobe done at a national level so that every patient with cancer shouldhave this kind of informed, sensitive counselor available for a sig-nificant period of time. When I work with people with cancer, Ispend about an hour and a half to 2 hours with them, discussingtheir options, discussing their feelings about both conventional andalternative treatment. So that 's No. 1, knowledge and how to share it. No. 2 is the creation of healing partnerships. Again, this is a theme that I have heard this morning. This requires that we spendmore time with patients, and especially that oncologists spendmore time with patients. I know a number of oncologists in town.There are oncologists whom every one of my patients loves andloves to go see, and there are oncologists whom they dread seeing.The characteristics of the ones whom they love to see are thatthese are generally extremely kind people, they are people whotake time, they are people who listen to questions, and they arepeople who if they tend to have preconceptions or areas of igno-rance, they say ''I don 't know. I would really like to find out more. '' Or ''I may be a little prejudiced. Maybe you could help me see this more clearly, or who should I talk to. '' So I think this is crucial, that from the side of the practitioners, and of course not just oncologists, all of us who are physicians, Ithink that we need to share information. This needs to be encour-aged, that all physicians should be sharing the best possible infor-mation about all the treatments they do, whether it is for canceror any other condition, whether it 's conventional, complementary, or alternative. I also think that it is important that we encourage, and in this instance, women particularly. Women have been the leaders in themovement for self care and in the movement for creating healingpartnerships with their physicians. They are the ones who firstsaid, ''What 's going on down there, you tell me. I 'm not ignorant. I want to know what 's happening. I want to take part in my care. '' I think we need to encourage this, not only at the clinical level, butat the national level. I think it is very important, not only that peo-ple who are expert in complementary and alternative therapies, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May women like the panelists who are on the last panel, be part of the advisory committees to the different institutes and cen-ters at NIH. Finally, or not finally, next to last, coming to the issue of re- search. Research is crucial, but there need to be new and moreimaginative models of research. Coming out of last year 's cancer conference, Nicholas Gonzales presented a very interesting, verypromising therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, a com-prehensive therapy. NCI responded and agreed to fund, and isfunding a clinical trial of this therapy, a very comprehensive alter-native therapy which is being funded by NCI, and studied by Co-lumbia University. This is the kind of partnership we need. Weneed to expand from studying single modalities to looking at com-prehensive approaches, and we also need to understand that eachperson who has cancer is an individual, and that an approach thatmay work for one may not work for others. We need to design re-search to accommodate that individuality. We also need to understand that there is a great deal, and this was brought out in the first panel, that all of us, and anyone whohas cancer can do on her or his own behalf, and we need to studythose therapies and put much more of an emphasis and much moreof a financial emphasis on some of those mind body therapies,changes in attitude, meditation, relaxation, group support, nutri-tion, exercise, and to really see what is possible for people to do ontheir own behalf. Finally, I would like to echo the suggestion, and I know your strong feeling, that it is time to pass the Access to Medical Treat-ment Act. It is time to open up the arena of treatment to all thera-pies that are offered by responsible people, and to understand thatpeople can assume in partnership with a variety of healers, respon-sibility for their own care. Thank you very much. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. We will push very hard to get that passed. We 'll try to get as many cosponsors as possible. We are going to have a vote. I would like to have one more of our witnesses speak. Ms. Silver, would you like to go ahead andspeak? Then we will run and vote, and we will come right back andtry to not have any more unnecessary demands on your time. Dr. G ORDON . I am going to have to go, though, when you break for the vote. I am sorry I do, but I have to speak at 3 in Virginia. Mr. B URTON . That 's OK, Dr. Gordon. I am going to try to see you tomorrow anyhow, so we 'll talk further. Dr. G ORDON . Terrific. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Silver. Ms. S ILVER . Thank you for the opportunity to address the com- mittee today. All of us who work in the field of complementary andalternative medicine are grateful for the visibility and the valida-tion that you bring to the field by holding this hearing. The Centerfor Integrative Medicine is a division of the Medical Faculty Associ-ates of the George Washington University Medical Center. Our pro-gram includes research, education, and clinical services. Patientcare began in April 1998, and from the outset, we included a pro-gram for patients with cancer. That program is called the Qualityof Life program, and it serves as an adjunct to conventional cancertreatment. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 the committee 's interest in research and the current level of knowledge about complementary and alternative medicineand its effectiveness in people with cancer. We have submitted tworesearch proposals to NIH to investigate the use of reiki and guid-ed imagery by patients with breast cancer and those undergoingradiation. As we all know, research is in its early stages. Thanksto the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH,the pace at which we receive documentation of complementary andalternative medicine 's effectiveness will increase as researchers are supported in investigating these vital questions. At the Center for Integrative Medicine, we are as anxious as any- one for those results. In the meantime though, we ask whether wecan proceed with unproven, and note that I said unproven ratherthan disproven, modalities to assist cancer patients. Our answer isa resounding yes. We have asked ourselves this fundamental ques-tion: How can we enhance the quality of life of the person as pa-tient? Traditionally, on assuming the role of patient, a person has will- ingly surrendered quality of life, her sense of orientation and per-sonal control in exchange for a cure. But we are beginning to sus-pect that surrender may be self defeating. We would suggest thatsuccessful medical outcomes are diminished when the patient lackscontrol, information, and support. Conversely, if these inputs aremaximized, the patient may recover more quickly and completely,and have a higher quality of life, whatever the ultimate outcome. Most cancer patients say that from the moment of their diag- nosis, everything in life is changed. A life that was going on rou-tinely is suddenly out of control. The entire focus on the what if 's of cancer treatment and its outcome. The Quality of Life program of the Center for Integrative Medi- cine can assist the patient throughout the course of her illness. Atwhatever stage of the illness the relationship with the center is ini-tiated, we help determine and meet the patient 's needs and goals in a comprehensive way. For patients newly diagnosed and await-ing treatment, we offer stress reduction with a focus on personalcontrol and empowerment, immune system enhancement to helpcombat the disease, relief from symptoms caused by anxiety or de-pression as appetite loss, nausea, or sleeplessness. For patients undergoing aggressive curative treatment, we offer relief from side effects of treatments, such as nausea or post-opera-tive pain, immune system enhancement to help maximize the effec-tiveness of the treatment, relaxation and stress reduction to helprestore the mind and body between enervating treatments. For patients in remission, we offer stress reduction during peri- ods of watchful waiting, rebuilding of stamina and flexibility fol-lowing medical and surgical treatments, and resumption of health-ful diet and nutrition, with added emphasis on cancer prevention. For patients who experience a relapse, all of the services and ob- jectives of the pre-treatment and treatment phase program can beresumed with even greater intensity. For patients with illnessesnot responsive to curative treatment, we offer control of pain andsymptoms of a progressive illness, mobilization of the powers of themind to maximize quality of life, and reduction of stress to allowfor end-of-life planning and resolution. Overall, the Center for Inte- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 restore a sense of control and well-being, and offer the patient the freedoms to heal physically, emotionally,and spiritually. Let me offer just two examples of cases in which we are treating women with cancer. The first is a patient with recurrentendometrial cancer. Immediately following surgery, she was re-ferred to our medical center for radiation. Thanks to an active part-nership with the Division of Radiation Oncology, the Center for In-tegrative Medicine was called into the case as the patient came forher initial consultation. Along with vital information about her ra-diation treatment, the patient was given information about the cen-ter and the role of complementary medicine in easing her waythrough the course of illness. She was given a meditation tape fo-cused on breathing and relaxation exercises that incorporate thedetails of the radiation experience. In the following weeks, the patient participated in meditation and reiki and used both skills to reduce stress during treatmentand to assist her in sleeping through the night. As the radiationprogressed, side effects became extremely bothersome. Stomachand intestinal upset were frequent. But a combination of acupunc-ture and nutritional guidance got them under control. As the radiation neared completion, the patient began focusing on the future. She requested further nutrition counseling, both tohelp restore her energy following treatment, and on a larger scale,sought advice on a diet that would do most to prevent a recurrenceof her cancer. After 28 successive days of radiation therapy, the pa-tient suddenly felt apprehensive about what to do without it. Shehad grown attached to her radiation team and to the routine ofdaily radiation appointments. But she found comfort and supportin the relationships that she had formed with the providers in theCenter for Integrative Medicine. She continues to practice the mo-dalities that she learned and is looking forward to adding yoga toher routine to help build stamina and regain flexibility. She in-tends to check in with her complementary medicine team indefi-nitely for encouragement and renewal. The second patient is a young woman with advanced breast can- cer. At the time of diagnosis, she was offered several treatment op-tions, and chose the most aggressive. She is currently undergoinghigh dose chemotherapy. Before her first treatment, the patientlearned reiki and guided imagery. As she faced her initial dose ofchemotherapy, she used both modalities actively to reduce her fearand the anticipatory side effects that she experienced. Today, asshe continues in treatment, the center 's reiki provider meets her at the oncology clinic and practices reiki with her as the medicationis administered. Nausea and vomiting seemed inevitable side ef-fects of her treatment, but the patient has found substantial reliefwith acupuncture. This patient 's prognosis is guarded. However, she has expressed confidence in the center 's ability to maximize her wellness and comfort. She has learned skills for stress reduction and relaxationthat she will utilize throughout her life. Whatever the outcome,feels empowered to maintain control of her life. Let me say again that the Center for Integrative Medicine offers an adjunctive program of care for women with cancer. We are keen- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 advances in oncology, through medi- cine, surgery, and radiation. We are in partnership with specialistswho practice those techniques. But the goal and the value of ourprogram is this. We change the experience of the cancer patient byplacing her at the center of care and treating the whole person,mind, body and spirit. Our patients convince us daily of the benefits that the center of- fers. But what of the patients we never see? The Center for Inte-grative Medicine operates on a fee-for-service basis, and our pa-tients rarely have insurance coverage for our treatments. Con-sequently, our program is accessible only to those with the greatestfinancial wherewithal. Personally, I find it heart breaking to tellcallers who are filled with hope, and sometimes desperation, thatour services are out of their reach. That is an every day occurrence.I hasten to add that our providers offer a remarkable amount ofpro bono care. But the reality remains that to be viable, the centermust charge for its services. The issue for payment for complementary and alternative medi- cine is inextricably linked to research and policy. Only when re-search demonstrates the efficacy and cost benefit of alternativemedicine will it be incorporated into mainstream third party cov-erage. We need your leadership to harness the demand of millionsof Americans to press for pure science, pilot programs, and dem-onstration projects that will assess the real value of complementaryand alternative medicine. We need mandated benefits that will ex-pand the scope of private and public insurance policies to even themost basic complementary modalities. We need Medicare to act asa model by including alternative medicine in its coverage. TheMedical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1999, H.R. 1187, would mandatenutrition counseling as a core benefit of Medicare for the purposeof disease management. Mr. B URTON . Pardon me, Ms. Silver. We have a vote on the floor. Would you mind \u2014\u2014 Ms. S ILVER . I have just about four more sentences. Mr. B URTON . All right. Go ahead. Ms. S ILVER . That bill is languishing, pending major reform of Medicare. Mr. B URTON . And the bill number on that again is? Ms. S ILVER . The House version is H.R. 1187. On the Senate side, it's S. 660. Mr. B URTON . OK. Ms. S ILVER . As we meet here today, 60 million Americans are utilizing complementary and alternative medicine. A substantialnumber of them are women with cancer. As the Center for Integra-tive Medicine treats our small share, we are guided by the prin-ciple that wellness during illness is not a contradiction in terms. Again, I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to address you today. In a larger sense, I want to thank you on be-half of those who so urgently need our help. [The prepared statement of Ms. Silver follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you, Ms. Silver. Dr. Beilin and Dr. Trimble, we will be back in just a few min- utes. We have one vote on the floor. I am anxious to hear from bothof you, so we will be right back. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . I want to first of all thank you for your patience. This has been a very, very long day. I am a little disappointed thatwhat you are going to tell us is probably very, very significant andwe didn 't have you on earlier in the program. Nevertheless, I can assure you that what you tell us today will be taken to heart andused, and we will talk to the various agencies about it. So let 's start, I guess go down the list with you, Dr. Beilin. Dr. B EILIN . OK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and mem- bers of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to be heretoday. My name is Dr. Dan Beilin, OMD, LAc. I have a doctoratein herbal and oriental medicine, and hold a degree in physiology,as I was physiologist at the UCLA Department of Gastroenterology.I am in private practice in California in European complementarymedicine and oriental medicine. I have been working in cooperationwith a group of doctors and a radiologist, who have been measuringchanges in the skin and the nervous system of patients who de-velop devastating diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune dis-orders. We have found a high correspondence between the nervoussystem 's ability to control metabolism and circulation, also referred to as thermoregulation or heat regulation, and the growth of tu-mors and other degenerative disorders. In complementary medicine, we try to step back one step and view the patient in terms of the interactions between the internalorgans and tissues. Traditional orthodox medicine too often focuseson a single organ of the body, when in reality, many organs are in-volved in a subtle or not-so-subtle manner in the advancement ofa particular disease state. Yet when we look at the body as a collec-tion of systems, each interrelated with the others, we can actuallybegin to search for the cause of illness. Fortunately, I believe thatwe are approaching a technology which will provide a bird 's eye view of the body as a whole, providing information about multipleorgan expression and painting a picture of biological processes thatmay bring us closer to finding the cause of such diseases as breastcancer. One technology is called regulation thermography, developed in Germany and legally marketed in the United States now. Regula-tion thermography offers a serious addition to the arsenal of physi-cians evaluating patients at risk of cancer or cancer recurrence. Itworks by taking temperature measurements of neurologically con-trolled points on the skin often above the organ in question, stress-ing the body with cool air, and then taking a second measurementof the same points. Computer software analyzes the response of thepoints and their adaptation to the rapid temperature change. Morethan 25 years of experience has demonstrated a relationship be-tween such responses in organ pathology. The test is non-invasive,painless, and the machine is small enough to fit into a briefcase. Regulation thermography is not intended to be a substitute for mammography or other methods of cancer detection. What it doesdo is provide information to the practitioner about the environment VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May that could be contributing to the cancer growth, allow- ing the practitioner to design a treatment strategy utilizing theprinciples of alternative and complementary medicine, stayingwithin the constraints of good science. I prepared a few slides that better illustrate the theory behind regulation thermography and its contribution to cancer detectionand treatment. So if you will check the monitors, the first slide isthe idea of terrain versus tumor. Here, we see a large box, whichrepresents healthy cells and fluids of the body. The small box rep-resents a tumor which has grown for some reason and has nowbeen diagnosed say by a mammogram. Medicine as of 1999, today,has given special attention to the destruction of the tumor, whetherby surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, but has neglected the in-ternal environment that has contributed to the development of thattumor. Until recently, there have not been scientifically verifiablemethods for measuring the factors in that tumor terrain. But thisis critical if we are to develop therapeutic approaches aimed attreating the whole patient, not simply mounting a frontal attack onthe tumor alone. The second slide illustrates how we are internally wired, that the internal organs, such as the stomach, pancreas, liver or prostate,are capable of talking to the nervous system by taking precisemeasurements of skin temperature as we stress the body, similarto a stress ECG by the cardiologist, we can see how the organs andother tissues of the body behave around that stress. Changes in theway the body behaves to stress can indicate the possible presencesof pathologies or pre-pathologies. German and Swiss researchershave gathered data over the last 20 years which have establishednormal values for stress reactivity in every skin region. Further-more, many disease states have been documented for their patternsof skin dysfunction over the whole body. Mr. Chairman, this is a method that is objective, reproducible, and very serious consideration for inclusion into every new com-plementary medicine hospital and program. It measures the pat-tern of response to stress which takes place in the terrain of thebody. The information gathered can act as a marker test for life-style change prescription effect and preventive measures that havethe potential to cut the increasing cost of cancer care. In slide three, we see a thermogram above done with this new technology. Above, a normal thermogram, and below, a chaoticthermogram. You can see how there is a complete disruption of acertain pattern. The top one looking homogeneous, the next looksmixed up, showing a lack of regulation, of homeostasis or balanceby the organs and nervous system. This is the whole body, withdata taken from 80 points. In the next slide, this is a study done by Professor Wagner in Germany. We see this, that 63 patients on the left bar with con-firmed breast cancer by pathology, were sent to blind doctors doingclinical exams alone, with mammography added, and then with regulation thermography in conjunction with mammography. Inter-estingly, a higher percentage of tumors were identified using regu-lation thermography in conjunction with mammography than conducted in Europe demonstrate that dy- namic thermography can be a valuable tool in helping to diagnosethe presence of occult disease. In fact, some studies suggest that insome cases, regulation thermography offers a viable alternative tomammography. If proven true, this would particularly be useful ingeographic regions lacking mammography facilities or as a prelimi-nary screening device for the family physician. In addition, studiessuggest that regulation thermography may be able to detect thechanges in the body that may preface the development of cancer.With regard to breast cancer and other types of tumors, researchindicates that most tumors have taken at least 5 years from theirinception to develop into a viewable size. What has occurred to thebody 's immune mechanisms during those years which creates the pre-tumor and then tumor? What do we know about the fertility ofour inner soil, if you will, which nourishes or depletes the develop-ment of tumors? For these reasons, I strongly urge considerationfor funding for studies in the United States. On the last slide, of course breast cancer is not the only disease for which this technology may be utilized. Here is a statistical aver-age of three patients with a progression of PSAs used as a prostatemarker, and their corresponding thermogram of the prostate pointstaken by this method. Note the correspondence of a higher PSA,say on the left is 12.53, to the higher degree of rigidity of responseseen in the thermogram are quite evident. When we see the low-ering of the PSA, we see a better thermograph coming out as a re-sult. The point I make is that complementary medicine is not only comprised of non-scientifically based methods. It has in the pastbeen shunned from the mainstream, but the effect has been tothrow the baby out with the bath water. In recent years, Congresshas taken important steps to address this issue, primarily throughthe creation of the Center for Alternative Medicine at the NIH, andthe provision of increased funding for research in alternative medi-cine. Many leading teaching hospitals and other medical centershave established programs focused on researching and using alter-native and complementary therapy. One of the roles for the Centerof Alternative Medicine should be to act to bring these integrativecenters together for advanced research on key technology, such asregulation thermography, and to provide additional funding for re-search so that the valuable alternative therapies will assume theirproper place within the entire healthcare system. Finally in closing, I also recognize that Congress this year will be dealing with the critical issue of patient rights with regard toGovernment funded and private healthcare plans. Unfortunately,alternative medicine has been neglected in the coverage decision-making of many healthcare programs. I ask you while consideringthis critical legislation, to keep in mind the proven benefits of alter-native medicine, and the desires of a significant portion of theAmerican public to have access to such treatment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me here today. I appre- ciate this wonderful opportunity to share my opinions regardingpresent and future trends in medicine. I hope we can work togetherin the future. [The prepared statement of Dr. Beilin, before we go to Dr. Trimble, I hope when we get to the questions and the answers, that you will talkabout, I think it was a proton device that can attack prostate can-cer? Dr. B EILIN . There is a type of hyperthermia that is a local hyperthermia device that is being reviewed right now. Mr. B URTON . I want to ask you about that when we get to the questions and answers. Dr. Trimble, thank you, sir, for being so patient with us today.Dr. T RIMBLE . Chairman Burton, members of the Committee on Government Reform, thank you for inviting me to represent theNational Cancer Institute at this hearing. I am head of the surgerysection at the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at theNCI. Sitting behind me today is Dr. Jeffrey White, who is Directorof the NCI 's Office of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. By training, I am an obstetrician/gynecologist and gynecologic oncologist. My own patients include many women with cervical,uterine, ovarian, and breast cancer. My experiences in medicine aswell as my own experiences caring for family members with cancerhave made clear to me the importance of a holistic approach incancer care. The NCI is committed to fostering the integration of complemen- tary and alternative medicine into modern cancer care. In 1989, wefunded key research conducted by Dr. David Spiegel and his col-leagues at Stanford and the University of California which dem-onstrated that psychosocial support prolonged long survival inwomen with metastatic brain cancer. Working with the NationalCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, we have es-tablished a cancer advisory panel for the National Cancer Institute.This panel, which meets three times a year, includes members fromthe conventional and the CAM cancer research community. Thispanel will help advise the NCI 's Office of Complementary and Al- ternative Medicine run by Dr. White, on how best to evaluate CAMtherapies, how to develop accurate CAM information for the public.We are also working with the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine and other NIH institutes to establishcenters for CAM research across the United States. I would like to mention a few examples of the NCI 's commitment to complementary and alternative approaches in cancer research.As Chairman Burton mentioned, for many years, the NCI has hada program evaluating natural products for anti-cancer activity. Oneof these products, Taxol, which is found in the bark of the Pacificyew tree, has been shown to improve survival significantly forwomen with breast, ovarian cancer. We have extended our study ofnatural products from plants to marine products. We are currentlyevaluating another natural product, shark cartilage, among pa-tients with breast and lung cancer. We have evaluated chrono-biol-ogy, the delivery of chemotherapy timed to a person 's circadian rhythms, in women with uterine cancer. We funded an importantstudy conducted at the Harvard Medical School and published lastweek in the New England Journal of Medicine, which showed thatnew use of alternative medicine was a marker for greater psycho-social distress and worse quality of life in women with newly diag-nosed breast cancer. We have started an unconventional innova- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 the development of new technology in the di- agnosis and treatment of cancer. We have heard some discussion of the problems of lymphedema today. We have recently opened two phase III trials evaluating thesafety of sentinel lymph node biopsy in women with breast cancer.If this is proved safe and efficacious, then we will be able to elimi-nate the need for axillary lymph node dissection, and spare thesewomen the risk of lymphedema. We are pleased to cosponsor the workshop described by Dr. Gor- don, which opens tomorrow, on the integration of complementaryand alternative therapy in cancer care. We look forward to contin-ued interaction with the complementary and alternative medicinecommunity in our efforts to improve prevention, screening, early di-agnosis, treatment, and quality of life for women with cancer. Iwould be happy to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Dr. Trimble follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Dr. Trimble. Let me start with you. I am not sure I understood exactly what you just said about thelymph nodes. Is there a non-invasive way to check the lymphnodes? Is that what you are saying? So you don 't have to remove them? So that you would not run the risk of lymphedema? Dr. T RIMBLE . What has been shown in smaller studies is that by the use of either a dye or a radioactive material, one can find theone or two lymph nodes to which the cancer drains. Those lymphnodes are removed and then examined microscopically. If thoselymph nodes are not involved by cancer, then that person does notneed a full axillary lymph node dissection. So that 's the theory that supports our trial, in which half the people would get a full lymphnode dissection, and the other \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask you, in some cases, they don 't take out all the lymph nodes. They just take out some of them. If theytake out some of the lymph nodes, don 't people run the risk of get- ting lymphedema, even though they haven 't taken them all? Dr. T RIMBLE . Well, the risk of \u2014you are correct. There is a risk of lymphedema with only removing some. But in, let 's say when a full axillary lymphedectomy is performed, then 20 to 30 lymphnodes may be removed. Whereas in the new sentinel lymph nodeprocedure, only one or two lymph nodes are removed. So the inci-dence of lymphedema following that sentinel node procedure is al-most nothing. Mr. B URTON . I see. OK. So instead of taking out 20 or 25 and then finding 5 that had cancer cells in them, you would just takeout those that you were able to pinpoint through the radiation? Dr. T RIMBLE . Right. Pinpoint that those are the ones that are closest to the cancer. That is where the lymph fluid would drainfrom that tumor. Mr. B URTON . I see. OK. All right. Dr. Beilin, you and I talked before the hearing. We were talking about other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer. You told methat in Europe, they are using a new technology that would elimi-nate, in many cases, the need for, let 's say, in prostate cancer, the prostate to be removed. You could just attack the cancer and partof the prostate. Is that correct? Dr. B EILIN . Well, I hesitate to say eliminate the need for it, be- cause every case is individual, and I think that we need a lot moreresearch to be done. But currently there are a number ofhyperthermia devices, one in particular is made in Spain, that isgoing through FDA review right now to be brought over. That in-volves a penetrating radio frequency hyperthermia that heats tis-sue beneath the surface of the skin that specifically could be di-rected toward tumor. There is fair science behind it. So there is astack of literature that is available privately now, because it 's being FDA reviewed by the company. That 's just all I know about it. Mr. B URTON . How long has that been used in Europe? Dr. B EILIN . It's about 6-year-old technology that 's now getting to be big in Europe. Mr. B URTON . If it 's 6 years in Europe, they must have records on this. Dr. B EILIN . Yes, they do. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Well, does the FDA here in the United States ever solicit those records, or do they just start all over from scratch? Dr. B EILIN . That is a very interesting question. My impression with working with the FDA that I have done with the regulationthermography is that they look at most cases as new, and that theydo not ask for studies that have been done in foreign countriessuch as Germany, Switzerland, countries that have the integrity ofmedicine that we do here. There are countries that are developedin the Western world just like ours, and I think that there shouldbe some kind of movement to accept or at least be interested in thereview of previous research that 's been done abroad with such things as diagnostic early screening equipment. Mrs. Mack, who spoke earlier, she said she did an early detection by palpation, by just feeling. Well, the tumor, when it is 1 centi-meter in diameter is already multi-celled with thousands of cancercells. That is not really early detection. We are talking about recog-nizing patterns of disarray and the control of tissue 5 years beforeit would be visable by other methods. So I think we need a littlebit of creative expansion in our paradigm. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you about our paradigm. So there are two examples of where the FDA is looking at new technologies thathave been used in Europe from anywhere from 6 to 10 years. Dr. B EILIN . From 6 to 15 years. Mr. B URTON . From 6 to 15 years. Now you are here from the FDA, are you not? Do we have any- body here from the FDA today? You are from the FDA? Could youcome up to the table, please? Are you prepared to answer any ques-tions? You are only here to monitor the hearing? Well, I will give you a question. We have been told in the last 24 hours of two cases, one involving the instrument involvinghyperthermia, and the other instrument we 're talking about as far as early detection is concerned, even before it 's readily apparent through mammography or through physical testing, that thesehave been used in Europe for 15 years in one case, and 6 years inanother, and they have not yet been approved by the FDA, andthey could be a real adjunct to our therapies and research here inthe United States and early detection. I would like for you to havethe head of the FDA give me a written reason on why they aredragging their feet on these two things. OK? I would like to havethat as quickly as possible. Dr. B EILIN . Mr. Chairman, if I may add that recently, the FDA has made some changes that are actually positive in that they havegranted new areas of possible registration of instruments,diagnostics and treatment that has allowed for marketing approv-als more readily than they used to. So at the same time, they mayseem slow to acknowledge technologies that have existed with gooddata, they are also moving in the right direction, from what I cantell. Mr. B URTON . Well, I 'm glad to hear that, but we still have tech- nologies that could really, really help, at least from every appear-ance that I have seen, that they are still dragging their feet on. Ijust hate to see any bureaucracy get in the way of progress thatis going to help save lives. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 let me just ask you one question, and I 'll yield to my colleague. In your statement, and I am trying to recall exactly howyou put it, but you indicated that if there 's new treatments or new things that people could take who have an illness that 's very se- vere, they should be able to go ahead and take it even though therehasn 't been approval yet if their life is at risk. Did I understand you correctly? Ms. S ILVER . I was referring to the complementary and alter- native modalities that we practice in our center. In other words,those have not been proven, by and large. But they have not beendisproven. That is to say that no one has suggested or proven thatthose modalities cause harm or are not efficacious. They have sim-ply not been studied. So for that reason, we ask the questionshould we withhold those modalities, knowing as we do anecdotallythat they can be effective with patients. Mr. B URTON . And your answer is what? Ms. S ILVER . Our answer is we don 't want to withhold those mo- dalities. Mr. B URTON . And you do go ahead and use them at the current time? Ms. S ILVER . We do use them. Mr. B URTON . Are you having trouble with the FDA because you do that? Ms. S ILVER . No, no. These are non-invasive, apart from acupunc- ture, but the other modalities are non-invasive modalities. Many ofthem are mind body techniques that people can use routinely. Sothere is no oversight, as it were, because these are not drugs andthey are not invasive procedures. But we also don 't want to hold out false hope. We don 't want to claim that any of these things is effective. We certainly don 't claim that we cure cancer. We do say though that we can change the quality of life of a patient withsome of these modalities, and our patients agree that their qualityof life has been improved. Mr. B URTON . Do you have some questions? Ms. C HENOWETH . Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank you so much, for your continuing work in this area and your leadershipnationally in this area. It is so very important to us in looking atAmerican health and the role of Government in helping the Amer-ican people stay healthy and to help them have access to the re-sources that help them stay ahead of the fight before the diseasecatches up with them. I experienced a very difficult passing of my own mother through radical, as a result of radical surgery because of cancer. So I havestrong feelings about this, and am very grateful to you, Mr. Chair-man, and to your witnesses. I think that we in this committee needto focus, as you are doing, on helping Government get out of theway. You know, first do no harm is not only a good motto for physi-cians, but also for legislators. I am afraid that some of our policiesthat we have implemented have caused harm to the individual innot being able to take control of their life. I am concerned thatwhenever we try to help, we end up interfering and making thelives of our constituents harder. That is simply unacceptable. Too often, access to public treatments is cutoff because the Fed- eral Government is unsure of its safety. But to people with termi- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 potentially terminal illnesses, this seems to be a cruel joke, as it was in the case of my family. I think we need, as you havebegun, to seriously question the role of Government in relating tocertain institutions that may either help or prevent access to eithernew treatments or to education and information that will help usprevent disease. So thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman forthis hearing. I want to ask Dr. Trimble, could you explain to me what circa- dian rhythms are? Dr. T RIMBLE . Well, circadian rhythms \u2014\u2014 Ms. C HENOWETH . In relation to a patient receiving chemo- therapy. Dr. T RIMBLE . Right. Circadian rhythms refer to any of the natu- ral rhythms, whether that is day and night or the seasons and howthey affect a person 's physiology and the functions of their body. In this case, we have some preliminary research suggesting that you could decrease the toxicity of chemotherapy if you gave one ofthe medicines, doxorubicin, at 6 a.m., and the other one, Cisplatin,at 6 p.m. So in a small study, it seemed as though there was lessdamage to the nerves and less damage to the bone marrow if youstaggered the chemotherapy that way. The NCI sponsored a large study in which half the women re- ceived their chemotherapy at any old time, whenever it was ready,prepared by the pharmacy. The other half got it at 6 a.m., and 6p.m. Then they looked to see whether there was any difference inthe toxicity and damage to nerves or to bone marrow. Unfortu-nately, in the larger study, there was no difference between thetwo. But we did think it was an important question and we arecontinuing to look and see how we can decease the toxicity of ourtherapies. Ms. C HENOWETH . You know, Dr. Trimble, American women and probably women in most of the Western countries, subject them-selves to some unpleasantries, mammograms, pap smears. We arecareful about self-examination for breast cancer. With 14,500deaths from ovarian cancer though in 1999, I am deeply concernedthat there is no early detection program for this type of cancer.Seventy-five percent of ovarian cancers are not detected until thelater stages of disease. So I wanted to ask you, what is the Na-tional Cancer Institute doing to help women be able to detect ovar-ian cancer before it reaches the critical stages? Dr. T RIMBLE . Well this is obviously an extremely important area that we have been working on for some time. We are making anumber of efforts to try to improve screening and early detectionof ovarian cancer. We are funding a very large trial, the PLCOtrial, involving 73,000 women and 73,000 men. The women arebeing, half of them are being screened with ultrasound and a bloodtest, CON -25 blood test, for ovarian cancer. So that is a test of the best available technology that we have, versus standard medicalcare. We are also trying to develop some new tests. We have an- nounced an initiative called the Early Detection Research Network,which is an opportunity for us to encourage laboratory researchand clinical research into coming up with new tests, new screeningtests for a variety of cancers. I know for this particular initiative, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May seven laboratories in the United States which specialize in ovarian cancer that have put together an application just tofocus on detecting earlier tests in ovarian cancer. In addition, the NCI is committed to funding what is called a SPORE or potentially more than one SPORE in ovarian cancer. Wehave a SPORE, which stands for Special Program of Research Ex-cellence, in breast cancer and colon cancer, prostate cancer. It hasbeen a very successful program. It is designed to bring researchfrom the bench to the bedside. Nine centers have applied for thatprogram. Those applications will be reviewed at the end of thismonth. So between these three initiatives, we think we are putting a lot of time and attention and money into trying to find a better screen-ing. But you are absolutely right. We need a better screening. Ms. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Dr. Trimble. I see that my time is up, but I had some questions for Dr. Beilin. So with the chairman 's permission, I would like to submit them in writing. Mr. B URTON . No, you can ask the questions. If you would just yield to me though, I have a question that I would like to add andthen I will let you proceed. Will you yield to me? Ms. C HENOWETH . We 're on. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Beilin, this device that they have used in Eu- rope for 15 years that you demonstrated with your slides earlier,would it detect something like ovarian cancer? Dr. B EILIN . In some cases. You know, there 's no device that is going to be 100 percent or even maybe 80 percent, but there arecases that have been found when they haven 't been found in any other way. We send them in. We refer them to radiology or toultrasound, and do CA -125, the normal blood tests. So we are able to in a small percentage, reveal more than would have normally inother ways been revealed. Mr. B URTON . I presume it is the same for prostate cancer or cer- vical cancer, or any other kind of cancer? Dr. B EILIN . There are more cases found, but it 's not a system that in any way could be used 100 percent of the time. That 's just not the way to think about these things. Mr. B URTON . But it would be a good adjunct? Dr. B EILIN . It would be a great adjunct, and the cost is very lit- tle. The machines are costing less than $15,000, which is about atenth of any of the other medical scanning or radiological devices. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Trimble, I don 't want to put you on the spot or the people over at NCI on the spot, but I can 't understand why at FDA there 's new technologies that have been used for 15 years with some modicum of success, a modicum of success in Europe,that have not been approved by FDA that could help you in detect-ing early cancer in places like my colleague was just talking about,cervical cancer and ovarian cancer. It seems to me that the bu-reaucracy isn 't working together and there 's no communication back and forth. I mean if this has been going on for 15 years, even if it would only help one-tenth of 1 percent of the women who have ovariancancer, it is something that should be looked at. Does your agencyever talk to FDA or look at these things that are going on in Eu-rope and elsewhere? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Well, we have very close relations with the FDA, particularly in the areas of chemotherapeutic drugs. We haveworked closely with them to design really international systems formonitoring toxicity of drugs and response to chemotherapy, in partso that as products are developed in Europe, we might be able touse that data to submit it to the FDA for approval, so we wouldnot have delays waiting for data to come in on patients in theUnited States. Mr. B URTON . Have you ever heard of this machine before that 's been used in Europe? Dr. T RIMBLE . I work in the division of cancer treatment, so we have been focused on treatment. We have opened several new ini-tiatives in imaging, one for unconventional imaging. We have alsorecently funded the American College of Radiology to set up an im-aging network to evaluate new imaging in the treatment of can-cers. I met yesterday with Dr. Beilin to discuss how this particulartechnology could be integrated into our research portfolio. Mr. B URTON . As well as the other technology he was talking about, the heat device? You talked to him about that as well? Dr. T RIMBLE . No. I did not talk to him about that yesterday, but we would be happy to talk with him. Mr. B URTON . I wish you would, because it sounds like it 's very promising, and it 's been used for 6 years in Europe and it 's not moving very fast through FDA. Can I make a request, and if you would write this down I would really appreciate it. I would like to request that the NCI providea list to our committee of the cancer treatments, including drugs,devices, and other therapies that are available in Europe and Can-ada that are not available in the United States. The reason I amasking for that is because I have a feeling that you, and I 'm sure you are very dedicated scientists as well as your colleague backthere, but I have a feeling because there is so much on your plateright now, a lot of these things that are happening in other partsof the world that may have been going on for some time, may nothave been really explored. As a result, some of those things, maybe a good idea that might help us. I can remember after World War II, we were bringing all the rocket scientists over here from Germany, many of whom shouldhave been strung up, to help us with our rocket program becausethey were so far advanced and so far ahead of us. I would just liketo know if you could give us a list of all these drugs, devices, andother therapies that are available in Canada and Europe that arenot available here, because if we get that list, then we can startseeing what might be helpful. Then we can talk to you about those. This is not in any way to denigrate the work you are doing. It is just to say that there might be some adjuncts out there thatcould be helpful to you. Dr. B EILIN . Mr. Chairman, if I might ask the question of Dr. Trimble. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Dr. B EILIN . What is the status of mistletoe, because mistletoe therapy is being used in many oncology clinics in Europe? Fromwhat I understand, is that our drug companies here are trying torecreate a patentable mistletoe to be used as chemotherapy, but VerDate 11-MAY-2000 mistletoe therapy with the research results that they have gotten being acceptable by FDA. Mr. B URTON . Before you answer that question, Dr. Trimble, this is one of the things that really bothers a number of people in Con-gress, because many people in Congress, including myself, suspectthat some of the pharmaceutical companies have undue influenceat the Food and Drug Administration and some of our NationalHealth Institutions. I hope that 's not the case, but we have that concern. When we hear things like what he just mentioned, thatthere is a therapy or a substance that is being used like mistletoein Europe to help in areas like chemotherapy, and instead of usingthat or exploring what Europeans have done, which is very cost-effective and inexpensive, we have got the pharmaceutical compa-nies trying to come up with something that is patentable fromsome synthetic property, some synthetic thing. The FDA then testsit, runs it through, they get a 6, 7, 8, or 9 year patent \u2014I don 't know how long the patents run on those things \u2014so that they can make money. Who suffers? The patients do when there might besomething much less expensive that 's on the market over in Eu- rope. Those are things that really bother people in this country. Anyway, go ahead. I 'll let you answer. Dr. T RIMBLE . Well first, I 'll take a pass on the mistletoe because I do not know anything about it. We will get back to you. But thatis not an area that I have studied. Mr. B URTON . OK. Well that would fall under the category of all the questions I just asked. Dr. T RIMBLE . Yes. No, I can comment or I would like to comment on our interaction with our colleagues in Europe and elsewhere.The National Cancer Institute has made a sincere effort to ex-change information with colleagues from around the world. Wesponsor a meeting in conjunction with the European Organizationfor Research and Treatment of Cancer every 2 years, to discussnew drug development. We have regular meetings with colleaguesin Japan. We also have been strengthening the ties between ourclinical researchers in this country, those in Canada, and those inEurope. Approximately 3 weeks ago, at the national meeting of the Amer- ican Society for Clinical Oncology in Atlanta, I participated in ameeting to discuss trials in ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancerswith representatives from Australia, Scotland, England, Norway,Sweden, Germany, Austria, and Italy. This is something that ishappening in many other cancer sites as well. So we are definitelytrying to find out what is going on elsewhere around the world, andmake sure that people in the United States have access to the bestideas, wherever they are from. Mr. B URTON . Dr. White, I understand that you may know some- thing about the question that was asked about mistletoe? Dr. W HITE . Yes. I can tell you a little bit about what we have done in this area. As you probably know, the National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medicine has 10 or I guess now 13centers that it funds for various different diseases. It has a cancercenter at the University of Texas, Houston, which we, NCI, co-funds with the NCCAM. That center is actually doing a phase Istudy of mistletoe in advanced esophageal cancer. They also have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May of pre-clinical studies with other herbal approaches that are used outside the United States predominantly. There are a variety of different preparations of mistletoe that are used in Europe and in Australia and various places. This is usingone of those five or six that are available. Mr. B URTON . How long has it been used in Europe, do you know? Dr. W HITE . I don 't know when it first started. The last random- ized clinical trial that I am aware of that was done in Europe waspublished in 1988. Mr. B URTON . 1988? Dr. W HITE . Yes. Mr. B URTON . That was 11 years ago. And we haven 't gone through the studies yet on it here in the United States? Dr. W HITE . Well, there has not been a study done in the United States, that I am aware of. But the review of that material, as Isaid, has been done at the University of Texas. Mr. B URTON . You know, I have had cancer in my family. I have had people appear at this table here who have little children whoare dying, and there 's alternative therapies available to them, and we run into stonewalls with some of the agencies, FDA or others,and even doctors who have used some of these therapies they havetried to put out of business. When we hear of therapies, tech-nologies, or simple products like mistletoe, that 's being used in Eu- rope with some effectiveness, and people are dying here, and I haveto look at these kids and their parents, or some men that hadHodgkins disease that was going to be terminally ill, and he hadto go outside the bounds of what 's considered law and order to be treated, it really boggles your mind and bothers you. I just can 't understand why we are having this kind of a problem. If there is a technology or some substance that can be used in Europe and is being used for 10, and you said 11 years ago theywere testing this and using it, why is it that the United States, themost advanced country in the history of civilization, is 11 years be-hind, 15 years behind in this other area, 6 years behind in anotherarea, and when I ask these questions, they say of the FDA, thisyoung lady that 's sitting back there, she says, ''Well we 'll check on it and get back to you. '' But there really isn 't any answer. I just don't understand it. It seems to me that Dr. Trimble and you, Dr. White, and others, ought to be constantly looking at these alternative therapies alongwith the Food and Drug Administration, to try to make sure thatwe are giving the American consumer, the American patient, thevery best opportunity to live a healthy life and to survive if theyare in big trouble. I know you are trying to do that. But it seemsto me that some place the golf club is missing the ball. That is whyI asked that question of Dr. Trimble, that we get a list of all thecancer treatments they are using in Canada and Europe, and thedevices and the other therapies, so that we can at least look atthem and see what the heck is going on over there that we are notdoing. It is really frustrating to me when I hear this kind of stuff. Go ahead. Dr. W HITE . Yes. I would just like to put a little bit of perspective on the mistletoe issue. I understand the broader scope of what it VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May are saying, but specifically on mistletoe, the largest clinical trial that I am aware of was a randomized trial with threearms on it, one arm that patients did not receive any supplementalcare after their surgery \u2014this is for breast cancer. Another arm re- ceived standard chemotherapy, plus or minus radiation therapy fortheir breast cancer. This is all adjuvant therapy. The third arm re-ceived mistletoe. The mistletoe arm did better than no therapy, but the chemo- therapy arm did better than no therapy. The mistletoe arm did nobetter than chemotherapy. So I think it 's not \u2014so we 're talking about first of all, adjuvant therapy. So this is not in advancedforms of cancer. Second, it is not something that represented inthat study a step above what was already available to the patients. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Beilin. Dr. B EILIN . If I may comment that there are statistics being gathered an immunologist and oncologist colleague in Austria forthe Germanic countries. They have discovered that statistics seemto be coming out that using chemo plus complementary therapysuch as mistletoe together resulting, like in breast cancer, thenumber is 25 percent less recurrence rates when you use both to-gether. So I think that those kind of statistics need to kind of leapover here so that we can begin to take the best and to integratethem and add them together to have an additive effect. That samestatistic came out for prostate and melanoma. Dr. W HITE . Is that published information? Dr. B EILIN . I believe so. I can lead you to it. Dr. W HITE . I would be happy to review that. Mr. B URTON . Well see, this is the kind of communication that every American would like to see all the time, not just at the tablehere at a hearing. So let me just ask two more questions, then I 'll yield to my col- league. Then we 'll wrap this up, because we have all been here a long, long time. The NCI gets $2.7 billion, $2.7 billion for cancerresearch. You are spending less than 1 percent of that on alter-native therapies. We are hearing things here today that indicatethat there are some alternative therapies with promise. I am sureyou are going to give me a list of other things that have promisethat we 're going to get from Europe. Why is it that we only spend $20 million out of $2.7 billion on alternative therapies when halfof the Americans who have problems are using and trying to findalternative therapies. It just doesn 't make any sense to me. Can you give me an answer to that, Dr. Trimble? Why are we onlyspending $20 million? Dr. T RIMBLE . Well, as I know that Mr. Chairman, that you have had some discussions with my director, Dr. Klausner, on this issue.We realize that we need to provide the American public with accu-rate information on complementary and alternative medicine, andwe need to provide them with accurate appraisal of these tech- niques in terms of whether they work so that people in the UnitedStates can decide for themselves whether they wish to avail them-selves of various complementary and alternative medicine tech-niques. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 But I think you are making my point. We need to spend more money than just less than 1 percent on that. Wouldn 't you agree with that? Dr. T RIMBLE . Well, I agree that we need to do more research. To that end, we have agreed to co-fund with the other institutes, cen-ters for alternative medicine research across the United States. Weare actively soliciting new ideas that we can test at these centersand through with their existing cancer centers. So we hope that wecan make more information available and have more and bettertreatment which combine standard treatment, complementary med-icine and alternative medicine for the people of the United States. Mr. B URTON . Let me yield to my colleague. She has to leave. Ms. C HENOWETH . Dr. Trimble, could you commit to us how much the National Cancer Institute will dedicate to alternative medicinestudies and research? Dr. T RIMBLE . No. That 's above my pay level to make that kind of a commitment. I will commit that we are actively recruitingstudies. We have committed to setting up centers to study com-plementary and alternative medicine. We will continue to forge ajoint approach with our colleagues in other medical disciplines inthis area. Ms. C HENOWETH . Mr. Chairman, I wonder as a member of your committee, if I might ask that you would ask whoever is in the paygrade \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Dr. Klausner. Ms. C HENOWETH . Dr. Klausner, how much? I would like to know as a Congressman. Mr. B URTON . I think what we ought to do is as the Congress take a look at the amount of money we are appropriating for NCI, andtalk to the people on the Appropriations Committee. Maybe sinceNCI of their own volition isn 't going to authorize more money for alternative therapies, maybe we should just specify in the appro-priations bill how much you have to spend for that. If we did that,maybe that would break the log jam. But I will try to talk to Dr.Klausner. I want you to make a note that we do that. I don 't have any other questions. Do you have any other ques- tions? Ms. C HENOWETH . Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to share on the record with you an observation that I have made. You know, webroke all the barriers down when we passed NAFTA and GATT.Now we have the World Trade Organization. We are importing 22percent of our beef that comes from foreign countries, and we don 't know where. They have certainly different standards than we have.Yet we are consuming that beef not knowing that it 's coming from foreign countries. Forty percent of our lamb sometimes comes from7,000 miles away and we don 't seem to ask a question about that. You know, we have toys that come from China, and we havehotwheels that come from Malaysia, and we have dog bones thatcome from Argentina. Nobody seems to worry about that in thiswhole global economy. But what about getting information from Europe that we can use on a par the studies and benefit from them? It just seems abso-lutely incredible to me that we always have to reinvent the wheelwhen it comes to medicine. Yet in every other arena in this global VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:29 May medicine, and freedom from medicine, and freedom from the institutions of the individuals sometimes when we makethat choice, is what is sorely lacking. I am afraid this Congress unfortunately is supporting the institu- tions and the patients have become a byproduct or just a necessaryfunction for the institutions, instead of the institutions being a nec-essary function to better healthcare. So, Mr. Chairman, I would love to work with you on perhaps re- quiring something in NAFTA or GATT that would mandate thatthese studies be accepted by FDA on a par. Mr. B URTON . We 'll take a look at it. I will get together with you and we will have Beth look into it, and see if we can 't maybe do some of that. Ms. C HENOWETH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I think that at the very least, those technologies should not languish for 6, 7, 8, 10, 15 years before they are utilizedhere in the United States. I was just informed that shark cartilage, for instance, I think Dr. Trimble said they are testing that, 7 years ago they started talkingabout it and we are just now doing it. So it seems like there is alot of foot dragging. Well, I don 't have any other questions for you. Thank you, Mr. White. You weren 't scheduled to speak, but we do appreciate your coming before us. Dr. Trimble, Dr. Beilin, thank you very much.Ms. Silver, thank you very much. I want to thank you once againfor your patience. We stand adjourned.[Whereupon, at 3:45 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
