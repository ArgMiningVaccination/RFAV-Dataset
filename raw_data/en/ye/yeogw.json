Material and methods: The aim of this study to measure the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine CAM (one type of CAM called saqua) use in acutely sick children (complaining from gastro intestinal symptom) and factors associated with it. This is a cross-sectional study, hospital-based study in a tertiary center of Baghdad City- Iraq from the first January 2018 to January 2019. Children were assessed using a specially designed questionnaire, interview with one of child's family almost the mother or grandmother, face to face interview. Data were analyzed using SPSS (statistical software version 20), Chi-square test for association between using CAM and not using. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among the total 415 admitted children one year's olds or less complaining from gastro intestinal symptom, 36 (8.6%) were using complementary and alternate medicine. The age distribution of the children using CAM less than first year, children were using CAM, age group less than one month 11 (30.6%), 1 to 6 months 22 (61.1%) and from 6 months to 1 year 3 (8.3%), male 22 (61.1%), female 14 (38.9), about region urban 23 (63.9%) and rural 13 (36.1%), parent with low education state. During period of hospitalization, observation and follow up was done, complication more in the children who use CAM (saqua), 9 (25%) out of 36 using saqua complaining from complication compare with non-using 12(3. 2%). Deaths increasing in the children which using saqua 21 (58.3%) compare with non-using 8 (2.11%). Conclusion: The usage of CAM concerning on value and believes, in this study was founded Complication more in children using CAM camper not using CAM (saqua), also number of death more in pediatric using CAM (saqua), so need awareness about it and more study about (saqua) one type of CAM. Complementary and alternative medicine, Children less than one year old, Baghdad City-Iraq It is the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not [ [1](#ref1)] also refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being [ [2](#ref2)]. The terms \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine [ [1](#ref1)]. The high cost of drugs and increase in drug resistance to common diseases has caused the therapeutic approach to alternative traditional medicine as an option for concerted search for new chemical entities [ [2](#ref2)]. The strategy aims to support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine [ [3](#ref3)]. Herbal medicines include herbal preparations and finished herbal products that contain parts of plants, other plant materials or combinations [ [4](#ref4)]. Natural products and traditional medicines are of great importance. Such forms of medicine as traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, Kampo, traditional Korean medicine, and Unani have been practiced in some areas of the world and have blossomed into orderly-regulated systems of medicine [ [5](#ref5)]. African traditional healthcare system is perhaps the oldest and the most assorted of all therapeutic systems. In many parts of rural Africa, traditional healers prescribing medicinal plants are the most easily accessible and affordable health resource available to the local community [ [6](#ref6)]. African traditional medicine is organized into three levels of specialty, namely divination, spiritualism, and herbalism. The traditional healer provides health care services based on culture, religious background, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs that are prevalent in his community [ [7](#ref7)]. Greater use could be made of these medicinal plants at the primary health care level [ [8](#ref8)]. Traditional Chinese medicine is a traditional health practice originated from Chinese philosophy and religion [ [9](#ref9)]. The traditional Indian medicine remains the most ancient yet living traditions India is known for its traditional medicinal systems-Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. The Ayurvedic concept appeared and developed between 2500 and 500 BC in India's [ [10](#ref10)]. Written history allows tracing back Mediterranean and European medical traditions to Greek antiquity [ [11](#ref11)]. Europe there is a very long history of traditional medicine that has a respectable historical and scientific dignity [ [12](#ref12)]. We define Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine (TAIM) as a system of healing practiced since antiquity in the Arab world within the context of religious influences of Islam and comprised of medicinal herbs, dietary practices, and mind-body therapy [ [13](#ref13)]. The study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient Sumerians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In Ancient Egyptian medicine, the Ebers papyrus from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices. In Iraq it is popular to use traditional & sells remedies in different age groups for several indications [ [14](#ref14)]. Saqua is consider one of these remedies in Iraq its widely used among the low socioeconomic classes to treat neonates, infants & children with abdominal pain & diarrhea [ [14](#ref14)]. Many countries are still failing to implement the policy and program changes needed to improve access to affordable medicines [ [3](#ref3)]. It \"inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects\" and that \"further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety\" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems [ [15](#ref15)]. The World Health Organization has implemented a nine-year strategy to \"support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine [ [16](#ref16)]. Herbal remedies have traditionally been used to treat both adults and children. Herbal remedies may offer a milder alternative to some conventional medicines [ [17](#ref17)]. This is a cross-sectional observational study done in a tertiary hospital called center of pediatric teaching hospital in Baghdad City of Iraq, from January 2018 to January 2019. There are many types of traditional medicine used in Iraq but in this study it was highlighted on substance used to treated gastro-intestinal symptom especially diarrhea and vomiting, its type of CTM called saqua this is common name used in some region and karfaa in other, content of this saqua (herbal, parts of plant and animal, mineral material).

In India Among the included children, 161 were using complementary and alternative medicine. Of these, (70.2%) were using complementary and alternative medicine for the current illness directly leading to admission whereas the rest were using at some point in past for other concerns [ [18](#ref18)]. (CAM) use among U.S. adults and Children whose parent used CAM were almost five times as likely (23.9%) to use CAM as children whose parent did not use CAM (5.1%). Between 2002 and 2007 increased use was seen among adults for acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga [ [19](#ref19)].
