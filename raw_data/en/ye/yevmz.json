He will also serve as chief of pediatrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital ( ynhh ) and physician-in-chief at Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital. At the core of Lister's decision to return to Yale was \"the remarkable attraction of the students and the young people who come to campus with idealism, imagination, and bold ideas,\" says Lister, who was a member of the medical school's fac - ulty from 1988-2003. \"I treasured my time teaching in the medical school, and it was entirely because of the personal relationships.\" Lister says he sees the oppor - tunity in Yale's Leading physician-scientist and wife create a new professorship to sustain a long legacy of basic research on gastroenterological disorders In the developed world, diarrhea is thought of as an easily treated nuisance. But in the developing world it is a major scourge: according to the World Health Organization, diar - rhea, often caused by cholera, is the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, causing nearly 1 million deaths among that population each year. Gastroenterologist and scientist Henry J. Binder, m.d. , has devoted much of his career to systematically investigating the biology of gastrointestinal problems and diarrheal diseases, and exploring ways to curb their incidence. Now professor emeritus and senior research scientist in the Department of Medicine, Binder and his wife, Joan, have recently committed to endowing a professorship for a physician-scientist to pur - sue research in gastroenterology at the School of Medicine. The Binders' commitment establishes the Henry J. and Joan W. Binder Professorship in Gastroenterology. \"Henry Binder has had a long and distinguished career, contributing greatly to our knowledge of intestinal function and disease, to the field of gastroenterology, and to Yale,\" says Robert J. Alpern, m.d. , dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine. \"He and Joan have now chosen to extend these contributions by contributing funds to create a professorship, and I am deeply grateful for their generosity.\" Binder first developed an interest in gastroenterology while a student at New York Over the course of an eventful life, Herb Allison, m.b.a. , a 1965 alumnus of Yale College, has found himself in many situations that could make the calmest of us feel anxious. He spent four years as an officer in the U.S. Navy, including a year in Vietnam. After obtaining a business degree at Stanford, he climbed aboard the roller coaster of the financial industry, first at Merrill Lynch, where he rose to become president and chief operating officer. He was president and ceo of tiaa- cref, stewarding hundreds of mil - lions of dollars in retirement accounts.

In 2009, after the company stabilized, he was tapped to serve as Assistant Secretary for Financial Sta - bility at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, a.k.a. \"the tarp Czar.\" But for all that, the stressful periods that have perhaps made the deepest personal mark on Allison began during his high school years and continued while he was an un - dergraduate Yale, when he suffered from a persistent series of panic at - tacks that he now recognizes was a severe anxiety disorder. Those experiences were the inspira - tion for a $3 million gift from Allison's family foundation to the School of Medicine to establish a Psychia - try Research Scholars Program under the aegis of the Yale Child Study Center ( csc) and the Department of Psychiatry. \"I became inter - ested in this field because I know people who have these illnesses, and I myself, when I was an undergraduate at Yale, suffered from anxiety attacks that were very difficult to deal with,\" Allison recalls. \"These disorders weren't under-stood\u2014people told me to just 'get over it'\u2014and there were no effective drugs at // Scholars (page 7) // Pediatrics (page 7) George Lister 1 Church St., Suite 300, New Haven, CT 06510-3330 www.medicineatyale.orgNon-Profit Org.

Niklason, m.d., ph.d. , knew when she started medical school at the University of Michigan that research would be a major part of her career. At Michigan, she did work for a local company on ventricular assist devices\u2014implantable machines that help failing hearts pump blood\u2014 but after seeing many patients in intensive care die of organ failure, she was skeptical that artificial solu- tions would ever work for patients over the long term. But Niklason, professor of anesthe- siology and of biomedical engineering, \"stumbled into tissue engineering\" during her anesthesiology residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. A tutor working in the mit lab of bio- medical engineering maven Robert Langer, ph.d. , showed her a picture of a rat skull in which he had drilled two holes and then permanently repaired one hole by filling it with engineered cartilage. \"That made me sit up because it never had occurred to me that it might be possible to reconstitute a whole tissue just from cells,\" she says. In 1995, while still a resident, Nikla- son found herself working in Langer's lab as well, now thinking that \"this tissue engineering stuff might be the coolest thing ever.\" And though she had no previous experience as a bench biol- ogist, she set out to engineer an artery from scratch, spending three years designing scaffolding on which to grow the tissue, creating a mechanical envi-ronment for the cells to grow in that mimicked the action of the heart, and concocting a nutrient medium match-ing the body's chemical environment. She continued that work at Duke University, where she moved in 1998. At first, \"there were lots of snafus, and lots of burst pipes and leaky fluids,\" she says. But in 1999, her team published a paper in Science on the first successful transplant of engineered arteries built from an animal's own cells. Next she focused on translating the method for human cells and making the process clinically feasible\u2014it took three months to grow an artery, far too long to \"ask a patient to hold his breath,\" she says. The solution was to grow arteries from donor cells, and then, in the final step, wash the cells away, leaving only the \"skeleton\" called the extracellular matrix ( ecm). Surprisingly, the tissue didn't look any different and was just as mechanically strong as cellularized tissue, says Niklason, who joined Yale's faculty in 2006. \"The advantage is that since the cells are gone, there's no rejection. Because it's non-living we can store it for months, so we have a tissue that's off-the shelf.\" Later this year, Durham, N.C.-based Humacyte, a biotech company Niklason founded while at Duke, will begin its first clinical trials of these arteries, which will be implanted into the arms of individuals with kidney disease to provide a source of high blood flow to expedite dialysis. Other researchers in her lab are working on lung regeneration as an alternative to lung transplantation, a difficult procedure with a low 10-year survival rate due to infection and organ rejection. The approach is similar to artery engineering: create decel- lularized lungs, keeping their complex branched vasculature intact, and then seed the ecm with a patient's own cells. With a patience that comes from long experience in medical research, Niklason says it may be 20 years before people will be breathing through regen-erated lungs. But she'll keep busy in the meantime. \"I've piled a lot on my plate, she says, laughing, \"but I've been doing it for decades.\" Going with the fl ow terry dagradi Laura NiklasonSeeing many patients die of organ failure as a physician- in-training and in her work as an anesthesiologist inspired Laura Niklason to make a difference. Though she was initially skeptical that arti-fi cial organs would ever be clinically practical, she went on to become a leading fi gure in tissue engineering, and her \"off-the-shelf\" arteries, decades in the making, are soon to be tested in human clinical trials.lifelines A rabbi, a ballerina, and a Green Beret walk into Yale School of Medicine\u2014all of them members of the Class of 2016.

But the action of some stem cells is quite familiar, and occurs right before our eyes. Clustered under every strand of our hair lie hair follicles, in which stem cells regulate the con - tinuous growth of hair. Though the adult stem cells in hair follicles don't have the potential of embryonic stem cells to take on nearly any cell fate, their role in regeneration makes them an exciting research tool for understanding basic stem cell biology. Embedded just beneath the surface of the skin and frequently regenerat - ing, the hair follicle is an ideal \"mini-organ\" for observing tissue regeneration. The follicle is a highly specialized and dynamic stem cell niche in which cell signaling cues originating both inside and outside the follicle and cell-cell in - teractions within it regulate the timing and location of stem cell divisions. Re - searchers have gotten a glimpse of these processes by examining skin samples taken at sequential time points during the hair follicle regeneration cycle under the microscope. But since these samples are only static \"snapshots,\" this tech - nique may lead scientists to miss important steps of the regeneration process, creating the possibility that what is seen through the microscope does not reflect the dynamic biology of follicles in living animals. School of Medicine researchers have now developed a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging approach that allows them to observe stem cell regeneration in the hair follicle in real time in live mice. Their findings, published in the jour - nal Nature on July 26, have provided new insights that will allow researchers to tackle questions related to both tissue regeneration and the role of stem cells in cancer and other diseases. \"Because we can follow the same cells over time, we can really learn the true behavior rather than inferring it by static analysis,\" says Valentina Greco, ph.d. , assistant professor of genetics and dermatology and senior author of the study. With this new imaging approach, says Pan - teleimon Rompolas, ph.d. , a postdoctoral fellow in Greco's lab and lead author of the Nature paper, gaps in our knowl - edge of the basic steps of regeneration can be filled, and cell-cell interactions and signals can be mapped in detail. The team used a two-photon laser scanning microscope that makes it possible to produce high-resolution images of tissue in living animals at precise depths up to 100 mi - crons (one-tenth of a millimeter). Such penetration is achieved by the use of low-energy near-infrared light, which scatters less in tissue than the light used in traditional light microscopy. Another advantage of this approach is that the low-energy light inflicts little damage on tissue, says co-author Ann M. Haberman, ph.d. , assistant professor of laboratory medicine and director of the medical school's In Vivo Imaging Facility. These attributes of two-photon imaging mean that the microscopes can observe events as they would occur naturally. In the new study, the researchers used mice engineered to express a fluorescent protein in the skin's epithelial cells, which allowed them to label and visualize epithelial cells within hair follicles. A series of optical sections of these glowing cells were collected with the two-photon microscope over several hours, generating three-dimensional views of living hair follicles in which dynamic cell behaviors could be followed over time. With the new technique, the researchers made two major observations that would have been impossible using static methods. First, they found that during the period of growth, when hair follicles rapidly extend underneath the skin, epi - thelial cells not only proliferate, but also migrate downwards. Science that's more than just skin-deep terry dagradi Yale scientists have developed a new non-invasive method for observ - ing stem cell regeneration in the hair follicle of live mice in real time.

The idea is to eventually determine the function of each gene in regulating hair follicle stem cell biology. \"While there are studies that have identified tissue regeneration signals, we still need to figure out how these signals interact with each other in the regeneration process, and in which behaviors they play roles.\" Such knowledge, Greco says, would better enable scientists to harness stem cells for therapeutic purposes. \"We're just now identifying the basis for future work,\" Greco says. \"It was a risky project, but one with high reward. We now have a new way of looking at things that could not have been explored before. I think the best is yet to come.\" Visit medicineatyale.org for a related video. Giving creative researchers freedom to pursue ideas Solving the mysteries of disease requires creative, innovative ideas from the best minds in medical research. Creativity can't be programmed to occur on a tight schedule or within a specific budget, yet that is precisely how most research grants are ad - ministered. Today's tight budgets and risk-averse grant commit - tees favor research awards that provide funds to build on what is already known\u2014not what is novel or unexpected. Private support for endowed professorships, like the Henry J. and Joan W. Binder Professorship described in this issue, can provide established researchers with secure, flexible funding to pursue new ideas . . . to think creatively . . . to new treatments. Additionally, endowed professorships ensure that a donor's name and particular interests are advanced in perpetuity. Gifts from donors can also spark new investigations by junior faculty like those who will be supported through the new Psychiatry Research Scholars Program covered in this issue. Yale School of Medicine seeks donors who are not satis - fied with a conservative approach to research, and who wish to participate in pushing the boundaries of knowledge.

Breast milk is rich in fatty acids, and ucp2 helps neurons in the brains of newborn animals utilize these nutrients. Horvath and colleagues in Spain and Brazil have now discovered that ucp2 levels are significantly lower in mice delivered by Caesarean section than those born vaginally, a difference that may persist into adulthood. As re - ported August 8 in PLoS One, mice with impaired ucp2 function have smaller nerve cells in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory, and these cells make far fewer connections with other neurons. Moreover, mice with low ucp2 levels perform differently on behavioral and memory tests. Because ucp2 gene expression is induced by cellular stress, the authors suggest that reduced oxygen levels and restricted blood flow experienced by animals during vaginal birth may trig- ger production of the protein. \"The increasing prevalence of C-sections driven by convenience rather than medical necessity may have a previously unsuspected lasting effect on brain development and function in humans as well,\" says Horvath, the Jean and David W. Wallace Professor of Biomedical Research and chair of the Department of Comparative Medicine. Does natural birth build better brains?One of the most intriguing techniques in current biological research is optoge - netics, in whch light-sensitive proteins derived from a variety of organisms, including plants, are introduced into cells, allowing scientists to rapidly and precisely control activity within these cells with flashes of light. In the July 30 online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Pietro De Camilli, m.d., the Eugene Higgins Professor of Cell Biol - ogy, and colleagues describe optoge - netically engineered mammalian cells in which levels of phosphoinositides, lipid components of cell membranes that regulate crucial functions, can be instantly and reversibly controlled with bursts of blue light. \"This is a powerful tool to acutely manipulate the metabolism of mem - brane lipids and to study the result - ing changes of cell behavior in real time,\" says De Camilli, also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. \"Abnormal metabolism of lipids in cell membranes has been implicated in many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's Disease.\" istockphoto A flashy technique for cell biologySecond, they confirmed long-standing suspicion that the mesenchyme, a cluster of cells at the base of the hair follicle, is a crucial signaling center that dictates follicle growth; in follicles in which the team removed the mesenchyme with a laser, regeneration halted. \"Not only does the study answer pre-existing questions, but the observations also raise new ones about how organizations of cells and their migrations and divisions are controlled,\" says Terry Lechler, ph.d. , as- sistant professor of cell biology at Duke University, who was not involved in the study. \"This work opens a whole new tool for analysis of hair follicle morphogenesis.\" The study also has implications for other stem cell niches. \"The hair follicle is just a paradigm representing what happens in other tissues,\" says Greco, a member of the Yale Stem Cell Center.

Those diagnosed at a later age typically have a milder version of the disease and are often relieved to hear their diagnosis. \"If they come to us with a cough, and we tell them that they have CF and we can provide relatively simple therapies to improve things, I think they're better off,\" he says. Adult patients are different in that they are expected to \"take ownership\" of their disease and to depend less on family members to make sure they take their antibiotics, enzymes, vitamins, use airway clearance devices to break up mucus, or take a nebulizer treatment multiple times a day. They learn to juggle what can be hours per day of therapy with their jobs, relationships, and families. \"We value the input and involve - ment of family members regardless of the age of the patient, but we really try to put our emphasis on the patient. When I have a 25-year-old whose mother is still making calls to say her child isn't feeling well, that's a sort of a red flag that the patient needs to take ownership,\" says Talwalkar. Patients visit the adult center at least four times a year, and more frequently if there are symptoms or issues that re - quire special attention. They may see specialists in areas that become important as they grow, including diabetes and its complications, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, and fertility and family planning, and insurance or employment issues. \"Overall, our patients are optimistic, because they've seen other patients do well,\" says Koff. \"We have patients who do all sorts of things, so that ultimately the challenge becomes balancing their therapies in their daily life.\"Medical advances are bringing longer, fuller lives to patients of a dedicated Yale clinic for adults In the mid-1950s, children with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that causes thick mucus to clog the lungs and pan - creatic ducts, were not expected to survive long enough to attend grade school. Even 10 to 15 years ago, children with this disease routinely died before their 18th birthday. But today, thanks to advances in both research and treatment strategies, doctors at the Yale Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center are seeing patients graduate from college, get married, have children, and work in every profession from teacher to executive. One recently ran in the New York City marathon. Having CF is still a major challenge for patients, who of - ten must take several medications to manage the disease, as well as various therapies to clear their lungs. In severe cases, they become candidates for lung transplantation. Still, these days, most patients' stories represent a vast improvement over the recent past. \"Most of my patients are working mem - bers of the community, and nobody passing them on the street, or working with them, would know that they're sick,\" says Jaideep Talwalkar, m.d. , assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics, and associate director of the center. Yale's adult program, accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, has continually kept up with advances in the field. Because long-standing data links comprehensive care with longer life spans, all patients now have easy access to a nurse, respiratory therapist, nutritionist, social worker, physical therapist, and research coordinator. \"All of our caregivers are very important,\" says Cheryl Robaczynski, registered dietician for the clinic, explain - ing that CF is a complex disease that affects not only the lungs, but other factors as well, such as digestion and blood sugar. \"One symptom may be an issue for a patient during a visit and it may take center stage, but everything is important. As a member of the team, I need to have basic knowledge in all of the areas,\" she says. The center's expertise has recently been bolstered by the 2010 recruitment of Amy M. Ahasic, m.d., m.p.h., as - sistant professor of medicine and an expert in critical care and occupational medicine. Most of the center's patients were diagnosed as new - borns or children, and treated at the Yale Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Center by the center's director, Marie E. Egan, m.d. , and her colleagues. Very early screening has given these patients an advantage in that they began respiratory therapy before they were weakened by built-up mucus and debilitat - ing lung infections. \"We're very aggressive in making sure kids are gaining weight and getting adequate pancreatic enzymes if they have pancreatic insufficiency, which most patients do,\" says Egan, associate professor of pediatrics and of cellular and molecular physiology. When patients turn 18, they participate in a formal transition to the adult clinic, quickly or gradually, depend - ing on their comfort level.Center treats cystic fibrosis in adulthood Jonathan Koff, director of the Yale Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center, examines a patient. Koff attributes the center's success in treating patients to a number of factors, including better diagnostic methods.robert lisak Many of us know a \"pack rat\" who has trouble throwing things away, but people with hoarding disorder take that tenden - cy to extremes, sometimes filling their homes to the ceiling with possessions. Long considered a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( ocd), compulsive hoarding is being reconsid - ered as a possible standalone diagnosis in light of evidence that its brain abnor - malities are distinct from those of ocd patients. A recent study led by David F. Tolin, ph.d. , adjunct associate professor of psychiatry, lends weight to that idea. In the new research, healthy people, people with ocd, and people with hoarding disorder were asked to bring junk mail to the lab. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner, subjects were presented with pictures of their own mail as well as mail not belonging to them, and were asked to decide to keep or shred each piece. As reported in the August is - sue of Archives of General Psychiatry , compared with the control and ocd groups, the hoarders' brains showed less activity in regions involved in emo - tional regulation, risk assessment, and decision-making when they considered others' mail but were hyperactive while deciding about their own. The under- and overactivation patterns resembled those seen in autism and anxiety disor - ders, respectively, say the researchers. Hoarding disorder: a unique obsessionDrug designers have successfully creat - ed many protein drugs to battle human disese. But most proteins cannot cross cell membranes, so in general these drugs lock on to molecular targets stud - ding the cell surface that indirectly af - fect processes inside the cell. But many important targets, including protein complexes, rna, and dna, reside inside the cell and have largely been deemed \"undruggable\" by protein drugs. In the July 27 issue of Chemistry & Biology, a team of scientists led by Alanna Schepartz, ph.d. , the Milton Harris '29 ph.d. Professor of Chemistry, describe a previously unknown molecu - lar signal that helps proteins enter cells and reach the cell interior. The proteins enter via endosomes, small sacs pinched off from the cell membrane, and the newly found signal triggers their release from the endosomal sac. \"We are very keen to understand how this release signal works, as it may allow researchers to engineer mol - ecules to follow a prescribed pathway into cells,\" says Schepartz, also director of the Yale Chemical Biology Institute and senior author of the paper. istockphoto A strategy to target the \"undruggables\" who described the transition from the mountainous stacks of paper students once received to a curriculum that is essentially paperless. The idea, which began as a five-month pilot program in 2011, has had manifold benefits. \"We felt this would allow us to be a little 'greener' in our curriculum, by reduc - ing the nearly $100,000 a year we spent on copying costs,\" Schwartz said. But the initiative has also vastly changed the way Yale medical students learn, and may ultimately change the way they practice medicine. \"Our goal was to provide a full curricular mate - rial set to our students, electronically, taking advantage of what the platform The School of Medicine's iPad initia - tive, through which all Yale medical students have been provided with an Apple tablet computer containing the school's curriculum, has won praise on campus and off, most recently by Apple Computer itself, which chose to include the School of Medicine in its \"Standout Schools\" webcast series. The series showcases educators from across the country who are using technology to engage students in new ways. On July 31, the live event featured an interview with Michael L.

He first came to Yale as a fellow in gastroenterology in 1963. \"I have been at Yale for just short of 50 years,\" he says. \"Having spent my professional career as well as a good deal of my life here, I felt that I wanted to support basic research in gastroenterology at the institution.\" At the School of Medicine, Binder has served in numerous teaching, administrative, research, and clinical roles. He was director of the General Clinical Research Center from 1980 to 2001. He established and for many years directed two National Institutes of Health ( nih)-supported train - ing programs, and had more than 35 years of continuous support from the nih. His work in the lab focused on understanding the mechanisms by which ions such as sodium and po - tassium are absorbed and secreted by the large intestine, and how changes in this physiology cause diarrhea. Though he is a professor emeritus and retired, \"you would never know it,\" Joan Binder observes. He main - tains an active clinical practice with Yale Medical Group, providing care to patients with a variety of gastro - intestinal illnesses including unex - plained chronic diarrhea. Binder's decades of research are now serving as the basis for improv - ing diarrhea treatment in parts of the world where treatment is critically needed. In recent years, with sup - port from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Binder has worked to reformulate oral rehydration solu- tion ( ors)\u2014a recipe of salt, sugar, and water\u2014in the optimal ratio for the treatment of diarrhea in children. This new formulation evolved from research in his laboratory. Diarrhea is most prevalent in places where people lack access to clean food and water, and Binder has traveled to India\u2014where diar - rhea causes more than 350,000 child deaths per year\u2014over a dozen times, collaborating with investigators at Christian Medical College in South India for the last 20 years to study diarrhea together with the develop - ment of this reformulated ors . For a lifetime of contributions to the field, Binder was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Award in 2005, and the distinguished Mentor Award in 2007, both from the Ameri - can Gastroentological Association. This past year, New York University honored him with the Solomon A. Berson Alumni Achievement Award in Clinical Science. After nearly 50 years in New Haven, Yale is also \"home\" for Joan Binder, who has served as a docent at the Center for British Art for three decades. The Binders' daughter, Sarah, graduated from Yale College in 1986 with a degree in history. \"Yale has given me a collegial environment that has been very beneficial to establish collaborations and interactions with a range of col - leagues,\" Henry Binder says. \"I found it a very nurturing, friendly, collab - orative environment.\" // Gastroenterology (from page 1) of Health ( nih), this period in a young researcher's career has become especially fraught. \"This program is particularly important for psychiatry and for child psychiatry,\" says State, also professor of genetics and co-director of the Yale Program on Neurogenetics, \"because we're at a point where we're beginning to understand the basic mechanisms of these diseases, and we need the next generation desperately to be able to leverage that knowledge with the latest technology. These next several years will be the time when we will finally start to crack this, and we can't afford to lose these people.\" The new program, says State, \"gives free rein to young faculty to do high-risk, interest - ing things early in their career, which is exactly what we need to do.\" For Allison, it was a happy discov - ery that his alma mater was a center of world-class research on precisely the sorts of psychiatric illnesses he would like to target: in addition to anxiety disorders, Allison hopes to see the gift provide support for research on depres - sion, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), and Tourette syndrome, which receive far less research funding than better-known disorders such as schizo - phrenia and autism. \"I was a liberal arts major, and I never encountered anybody at the medical school,\" says Allison. \"But over the last year and a half I've got - ten to how important the research at Yale has been, and how promising it is. If this is thought of as seed money that can attract additional funding, so much the better.\" In addition to nurturing scientific talent, Allison has focused his donation on increasing collaborations between researchers who approach psychiatric disorders from diverse perspectives. \"This type of illness is about the most complex there is, because there are genetic causes, developmental causes, and the environment, and there has to be a coordinated approach\u2014genom - ics, pharmacology, neuroscience, and psychiatry\u2014to understand them.\" The initiative took root in Allison's conversations with Yale csc Director Fred R. Volkmar, m.d. , the Irving B. Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and Psychology; John H. Krystal, m.d. , the Robert L. McNeil Jr. Professor of Translational Re - search and chair of the Department of Psychiatry; and State, who says that Allison was thinking big: \"'I want you to do something transformative,' he said, 'What are the big ideas?' And we concluded that the impact of this program would be both immediate and lasting, not just understanding these disorders, but moving toward treatment. This is a huge win-win.\"The inaugural Psychiatry Research Scholars will receive their first fund - ing in September, and State says the three individuals chosen exemplify the range of research interests, and the range of career stages, the program is designed to support. Tamara Vanderwal, m.d. , m.div. , just completed her clinical training at Yale this past July, and she will make use of the new funding to support her neuroimaging research on the development of the \"social brain\" in toddlers and young children. Thomas Fernandez m.d., an instructor at the csc , will dramatically expand his research, which receives partial funding from the National In - stitute of Mental Health, in psychiatric genetics, focusing on Tourette syn - drome, motor stereotypies, and anxiety. An expert on ocd , Christopher Pittenger m.d., ph.d. , assistant profes - sor of psychiatry, in the csc , and of psychology, has received some exter - nal funding for his work, but he is pursuing a line of research that State says \"has the potential to make major contributions to the understanding and treatment of Tourette disorder.\" This work \"has great promise to garner nih funding with a relatively modest amount of additional investment\" from the new gift, State says. \"If this new effort can hasten the day when these illnesses are better under - stood,\" Allison says, \"then the gift of our family's foundation will have provided a little bit to help in that direction.\"Department of Pediatrics to build novel programs to meet new challenges in medicine. \"There is a need to replenish, to reju - venate the department with a stream of young physicians and investigators and educators,\" he says. \"The most important thing I can do is establish an environment where people want to come and launch their careers\u2014an environment that is challenging, but offers opportunity. I want to seed the department, rather than sod it.\" Lister returns to Yale from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, where he served as chair and professor of pediatrics and associate dean of education since leaving Yale in 2003. At UT Southwestern, Lister established a multispecialty consultation network that allowed health care providers to discuss their patients' cases with subspecialists at any time for free. The network was created in response to the multitude of underserved pa - tients Lister observed, many of whom lacked health insurance or lived long distances from medical centers. He hopes to develop a similar network in the New England area, which will not only provide access to medical exper-tise to physicians in the communities that Yale serves, but will keep those physicians informed about \"the real and present problems in the direct care of patients.\" Lister was a pediatric resident at ynhh and then a fellow at the Univer - sity of California, San Francisco. Five // Pediatrics (from page 1) years after returning to Yale in 1988, he became director of the pediatric intensive care unit. He soon estab - lished the Section of Critical Care and Applied Physiology in the Department of Pediatrics, and under his leadership the section continued to expand its clinical and academic activities. \"Dr. Lister spent many highly productive years at Yale and helped shape the department to which he is now returning as chair,\" says David J. Leffell, m.d. , the David Paige Smith Professor of Dermatology and Surgery and deputy dean for clinical affairs. \"His knowledge of our institution and experience as chair of the pediatrics department at Southwestern will al - low him to proceed rapidly to help the department realize its great potential.\"At Yale, Lister will continue his research on monitoring children at risk for sudden infant death, work on which he has collaborated with Yale's Eve R. Colson, m.d. , associate profes - sor of pediatrics, for many years. He also hopes to develop a program to help students interested in pediatrics to develop careers as physician-sci - entists, and to build bridges between pediatrics and other departments. In particular, he is interested in building collaborative efforts to diagnose and treat chronic illnesses that emerge in childhood, such as diabetes, congeni - tal heart disease, and depression. Lister succeeds Clifford W. Bogue, m.d. , who has served as interim chair of the Department of Pediatrics since September 2010. // Scholars (from page 1) John Krystal (From left) Thomas Fernandez, Christopher Pittenger, and Tamara Vanderwal, the inaugural group of Psychiatry Research Scholars, will receive funding to support their research on psychiatric illnesses.Matthew State Fred Volkmar In July, President Obama named Valerie Horsley, ph.d. , the Maxine F. Singer '57 Assistant Professor of Mo - lecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology one of 96 recipients of the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers ( pecase ). In August, she was given a 2013 Rosalind Franklin Young Investiga - tor Award, which is funded by the Gruber Foundation and administered by the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics. Horsley studies the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control stem cell activity and function within epithelia\u2014the tissues that line our in - ternal organs and outer surfaces. Her lab uses the mouse as a genetic model Thomas M. Gill, m.d. , an expert in research and clinical care aimed at preventing disability among older persons, has received the 2012 Joseph T. Freeman Award from the Geronto - logical Society of America. Gill, the Humana Professor of Medicine and professor of epidemiol - ogy and of investigative medicine, is a leading authority on the epide - miology and prevention of disability among older persons. His research has offered compelling evidence to support an emerging paradigm of disability as a reversible, and of - ten recurrent, event. With results from his epidemiologic studies, Gill Alison P. Galvani, ph.d. , has received the Blavatnik Award for Young Scien - tists from the New York Academy of Sciences. Galvani, associate professor of epidemiology and of ecology and evolutionary biology, is one of four faculty recipients of the award in 2012. Galvani's work focuses on inte - grating epidemiology, evolution, and ecology in order to generate predic - tions that could not be made by these disciplines alone. Galvani's interdisciplinary ap - proach has widespread potential for answering evolutionary questions, explaining empirical observations, and informing public health policy. system to study how adult stem cells within epithelial tis - sues maintain tissue homeostasis and contribute to wound healing, and their role in cancers. The pecase is the highest award bestowed by the United States Government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers. The Franklin Award, named in honor of one of the found - ers of modern genetics, is given every three years to two young women geneticists. Designed to support career development, the awards include a grant of $75,000 over three years.successfully imple - mented a landmark clinical trial that demonstrated that functional decline among frail elderly persons can be prevented. Gill serves as director of the Yale Program on Aging, the Claude D. Pepper Older Ameri - cans Independence Center, the Center on Disability and Disabling Disorders, and a National Institute on Aging-funded postdoctoral training program in geriatric clinical epidemiology and aging-related research.She has applied this approach to the study of hiv , influ - enza, tuberculosis, and the human papillomavirus (hpv), among other diseases. The Blavatnik Awards celebrate the excellence of young scientists and engineers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. They recognize highly innovative, impactful, and interdisplinary accom - plishments in the life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineer - ing, with unrestricted financial prizes.

Kadan-Lottick, m.d. , m.s.p.h. , associate professor of pediatrics, has received a St. Baldrick's Foundation Extended Scholar Award.The award extends Kadan-Lottick's previous St. Baldrick's Scholar Award, given in 2008, for an addi - tional two years. Kadan-Lottick researches outcomes among survivors of childhood cancer, 25 to 30 percent of whom experience long-term impairment in cognitive abilities and emotional regulation. Her research seeks to explain the considerable variation in outcomes seen among children who received identical therapy, with a focus on possibly in - herited factors that affect how chemo - therapy is metabolized, or that result in vulnerability to these outcomes.The St. Bal - drick's Foundation, founded in 2000, is a volunteer-driven charity committed to funding research to find cures for childhood cancers and to give survi - vors long and healthy lives. Kadan-Lottick, medical director of the heros Program at Yale, received her m.d. from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She completed a residency in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and fellowships in pediatric hematology/oncology, at The Children's Hospital at the University of Colorado Health Sciences, and in epidemiology, at the University of Minnesota. Nina Kadan-LottickCharity renews support for research on outcomes in survivors of childhood cancer 8 www.medicineatyale.orgThe School of Medicine's Joan A. Steitz, ph.d. , has been awarded two major prizes that recognize out - standing achievements of women scientists. Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophys - ics and Biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medi - cal Institute investigator, was awarded the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize of Rockefeller University for more than four decades of research on how mes - senger rna (mrna) is fashioned in order to make proteins from the instructions in dna , a process crucial to all life. Steitz was also named winner of the 2012 Vander - bilt Prize in Biomedical Science, created \"to honor and recognize a woman scientist of national reputation who has a stellar record of research accomplishments and is known for her mentorship of women in science\" by Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"Professor Steitz is both a tireless advocate and a visible and successful role model for women in science,\" said Steven Girvin, deputy provost for sci - ence and technology at Yale. \"Her work was critical to our understanding of the complex and crucial role rna molecules play in biology.\" As a student at Harvard University in the 1960s, Steitz almost decided not to pursue a career in sci - ence because of a lack of opportunities. However, with the encouragement of established scientists such as James D. Watson, ph.d. , winner of the Nobel Prize for discovery of the structure of dna , Steitz began to study how rna operates in bacteria.RNA biologist is honored as scientist, advocate, and mentor After coming to Yale in 1970, Steitz soon discov - ered \"initiator regions,\" sites in m rna strands that mark where the cell's protein-making machinery begins translating m rna into proteins. In a classic paper published 10 years later, Steitz showed that rna -protein complexes in the cell nucleus called snrnp s are critical to splicing, by which non-cod - ing sequences are excised from pre-m rna to form mrna . Steitz has been an international leader in describing the molecular events involved in creation of m rna .
