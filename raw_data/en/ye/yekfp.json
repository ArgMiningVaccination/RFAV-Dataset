Sometimes, you may unintentionally gain weight without increasing your food intake or decreasing your physical activities. This may either be periodic, rapid, or continuous. Periodic weight gain is characterized by fluctuations in your weight every now and then or periodically. This is often witnessed during a woman's menstrual cycle. Rapid and unintentional weight gain is often a side effect of a few medications, and in most cases, this is harmless. Continuous weight gain is gaining weight over time due to varying actors like advancing age or overeating. Here are some additional factors that are seen contributing to weight gain: During the reproductive age, 27% of women run the risk of being overweight. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406571/) in the United States showed that nearly 40 years ago only 1 in 50 people had a BMI of 40 or more, while in 2019 it is about 1 in 10. 41% see a prevalence in obesity which has increased since 1976 when the rate was 17%. Through 2030, these rates are anticipated to keep increasing. Pregnant women frequently experience obesity. At conception, 21% of women have a BMI of 30% or more, while 9% of women have BMIs of 35 or above. - Pregnancy: During pregnancy, women tend to put on extra weight as a result of the growing fetus and placenta, amniotic fluid, increased blood supply, and enlarged uterus. - Hormonal Changes: When a woman enters menopause, there is a decrease in the estrogen hormone. This can result in weight gain around the abdominal region and the hips. - Menstruation: Women experience water retention and bloating around that time of the month. This may also be accompanied by varying levels of estrogen and progesterone, which results in periodic weight gain. - Fluid Retention: Fluid retention is also known as edema. It causes your limbs, hands, feet, face or abdomen to look swollen and results in weight gain. - Medications: Certain medications like corticosteroids, antidepressantsi [X]Medications that can aid with disorders like depression and anxiety disorders by reducing their symptoms. , birth control pills, and antipsychotici [X]Medication used to treat psychotic disorders like schizophrenia that include unreal sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or sensations. drugs are known to cause weight gain.
