The Government Response is in plain text. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 1 Part 1 Ministerial introduction to the full Government Response to the independent Farming Regulation Task Force Introduction As the Minister for Agriculture it is my job to make a differ ence to the farming sector. In May last year the independent Farming Regulation Task Force published a challenging agenda for changing the way we regulate the farming industry in England and how we work with farmers1. I had specifically asked Richard Macdonald to ensure it left a long term legacy of change and not just some regul ations to amend or abolish. The report achieved this by calling for a fundamentally different approach and cultur e in Defra. I am pleased to be able to set out a full re sponse to the Task Force's report. A number of key themes for action have become clear, and we shall be focussing resources on driving these forward over t he coming months. Out of 220 recommendations that the Task Force made (with a further 18 recommendations directed at the Food Standards Agency), we have said an immedi ate yes to over 159 and are actively considering what could be possible on a further 31. Some we are ex ploring through formal consultations which are currently underway, and for others we are working closely with different parts of the farmi ng industry. Where we have dec ided not to take forward a recommendation, we have set out clearly why. You can see the detailed responses to each recommendation in the attached document. In responding to the recommendations, I would like to highlight the key actions, and where we have already made good progress. Inspection and earned recognition We fully accept the principle of reduci ng the inspection burden upon those who have a strong track record of reliability and adherence to standards. This risk-based approach to inspections is happening now in a number of in spection regimes, for example Integrated Pollution Prevention and Contro l (IPPC) inspections in the pig and poultry sectors, and with livestock welfare and dairy hygiene inspec tions. Farmers who are in certain farm assurance schemes are no longer inspected as frequently for these purpos es. We want to go further. We want to build a higher level of trust between farmers and inspection bodies where professionalism and high standards in farm businesses ar e routinely rewarded by a reduction in the number of inspections. In the response we detail the next steps, wo rking closely with Assured Food Standards, Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF) and the National Farmers' Union (NFU). We are working with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to review cross compliance inspections 1 http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2 011/05/17/pb13527farming-reg-report/ Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2 this year, with the intention of implementing changes for 2013. We need to get this right, and we will take a step by step approach to ens ure that the food we grow continues to be safe and that environmental and animal welfare standards are high. It is important that we continue to address non-compliance and take effe ctive enforcement action where needed. Sharing data and information To help reduce unnecessary duplication of in spections, we need to get better at sharing information between our delivery partners to enable them to take a more risk-based approach and direct inspection activity to where it is most needed. There is no substitute for close working re lationships between farming organisations and regulatory bodies at the local level. In East Anglia, the NFU are le ading the way with Local Authorities and other regulatory bodies including AHVLA and EA. Simply by talking to each other and working t ogether with shared information, t hey are reducing duplication of inspections and co-ordinating action in a more targeted way. Given this success, NFU have committed to rolling this approach out across all regions , and we will support them. Sharing information between organisations needs to be done properly to make sure farmers' data is handled appropriately, and we need the consent of individual farmers and business owners. We are making progress: the NFU has already played a lead role in developing a draft data sharing st atement. The next step is to identify which information it would be most helpful to share to reduce the burden of information requests. We are talking to farmers to find out how our information gathering could be improved, and where we can, we will respond to this feedback by phasing out repeated requests for the same information. I want to use simple approache s to do this now, rather than waiting for complex IT solutions, which could delay progress. In December 2011 we published our first Paperwork Plan, which we will review twice a year. This set out our priorities for r educing the burden of paperwo rk on farmers and food processors, so everybody can see what we ar e doing. In March this year we are kicking off a series of farmer workshops to look in greater detail at their paperwork loads, so we can understand the cumulative burden from the farmer's point of view, and identify where we can make the biggest differences. Digital by default Many of our services are available online a nd we are encouraging farmers to do more of their business this way, as the whole of Government moves to phase out the paper-based approach. In the future, all online Government services will be available through a single Government website. This provides opport unities to streamline the way we can do business and offer tools and services to farmers . We plan to use online working to make earned recognition happen more rapidly and speed up effective sharing of information and data For example, it might be possi ble for farmers to submit ke y information such as their membership of livestock health or farm assurance schemes, to support automatic Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 3 assessment of their risk status, and so make it easy for farmers to identify what else they could do to reduce their risk status and therefor e the number of inspections. Later this year we are setting up a prototype webpage to give farmers the opport unity to test these ideas, and offer their views on how they could be improved and developed further. We will work closely with farming organisations so that as we implement our drive towards online working, it is done inclusively, and farmers get advice and support. EU engagement and CAP Many legal requirements on the farming industry originate in the EU. We will improve the way that we work with the EU by working in cl oser partnership with the industry early on in the policy development process. We have started doing this by setting up an industry / Government group to participate in the very early stages of the proposals for an EU Animal Health Law to help shape our negotiating stra tegy. We have recently secured notable successes. For example, we persuaded the EU to defer the introduction of reporting the movement of individual sheep until December 2014 for the historic flock, which means that farmers are spared an unnecessary burden. We will continue to press for the EU to adopt a more risk-based rather than hazard-based approac h to legislation. Our Chief Scientist has been active in promoting this approach in the EU for pesticides and chemicals. Where we have shared objectives in the EU, we want to use the farming industry's networks to influence outcomes and to take a more stra tegic approach to engagement in the EU. We need to get CAP reform right. We will cont inue to push to simplify CAP for farmers and are working in a number of ways to do this . We want to ensure that farmers are recognised for the public benefits they provide. We also want to secu re flexibility in the regulations so that we are able to develop schemes that achieve our objectives for the farming industry and the environment. Integrated environmental messages Over the years, new environmental legisl ation and voluntary schemes have generated a cumulative burden of processes and requirement s which are not always complementary. We recognise that this complexity can make it difficult for farme rs to know how to comply. This is not easily or quickly addressed if we want to tackle it at EU level. We will continue to use opportunities to push for outcome and risk-based legislation. But we can take action now to respond to the Task Forc e recommendation to simplify and integrate environmental messages. The most important aspect of this work is to give some clear and simple guidance to farmers on what will work best for the env ironment and help them improve their bottom line. We are working in close collaborat ion with farming and environmental organisations to jointly draw up a draft list of the types of key actions that we collectively want to encourage land managers and farmers to take. For example we all agree that in many cases actions, such as nutrient management planning, can achieve multiple beneficial environmental outcomes for water and air qual ity, and they also make sound business sense. We achieved strong consensus that t hese messages are most effectively delivered Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 4 at the local level, so that they can be tailored to local farming practices and environmental circumstances. We will use local networks to get the information out to farmers to help them decide which actions are right for them. Animal Movements Controls on animal movements and livestock identification are vitally important in controlling and preventing the spread of animal di seases. Our ability to respond effectively to a disease outbreak and get the livestock industry back to normal business as soon as possible depends on our ability to trace livestock and determine how long stand stills and other controls need to be in place. The Ta sk Force recommended that we review how we implement the 6 day standst ill requirements. We hav e undertaken extensive risk assessment to ensure that if we do this t here will be minimal increase in overall disease risk. We have worked closely with industr y organisations to develop a way forward which would lift the 6 day standstill requirements for movements of cattle, sheep and goats for farms which have separation units that meet minimum requirements. We have invited the industry to develop proposals for how separation units can be approved through assurance schemes, in a way that the requir ed standards can be met. There is still work to do and it is critical we get it right, but th is way forward, developed with the industry, is a clear demonstration of responsibili ty sharing in managing risks. We have also made progress in implementi ng electronic reporting of pigs and sheep movements. E-reporting of pig movements was introduced in October last year, and we are on target to achieve 70% of all pig movem ents being recorded by the end of this year. TSEs and Meat Hygiene Inspections The Task Force made several recommendati ons to Food Standards Agency (FSA) about TSEs and meat hygiene inspections. T he FSA published its response to these recommendations in November 2011 and an updat e on progress has been published. You can view their response at www.food.gov.uk . Better Regulation - Making it happen We have made significant progress in responding to the Task Force recommendations in changing the way we work. The detailed res ponse includes many examples of how we are working in partnership with industry, involving interested parties from the start in developing practical solutions. The Task Force recommended that we should recruit industry specialists and use st aff exchanges. We are fully behind this recommendation and will, jointly with NFU, launch a busine ss exchange programme in April this year. We have set up two groups to make sure that the changes we commit to in this report actually make a difference on the ground. T he independent Regulatory Scrutiny Panel will take a strategic overview of the way that Defra is shaping and implementing regulation. We have also established the Task Force Implementation Group, chaired by Richard Macdonald. It is made up of members of farming and environmental organisations, Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 5 farmers and Defra officials; they will overse e progress and feed in ideas to help develop innovative solutions. We will regularly report pr ogress so you will be able to keep track of where we have got to. Through the Task Force itself and the way in which we have responded to the recommendations, farming is leading the way in taking forward the Government's wider agenda on better regulation. There is a st rong focus on risk-based intervention and changing the way we work with stakeholders to develop solutions in partnership. We are committed to driving this agenda forward - the Task Force report and this response is only the start. James Paice MP, Minister of State fo r Agriculture and Food Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 7 Part 2 Changing the way we work: from bureaucracy to responsibility and partnership Revisit and refine the regulation culture Start by asking whether there is a problem to address - and then identify alternati ves to regulation 2.06 Once a problem has been identified, we recommend that Defra's starting point - for addressing wholly domestic problems and when negotiating in the European Union (EU) - should be non-regulatory solutions. Yes We will encourage a culture of seeking non-regul atory solutions where these can achieve desired outcomes, particularly for domestic probl ems. In most cases, regulation can be avoided if the farming sector and their partners can deliver solutions to problems and achieve the desired outcomes through voluntary action, assurance schemes or other market-based incentives. We have given the industry opportunities to address important environmental issues through voluntary initiatives instead of imposing regulation: in the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, fo r example, farmers are encouraged to voluntarily retain and exceed the environmental measures that used to be provided by set- aside. The Task Force has set both Gove rnment and the farming industry a significant challenge and our ability to adopt more non- regulatory approaches depends on industry willingness to take responsibil ity and help us find solutions to identified problems. 2.07 We recommend that policy-makers, regulat ors, industry and others start by asking themselves a series of questions: what's the problem? Do we need to address it at all? what's the desired outcome? How is exi sting action (including regulation) contributing to this outcome? does Government need to do this? Can only Government do this? can we do this without regulation? if there is an unambiguous need for regulation: o how will it contribute to the desired outcome? o how do we keep it simple and cl ear, while keeping the focus on the outcome? o how do we avoid duplication in bot h legislation and subsequent enforcement? o and how do we keep the focus on outcome rather than process ? is the private sector already doing some thing similar? If so, how can we use what they are doing includi ng as a risk assessment tool? if we need regulation, what is the most efficient a nd cost effective inspection regime possible that achieves the desired outcome? Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 8 what might be the unintended conseque nces of our proposal, and how might we avoid them? who is best placed to produce clear, succinct and simple guidance to help businesses comply? Yes We endorse the Task Force approach to regulator y reform. We will adopt these principles in our approach to policy development and est ablish ways of working which ensure policy teams answer these questions at the outset of the policy making process, so we can avoid legislation wherever possible. The Better Regulation Programme Our Better Regulation Programme is driving fo rward reform of the way we regulate across all sectors of the UK econom y. We are establishing: a more consistent approach to regulatio n across Defra and its delivery network; tighter scrutiny over regulat ory and deregulatory plans; and; an efficient way of reporting the progress we make to Better Regulation Executive, the Cabinet Office and others. Before we introduce any new regulation we always undertake an impact assessment, to make sure we fully understand the consequences for those affected. In response to the Task Force's recommendations we will ensure that the questions at 2.07 are always addressed in the impact assessment process. Early engagement bet ween regulators and industry is a key part of this process. All proposals for legislation are challenged by the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC) which is supported by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS). The RPC looks at the implications of impact assessments for all busi nesses, including the farming sector, and its conclusions directly in fluence our decision on how to proceed with legislative proposals. We have assessed and published the costs and benefits of all our regula tion. We are the first Whitehall Department to do this and we ar e using it to help us work out where we should target our efforts for regulatory re form. We will also conduct more detailed research to understand the cumula tive effect of our regulati ons on micro-businesses, and research on what encourages and / or supports businesses to comply. To make meaningful change in regulatory cult ure we will ensure that all new regulatory proposals are properly challenged at the beginning and end of their development. To do so, we will: Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 9 Subject all new regulatory proposals to an internal scrutiny process to make sure that we have identified a range of policy options, including alternatives to regulation, before commencing work to gather evidence and develop Impact Assessments. We will fully scrutinise fi nal proposals before recommendations are made to Ministers. The Better Regulation team will ensure that this new clearance process is introduced from May 2012. Ensure policy teams have sufficient knowledge of better regulation principles. We will roll out a training programme for policy officials, economist and lawyers during 2012. We have already introduced a regulator y management database to track all our initiatives. This will help ensure that regular reviews of regulations are carried out. Increase transparency of t he regulatory landscape. We currently compile the regulations we own on a web-based portal \"Defra-lex\" to which we will add guidance and published impact assessments. It is hoped this database will be publicly available from the National Archive website from early 2013. 2.08 We recommend that trade associations continue to develop voluntary initiatives to address agreed problems and meet desired outcomes, and facilitate take-up by their membership. We also recommend that trade associations strengthen their 'marketing' of successful volunt ary initiatives, including to policy- makers in the European Commission and European Parliament. Yes We fully endorse the Task Force's recommendation. We look forward to continued close working with Trade Associations and other i ndustry stakeholders to encourage the use of voluntary approaches where these can achiev e the results we need, instead of using regulation. Where these init iatives can be shown to be succe ssful, we will use them as examples of responsibility sharing in the EU. Cultivate and celebrate partnership Trust and responsibility: the basis of partnership 2.10 We endorse the view that regulators s hould trust business, but this trust must be matched by industry taking r esponsibility. We recommend that industry should demonstrate this by trade associati ons informing their membership that the consequences of partnership include ac cepting punishment for breaches of trust . Just as we expect Government will respond to this report, we recommend that key industry bodies publish their own responses, demonstrating how they propose to take responsibility. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 10 Industry organisations are important messengers to farmers. The farming industry has a vital role to play in helping deliver key messages, to make farmers aware of important changes or new initiatives, to encourage better ways of working to improve standards and returns, and in encouraging compliance. The UK farming industry has a hard won reputation for high standards of food producti on, and this reputation can be further enhanced by industry bodies taking responsibility for ensuring that the wider industry plays its part. We look forward to seeing industr y bodies' response to this recommendation, and will work in partnership with them to help build a higher leve l of trust between regulators and farmers. 2.11 We recommend that such a response from industry bodies might include their views on the proposals we direct towards them throughout this report2, as well as the following elements: engaging openly with Government on key tools such as Impact Assessments that are already in place: the quality of Impact Assessments partly depends on industry providing detailed and accurate information; they would be more powerful if they were an agreed document; engaging fully with Government and third-party assurance bodies to develop a workable system of 'earned recogni tion' (for which see paragraphs 3.12 33); trade associations should continue to help their members become involved with approaches such as the Voluntary Initia tives on Pesticides and the Campaign for the Farmed Environment; trade associations and other industry bodies such as the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board (AHDB) should drive, own and fund training and continuous professional development (C PD) for farmers, farm advisers and inspectors (e.g. agronomists, vets, Lantra), and that such training for farmers be recognised through earned recognition; promoting a role for farmers in assessing out comes, and the sharing of data with regulators and industry representatives; and agreeing with the regulator what constitu tes bad behaviour and how it should be addressed. Yes We fully endorse the Task Force's proposal s. We are working closely with trade organisations to implement these ideas, in particular through driving forward the earned recognition proposals and supporting industry in developing voluntary initiatives. Industry organisations have a key role to play in developing the evidence base which allows us to make robust decisions about how outcomes get delivered. We need reliable industry evidence, for use in our impact asse ssments, to help us pr operly understand the 2 specifically in paragraphs 2.12, 2.14, 2.16, 2.17, 2.19, 2.20, 2.28, 2.34, 2.36, 2.45 (final bullet), 9.26, 9.39, 9.42, 9.46, 10.17, 10.20 and 10.29. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 11 effects of proposed regulation on farm busine sses and farming sectors. We will use this evidence to influence EU policy making. Sharing the problem and desired outcomes 2.12 We recommend that problem, outcome and solution should be routinely shared, discussed, collectively considered and owned between Government and industry. This includes informing the UK negotiating position in the EU. Yes We are putting increasing emphasis on working together with industry to solve specific problems and are committed to building an even closer partnership so we can achieve agreed outcomes together. Given the increasing demands on the agricultural sector - to increase sustainable food produc tion and remain competitive, while safeguarding the environment and other standards - we strongly belie ve that the best wa y to address this challenge is for us to work with farming, environmental and consumer groups to develop innovative ways of working and deliver these in par tnership at the local level. We have the same goal: a thriving and sustainable agricultural industry. We must work together, sharing responsibility, and helping each other, to get there. As outlined in our interim response, we ar e supporting innovative a pproaches to engaging with industry sectors and other stakeholders, in initiatives such as the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, Tried and Te sted, the Pesticides voluntary initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Action Plan. We have pioneered re sponsibility sharing in Whitehall in setting up the newly instituted Animal Health and Welfare Board, which creates a direct link between those creating policy and those affected by it. It is our intention to use this approach wherever possible. Voluntary approaches and partnership working Dairy Contracts We stated in our interim response that producers and processors had risen to the challenge of working together to create a volunt ary code of practice to secure better and clearer milk contracts, ra ther than imposing a further regulatory burden. We are supporting representatives of dairy producers and processors to continue working together, with the aim of agreeing a voluntary Code of Best Practice in Spring 2012. The EU dairy package requirements on contracts are relatively narrow and cannot be embellished or strengthened by Government in domestic legislation. Assuming agreement can be reached and it is fully comp lied with, the code would bring broader results more quickly and would keep the indu stry in control rather than relying on Government or legislation. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 12 We want industry organisations to have the opportunity to develop innovative solutions with us. Later in this response we will show where we are working with industry to jointly prepare for, and proactively influence EU policy, for example Animal Health Law. Using independent industry expertise to shape the regulatory future 2.13 We recommend the establishment of a senio r panel or board within Defra to have oversight of better regulation matters. Periodic independent regulatory review should be a key princi ple for Government. Yes 2.14 We recommend that the group: should be a genuine 'enquire and challenge ' panel if it is to hold Defra to account; include, as equal partners, up to thr ee independent members, one of whom should chair the panel; include independent members who participate as individuals should have the breadth of experience to contribute fully; monitor Defra's adherence to better regulation principles and have a strategic overview of regulations; steer Defra's engagement on regulation issues with industry and act as a point of reference where business feels th at standards are not being met ; review progress with impl ementing the recommendations of this report; and be accountable to Ministers. 2.15 We recommend that the board should have a role in contributing to better regulation decisions in relation to animal health and welfare . Yes We appointed an independent Strategic Regulatory Scrutiny Panel in response to these recommendations, in November 2011. The Panel's role is to advise and challenge us on our strategic approach to regulatory reform. Its remit extends across all our policies and their implementation. Its responsibilities are to: enquire and challenge and pr ovide independent advice to Ministers and officials on the effectiveness of our strategi c approach to regulatory reform; monitor our adherence to Better Regulation pr inciples and take a strategic overview of our regulatory plans; advise us on our strategy for engaging with stakeholders so as to ensure that their views are taken into account in t he shaping of regulatory policies. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 13 Making it happen We have set up two groups to make sure that the changes we commit to in this report actually make a difference on the ground. T hey will oversee the im plementation of the recommendations, and provide a robust, in dependent challenge. The Independent Regulatory Scrutiny Panel will take a strategi c view of the work we are doing to reduce regulation, and the Farming Regulation Task Fo rce Implementation Group will look at the practical things we are doing to implem ent the Task Force's recommendations. Independent Regulatory Scrutiny Panel The Panel consists of thr ee independent members, appointed in a personal capacity, having knowledge or experience of the interest s of external stakeholders impacted by our regulatory activities. The current members, who have been appoint ed for a two year term are: Andy Robertson - former roles include Chief Agricu ltural Officer in the Scottish Executive's Rural Affairs department, Chief Executive of NFU Scotland, and various positions in East Sussex County Council, w here he currently works. He was also a member of the Task Force; Peter Young - Strategy Director at SKM Envi ros and Chairman of the Aldersgate Group. He has 30 years international exper ience in multi-disciplinary environmental management consulting; Christine Tacon - until very recently Managing Director of The Co-operative Farms which is owned by the consumer-owned Co -operative Group. She was awarded a CBE for services to agriculture in 2004; she was Chair of the 2011 Oxford Farming Conference and is Chair of the BBC Rural Affairs Advisory Committee. The Panel's current programme of work incl udes assessing the strategic impact of our proposals for reducing regulation as part of the Red Tape Challenge. T hey will also advise on how we embed a culture of bette r regulation in practice. Farming Regulation Task For ce Implementation Group The Implementation Group will over see and monitor progress in implementing the specific recommendations in the Task Force report, and will hold us, Defra, our agencies, wider Government and industry organisations acc ountable for progress. The Implementation Group will also help to identify and remove barriers to progress and help build relationships between Government and industry. Richard Macdonald, who led the initial Task Force, chairs the Implementation Group. The core membership is: independent members: David Christens en (farmer); Caroline Drummond (farmer and Chief Executive of LEAF); Jeremy Moody (farming advisor and Secretary of Central Association of Agricultural Va luers); Ian Pye (farmer); William Wolmer Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 14 (farmer); representatives from NFU, RSPB and Defra. The Group held its first meeting on 6th Februar y. Progress will be reported on the Group's pages on the Defra website. Animal Health and Welfare Board We have also established a new Animal Health and Welfare Board for England, comprising experts from outside Government and senior Government officials with responsibility for animal health and welfare. T he Board, chaired by Michael Seals MBE, is the principal source of Departmental advice to Ministers on all strategic health and welfare matters relating to kept animals in England, such as farm animals, horses and pets. The first Board meeting was held on 8 November 2011. Defra should engage with industry at the earliest stages of developing (and possibly co-designing) legislation 2.16 Where a regulatory route has been agreed to address a problem, we recommend that the framework should be designed by Government and industry in partnership to the greatest extent possible . Yes We will work in partnership with the indus try and other stakeholders in discussions on problems and any regulatory routes that are being used to address them. 2.17 We recommend that policy-makers always invite a working group of industry representatives (both trade associations and farmers) to sense-check draft proposals in confidence and 'instructions to departmental lawyers' before they are turned into legal text. We recommend that Ministers should not approve formal consultation on any legislati ve proposal where industry has not been invited to contribute in this way. We will continue to involve industry represent atives and other stake holders in developing policy and the mechanisms we need to put in place to achieve desired outcomes, including how regulations should be shaped. However, while we will involve stakeholders and industry as fully as we can it is not always appropriate to involve interested parties in drafting instructions to lawyers. We often have to take a ccount of conflicting views of stakeholders and wider considerations, in shapi ng the final instructions to lawyers. Involving one particular group of stakeholders in favour of others would be contentious and could be subject to challenge. It would al so inevitably slow down the drafting process which involves extensive engagement in an iter ative process. We will continue to involve industry and other stakeholder organisations in commenting on draft legislation before the formal consultation process. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 15 Defra should invite industry to play a leading role in drafting jointly owned guidance on implementation of regulations 2.19 We recommend that: Defra and its regulators invite appropria te trade associations and farmers, where they have appropriate capacity, to play a leading role in drafting guidance, consulting other interest groups as appropriate; those involved in drafting jointly own that guidance with Government (assuming that Government is happy to sign up to that guidance) and should help promote it with those needing to use it; and Defra, its regulators and tr ade associations trial guidance with ordinary farmers in advance to sort out problems. Yes It is important that guidance is jointly owned. The approach to explaining requirements, providing useful advice and supporting ev idence needs to be shaped by farmers for farmers. Some of our guidance is statutory, in that we are r equired by law to produce it in support of regulations. Whatever the purpose of our guidance, we will: ensure that it delivers it s primary purpose: to help fa rmers achieve the desired outcomes and to comply with r egulatory requirements; seek to avoid introducing more proc ess or prescriptive requirements; test guidance with farmers to ensure that it is clear and accessible; develop new principles for producing gui dance by May 2012, which will commit to involving stakeholders in drafting guidance. For example, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will work with technical stakeholders and individual groups of representative farmers when developing and launching any new forms or guidance This will make sure that the language, content and format of RPA advice, guidance and other publications re flects the needs of those that are going to use it. RPA has used this approach recently when working with bovine industry representatives on the new cattle passport, the end of the cattle keeper s' statement and changes to legislation for electronic cattle death reporting. Their technica l stakeholder group led the development of the cross compliance guidance, which is cr itical documentation for ensuring farmers understand their resp onsibilities. Strengthening Government's agricultural expertise 2.20 We recommend that Defra recruit industry specialists. In the short term, we recommend a programme of two-way secondmen ts and training between Defra, its agencies and delivery partners, and i ndustry, e.g. trade associations. We recommend exchanges, induction programmes and farm visits by Defra/agency staff. We endorse Environment Agency and Food Standards Agency efforts in encouraging such interchange and reco mmend that the practice become more common within Defra, its agencies and delivery partners. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 16 Yes An understanding of farming practices is import ant for any policy team that is developing and implementing policies that prim arily affect the farming indus try. Staff working with the farming sector are strongly encouraged to under take farm visits, facilitated by industry organisations. We agree that improved hands-on experience for policy makers is a good idea. Our Change Programme will be picking this up in te rms of thinking about the Department's skills and ways of working. Bu t, we want to do something specific for agriculture in response to this recommendation. Therefore we will, jointly with the National Farmers Union (NFU), launch a business exch ange programme in April this year. Develop and demonstrate a new targeted and fairer approach to inspection and enforcement A comprehensive risk-based approach to inspections must be the future 2.23 We recommend (see Chapter 3 for details): adoption of a system of earned recognition to inform and target inspections and that serves as an incentive for good practice; that regulators provide a proper explana tion of their inspection programme. Yes We are committed to embedding ear ned recognition into inspection regimes to incentivise good practice and reduce the inspection burden on those that are co mplying with their obligations. Our response to the recommendations in Part 3 provides more details of the work we are doing to achieve this. Making penalties proportionate 2.26 We recommend that the proportionality and type of penalties applied by enforcement bodies be reviewed . Yes We endorse the Task Force's proposal. Our Better Regulation Programme is currently embarking on a project to assess how a risk-based approach to compliance and enforcement could be adopted across the Defra network to better target the persistent and deliberately non compliant. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 17 Smart enforcement National Intelligence Model (NIM) The Wildlife Licensing and Registration Servic e of the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA) has introduced the use of the National Intelligence Model (NIM) approach by working with enforcement partner s across the National Wildlife Crime Unit, UK Border Agency and Local Authorities. The model focuses upon intelligence led enforcement action which is based on risk asse ssments and national priorities. The result has been fewer inspector visits and an increase in successful outcomes. 2.27 We recommend that regulators should have a greater range of penalties at their disposal; specifically: Where non-compliance is minor we r ecommend that regulators should be allowed to give warnings and require faults to be put right. Where non-compliance is major we r ecommend that tough punishments are applied. We recommend there should be a robust and transparent system for determining what non-comp liances count as 'major'. We recommend that a good way of applyi ng proportionate penalties would be to use civil sanctions, a Macrory principle3, rather than criminal punishments (which should target the most serious cases). Yes Transforming Regulatory Enforcement The Government (through the BRE) recently published its response to a consultation on Transforming Regulatory Enforcement . The Government made a commitment to \"end tick box regulation\" and to improve business experience of regulat ory enforcement. The response recommends greater use of co -regulation and earned recognition. It also announced a review of all regulators responsible for enforcement on business and civil society organisations to identify where enforce ment is not working efficiently and where there is a need for fundamental reform. The first stage of t he review of regulators has started with a data-gathering phase. A further announcement on the arrangements for the review will be made in spring 2012. Defra is piloting Compliance and Enforcement Plans for a few selected new regulations. This will be a new step in our policy developm ent process, and means we will be working with the delivery partners and stakeholders to explicitly consider: clear definition of desired outcome; compliance rate required to achieve outcome; impact (or risk) of non compliance; permitted or licensed activity; business engagement plan; 3 R. Macrory (2006) Regulatory justice: making sanc tions effective. Final report. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 18 local or national delivery; how compliance will be monitored -oppor tunities for co regulation, earned recognition; advice and guidance -including ownership, methods of delivery and adherence to Code of Practice on Guidance; plans for targeting the deliberately non compliant; incentivising compliance; sanctions for non compliance - criminal, civil; powers of entry; plans for monitoring and evaluating. The pilots will commence befor e the end of December 2012. We agree that regulators should have greater fl exibility to use a range of penalties which will help to ensure that the sanctions appl ied are proportionate to the level of non- compliance shown. These are some of t he new types of penalty being used instead of criminal proceedings: Proportionate penalties Enforcement Undertaking The Environment Agency introduced civil sanc tions for minor breaches. These include Enforcement Undertakings (EUs), which enabl e a person who a regulator reasonably expects to have committed an offenc e to voluntarily take correct ive action rather than face further proceedings. These EUs have been welcomed by business and, by the end of September, 49 offers had been made, of which 19 were accepted and 10 completed. The majority of these were for packaging offenc es. A full report of the first year will be published in early 2012. The EA plan to in troduce civil sanctions for Environmental Permitting offences in 2012. Administrative Sanctions We have designed a system of Financial Ad ministrative Penalties to encourage Salmonella testing. Where an operator has committed an offence under the Regulations a financial penalty may be offered as an alternat ive to criminal prosecution. AHVLA has successfully implemented this system, with the level of penalty being decided by a central moderation panel and dependent on t he circumstances of the individual case. There has been a reduction in the number of late or non-testing by producers as a result, safeguarding the food chain. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 19 Recent simplifications of legislative frameworks Implementation of the Flood and Water Management Act Implementation of the Flood and Water Managem ent Act includes reforming the regulation applying to reservoirs (many of which are f ound on farms). This will make it more risk based - including de-regulation for large reservoirs that don't pose a significant risk and the extension of regulation to smaller ones that do. Regulator responsibilities for consenting and enforcement of works to watercourses to the lead local flood authorities will be reallocated to better re flect their wider responsibilities. The net benefits to business are estimated at \u00a3286,000 per year. Guidance on the Date Marking of Foods We have revised our guidance to businesses on how to take a risk based approach in deciding whether to use \"best before\" and \"use by\" dates for their products. This simplifies the process for businesses and allows consum ers to have confidenc e in the date marks provided. The net benefits to busine ss are estimated at \u00a389,000 per year. Streamlining Environmental Permitting The Environmental Permitting fr amework provides a common pl atform for activities whose risk to the environment means they need either a permit or some general rules. The framework allows a single permit where severa l might otherwise be required, standardised guidance for operators and common business proce sses for the regulators. This leads to lower charges and business costs (estimated net benefit of \u00a3121m N PV over 10 years). The framework was established in 2008 br inging together the licensing of waste management and Pollution Prevention and Cont rol activities, and expanded in 2010 to include water discharge consents, groundwater authorisations and radioactive substances regulation. We want to extend the framework where the benefits warrant it and bus iness supports it. We are currently seeking the necessary power s to enable Ministers to regulate the use of water resources and so bring water abstrac tion and impoundment licensing, flood defence consents and fish pass approvals into Environmental Permitting at a later date. The framework also allows for eas ier transposition of EU permitti ng requirements, for example, those stemming from the industrial emissi ons and sewage sludge directives. We also make periodic changes to improve the framewor k: for April 2012, we propose to introduce civil sanctions to enable the EA to apply a wider range of propor tionate enforcement responses to secure compliance with the environmental permitting regulations, and to make some further simplifications. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 20 2.28 We further recommend that: the UK seeks to renegotiate EU rules to incorporate the principle of proportionate penalties4; and industry endorse the approach of proportionate penalties - and apply peer and market pressure to develop high standards. Yes We will press the case for proportionate penalties in EU rules. Reduce and reform paperwork and process Introducing general licences where possible 2.30 To reduce burdens on the end-user, we recommend that Defra, its agencies and delivery partners should make a presu mption in favour of general licences wherever legally possible. Yes Our regulators will discuss with farmers what li cences could be usefully bound together, while ensuring farmers are aware of their obli gations. We will make any new combinations of licences available within 18 months (to a llow for formal consultation where necessary). We will use models of general licences that alr eady exist. For example, Natural England (NE) already issues general licences e.g. permitting the management of certain bird species causing damage, disease and public heal th and safety problems. No application is needed, providing that the land owner is sati sfied that that the use of the licence is justified and conditions can be complied with. NE is also looking at expanding Class Licensing arrangements, some of which requires changes to regu lations e.g. Protection of Badgers Act 1992, to facilitate use of Class Lic ensing. This will allow people to only register once to undertake some activities that would otherwise require several licence applications. Introducing maximum response times and fixed decision points 2.31 We recommend that the Government commi ts to maximum response times [for taking decisions]. We recommend that the regulat or gives a commitment to take decisions at fixed decision poi nts to allow all parties to consider whether to proceed or not. Yes 4 e.g. to avoid a recurrence of the situation experienced by the RPA on cross compliance., In 2005, RPA adopted a light-touch ap proach to payment reductions for non-compliance, only to be subject to European Commission Audit criticism in 2008. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 21 We agree that permissions and consenting arrangements should be as streamlined as possible. For many regulation schemes, ther e are published general rules for processes. For activities where the risks are higher or lo cally-specific, site-specific determinations will continue to be necessary. We expect all pe rmissions to have a statutory decision time, with the clock running from the moment an adequate applicat ion has been accepted. Where requested, our regulat ors will agree interim decisi on points with developers who have complex applications, for example to identify show-stopping issues before committing to further expense. Generally, these arr angements already exist, but we will make the processes clearer. For example, since July 2010, NE has underta ken to publish performance data against its published target for responding to species licences applications; the target is to respond to applications within 30 working days (or 15 work ing days for less complex applications like renewals of licence commonly used by farm ers e.g. to manage problems caused by geese). We also announced in the Autumn Statement that we are implementing the Penfold Review of non-planning consents to give: 13-week decisions on mo st environmental permissions; creation of Environmental Account managers for complex multi-regulator applications; improving linkage to non-planning c onsents through the planning portal. As a new commitment, we will seek to make t he 13-week decision time statutory at the first opportunity, replacing statutory decision times where these are currently longer. Introducing single sources of information 2.32 In the light of this, we recommend that Defra establishes a single access point to information on inspections (e.g. the Farming Theme of Business Link) and single customer contact points in each regulator. Recommendations 2.32 - 2.43 ar e addressed together, below 2.43 Reducing paperwork 2.33 We recommend that Defra, its ag encies and delivery partners: develop a partnership approach to designing forms (paragraph 2.34); introduce new principles for coll ecting data (paragraph 2.35); review requirements on farmers to write plans (paragraph 2.36); move from paperwork to 'digital by default' (paragraph 2.37); and make better use of the Farming Theme of Business Link (paragraphs 2.38 40). Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 22 A partnership approach to designing forms 2.34 We recommend that with every new admi nistrative burden, Defra and industry collectively engage a sample of ordinary working farmers to help design the form. Adopting new principles for collecting data 2.35 We recommend that: before any process is considered the question is asked - 'do we really need this information?'; regulators comply with the Regulators Compliance Code by not collecting the same data twice where this can be avoided; regulators should make clear to farmers who their data is being shared with and offer farmers the opportunity to 'opt in ' to data-sharing between Defra and its regulators; there should be a presumption that regul ators share data except where they are not legally or technologically able to do so; regulators be sensitive to sectoral cale ndars when issuing requests for data; industry trade associations push the take- up of electronic means of data supply by its members; and regulators investigate alternative means of gathering data that do not impinge on farmers. Review requirement on farmers to write plans 2.36 We recommend that Defra reviews its ra tionale for requiring farmers to write plans . From paperwork to 'digital by default' 2.37 We recommend that: Defra, its agencies and de livery partners aspire to create a comprehensive system of pre-populated forms; Defra, its agencies and de livery partners, and trade associations, encourage take-up of opportunities to complete 'pap erwork' electronically as part of good business management practice; the Government sets a goal of 100% quality broadband access in rural areas; the Government and trade associations encourage farmers and food-processors to use online facilities, whether direct ly or through a third-party including call centres; and IT training for farmers should be a priority for training providers. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 23 Making better use of the Farming Theme of Business Link 2.38 We are convinced that the Farming Theme of Business Link is the best vehicle to deliver our proposals on earned recognition and risk-based inspections as well as being the place for online applications and information. 2.40 We recommend that: the Government makes it easy for farme rs to find the Farming Theme, by improving the signposting of the Farming Theme within Business Link (e.g. through a link on the Business Link homepage); and trade associations take on the important role of encouraging take-up of Business Link among their members. Defra, its agencies and delivery partners should produce a plan for reducing paperwork and process 2.43 We recommend that Defra, its agenci es and delivery partners, including the Food Standards Agency produce a coherent plan for Ministers of how they intend to further reduce and rationalise the proces s and paperwork for farming and food- processing businesses, with aim of improv ing efficiency and effectiveness. We recommend that the plan: is produced by the end of 2011; explains where paperwork and pro cess cannot be reduced, and address 'customer journey mapping' wher e it makes sense to do so; and is based on the Task Force principles a nd recommendations elsewhere in this report. Yes We published our paperwork plan in December 20115, setting out what we have done recently, and what we will do to try to reduce the burden of paperwork and process on farmers and food processors. The paperwork pl an sets out many of the areas below, and we will review the plan twice a year to make sure that we ar e always doing all we can to reduce paperwork. The Government as a whole is moving to provid ing services \"digitally-by-default\" and plans to launch a single Government website in late 2012. This will bring together the current Direct Gov and Business Link under a single platform under the Government Digital Service (GDS) badges. The Farming Theme currently located on the Business Link site will also transfer over to the new platform. 5 http://archive.defra.gov.uk/f ood-farm/farm-manage/documents/fa rm-reg-paperwork -plan-dec2011.pdf Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 24 This new platform will eventually become the si ngle access point to all Government online services, including for all the guidance and tr ansactional services that help farmers need do business more efficiently. To support the move to digital-by-default, broadband roll out across rural areas is one of our top priorities. The deployment of superfa st broadband in rural areas is at the heart of the Government's Broadband Strategy \"Britain's Superfast Broadband Future\"6. It aims to establish superfast broadband connectivity to a minimum of 90% of each County in England, and a standard service to the re maining 10%, but capable of upgrade to a superfast solution in the future. On 29 November 2011, we launched the Rural Community Broadband Fund (RCBF), with \u00a320 m illion of funding to deliver broadband projects. This will ensure that a greater proportion of busi nesses and consumers in those communities can take advantage of the benefit s of superfast broadband with the intention that virtually everyone will have access by 2015. We know that there is currently some variability in rural internet access, and we will take this into account in the manner and timescale in which we move to digital-only services. In the shorter-term we are l ooking at the role online services can play in providing information and tools to support the implement ation of earned recognition and risk-based inspections. We want to trial a 'farmer page' for earned recognition on Business Link, and plan to open a prototype page in spring 2012 so that farmers c an test it and give us their views. We will use the f eedback from the prototype page to help us develop a fully functioning online tool fo r earned recognition. We also want to make the farming-specific webpages currently on Business Link easier to use. To help farmers gain easier access to the online services they require the Farming Theme already provides 'friendly' URLs linked to key services. The quickest and easiest route for farmers to access t he farming home page is by using www.businesslink.gov.uk/farming . We are moving more of our services to fa rmers online. For example, we moved pig movement reporting from a pape r-based system to electronic in October 2011. This new system saves time as it pre-populates bas ic information automatically, reducing the number of times pig-keepers have to fill in the same information. We plan to introduce a similar system for e-reporting of sheep, goats and deer movements by spring 2013, and we will move \"The Guide to Cross Comp liance in England\" online from 2013. It is important that we work closely with industry on this and therefore will establish an Industry-Government Group, including industry bodies and independent farmers to advise on how to help farmers move online and how ot her businesses can provide online support services to farmers. 6 http://www.culture.gov.uk/publications/7829.aspx Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 25 There are other ways in which we are trying to make it easier for fa rmers to interact with Government, for example: We will design forms to make them easier and simpler to use, and we'll get farmers and others who are using the forms to help design them. We will make forms more tailored to their audience, for exampl e the Environment Agency will tailor environmental permitting application forms to the agricultural sector by providing a \"farmer-specific\" appl ication form. We want to make best use of pre-populated forms, although there are some technological and data-sharing barriers to th is which we need to think further about before deciding the best way forward. (Also see the responses to recommendation 5.07.) We will adopt the Task Force's principles fo r data collection. A ke y part of this will be reducing the amount of dat a we ask farmers and others for though increasing data sharing across the Defra agencies. We have set up a pilot project to see how this could work in practice. (Also s ee the responses to recommendations 5.08 and 5.15.) We will also work to improve the guidance we issue. For example we will include \"quick start\" guides at the beginning of new guidance; and we are working to make all guidance documents shorte r. (Also see the responses to recommendations 5.21 and 5.22.) For more information on how we will work to reduce the burden of paperwork on farmers, see the responses to recommendations 5.07 - 5.33. Explore and embrace tools to influence farmer behaviour Understanding farmers to influence behaviour 2.44 We recommend that Government and industry use insights from behavioural science to enable, encourage or persuade farmers and food-processors to contribute to achieving better outcomes . 2.45 We recommend that Defra further enc ourages the use of farming industry 'segmentation' in policy-making. We recommend that regulators and industry representatives partner their approach to farmers and food-processors . Our customer insight research indicates t hat a range of approaches to enable, encourage and exemplify is required to st imulate change within industry. We are working to develop more flexible sector based po licy options that respond to local contexts and situations. Further insights from behavioural science ca n help with the exemp lification of best practices - by us and by industry - and so hel p more farmers improve their environmental and business performance. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 26 We also recognise the need to improve our cust omer insight of those who engage directly with farmers such as providers of advice and guidance, and also learn from their experiences, since they have an important infl uence over the choices that farmers make. 2.46 This feeling of 'guilt' is behind much of farmers' worries about inspections and can be compounded by heavy-handed or insensitive enforcement. It is essential that full account is taken of the cumula tive and individual imp act of regulation, guidance and enforcement. Yes We want to better engage with farmers and food processors to support and encourage them to obtain the best outcomes for themse lves, the environment and consumers. The more we understand about why farmers and food pr ocessors operate as they do, the more readily we can create and im plement policy to underpin this, without unnecessary legislation. We are working in partnership with industry gr oups to adopt an approach that is more behaviour-based - not only in our wo rk, but supporting them to adopt a similar approach. We continue to develop our expertise on infl uencing behaviours and are embedding this across the department by working with polic y teams to identify opportunities where influencing the behaviours of citizens or organisations could be helpful. We will also work with industry organisations to help shape non-r egulatory options for achieving desired outcomes, for example im proving the impact of vo luntary initiatives. Non-regulatory approaches are increasingly encour aged and used by Defra, for example: Campaign for the Farmed Environment: Led by the farming industry in response to the removal of \"set-aside\", this encourages farmers to adopt a voluntary approach to environmental land management; Project 50%: A partnership between scientists and Devon beam trawlermen to help protect fish stocks by reducin g the amount of juvenile fish discarded overboard by over 50%. Engaging in the EU: more, earlier and in partnership The Coalition Government's guiding principles for EU legislation 2.49 We endorse the Coalition Government's Guiding Principles for EU legislation , as announced in December 2010, particularly: We believe Defra, the UK Permanent Represen tation to the EU, Cabinet Office and Better Regulation Executive should allocate more specialist resource to Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 27 engagement, not less . There may also be benefit in integrating a better regulation module into training in EU negotiations. We recommend that the UK argues to the Eur opean institutions that it can help industry better comply with regulation by agreeing realistic transposition and implementation timescales. We recommend that timescales should not be traded off against other elements as part of the negotiation end-game. We recommend that the Government goes fu rther and presses EU partners to introduce post-implementation reviews or sunset clauses as standard in EU legislation, where this is not already the case. We recommend that the European Commission should lead the review and s hould consult end-users in doing so. We recommend that the UK should encourage the institutions to shift their focus from process to outcomes. We recommend that the UK presses the European institution policy-makers to ask themselves the same questions that we suggest Defra policy-makers ask (paragraph 2.07). In coming to a decision, we recommend that Ministers consider whether gold- plating: o would place industry in an uncompetiti ve position (as we fear from the Poultrymeat regulations); o would simply 'export' th e problem overseas; and/or o could be provided by the marketplace rather than legislation (e.g. farm assurance standards). Where Ministers decide not to use copy-out, we recommend that they publicly consult industry and other stake holders with their reasoning. Yes Influencing in the EU is a key priority for the Department given most of our regulatory stock comes from Europe. We will continue to allocate staff resource to this priority area and we will make better use of the existing resources at our disposal, as set out in the Government's Guiding Principles for EU legisl ation. However, in the current economic climate, it is not possible to allocate more specialist resource to EU engagement. We are leading the way in improving training on EU negotiations. We launched new internal guidance for Defra officials on conducting a successful EU negotiation in October 2011, and it has been taken up as a cross-Government model. The guidance covers all aspects of negotiation, including engagement with stakeholders, pr oject planning, impact assessment, better regulation, and includes practical examples from real negotiations. The guidance address transposition and implem entation timescales; we will push in individual negotiations to ensure that these are realistic. Th e guidance also covers issues of gold-plating and copy out (imple menting legislation by directly copying of the text of an EU directive without amendments) . In most cases we cons ult on regulations before making them; we will ensure that if Ministers decide not to use copy out, this is addressed in the consultation. We will al so ensure that we consult and wo rk closely with industry, to discuss these issues and try to resolve them ve ry early on in the im plementation process. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 28 We will continue to encourage the use of review or sunset clauses in EU legislation where they are appropriate (there are legal reasons why sunset clauses might not always be appropriate). We will encour age the European Commission to continue to conduct post- implementation reviews and invo lve stakeholders in them. Using the European Commission's Communication on smart regulation to lead change 2.50 We recommend that the UK Government use the European Commission's Communication on Smart Regulation7 to help lead regulatory change in Brussels. Specifically, we recommend that : the Government should collaborate with the European Commission's Secretariat General to push the other European inst itutions to incorporate the European Commission's Communication on Smart Regulation into their policy- and law- making; the Government should argue that smart regulation is key to the European Commission's Europe 2020 strategy ; as a matter of continuing policy, the Government should press the European Commission to simplify existing legislati on and ensure that this results in improvement to end-users. Yes We will continue to use the Commission's Co mmunication on Smart Regulation, and other tools, to lead regulator y change in the EU. We are successfully driving forward a new and smarter approach to regulation in Europe which aims to support business and helps enterp rise flourish. These aims are central to the Prime Minister's EU growth agenda, which seeks to reduce the overall burden of regulation on business, particularly small busi nesses. These aims are supported by a broad group of like-minded EU Member States. In June 2011 the Government finalised its Guid ing Principles on EU Legislation. Three additional Operating Principles were added to promote early engagement with the EU and ensure we hold the EU institutions to account on their better regulation commitments. In summary, the three Operating Principles are: i. twice a year, Ministers will report to the Foreign Secr etary on their department's EU priorities and early engagement strategies . This strategy check will help us agree priorities across Government and ens ure that we are not proposing or agreeing to unnecessary regulation; 7 http://ec.europa.eu/gover nance/better_regulation/key_docs_en.htm Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 29 ii. Departments will agree their negotiating pos itions on EU proposals as early as possible and will assess the likely impact of a variety of positions , to help Ministers make evidence-based decisions; iii. the Government will work with EU partners to hold the EU institutions to account on their commitments to bette r regulation principles. Placing the end-user at the centre of EU policy-making and regulation 2.51 We recommend that the Government lobb ies European institutions to put end-users at the heart of how interventions ar e chosen and developed. Specifically, we recommend that: the Government uses the Council of the European Union to hold the European Commission's Impact Assessment Board to account in its role of assessing European Commission impact assessments. It should focus on the impacts on micro-businesses; the Government presses the European institut ions to look at cumulative burdens on industry ; the Government, working together with the Council of the European Union and European Parliament, presses the European Commission to deliver on its commitment to 'think small first' when developing policy that affects businesses. It should examine cross-DG issues (e.g. inspections) as part of the 'fitness checks' unveiled by the European Commission's Communication on Smart Regulation ; the Government presses the European Commission in particular to engage more thoroughly and at an earlier stage in policy development with industry practitioners likely to be impacted by the proposed problem and solution; and trade associations strengthen their engage ment with European institutions. This involves making alliances wi th equivalent organisations from other Member States. It also involves Defra regularly inviting industry on lobbying visits to Europe. Yes We fully endorse the Task Force's recommendat ion that those who are affected by EU decisions should be at the heart of the decis ion making process, and we will continue to work with EU institutions and industry or ganisations to make sure this happens. We are pushing EU institutions to ensure that policy decisions are always based on evidence and that impact assessments are properly scrutinised by the Council and Parliament, so that the likely effects of legislation on the end-user are always fully considered. Following a sustained campaign by the UK, the European Pa rliament recently announced that it will create a dedi cated impact assessment di rectorate, and we are still calling, along with anot her eleven Member States, for a si milar unit in the Council. We also want the Commission to consult on draf t impact assessments, so that stakeholders Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 30 and businesses can have their say, and ensure growth is supported rather than hampered by proposals. We are encouraging the Commission to cons ider impacts on micro-businesses, and deliver on its commitment to 'think small first' . For example, following UK intervention, the Commission Communication on Smart Regul ation extended the minimum public consultation period from 8 to 12 weeks and also committed to revi ew its consultation process. Furthermore, following concerted UK lobbying, the Co mmission committed to preparing all future legislative proposals based on the prem ise that micro enterprises should be excluded from the scope of the proposed legislation, unless there is an explicit justification to include them, as of Januar y 2012. The Commission also committed to ensuring that in cases where micro-enterprises must be covered by its legislative proposals for wider public policy reasons, tailored approaches and lighter regimes to reduce burdens on micros will be considered. It is also screening the existing stock of EU legislation to identify opportunities where micr o enterprises could be exempted or where burdens on them could be reduced. We will hold the Commission to account on these commitments as a matter of priority and will continue to make suggestions for specific areas of EU law which would be suitable ca ndidates for micro-exemptions or lighter treatment for micro-businesses and SMEs. We will work in a new way with industry on EU issues, and invite industry bodies to meetings to influence EU Commission wher e appropriate. We will engage stakeholders earlier in strategic discussions to establish prio rities for influencing in the EU, and will join up information gathering and lobbying with stakehol ders more effectively, for example by using their European networks. We have been working collaboratively with industry on a number of EU issues , for example: The Animal Health Law is one component of a package of new legislation underpinning revision of the Official Food and Feed Contro ls. In December 2011, we established a Core Group of industry colleagues to work with us in developing and delivering the UK's negotiating strategy on the proposal, so that we can: i. improve risk analysis and risk management; ii. flag up issues that the proposed Animal Health Law might raise; iii. identify potential benefits of the proposal, and opportunities for the industry to take the lead in managing implementation (e.g . codes of conduct, assurance schemes) The Core Group will consider and advise on emer ging issues in relation to surveillance, tracing, welfare, disease mitigation and trade as European negotiations proceed. The proposed draft Soil Framework Directive was introduced by the Commission in 2006 following publication of the EU Thematic Strategy on Soil Protection. We support the objective of protecting Europe's so ils, and agree there is a need to deal with serious soil degradation in some parts of Europe, but we have serious concerns about the current proposals which we would like to see changed. We have worked closely with the NFU, to share information, particu larly about costs, additional administrative burdens and to better recognise our current approach over soil protection. We have Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 31 also worked with the NFU to lobby their counterparts through COPA-COGECA (the European agricultural union). We commit to working in a collaborative way on other issues as they arise. For example, through 2012 we will work with the pig industry on the ban of close conf inement stalls for breeding sows which comes in to force on 1 January 2013. We will develop a plan for how we can work together to be as effective as po ssible in this European negotiation. We also commit to working with the dairy industry and other key pl ayers in other EU Member States to influence policy discussions on possible fu ture extensions of IPPC to this sector. How the European Commissi on can improve compliance 2.52 We recommend that the Government: explores with the European Commi ssion how they might better take responsibility for helping end-user s comply with EU legislation ; presses other Directorates General to foll ow DG ENV's compliance promotion initiative8. This may involve oning European auditors and their approach on disallowance decisions; and encourages the European Commission to work with industry and Member States to draft guidance on implementing EU law. Yes We want legislation, and particularly the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to be clear and simple for farmers, administr ations and other end-users, and a key driver for efficiency and improved compliance. This is one of our key objectives for the current post 2013 CAP negotiations. We have been exploring with the Commission how it can help end-users comply with EU legislation through ex-ante review rather than post-implementation audits, and have had a positive response from them so far. Our negotiating team will continue to work with the Commission, the European Parliament and other Member States to ensure that the legislation is as clear and understandable as possible for our customers and for our implementing bodies. We will continue to work with the Commission on compliance promotion and are championing t he principles for refining and better targeting compliance promotion practices with the Direc torate-General for Agricultur e (DG AGRI). Measures to encourage compliance and understanding of the rules should be given greater emphasis by the Commission to avoid the risk of disall owance as a result of misunderstanding. 8 http://impel.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Communication-on-implementing-European-Communi ty-Environmental-Law-2008- com_2008_773_en.pdf Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 32 Improving inspections required by EU law 2.53 We recommend a better balance between risk-based and random inspections. This means that the European Commission s hould review its use of breach rates in calculating the size of samples for inspection regimes . Yes We will press this point during the CAP reform negotiations. To facilitate increased use of risk targeted inspections we will continue to argue that Member States should not have to increase inspection rates unless there is a cl ear increase in non-compliance in the general population.Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 33 Part 3 Improved inspections including through earned recognition Our vision for change 3.03 We would like to see reconsideration of the [European Union] EU requirement for unannounced visits, so as to achieve a better balance between surprise and business disruption. Unannounced visits are a requirem ent of a number of EU regulations. The EU considers these visits are important in order to assess true levels of compliance, for example where farmers are receiving payments. We rec ognise that these visits can cause some disruption to farming businesses, and where possi ble we are exercising flexibility in how much notice we give of such inspections. We will press for reasonable flexibility in how these visits are conducted during the Co mmon Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform negotiations. Principles for inspection 3.04 To improve inspection and help the Gove rnment end what it calls \"the culture of tick-box regulation\", we recommend that the following principles should apply to farms and primary processors: there should be as few inspections as are necessary to meet obligations and maintain standards; inspection must be risk based and targeted; regulators should provide a clear explanation of their inspection programme; regulators must make full use of all evi dence available to them (paragraphs 3.13, 3.23) to implement earned recognition; regulators must have greater confidence in industry to meet standards; inspections should, where possible, fit the business calendar (e.g. not during lambing); inspections should fit with the way th at business works and limit requirements on farmers to what is reasonable; adequate notice should be given before an inspection (unless the law requires unannounced checks); where possible checks should be made on a sample basis: e.g. checking perhaps only 10% of cattle during cattl e identification inspections or only selecting certain criteria to be checked during a cross compliance visit. A full check should be carried out only where non-compliances are found; to avoid multiple visits, an inspecti on should cover all issues for which that regulator is responsible; Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 34 regulators must share information, as far as possible, to impr ove prioritisation, reduce frequency of visits and improve coordination, e.g. animals should only have to be gathered once for inspection purposes; and inspectors must understand the busines s and be aware of any associated assurance scheme coverage; these principles should be applied across the sector, e.g. livestock markets. Yes We have been told by farmers that when co rrectly carried out, inspections can be a positive experience. They can receive useful feedback and advice, and be reassured that they are achieving the necessary standards and complying with legal requirements. In many cases the frequency of inspections is set out in EU law. In some cases, such as cross compliance, a proportion of inspections must be random. In response to the Task Forc e's recommendations we will: improve our risk-based targeti ng of inspection and enforcement; encourage inspectors, including Trading St andards Officers, to work together at local level so that visi ts are not duplicated; continue to train inspectors and ensure they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge of farmi ng and land management; give farmers fair warning of inspections and, as far as possible, time inspections when it will cause least disruption to business; combine inspections where appropriate, parti cularly when they involve the gathering of livestock. The Animal Health and Ve terinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA) will ensure that their Veterinary Officers lia ise with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) so that Cattle ID cross compliance che cks can be combined with TB testing visits; plan to apply the earned recognition principl e across all inspection regimes, so that farmers who have a record of high compliance are inspected less. We are undertaking a fundamental review of a ll our regulatory bodie s, and will use this opportunity to test how our agencies and partner s are applying the Task Force principles. We will examine each agency's feedback and complaints arrangements as we want to make sure that farmers and others can report incidences where these principles are not being met, and have confidence that their concer ns will be addressed. All agencies now have training programmes to enhance inspecto r skills. We will work with our delivery partners to ensure that the Ta sk Force principles are included in training programmes. Organisation of regulators 3.06 We recommend that the CAP cross compliance inspectorate should be confined to RPA and AHVLA, ideally with the whole process being led by RPA to reduce the potential for multiple official inspections. In the longer term, we recommend that RPA carry out all visits , with input from AHVLA as needed. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 35 Yes We have now made this change. From 1 January 2012 the RPA will carry out cross compliance visits on farms previously made by the Environment Agency (EA). We will review the scope for RPA taking greater resp onsibility for managing the cross compliance inspection programme. 3.08 We recommend that the Government ensures that local authorities are not carrying out inspections for the same purpose as another regulatory body. In the case of such duplication, only one bod y should carry out the inspection . Yes Inspections should not be duplicated. It is an unnecessary burden to farmers, and a waste of our resources. We are working with farming and local aut hority representatives right now to address this recommendation. To st art with, we will focus our attention on inspections that require checks on livestock (primarily cattle) and all associated records. Some inspections are necessary to address an identified non-compliance issue. In such cases, visits are fully justifiable. We are considering what else might be done to ensure that there is a culture of best practice and a constructive working relation ship between farmers and regulatory bodies, at a local level. We want inspectors to wo rk closely together to exchange information and intelligence as part of the dr ive to embed a risk-based approach to inspection visits. Local Authorities and the National Farmers Union (N FU) in the East Anglia region jointly established a network for farmer representativ es to work with Trading Standards Officers from each county. Regional representatives of Assur ed Food Standards, AHVLA, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), EA and RPA also participate. This network has agreed best practice guidelines for inspections, and provides a forum for ensuring close communication between regulatory bodies, informa tion sharing, and addressing identified problems. Feedback suggests this is working r eally well. NFU have agreed to roll out this model in other regions and we have secured positive engagement from local authority organisations to help make this happen. Enforcement and emergency capacity 3.09 We recommend that regulators and local authorities continue to work together to pursue enforcement. Yes As referenced above, we believe that an effe ctive working relationship between farmers and regulators at the local level is critical to effective enforce ment. Clarity about roles and responsibilities in an emergency is crit ical to managing disease outbreaks and contamination incidents. Roles and responsibilities are set out in our Exotic Disease Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 36 Contingency Plan and Operations Manual. We hold joint ex ercises between our agencies and local authorities to test res ponses to such events. Inspector behaviour and skills 3.10 We recommend that the Government and trade and professional associations jointly develop new arrangements to en sure that inspectors and assessors have appropriate training, and understand the business sectors in which they operate. Yes Inspectors must have appropriate training and skill and all of our delivery bodies have on- going training programmes for their inspection st aff. For example, the RPA Inspectorate has a bespoke professional development progr amme for its inspectors, as well as mandatory scheme specific trai ning and refresher training programmes. Competence is assessed on an ongoing basis. About 60% of RPA inspectors hold at least one level three accredited professional qualif ication (BTEC Certificate in Management, Communication and Customer services or a NPTC City and Guilds Certificate of Competence (COC) in livestock inspection) and 13% hold two. An understanding of farming may be important in many areas and some inspectors have an agricultural degree or other relevant qualif ication. We will consider the need for additional training as part of the fundamental review of regul ators - see the response to recommendation 3.04 Earned recognition Principles of earned recognition 3.16 We recommend that the principles of earned recognition become central to Government regulatory policy-making and implementation, so wherever possible individuals/businesses have the opportunity to provide evidence and benefit from a reduced or less costly regulatory burden. Yes We are committed to establishi ng earned recognition as a principle that should be applied more widely than just farm regulation. We have already implemented earned recognition principles in some inspection regimes: Integrated Pollution Prevent ion and Control (IPPC) inspec tions for pigs and poultry, where the EA has encouraged the industry to participate in the IPPC Farm Assurance Scheme; introduced by FSA for dairy hygiene ins pection regimes in 2011 (estimated saving to dairy farmers of \u00a31.32m per year); Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 37 farmers who are members of certain a ssurance schemes are now considered as low risk in the AHVLA risk model for allo cating animal welfare inspections from 2012. We will build on the lessons learned from this experience when applying earned recognition more widely, while ensuring that we maintain standards in food safety, environment and animal welfare. We will be mindful of the need to make sure t hat any changes are fair and proportionate and do not have unintended effects on costs to business, in particular small businesses. For example businesses that are not memb ers of accredited assurance schemes may have other ways to demonstrate competence. We also encourage business to think about how the principle of earned recognition for fa rming practises might be further developed and adopted in the commercial sector. Earned recognition in practice Accredited assurance schemes 3.20 We recommend that regulators, industry and assu rance providers review current arrangements and agree a list of accr edited and other schemes that provide assurance against specific official controls. In response to the Task Force's ideas about earned recognition we have worked closely with NFU, Assured Food Standards and Linki ng Environment and Farming (LEAF) to review current arrangements, and have comple ted a detailed analysis to identify overlap between official inspections and farm assurance audit requirements. We have used this to set out our initial priorities for intr oducing earned recognition into other inspection regimes. These are set out below. But there may also be opportunities where we can apply earned recognition more widely under CAP reform, and we will work to identify where it might apply to other inspections. We invite the farming industry to suggest other areas where there is pot ential for earned recognition, and the standards or other information that we might take into acc ount in assessing the frequency or need for inspections. As stated in our Interim Res ponse in November 2011, we will publish a more detailed earned recognition implem entation plan later in 2012. Outline plan for prioritising work on earned recognition Inspection Background Action Single Payment Scheme (SPS) - cross compliance EU obligation to check at least 1.0% of claimants each year - selection is 20% random control and 80% risk-From 2012 checks on animal welfare by AHVLA will operate earned recognition for members of several welfare based accredited assurance Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 38 based. schemes. RPA will implement earned recognition in 2013 as part of its cross compliance inspections9, and then consider with Defra further implementation of earned recognition as part of CAP reform. SPS - eligibility checks EU obligation to check at least 5.0% of claimants each year - selection is 20% random control and 80% risk- based. We will identify opportunities to apply earned recognition more widely in inspections under the new CAP in 2014. Agri-environment stewardship schemes EU obligation to check at least 5.0% of claimants in their first five years and 2.0% of other claimants each year - selection is 20% random control and 80% risk-based. Animal by-products incinerators Risk-based checks by AHVLA. Operators who are generally compliant when inspected will receive an annual inspection. In England and Wales on poultry premises the inspection will usually be made at the same time as other visits, for example Egg Marketing Inspectors, or as part of the national feed survey. We will invite industry to submit proposals for earned recognition in relation to inspection of animal carcase incinerators. We will agree with industry the criteria for carrying out visits differently and/or less frequently. Poultry meat regulations Checks on producers using special marketing terms (approx every six weeks). The UK opposed these checks before they were introduced in 2010, but the EU requirement is clear. But we will review the inspection regime in the summer 2012 to explore opportunities with the industry to introduce earned recognition in UK. Zoonoses Checks under the National Earned recognition is already 9 For which RPA is the Inspecting Body in respect of Statutory Management Requirements and Good Agricultural and Environmental conditions Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 39 surveillance Control Plan for salmonella. operating as industry testing is carried out by accredited commercial assurance schemes and testing and checks are risk-based. We will take the opportunity to adopt earned recognition as plans are reviewed or new national control plans proposed. Intelligence-led checks Environmental controls - water, waste, nitrates - risk- based checks (catchment based or individual premises) to address specific problems. The Environment Agency will consider how to build on its current risk-based approach to introduce further opportunities for earned recognition. Licensing or other applications Many regulatory schemes require an official inspection following an application for a licence. We will consider on a case by case basis the potential for change, simplification or earned recognition. 3.24 We recommend that regulators and industr y organisations consider an issue- by-issue list of information that would be appropriate for guiding risk assessment. Yes This recommendation provides an opportunity for farmers to provide regulators with information about their skills and competencies and t he way that they work to feed into risk assessment processes. Currently the offi cial risk-assessment when planning inspection programmes or other interventions, does not ta ke account of the full range of information that may be available on an individual farme r and/or his business from other official sources, or from information prov ided by third parties; as a result: the assessment may not be a true reflection of risk; farmer and inspector time may not be used effectively; and there may be duplication of official and third party checks, even though both are delivering the same overall outcome. We will be exploring the potential for drawing up a list of indicators for demonstrating competence that might be used by all Defra regulators as part of earned recognition. Information sharing 3.28 We consider that the Farming Theme on Business Link (paragraphs 2.38 40) offers the best practical way for farmers and regulators to share earned recognition evidence (paragraph 3.22 25), and strongly recommend it s development to this end. We are at an early stage in developing with industry and our delivery partners how online provision of information by farmers could facilit ate earned recognition. In Part 2 we agreed Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 40 that online working provides opportunities fo r farmers to submit information and evidence that can be used to earn recognition, and we will develop IT solutions to facilitate this in the future Government Digital Service (GDS). We are trialling a prototype webpage during 2012 that will show how evidence might be submitted to earn recognition and reduce inspection frequencies, and we will invite farmers to test the concept. Inspections where earned recognition could apply 3.29 We recommend that regulators consider all current farm inspections to assess whether there is close alignment betw een official inspect ion and third-party schemes with a view to addressing dupli cation and adopting the principles of earned recognition. Yes In response to this recommendation, we have worked with Assured Food Standards and NFU to undertake an analysis of overlap between assurance audit and official inspection. That work is now complete and has been used to prioritise how we take forward implementation of earned recognition as set out in the table above. As part of the implementation plan for earned recognition we will publish a list of all farm inspections by Defra and its delivery partners with an assessment of the potent ial for earned recognition. Recommendations made in other chapters We believe that the Gangmasters Licensi ng Authority (GLA) should move its inspection regime to a more targeted, risk-based approach using the principles of earned recognition (paragraph 4.53). See responses to recommendations in Part 4 The IPPC Farm Assurance Scheme is an exemplar for other forms of earned recognition. We recommend that if the scheme shows continued standards of compliance, the EA should consider further significant reductions in inspection frequency (paragraph 6.76). See responses to recommendations in Part 6 We recommend greater use of earned rec ognition in respect of meat hygiene controls and in particular moving to commercially operated control bodies to undertake certain official controls (paragraph 10.16). See responses to recommendations in Part 10 Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 41 Import controls on high risk products: FSA should work with trade bodies, ports and designated laboratories to minimi se delays of products produced to internationally recognised standards (paragraph 10.45). See responses to recommendations in Part 10 Recommendations to assurance and other schemes 3.31 We recommend that third-party assura nce schemes: 'keep it simple'; ask what is really needed and leave out what is superfluous; use language the farmer understands and keep paperwork short and simple . Yes We agree, and are working cl osely with Assured Food Standards and LEAF Marque to develop earned recognition opportunities, and ensure that our messages, guidance and requirements are clear. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 43 Part 4 Business and management Planning Localism 4.07 The onus will be on farmers to partic ipate proactively in neighbourhood plans under the Localism Bill and we recommend that they do so. Yes We strongly encourage the farming industry to fully engage in plan-making, including neighbourhood plans. National Planning Polic y Framework (NPPF) 4.12 The NPPF must recognise importance of food production and agricultural businesses . We propose the following specific wording for inclusion in the NPPF: \"Competitive and profitable agricultural and food-processing industries, producing as much food as possible whilst maintaining environmental standards, are a key feat ure of national governmen t policy. The planning system must therefore facilitate sustainable intensification 10 and productive farming which can grow, adapt, innovate and change; and promote the development of agricultural business and the wider food supply chain, recognising the economic and social benefits that these businesses can add to the local community.\" The NPPF is a key part of Government's reforms to make the planning system less complex and more accessible. The NPPF is currently being fina lised and will be published by the end of March 2012. We cannot pre- empt publication in responding to this recommendation. Permitted development and Prior notification 4.15 We recommend a return to the developmen t regulations whic h were in place pre-1995 where any agricultural buildings under 465m2 on an agricultural unit of 5ha or more is permitted developmen t without prior notification. 4.17 We recommend that agricultur al buildings between of 465 1,500m2 surface area, on agricultural units of a minimum size of 5ha, s hould be subject to the prior notification procedure rather than full planning control. 10 The term 'sustainable intensification' f eatures in the recent Foresight report on Global food and farming futures . See http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/our-work/ projects/current-projects/global-food-and-farming-futures/reports-and-publications Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 44 Any large building, whatever its purpose, should be subj ect to appropriate planning safeguards. The NPPF, however, is designed to be streamlined and fit for the needs of modern business. The NPPF is a key part of Government's reforms to make the planning system less complex and more accessible. As part of the Autumn Statement in 2011, the Government announced the intention to consult on allowing greater flexib ility for changes of use of exis ting agricultural buildings for other business purposes, for example offices, leisure and retail space. 4.18 We recommend that the construction of on-farm winter-fill reservoirs up to 25,000m3 be permitted Permitted Development Order] . LPAs [Local Planning Authorities] should expedite their construction, with appropriate conditions regarding siting and design. Wa ter infrastructure for agriculture and horticulture should be recognised as stra tegic within the NPPF and by LPAs. We support the principle of this recommendati on. We want to encourage farmers to build reservoirs to provide resilience during extended dry periods and as part of wider sustainable farming practice. There is nothing to stop farmers building on-farm reservoirs now, and engineering operations r easonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture are in many cases already permitted development. But these structures must be sited and built safely. At present, there is no evidence to support a lowering of the current threshold for the regulation of high risk reservoirs from 25,000 to 10,000 cubic meters and therefore we will not enact that pr ovision in the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. We want to minimise the uncertainty for fa rmers so that it is not a barrier to the construction of on-farm reservoirs. We will, in consultation with industry, produce guidance for farmers in 2012/13 on how to build 'lo w risk' reservoirs. This guidance should also reassure LPAs as to the safety of on- farm reservoirs. EA experts are on hand to offer advice about positioning and construc tion of 'low risk' reservoirs. Polytunnels 4.21 We recommend that Part 6 of the GPDO is amended to create a category that would include polytunnels . Polytunnels may already benefit from agricul tural permitted development rights, depending on a number of factors such as their desig n, size and permanence, if local councils determine that they constitute development. Local councils are expected to have due regard to the needs of agriculture in bringi ng forward plans for their areas and in any decisions affecting development. There is a debate to be had about polytunnels. T hey play an important role in British horticulture, enabling an increase in sustain able food production, and local benefits to the Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 45 rural economy. We recognise that at a local level their potential effects on landscape can be controversial, and there is a need to strike a sensible balance. We have asked the Farming Regulation Task Fo rce Implementation Group to review the way that the farming industry can work with the planning system to optimise opportunities for sustainable food production, to enhance the se ctor's competitiveness. This will include gathering more evidence to inform a wider discussion with stakeholder organisations. 4.23 We recommend that LPAs take a prag matic, non-regulatory approach to horticultural support structures, such as 't able tops', training systems and fruit- netting; these should all remain outside the planning system. Yes Minor horticultural structures are unlikely to be viewed as devel opments that require planning consent. Local pl anning authorities are best pl aced to determine how such structures should be regulated on a case-by-ca se basis, but local planning authorities are expected to be pragmatic, and to have due regard to the needs of agriculture in plan-making and development management work. Information requirements 4.27 In order to simplify and reduce unnecessa ry delays in the planning application process, we make the following recommendations: for outline planning permission and prior notifications, LPAs should be required to respond within 14 days to notify if there is a need for any additional information to validate the application (thi s is consistent with our wider strategic recommendation that Government commit to maximum response times (paragraph 2.31); for outline planning permission and prior notifications, LPAs should be required to provide a substantive reply and decision within 42 days of the original request (ditto); local planners should be offered training in agriculture, horticulture and the food industry. The onus on this should come fr om farming organisations but we also commend this opportunity to agricultural colleges. Yes We agree with the principle of this recomme ndation. In July 2011, the Government announced the intention to look at both the length of time it takes to determine any planning applications, and the level of information required in support of planning applications. Village greens and footpaths 4.34 We recommend that for both the applicat ion for designation of village greens and the recording of new rights-of-way, mechanisms should be introduced to Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 46 rebalance the process and to ensure that reasonable costs are met by both parties (i.e. including applicants). 4.35 We recommend that the proliferati on of inappropriate village green designations is addressed. We understand th at, as part of th eir Business Plan commitments, Defra and (the Department for Communiti es and Local Government] (DCLG ) will be looking to reform village gr een designations and to introduce a new local 'green space designation'. We woul d recommend that Defra/DCLG use this reform to address our concerns in paragraphs 4.28 34. 4.36 We recommend that the Group's conclusions that a cut-off date of 2026 for discoveries of historic routes should be im plemented, as originally introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, whereby a fi nal map is drawn up with all footpaths and rights-of-way , with no more being added . 4.38 We recommend that a pragmatic soluti on for temporary diversions should be to put the proposed diversion to the releva nt local access forum, for agreement or otherwise. We believe that it might be he lpful for the Government to supplement this local approach with a code of practice. 4.39 [We understand that Defra is currently considering the various access proposals put forward by the Stakeholder Working Group on Unrecorded Rights of Way]. We encourage the Government to consider our recommendations and the strong sentiment behind them in any wider package of measures to come out of the work of the stakeholder working group. Under consideration We have recently consulted on proposals to refo rm the system for regi stering new town or village greens. The Government want s to achieve an improved balance between providing protected green space for local co mmunities and reducing the administrative burden on local authorities and landowners. We plan to publish a summary of the consultation responses soon and announce our proposed reforms in the summer. Last year we published the Natural Environm ent White Paper (NEWP). It set out the Government's intention to consult on si mplifying and streamlining the processes for recording and making changes to public rights of way. This will be based on proposals made by Natural England's (NE) Stakeholder Wo rking Group on unrecorded rights of way, in its report 'Stepping Forward' (published in March 2010). The Group included a full range of rights of way stakeholders, including the National Farmers Union (NFU) and the Country Landowners Association (CLA). We believe it produced a balanced package of measures which would offer benefits to all concerned. We expect to make an announcement on the consultation later this year. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 47 Seasonal workers' accommodation 4.41 We recommend that there should be a presumption in favour of planning applications for seasonal workers' accomm odation in established horticultural businesses. This would mean allowing permitted development for buildings up to 465m2 surface area and prior notification for buildings between this threshold and 1,500m2. As part of the Autumn Statement in 2011, the Government announced the intention to consult on allowing greater flexib ility for changes of use of exis ting agricultural buildings for other business purposes, for example offices, leisure and retail space. The NPPF is designed to be streamlined and fi t for the needs of mo dern business, and is a key part of Government's re forms to make the planning system less complex and more accessible. It will be published in March 2012. Renewable energy operations 4.44 We recommend that the NPPF should recognise the importance of on-farm renewable energy developments. Under consideration The responses to the consultation on the dr aft NPPF are being considered, and we will await the outcome before consider ing this recommendation further. Agricultural labour UK and European Union (EU) citizens in seasonal work 4.49 We recommend that the Departme nt for Work and Pensions (DWP) adapts the benefit system to reduce fi nancial disincentives (such as loss of benefits) for the unemployed to undertake seasonal work . We recommend that the agricultural industry improves its collective communication strategy to encourage greater take up of seasonal work by EU citi zens, particularly students . Yes We have already taken a number of measures to provide improved employment support and financial incentives to work. In particular the Universal Credit system which aims to be introduced from 2013, will improve incentives to work (especially for low earners) by ensuring that people are better off for each hour that they work and every pound they earn. We would welcome any initiatives from the industry to encourage greater take up of seasonal agricultural work by the EU workforce. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 48 Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) 4.54 We urge the Home Office to introduce a replacement for the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme to enable workers from pros pective accession states to provide seasonal labour for UK agriculture and horticulture . Under consideration We have announced that the SAWS will continue for 2012 and 2013 in its current form and at the maintained quota level of 21,250. Defra, the Home Office and other Government departments with an interest will consider options for addressing seasonal labour needs beyond 2013. In order to inform this c onsideration, the Home Office intends to commission advice from the independent Migrat ion Advisory Committee on the issue. Gangmasters licensing scheme 4.60 We urge those leading the review to consider our recommendations as a means of reducing the burden of admini stration and inspection when enforcing workplace rights . Communications and perceptions 4.62 We recommend that the GLA [Gangmasters Licensing Authority] continues to work with the National Farmers Union (N FU) and other representatives of labour users to lead drafting of future guidance specific to labour users. In line with our strategic recommendation (paragraphs 2.18 19), we recommend that the GLA and NFU jointly own this guidance . 4.63 To improve its relationships with the farm ing and horticultural industry, we recommend that the GLA should better co mmunicate its priorities (enforcement against rogue gangmasters) and furt her engage with labour users on its enforcement approach. Inspections and enforcement 4.64 We welcome the GLA's pilot [ to test lighter-touch regulation in the forestry sector] , and recommend that it be ext ended to low-risk activities in farming and growing. 4.65 We believe that the GLA should move its inspection regime to a more targeted, risk-based approach using th e principles of ear ned recognition. 4.66 We recommend that the GLA ensures that its inspectors are clear as to the guidelines that are in place when conducting inspections . Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 49 4.67 We recommend that the GLA explor es further alternative means of interviewing gang workers without disrupt ing farm businesses as far as possible and without adversely affecting its abilit y to identify worker exploitation. 4.69 We recommend that the GLA and trade asso ciations should work together to better communicate the advantages of a labour user voluntarily registering on the GLA website as a labour user . We also recommend that the GLA make clear that labour users that voluntarily register on the website are at no higher risk of inspection than if they do not register. An alternative to licensing 4.70 We recommend that Defra explores the co sts and benefits of a 'registration and enforcement' model as an alternati ve way of delivering desired outcomes. Yes The Government's Red Tape Challenge process has endorsed the need for the GLA to enforce protection for vulnerable workers in its sectors. The Gove rnment will continue to look at what more the GLA needs to do to tackle the non-compliant, while reducing unnecessary burdens on the comp liant, and any legal changes needed to support this. Any future approach will be reviewed as part of the Red Tape Challenge process. The GLA will also be monitored under the Government's ongoing review of public bodies and enforcement agencies. As a result of the recommendations by the Task Force the GLA will also: issue new guidance to its inspectors by April 2012 and will look at its approach to minimising disruption when interviewing gang workers on a case-by-case basis. The GLA's website already has a new page providing information specifically for labour users; look at ways to work cl oser with labour user repres entatives and labour users, including establishing user groups, during spring 2012; communicate its priorities across its whole remit of fish processing, shellfish, meat, dairy and food processing, during the summer 2012. In addition, the GLA is running a Forestry Pilot Scheme on the scope for using an earned recognition approach to licensing for forestry operators, including dispensing with an Application Inspection, and at how this might be applied more widely across its regulated sectors. The GLA will introduce changes by September 2012. We will also respond in detail to the Forestry Regulati on Task Force's report by March. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 50 Transport Trailer licences 4.74 We recommend that the DVLA introduces an exemption from the B and E category licence requirement for vehicles u sed for agriculture, horticulture and forestry . The driver licensing requirements for towing trailers contained in the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 implement ve ry clear requirements in EU law. Whilst experienced tractor drivers who are subject to this requirement may consider it as unnecessary, it is a one-off test. There wil l be few opportunities to amend this EU legislation in the near future. However, new driving licence holders with category F entitlement still do not have to ta ke separate tests to operate trac tors with trailers or other equipment, although it is adv isable that they receiv e appropriate training. Weight/speed restrictions for trailers 4.77 In the light of the size/needs of mode rn farm machinery, we recommend that Department for Transport (DfT) amends the 1986 regulations, making the following changes: the maximum speed limit for tr actors should be aligned with the rest of the EU at 40 km/h; the maximum weights of trailers and combinations are increased from 18.29 tonnes and 24.39 tonnes to 21 tonnes and 31 tonnes respectively. We appreciate that, due to other legislation, any machin ery of this weight would be required to be registered with an appropriate scheme to ensure roadworthiness. We understand that such a scheme is being developed by the industry in partnership with the DfT. Under consideration We will engage with industry organisations to consider how these recommendations might be taken forward. Maintaining high standards of road safety is of key importance, whilst permitting farmers to take full advantage of modern equipment. Whilst it might be possible to allow increases in trailer and combination we ights, there must be a robust mechanism to ensure that such combinations are roadworthy. The speed issue needs careful consideration, including where tractors are capable of exceeding 40km/ h. We will consider both of these issues while also taking account of developments in construction standards in the EU Regulation for the approval of agricul tural and forestry vehicles. Any proposals to change would be subject to normal regulator y process including public consultation. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 51 Forklift testing 4.79 We recommend that the relevant training guidance or application form from the certification body makes this clear [that there is no requirem ent for forklift drivers to take a retest within a certain time limit, instead the onus is on the employer to assess staff and decide whether refresher training should take place] to test candidates booking a forklift-driver training and certification te st. We also recommend refresher courses for all forklift drivers from time to time. Yes Guidance on the training required for lift tr uck operators is covered in the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Approved Code of Pr actice (ACOP) \"Rider-operated training\" reference L117. The ACOP covers refresher training. The guidance states that there is no specific requirement for refresher training after set intervals but points out that lift truck operator s need to be re-assessed from time to time to ensure that they continue to operate lift trucks safely. All HSE ACOPs and guidance (incl uding L117) are to be reviewed this year as set out in the Government's response to the Lofstedt review of health and safety legislation. We will take this opportunity to review the guidance on refresher training to make it clearer. Health and safety 4.83 We urge farmers to remember the HSE message \"Make the promise: come home safe\" and increase their professionalis m in awareness of health and safety issues . Yes We agree with this recommendation. Health and Safety in the farming industry remains a key issue given the accident rate for the industry remains unacceptably high. Tenancy issues Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 4.85 We think there should be consider ation of a less costly approach [to solving disputes which arise withi n agricultural tenancies] . In particular this should allow the parties to a Tenancy Agreement to contract out of the arbitration provisions within the existing legislation and to opt for di sputes to be settled by an Independent Expert where the matter does not relate to a notice to quit. Yes The Tenancy Reform Industry Group agrees that this is an area of tenancy legislation which should be examined with a view to reform. As a first step, we have asked the Group Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 52 to consider the issues more fully and to report back to Ministers with clear recommendations. Changes to agricultural tenancy legislation would be required to implement this recommendation and this wil l depend upon a suitable legislative vehicle and Parliamentary time. Agricultural (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations 1973 4.86 We recommend that Defra invites th e Tenancy Reform Industry Group to undertake such a review [of the Agricultural Regulations] . Yes These Regulations are outdated and we have asked the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to carry out a review and report back to Ministers.Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 53 Part 5 Paperwork Principles of paperwork Government and industry should design forms in partnership 5.07 We recommend that for every new administ rative burden, Defra, its agencies and delivery partners, and industry should collectively engage a sample of ordinary working farmers to help design the form/record/plan . Yes We are developing new principles for pr oducing guidance and forms which we will publish/put into operation by Ma y 2012, and which will commit us to involving farmers and other stakeholders in producing forms wherever this is appropriate. For more information on this, see the paperwork plan 11. As a response to the Task Force recommen dations, Defra and its agencies are already working in partnership on developing forms, re cords, plans and other paperwork, as set out in our paperwork plan. For example, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) set up a Farmer Panel to provide independent views and insight from up to 1000 farmers. The RPA used the Panel to review the draft 2010 Single Payment Sc heme (SPS) Claim Form and Handbook. In response, the form was changed to allow customer details to be manually changed on the form (rather than requiri ng farmers to tel ephone the Agency) and subsequent versions of the guidanc e used more helpful language. A new approach to data collection th at improves the efficiency of its supply, capture and use 5.09 We recommend that, before soliciting data, Government asks itself whether it really needs the information. The question shoul d be 'do we really need this information in order to co mply with legislation?' not 'would the information be useful?' Responses to recommendations 5.09 - 5.13 are together, see 5.13. 5.10 We recommend that regulators do not coll ect the same data twice where this can be avoided. We recommend that Go vernment agencies endeavour to join up their information-gathering wherever possible . 5.11 We recommend that regulators do not collect superfluous data . 11 http://archive.defra.gov.uk/f ood-farm/farm-manage/documents/fa rm-reg-paperwork -plan-dec2011.pdf Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 54 5.12 To reduce burdens on farmers, we recommend that there should be a presumption that regulators share data except where they are not legally or technologically able to do so. We recommend that regulators make clear to farmers who their data is being shared with and o ffer farmers the opportunity to 'opt in' to data-sharing between Defra and other regulators. 5.13 We recommend that regulators demonstrat e sensitivity to sectoral calendars when issuing requests for data. Yes We are responding to these recommendations by developing ways of capturing and using data more efficiently. We ar e, right now, working closely with the Environment Agency (EA), RPA, Natural England (NE) and Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), Food Standards Agency (FSA), Local Authorities, the National Farmers Union (NFU) and, most importantly, farmers themselves, to bu ild a comprehensive evidence base of what farmers are asked to do to meet both regulatory and non-regulatory requirements, and in particular what they feel are the most s uperfluous and/or onerous requests for information. We will have completed this work by spring 2012 and will use it to help us make changes to stop collecting unnecessary information, avoid duplication of requests, and see where we can share data more e ffectively. Data sharing is a key part of reducing the burden of information requests. We already share some data (see example in the box below) but we need to do this more often and more ef fectively. In light of the Task Force's findings, we are already tryi ng to share more data between different agencies as outlined in the cases below: Case 1 : NE and the EA have started to work on sharing data on Environmental Stewardship Schemes. The EA have asked for greater access to this information for use in their risk assessment proce ss. We are working with our lawyers and both agencies to establish whether sharing this data is legally possible and, if so, how we can overcome any technical or logistical difficulties to ens ure that the information can be shared securely. We will have a response to these questions by spring 2012 and hope to have data sharing underway by autumn 2012. Case 2: The EA asked for data held by Defra from the Agricultural Survey in June, to assist with risk assessment. We investigated whether this was possible, and found that while we can share the information for analytic al purposes, it cannot be used directly for inspections or enforcement at the moment. We are worki ng with our lawyers to see how we can adapt the way we collect this informa tion so that it can be used for these purposes in future. In the interim, we are making this data available to the EA who are using it to target their mail shots and to identify trends or pressures in a particular catchment. The Task Force also asked us to invite fa rmers to agree that their data will be shared between regulators. Anecdotally it seems that there is s upport for this within the farming industry, and an understanding that without it we will be unable to maximise the potential of earned recognition. As mentioned in our in terim response, we are working with the NFU to produce a single data protection statement which may make it easier to share Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 55 information between us and our delivery agents in the future. We are examining data protection legislation and look ing at how we can assure farmers that information about them is being handled appropriately. We will do all we can to make sure data can be shared efficiently and effectively. We will provide an update on this work in th e six month paperwork action plan progress report. Existing data sharing practice Livestock Holdings AHVLA have recently developed a new geospatial IT application to help better understand the spread of land making up livestock holdings in England. The 'CPH viewer' has been developed using information already held by the AHVLA and plotting this together with data on land holding held by the RPA. This application will help AH VLA in its day-to-day activities and also to support work during a disease outbreak, which will help us minimise the spread of disease and protect livestock. Customer and Land Data We manage CLAD, a database which provid es Customer and Land Data to support evidence-based policy development and to make operational decisions. The current service provides access to RPA's customer and land data for specific business purposes. It also receives and stores data from the Welsh Government and the Forestry Commission. Since 2008 we have arranged and managed data sharing agreements between the RPA and organisations requiring access. We also facilitate access for individual users, which means that contractors for those or ganisations can also use the information. CLAD data has been used, for example, to manage disease outbreaks and for epidemiological studies by science agencies, helping farmers to keep their livestock and crops healthy by containing the spread of disease and enabling us to research preventive measures. We are currently working with the Welsh Gove rnment to put in place a data sharing agreement which will mean that we can share CLAD information with different organisations without having to construct i ndividual agreements. We will have this agreement in place by April 2012 and we are working to give the Welsh Government access to the AHVLA CPH vi ewer by the same date. 5.14 We recommend that trade associations encourage their members to submit data electronically. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 56 We support this principle; we want trade a ssociations to encourage their members, and individuals to choose electronic options. We will support trade associations and individual farmers and customers in this. See the response to recommendation 2.43 for more information on our approach to electronic and online services. 5.15 We recommend that regulators investigat e alternative means of gathering data that do not impinge on farmers . Yes We will look at alternative, less burdensome ways to collect data. In response to the Task Force recommendati ons, in December 2011 we set up a pilot project to look at data sharing between Defr a agencies. This will help support better data sharing in the future and could minimise t he need for some data to be collected. We are working closely with industry representatives on this project which will run until spring 2012 (see responses to recommendations 5.09 - 5.13, and the Paperwork Plan for more general information on data collection.) We have already reduced the impact of data co llection on farmers by, for example, using remote sensing and aerial photography to mainta in the Rural Land Register. This allows the number of physical inspections to be re duced, while still meeting the regulatory requirements. This means that for many cust omers all they will know of a remote sensing inspection is a letter informing them that t he inspection has been completed and there is no action for them. Looking further ahead, we are exploring the potent ial for digital maps and geographic information services (GIS) to offer new interactive ways of exchanging data and communicating with farmers. We see the development of GIS capability as one key elements of the 'digital by default' approach. An aspiration that paperwork b ecomes 'digital by default' 5.17 We recommend that Defra and industr y set a joint vision of making all paperwork available for electronic comp letion and online submission. As the Farming Theme of Business Link (paragraph 2.38 40) expands in membership, it should become the default means through which farmers can store and submit forms electronically. Yes The Government as a whole is moving to provid ing services \"digitally-by-default\" and plans to launch a single Government website in late 2012. This will replace the current Direct Gov and Business Link platforms. The Farming Theme currently located on the Business Link site will also transfer ov er to the new platform. The new platform will eventually be the single access point to all Government se rvices, including for all the guidance and services that farmers need. This will make it eas ier for them to find this information so that Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 57 they can do business more efficiently. See the response to recommendation 2.43 for more information on our approach to electronic and online services. We have been working to move form filling online across Defra and the agencies; details of what we are doing are set out in our paperwork plan12. For example, the RPA has made significant progress in encouraging onli ne applications for the SPS with a third of customers now claiming online. The online cattle tracing system (CTS) provided by the RPA's British Cattle Movements Service no w has approximately 37,000 regular users (UK wide): about 45% of UK cattle farmers are now reporting births, deaths and movements online. Reviewing the requirements to produce plans 5.19 We recommend that Defra/regulators revi ew the requirements on farmers to complete plans. Yes We will review requirements to complete pl ans as we prepare for implementing the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) (post 2013), and during t he detailed design of CAP 2013 schemes. However, good planning often makes good busine ss sense. For example, we think that nutrient management planning is essential to help farmers maximi se yields and to balance the benefits of nutrient use against the cost s, both economic and environmental, to the farmer as well as to society in general. We want all farmers to a dopt comprehensive good nutrient management, alongside other good farming pr actice. Our view is that nutrient management planning should be standard practice fo r all farms where fertilisers, manures, slurries, composts, or other sources of nutri ents are being applied. They are essential tools for keeping track field by field of nutri ent inputs and outputs, so il test data, and other relevant information, allowing farmers to note what they have done in the past and to plan appropriately for futu re farm management. Improving guidance 5.21 We recommend that Government considers ways to improve co-ordination of related guidance and the frequency with which it is made or changed. Yes We will minimise the number of changes and updates to guidance we provide, to reduce the amount of time businesses have to s pend familiarising themselves with new paperwork and processes. 12 http://archive.defra.gov.uk/food farm/farm manage/documents/farm regpaperwork plandec2011.pdf Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 58 We will develop new principles for producing gui dance and forms, which will include co- ordinating revisions to guidance through ex isting reviews. New guidance tends to be published in the run up to the two annual common commencement dates, in April and October, when regulations are generally ma de or revised. Sometimes it may be necessary to amend or update guidance or forms quickly, and it may not be possible or appropriate to co-ordinate (or delay) a revi sion. We will continue to discuss any changes with stakeholders before they are formally consulted so there should be no surprises for the farming sector. We are increasing the amount of guidance provided in digita l and online formats as these give better opportunities to ma ke sure that farmers are onl y alerted to changes that are relevant to them, and make it easier for farmers to tailor guidanc e to their specific needs. For example, we have recently introduced t he Cross Compliance Guidance Search Tool on the business link farming theme to help farmers quickly identify and filter the cross compliance requirements that apply to their business. The tool can be accessed via www.businesslink.gov.uk/defra-farming-online . 5.22 Where guidance document relate to rule changes, we recommend that they provide upfront a short, 'quick-start' guide on how rules have changed. We suggest that guidance documents should be as shor t as possible; page numbers in single figures if possible! Yes We are developing new principles for produc ing guidance and forms which will come into force by May 2012, which will include producing \"Quick Start\" guides to documents, and keeping guidance documents c oncise and targeted. Summary of regulation-specific paperwork recommendations Nitrate Regulations 5.23 We recommend that: the review of the Nitrat e Regulations significantl y reduces the paperwork, including the need for detailed plans and maps; it is necessary to keep a record only of the amount of nitrogen applied per field in organic and inorganic form. Where a farmer has a more detailed nutrient management plan, they could earn the ri ght to be less frequently inspected as part of an earned-recognition approach; the Farming Theme of Business Link is expanded to enable farmers to submit electronic copies of nutrient management plans online. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 59 farmers can apply for a derogation fr om the 170 kg/ha whole-farm nitrogen loading limit through the SPS claim, rather than submitting a separate application; a new calculation for NMax should be requi red only when a significant change in farming practice takes place, or unl ess the fertiliser recommendations13 change substantially; and organic and low-intensity farming systems are exempted from record-keeping requirements under this regime. See responses to recommendations 6.16 - 6.22. Environmental permitting 5.24 We recommend that: the environmental permitting applicat ion form and accompanying charging note should be tailored to th e agricultural sector; the EA should allow and encourage permit applications to be completed online; See responses to recommendations 6.61-6.62. Single Payment Scheme and cross compliance 5.25 We recommend: that the Soil Protection Review becom es voluntary and be used in earned recognition (with [Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition] (GAEC) 1 itself being reframed as a 'duty of care'); removing crop codes from th e SPS form where possible; extending the SPS-application window so th at forms can be submitted from the beginning of January; changing the entitlements form to includ e an option which allo ws RPA to rotate the entitlements so they remain viable; that in cases of dual claims, the RPA giv es farmers the option to forward their personal details to the other claimant; that the RPA should return to its previ ous pragmatic approach to 'obvious errors' on SPS forms; that the RPA should introduce a system of fixed-date replies throughout any appeals process. See responses to recomm endations 7.45 to 7.64. 13 Fertiliser recommendations as contained in the Defra 'Fertiliser Manual' (RB209). Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 60 Livestock movements and farmed animals 5.26 We recommend: increasing the use of electronic reporting for livestock movements; reviewing information in cattle passports , herd books, flock registers and the fallen stock register to ensure that information is provided only where necessary and in a way consistent with normal farming practice . See responses to recommendations 8.12 - 8.14. Food chain information 5.27 We recommend that existing informa tion from contractual arrangements between producers and slaughterhouses, a nd/or farm assurance schemes, should replace the need for food chain information requirements . See response to recommendation 10.39. Agricultural and other surveys Agricultural surveys 5.30 We urge Defra to continue lobbying the [European Union] EU over the size and extent of the [agricultural] surveys. We recommend that Defra integrates into its negotiations the new approach for data co llection that we outline in paragraphs 5.0815. Yes Surveys are important: Defra's statistical su rveys are used widely by Government and the industry in developing policy (f or example to measure the im pact of the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, or to influence the dire ction of CAP reform) and to improve the functioning of the market (such as by making timely information available on the supply and use of key crops). However, we believe that the size and ex tent of the surveys required by the EU is in excess of that needed by Government and industry. I n response to the Task Force recommendations we have stepped up our lobbying of the EU on the development of farm surveys after 2013, where we are cont ributing to a Commission-led Task Force. The UK is leading one of the sub-groups (comprising representatives from half a dozen Member States and European Commission officials from the statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat), and the Directorates-General for Agriculture and Environment (DG Agri and DG Environment)) looking at new data needs. By engaging early and constructively we hope to infl uence the EU to incl ude smaller and cheaper surveys, with a greater focus on the key policy questions, as part of a new Regulation. We will also encourage the Commission to join up its data needs across the various domains (statistics, disease control, CAP reporting, etc.) to avoid dup lication and incons istencies. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 61 5.31 We recommend that the June survey is comple ted entirely online, using information that applicants are already providing for the SPS forms. Yes We will aim to maximise the number of farmers who complete the June Survey electronically through Farming Online, and in futu re the GDS platform. We have already put in place measures to increase take-up, wit h 8,500 (9% of the total) providing electronic responses to the Census in 2010 and 8,800 (41%) to the much smaller 2011 survey. We intend to obtain an even higher proportion of responses through Farming Online in 2012 by making online completion of the survey t he default option. We will also work closely with the Industry-Government Group being set up to advise on how to help farmers move online and how other businesses can provide online support services to farmers. However, we cannot use data from SPS forms di rectly to replace June Survey responses as less than 5% of the items we ask for on the June Survey are collected through the SPS. To meet EU regulations, and the information needs of stakeholders and policy makers, we require data on the areas of individual crops gr own. This information allows us to, for example, produce the cereal balance sheets t hat are used by the industry (often via the HGCA) to inform planting decisions and market prices. This data is not collected through the SPS form and it would be inefficient to intr oduce it. The overall burden on farmers will be lower from small, targeted, surveys than from a blanket approach to collecting detailed data from all SPS claimants. However, we will ensure that the data collected through the SPS and statistical surveys is as integrated as possible following any changes to the monitoring and evaluation of the C AP prompted by upcoming reforms. Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) surveys 5.33 We recommend that Fera continues to make the best use of online and electronic tools to reduce the time it takes farmers to complete surveys. Yes Fera will continue to maximise the use of online and electronic tools, including email and farm management software, as well as posted records and telephone calls, to reduce the amount of farmers' time the Pesticide Usage Surveys (PUS) occupy. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 63 Part 6 Environment and land management Introduction 6.04 We recommend that, through the [Natural Environment White Paper] ( NEWP ), Defra sets out a framework to deliver better integrated and prioritised environmental messages to farmers and their advisers. Yes We agree that the current environmental mess ages given to farmers and advisers can be confusing because of: cumulative environmental regulations wit h sometimes overlapping requirements and high level of process - for example paperwork, records and calculations, and; different messages about envir onmental priorities that farmers and advisers receive from multiple sources. We will integrate and prioritise environment al messages for farmers and advisers by tackling the causes of the current confusion. Environmental regulations : Environmental regulations gener ally exist for good reason. Nevertheless we are continuing, through the Red Tape Challenge particularly, to look for opportunities for reform to make it easier and cheaper for business to protect essential ecosystem services. However, there are ca ses where environmental goals overlap, such as with the Nitrates and Water Framework Direc tives. Our respon se to recommendation 6.34 describes how we are addressing this. El sewhere in this response we have set out how we will address burdensome paperwork and implement a more risk-based approach to inspections. Environmental messages : Before we can integrate and prioritise the environmental messages that farmers and their advisers re ceive, we all need to agree on our key environmental priorities. We are working with delivery partners and key stakeholders to agree a list of priority environmen tal outcomes. We will also i dentify the actions we want farmers to focus on and develop clear messages to explain what we need to achieve. We have taken a strong first step towards defin ing more clearly the things farmers can do to help deliver these priority environmental outc omes. An indicative list is attached in the box below. The list contains a mixture of actions that farme rs may currently consider when meeting the requirements of existing regulations (such as under the Nitrates, Water Framework and Habitats Directives), incent ivised schemes (such as Entry and Higher Level Stewardship schemes) and voluntary initiatives (s uch as the industry-led Greenhouse Gas Action Plan). These types of actions can be beneficial to a farmer's business with regard to productivity and efficien cy, as well as beneficial for soil, air, water quality and basic land management for biodiversity purposes. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 64 Indicative list of key on-farm actions benefi cial to both the farming business and the environment Manage nutrient requirements of crops Use nutrients efficiently i.e. when crops most need it and/or at times least likely to waste benefits through losses by diffuse pollution to air, soil and water. For example; o do not over-apply organic or inorganic fe rtilisers (e.g. test soils to assess nutrient requirements and test sl urries for nutrient content); o incorporate nutrients quickly to soil (to avoid gaseous losses of nutrients); o use appropriate (e.g. band spreaders or injection for slurry) and calibrated spreading equipment; o use non-urea based fertilisers to hel p reduce ammonia emissions. Where urea fertilisers are used, use with urease inhibitors; and o ensure adequate storage for slurry and manure, and cover stores where possible. Protect agricultural soil Identify the risks of soil erosion, com paction and loss of soil organic matter and put in place appropriate measures to mitigat e these risks (e.g. implementing a soil management plan). For example: o reduce risk of soil erosion and runoff by water; o prevent and relieve soil compaction due to cultivations and mechanical damage. Manage water resources and watercourses Manage drainage and overflows; Manage water resources; Reduce direct impact of livestock on waterc ourses (to avoid direct defecation into water and erosion), for example fence off access to water cour ses and riverbanks; Use, site and manage buffer strips (also has significant benefits for biodiversity). Manage Pests Store, use and dispose of Pesticides in compliance with conditions of use and the principles of good plant protection practice; Increase awareness and use of Integrated Pest Management. Maintain and Enhance Landscapes and Biodiversity Increase awareness of biodiversity and landscape assets and how to improve their resilience to threats e.g. climate change, invasive species; Maintain and enhance historic features, woods and habitats including hedges, walls and longer-term uncultivated habitats (suc h as flower-rich habitats), seed-rich habitats and in-field features (such as conservation headlands) that support beneficial insects, farmland birds and other wildlife and which add to the distinctiveness of local landscapes; Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 65 Work with neighbouring lando wners to improve the condition of habitats that straddle farm boundaries and help connec t those that span a landscape; Contribute to the delivery of local plans for the natural environment, including those for landscapes, biodiversity and green infrastructure; Keep public rights of way unobstructed and convenient to use, and stiles and gates in good order. Never plough field edge paths and quickly restore any cross-field path you do plough. When this list is further developed it will prov ide a starting point for us, our delivery partners and advisory networks to simplify and prioritise environmental messages to farmers which help meet national priorities. However, this is onl y part of the way forward. It is clear from our discussions with delivery partners and stakeholders that the other key to achieving integrated and prioritised environ mental messages is to enable the farmers to work together on a local scale to tailor environmental messages. Experience suggests that significant progress can be made where the local farming community works closely with environmental agencies and or ganisations to solve local problems. We want to build on this so that messages can be tailored to be relevant to local and national environmental priorities. We are working in partnership with deliv ery partners, advisers and farming and environmental stakeholders to develop a framewor k that will enable delivery of integrated and prioritised environmental messages on a lo cal scale. We will do this through a review of existing advice and inc entives (see box below). Projects delivering a locali sed approach to simplifying and prioritising environmental messages Review of Advice and Incentives We are reviewing existing advice and incentives and approaches taken under voluntary and industry-led schemes (s uch as the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, which often work on a local sca le) with a view to simplifying current schemes to enable clearer communication of environmental priorities and advice on a local scale. This review, which will report in late 2012, will build on the work of the Integrated Advice Pilot (IAP) and initia l work carried out to define priority environmental outcomes and the national le vel actions (Box A). Integrated Advice Pilot (IAP) The aim of the Integrated Advice Pilo t is to develop a novel farmer-focused approach to the delivery of flexible, int egrated advice that balances farm business objectives with Government policy objective s and integrates measures to achieve multiple benefits. An ADAS led consorti um is undertaking the pilot which started in February 2011 and is due to conclude in March 2012. This aims to produce sector specific integrated advice, flexible advisor y protocols, a training course and to agree Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 66 a legacy for the pilot. We will use the findings of this pilot in the review of advice, incentives and voluntary initiatives (as above). The Nitrates and Water Framework Directives Package of recommendations 6.15 We recommend that farmers use initia tives such as the Campaign for the Farmed Environment to encourag e water protection measures. Yes We are working on providing clearer guidance for farmers on the basic measures required to safeguard local water quality, to coincide with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and associated Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) arrangements for 2014. This will be informed by the Catchment Ba sed Approach (as set out in 6.34). This will help ensure that the farmi ng community understands its res ponsibility to reduce diffuse pollution from agriculture and takes advantage of schemes, such as the Campaign for the Farmed Environment or the Catc hment Sensitive Farming initia tive, that help inform them of how they can undertake on-farm measures. It is also Government's role to ensure that there are consistent messages about water protection measures and measures for other environmental priorities, across Government -led/partnership schemes (see the response to recommendation 6.04). Record-keeping and calculations 6.16 We recommend that the review of the Nitrate Regulations significantly reduces the paperwork, including the need for detailed plans and maps. It should also reduce the complex calculations required of farmers, particularly in relation to manure and slurry. Responses to recommendations 6.16-6.20 are t ogether; see 6.20 6.17 In terms of compliance, we believe it is necessary to have only a record of the amount of nitrogen applied per fiel d in organic and inorganic form. In line with our earned recognition proposals (paragraph 3.23), where farmers have a detailed nutrient management plan we recommend that they could earn the right to be less frequently inspected. 6.18 We recommend that the Farming Theme of Business Link should be expanded to enable farmers to submit electronic copies of nutrient management plans online. To complement this, we re commend that Defra, the [Environment Agency] EA and trade associations jointly en courage better take-up of PLANET, the Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 67 Defra-developed nutrient management software that helps with doing the calculations and keeps records. 6.19 We recommend that this application fo r a derogation could be incorporated into the [Single Payment Scheme] ( SPS) claim, with the [Rural Payments Agency] (RPA) then sharing this information with the EA14. 6.20 We recommend that a new NMax calcula tion should be required only when a significant change in farming pract ice takes place, or the fertiliser recommendations15 change substantially. Under consideration as part of the curr ent Nitrates Consultation (launched on 20 December and due to close on 16 March 2012). We agree that the Nitrates Regulations 16 are more prescriptive on a number of the planning and record-keeping provisions than is necessary. We have put forward some concrete proposals to address this point and other recommendations of the Task Force in the current Nitrates Consultation17, published on 20 December 2011 and closing on 16 March 2012. We will ensure that Nmax18 calculations are required only when there is a risk of the limits being breached (recommendation 6.20). These and other changes being brought about through the Nitrates Consultation will take effect from 1 January 2013 or later, depending on the complexity of the issues. We agree that good nutrient management is part of standard good farming practice. It helps maximise profits and minimise the env ironmental impact of fa rming. Indeed, we believe that all farms should manage their nutrients well. This does not mean that all farms need highly detailed plans, but the evidence of the 2011 Farm Practices Survey shows that almost two farmers in every five do not have a nutrient management plan of any sort. This suggests that a significant proportion of the industry needs to improve its nutrient planning. We will ther efore continue to work with the EA and trade associations to encourage greater uptake of PLANET and ot her nutrient management tools, and will provide free expert advice to farmers and l and managers on nutrient management issues via the new Farming Advice Service (recommendation 6.18). We will not remove the requirement in the Nitrates Regulations for farmers in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) to have a nitr ate fertilisation plan (recommendation 6.16) because this is a requirement of the Nitrates Directive. However, we accept that it is not for the Government to dict ate exactly how plans and records should be kept and we will continue to leave it to farmers how they fulf il this requirement. We want fertilisers to be 14 We recognise that this is reliant on the EU granting a further derogation. 15 Fertiliser recommendations as contained in the Defra 'Fertiliser Manual' (RB209). 16 Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008, as amended by the Nitrate Pollution Prevention (Amendment) Regulations 2009 17 The Nitrates consultation can be found at http://www.defra.gov.uk/consult/2011/12/20/nitrates-directive/ 18 Nmax is the maximum amount of nitrogen permitted to be applied to a crop in a twelve month period. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 68 applied to crops when they need it, in the quantities required and in compliance with the Nitrates rules: farmers need to be able to dem onstrate when asked t hat this is happening. We are consulting on how to reflect earned recognition in the planning and record-keeping aspects of the Nitrates Regulations (recommendat ions 6.17 and 6.18) in practice and will discuss this with industry experts at a works hop in late February 2012. We are uncertain whether submitting nutrient management plan s online (recommendatio n 6.18) would prove cost-beneficial - we will do some further analysis - but believe we can probably take a step in the direction of reducing inspection rates where quality plans have been made (recommendation 6.17). We will report on progre ss in the Government's response to the Nitrates Consultation. Exemptions for organic and lo w-intensity farming systems 6.21 We recommend that if an organic farmer in an NVZ is fully certified by a relevant organic certification body, the organic land should be assumed to be compliant with the Nitrate Re gulations and the farmer should not have to carry out the additional record-keeping. Responses to recommendations 6. 21 and 6.22 are together; see 6.22. 6.22 We recommend that the Government takes a lighter-touch approach to record-keeping for low-intensity farms wi thin an NVZ. We propose that the forthcoming Nitrate Regul ations exempt these farms from the record-keeping requirements. We recommend that farmers s hould either complete a self-declaration or use an accredited adviser to claim this exemption. Under consideration, as part of the curr ent Nitrates Consultation (launched on 20 December and due to close on 16 March 2012). We are considering exemptions from the need to keep specific NVZ records for two categories of enterprise: The organic farming sector. It seems lik ely that the records required under the organics rules would also provide assurance of compliance with the NVZ rules. We are reviewing this during the Nitrates consultation, and provided our analysis shows that the organics standard does provide the assurances the Government needs, we propose to exempt certified organic farms from separate record-keeping requirements. Further to this, through the Nitrates Cons ultation we have asked the industry to propose other ce rtification or assurance schemes that would also provide sound evidence of compliance with the Nitrates rules without the need for some or all of the current Nitrates records. Low intensity and small farms. We have set out proposals in the Nitrates Consultation to exempt farms where the fa rming system is extensive, and where we Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 69 can be confident that the Nitrates rules would not be breached. In such cases keeping records would not provide any ex tra environmental prot ection. For small farms, we believe that the cost of keepi ng records may also be disproportionate to the environmental benefit. We are therefore seeking views on whether such an exemption would be workable an d what definition of \"small\" would be appropriate. Review of rules for the use of organic materials with lo w readily available nitrogen 6.23 We recommend that Defra revises the rules to allow for higher limits on the nitrogen content of slow release nitroge n organic materials under the Nitrate Regulations . Under consideration as part of the curr ent Nitrates Consultation (launched on 20 December and due to close on 16 March 2012). We accept this recommendation and we are c onsulting on two options to address it. We propose to allow the application of either 500 Kg/ha of total N in any 2 year period or 1000 Kg/ha of total N in any 4 year period. Because only a very small proportion of the nitrogen in compost is readily available, this would allow the use of composts as mulches and soil conditioners without introducing an unacceptable risk of nitrate leaching to water. This is in line with evidence put forwar d by the top fruit sector. Recommendations for long-term change 6.26 So, in the long term, we would li ke to see measures to address nitrate pollution integrated within river basin ma nagement planning and delivery. We hope that, over the next five years, a catchment-based approach to managing all the pressures on the water environment could be operational across England. Responses to recommendations 6.26, 6.30 and 6.34 are t ogether; see 6.34. Key actions needed to inte grate nitrate reduction with a catchment-based approach to nitrate pollution 6.30 We recommend that the farming industry works with others to roll out catchment-based projects to demonstrate th at nutrient pollution can be tackled locally and effectively. Responses to recommendations 6.26, 6.30 and 6.34 are t ogether; see 6.34. 6.33 We recommend that the minimum nati onal closed period for manure and slurry spreading and their storage arrangeme nts in NVZs should be looked at again and also made to reflect local differences. A zonal approach to these, such as in operation in Ireland, could be a useful model. We further thin k there is a case for Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 70 staggering the beginning and end of the cl osed periods so that farmers can make the best use of good weather to spread manure early or late. Under consideration as part of the curr ent Nitrates Consultation (launched on 20 December and due to close on 16 March 2012). We have put forward some proposals to implement this recommendation through the Nitrates consultation. This includes asking whether to include rain fall variation in the determination of closed periods (as this point has consistently been made by some in the industry). In response to the 2007 Nitrates consultation on this issue, stakeholders felt that the complexity of the rules to implement this out weighed the benefits. This tension remains. The existing closed periods already take into account farming system (arable or grassland) and soil type (light/sandy and others). In addition, to factor in rainfall and growing season would mean an absolute minimum of 16 different classifications of farms with up to 16 different closed periods. Our priority is to deliver a transparent and workable system as well as one which reflects the variation in the risk of nitrate leaching to water: there is a real and difficult balance to be made here. 6.34 We believe there would be a case for th e European Commission to look again at the provisions of the Nitrates Directive. Ideally we would like to see an integration of any revised measures unde r the Nitrates Directive wi th those of the Water Framework Directive in a way that minimises burdens, avoids duplication and preserves outcomes. Yes The Nitrates Directive should not be seen in isol ation from other environmental challenges and our goal is to look at the causes of, and measures to address, all sources of diffuse pollution in a more joined up way. The Water Framework Directive has the potential to achieve this as it takes a wider look at di ffuse pollution rather than focussing on a single issue such as nitrates. Tackling the various causes of diffuse polluti on from agriculture is a big and complex ask which needs to be addressed by both industry and Government. As a first step, we have established 25 pilot catchments that we will evaluate to inform the roll out of a wider catchment based approach to tackle diffuse pollution during 2013. Initially this will be over a limited number of catchm ents but the intention is to have these schemes nationwide. We will work in part nership with local stakeholders on these catchment scale operations to help ensure t hat local knowledge is used to drive change by: identifying and understanding issues within a particular catchment; involving local groups in decision making; Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 71 sharing evidence; identifying priorities for action; and seeking to deliver integrated interventions in cost effective ways that protect local resources. Once local issues are identified, we will provi de clear information to fa rmers (as in 6.15) on what measures they can implement in or der to tackle diffuse pollution and meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive and the Water Framework Directive. When we can show that farmer s are making real inroads into nitrate losses, through the action they are taking under the catchment ba sed approach, we will have a stronger case to put to the European Commission to convin ce them that a separate narrowly focussed Directive on Nitrates is no longer necessary. We are not currently in that position. While the Water Framework Directive is spec ifically addressing diffuse water pollution issues, some of the measures farmers can implement, such as good nutrient management, can also achieve multi-beneficial environmental outcomes i.e. in reducing GHG emissions. Therefore this work and that on integrating and prio ritising environmental messages, as set out in 6.04, will feed into each other. For information on the development of the approach and progression within the pilot catchments please visit the Envi ronment Agencies website at: http://www.environment- agency.gov.uk/research/planning/131506.aspx Managing water resources Water White Paper 6.37 We recommend that Defra take account of farmers as customers of the public water supply, as private water suppliers, as small scale abstractors of water, and take account of farms as a poten tial source of water stor age for agricultural and horticultural use. Yes We recognise the interests and importance of farmers, both as abstractors of water or private water suppliers and as customers of the public water supply. We will continue to work with the farming community, along with other stakeholders, as we develop policy for the long-term reform of the abstraction management system as suggested in the Water White Paper. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 72 Water abstraction: problems with licensing 6.40 We recommend the granting of longer wate r-abstraction licences, with further renewal being permitted as long as the condi tions are met. We also recommend that the EA do more to encourage the trading of abstracted water. Yes As the Task Force recognised, longer duration abstraction licences (24 years) are already granted by the EA as long as certain criteria are met. However demand for irrigation and water in general is expected to increase due to climate change, among other pressures. Simultaneously water availability is expect ed to increasingly fluc tuate and be lower. Increased abstraction alone will not solve the problem in the long term. In order to address current water pressures and to proacti vely prepare for the future, farmers must engage in a variety of actions to in crease their water resilience. We agree that trading of abstracted water is an important issue for farmers. The EA has just published new and clear rules that pres ume the trading of abstracted water should be allowed if there no risk of increasing environmental damage. The EA will improve market information to make it easier for willing buy ers and sellers to understand the potential value of their abstraction licences. By July 2012 it will publish (on the internet) data on water licences so that those interested in buy ing licences can approach potential sellers, encouraging the emergence of ma rket makers and brokers. We will encourage trading by increasing the volume of water that may be available to trade. The EA will examine lar ge unused licences to consider whether it should revoke the licence if the holder does not have a reasonable need for it. The EA will also identify a number of catchments wit h potential for increased trading. We will use this experience to help design a new abstraction regime more encouraging to trades. Avoiding summer abstraction - on farm reservoirs 6.43 Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, we recommend that Ministers set the threshold which triggers regist ration of reservoirs back to 25,000m3. Yes . Also see response to recommendation 4.18. We want to encourage fa rmers to build reservoirs to prov ide resilience during extended dry periods. But these structures must be si ted and built safely. We will not enact the provision in the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 to lower the threshold for the regulation of high risk reservoirs from 25, 000 to 10,000 cubic metres, unless evidence suggests there is a widespread and significant risk to life or property. We want to minimise the regulat ory uncertainty for farmers so t hat it is not a barrier to the construction of on-farm reservoirs. In cons ultation with industry, we will produce guidance for farmers in 2012/13 on how to build 'low risk' and therefore deregulated reservoirs. This Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 73 guidance should also reassure Local Planning Authorities as to the safety of on-farm reservoirs. There is nothing, however, to stop farmers building on-farm reservoirs now, particularly in light of an increasingly fluctuating and dimini shing water supply. EA experts are on hand to offer advice about positioning and the constr uction of a 'low risk' reservoir to ensure deregulation. Private Water Supply Regulations 2009 6.47 The [Food Standards Agency] FSA plans to issue guidance on the use of private water supplies, including use in dairy premises, whic h will clarify the requirements of relevant food hygiene le gislation and the relationship with the Private Water Supply Regulations. We recommend that the FSA acts promptly to issue this guidance. Recommendation for the FSA. The FSA has provided its own response which can be found at http://www.food.gov.uk/ Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 6.50 We recommend that the water industr y, through the Water Regulations Advisory Service, reviews its guidance for farms, in collaboration with relevant farming organisations to ensure that comp liance is cost effective, practical and relevant to risk. Yes We support this recommendation, and will engage with the Water Regulations Advisory Service and to encourage them to do so. Maintenance of seawalls and other coastal/fluvial assets 6.54 We recommend that Defra and the EA pr ess ahead with plans to streamline the consenting system [for seawalls and other coastal defences] . We also recommend that outdated byelaws are reviewed. The aim should be to move towards a more risk-based and easier to understand system wi th time-specific consents for routine maintenance operations. Yes We will continue streamlining the consenting system and moving towards a simple and risk-based system. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 74 In the next steps of the Penfold Re view, we have committed to expanding the Environmental Permitting programme (EPP). We will also include provisions in the Water Bill to allow for the framework to be expanded to include flood defence consents. We are currently considering integration of flood defence consents into the EPP. We want to reduce the burden on all applicants and regulat ors will target resources at higher risk activities. Our aim is to help streamlining, introduce a risk based approach to issuing permits and provide web based guidance to applic ants. We will review regional byelaws as part of work to integrate EA flood defence consents into the EPP. 6.55 We believe the EA should be required to actively encourage and facilitate the involvement of landowners who come forward with proposals to maintain defences that would otherwise not be maintained. Yes Where the EA no longer carry out maintenance wo rk at a specific location, we will discuss options for future maintenance with landowner s. We have also pr ovided online guidance to help landowners determine what, if anyth ing, would need consent. Consent is risk based, and when landowners require it, t he EA will provide further support and bespoke consent advice. Environmental Permitting Regulations: Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control and waste Overarching permitting issues 6.61 We recommend that the EA, working in partners hip with specialist trade associations, should: tailor the environmental permitting a pplication form and the accompanying charging note to the agricultural sector; identify a checklist of information th at needs to be submitted with each application; produce a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) note that sets out the service standards that farmers can expect; and produce guidance to help farmers best navigate the parallel planning and permitting processes; in order to ensure consistency and to make the processes expeditious, the EA should lead on aspects of applications covering local wildlife sites. Yes The EA agree that there is scope to improve design and usability of documents. They have developed an Action Plan to rationalise proc ess and paperwork. As part of this plan Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 75 the EA released an improved Environmental Permitting Charging Scheme Guidance document for all sectors in April 2011. The EA will also revise the Environment Permitting Regulations application forms for intensive pig and poultry businesses so there is a farm specific application form by July 2012. The forms will be revised using input from the Environment Permitting Regulations Industry liaison group which includes represent atives from Defra, Natural England (NE), the British Pig Executive (BPEX), the Nati onal Planning Authority (NPA), British Egg Information Service (BEIC) and the National Farmers Union (NFU) (for more information on this see the paperwork plan19). 6.62 We recommend that the EA should examine options for online [IPPC] permit applications. We recommend that the Farm ing Theme of Business Link (paragraphs 2.3840) should become the hub for regi stering exemptions and applying for permits. Farmers registering on this site should have simple waste exemptions and their waste-carrier registration registered automatically. Yes We support this recommendation and the EA will pr ovide the facility for permit applications to be completed online, through its Integrated Regulation programme. There are already links to the EA registration pages in the farmi ng section of Business Link, as well as EA guides on Business Link itself. Waste exemptions may also be regist ered online and the EA have already embedded these links on Business Link. The EA's Natio nal Permitting Service is exploring potential for other links from Business Link to the EA website. The EA will publish a short wast e exemptions guide in early 2012. This will link to the detailed guidance on the web pages as an interi m solution whilst a single consolidated exemption guidance document is finalised. Whether it is Bu siness Link, or its successor, we are committed to bringing together onli ne tools in one easy to find and easy to use place. Waste management 6.66 We recommend that waste regulations should be as light touch as possible, to grow trust with the industr y. We believe that a three -tier approach to regulation and exemptions is needed. Where appropria te, Defra may need to renegotiate the Waste Framewor k Directive [WFD] to achieve this. 19 http://archive.defra.gov.uk/f ood-farm/farm-manage/documents/fa rm-reg-paperwork -plan-dec2011.pdf Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 76 The WFD requires that all waste recovery and disposal operations be subject to a permit or the registration of an ex emption. This rule means a general licence is impossible without lengthy and difficult negotiations in Europe. Despite this we have implemented a three ti er system that makes permitting as risk-based as possible. This consists of waste exempt ions, which are valid fo r three years, standard permits and bespoke permits. We have also made extensive use, unlike most Member States, of the derogation permitted in the Direc tive allowing exemptions from the permitting requirement. In the short term, the EA wi ll continue developing standard pe rmits and where possible we will amend the current ex emptions to ensure they encourage low risk waste recovery and reuse of waste. Our aim will continue to be making regulation as light touch as possible. 6.67 We recommend that Defra and the EA should work with the farming industry to further develop national End-of-Waste Prot ocols for appropriate farm waste. We also endorse work by regulators to advise farmers of how they can best recover resources. Yes Quality Protocols lay out the ' end of waste' criteria for the production and use of a product from a specific waste type. These protocol s ensure that the WFD is upheld and that there is no need for waste management controls. We recognise the importance of these protocols and the opportunities they presen t, especially to the farming industry. We have already put 'end-of-waste' protocol s in place for compost and digestate from anaerobic digestion. We are continuing to invest igate suitable materials for generic 'end of waste' assessments, includi ng agricultural wastes or waste derived products for agricultural markets. Through the 'European Pathway to Zero Waste', the EA is also developing a protocol for meat and bone meal ash, which if successful will allow its use as a non-waste fertiliser. The EA has established a demons tration project called EQual (Ensuring Quality of Waste Derived Products). EQual will replace the EA 's Waste Protocols Pr ogramme this autumn, and is being run in partnership with Governm ent and industry, with industry taking greater ownership of the evidence gathering elements. 6.68 We believe that farmers should not be pe nalised by having to treat fly-tipped material as business waste. We recommend that the EA should reclassify fly-tipped material on farms as household waste, so th at farmers can dispo se of it at council waste sites at no cost. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 77 We recognise that fly-tipping continues to be a major and expensive frustration to many in the rural community, but allowi ng farmers to dispose of fly-tipped waste free of charge would be prohibitively expensive, unfair to other industries and essentially, would not tackle the underline causes of the problem. However, we believe that there is much that can be done, both to prevent fly-tipping and importantly to lessen the burden of clean-up for landowners. By summer 2012 we will hold a Ministerial fly- tipping summit that brings together major stakeholders to discuss how national suppor t can be used to back regional and local projects. We will work with industry and local authorities to prioritise better reporting in order to focus efforts and map trends. The Summit will aim to identify and champion affordable solutions and find a holistic appr oach that is based on communication between affected parties, Local Authorities and the Police. Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) 6.74 If the [IPPC Farm Assurance] scheme shows continued standards of compliance, we recommend that the EA should consider further significant reductions in inspection frequency. Yes The EA has implemented a pig and poultry fa rm scheme which has reduced inspections for almost 70% of farms from yearly to 3 yearly, the minimum frequency possible under the Industrial Emissions Directive. The EA is working to ensure that all farms will be eligible for entry to the scheme by demonstrating improved compliance, through rais ing awareness of issues common to that sector and rolling out improved advice and gu idance delivered in partnership with trade associations. 6.75 We recommend that if there is any o pportunity to remove farming altogether from IPPC controls then it should be taken. If this is not possible, we recommend that the thresholds for applying IPPC to pig and poultry businesses should remain unchanged, and that IPPC shoul d not be extended to cattle. We recommend a long- term objective of basing the limits [for requiring IPPC permits] on actual numbers of livestock housed. We believe the application of IPPC provides necessary protection for the environment, particularly in respect of potential emissions of manure and ammonia. Compliance with IPPC provides a significant environ mental credential to the operator. We do not agree that IPPC thresholds s hould be based upon actual numbers of livestock rather than places. IPPC controls are proper ly concerned with the potential for pollution to occur and ensuring that measures are in place to prevent or, where that is not possible, to Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 78 minimise potential pollution. Since the pollu tion potential of intensiv e livestock rearing is directly related to the number of animals potentially involved, we think that the maximum number of places is the appr opriate criterion for setti ng these environment protection thresholds. This approach is also much more readily auditable, particularly as it does not require scrutiny of actual stocking levels which may vary frequently and so lessens the regulatory administrative burden on both inspectors and farmers. The European Commission must review the inclus ion of the intensive rearing of cattle in IPPC by the end of 2012. We are working with the NFU and other sector representatives to ensure that UK environmental and farming c oncerns are fed effectively into those reviews. On the basis of currently-availabl e evidence we do not think there is sufficient justification for including cattle in IPPC. 6.78 We recommend that the EA: should have an objective process for dealing with applications for [pig and poultry] installations that could impact on ne w and existing local wildlife sites; should demonstrate that it has assessed the risk properly, accurately and consistently; should base decisions on sound science; should give considered reasons for re quiring applicants to model possible impacts; and with others, should make it easier for industry to access public records on sensitive sites, includi ng local wildlife sites. Yes The EA will produce guidance for its planning and permitting officers on how to respond to planning applications that include activities requiring an environmental permit. This will include agricultural development. The EA will issue the guidance to key stakeholders for consultation in spring 2012 and aim to publish later in 2012. NE will produce a guidance note specifically for intensive farming operators on the planning permitting interface and nature conservation sites by spring 2012. The industry must have confidence in and tr ust the EA's risk assessment process and the science upon which it is based. It is impor tant that evidence used to underpin decision making is robust. EA, NE and the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) have established two groups to: i. review the scientific evidence ensuring the correct critical emission loads on habitats are established and not exceeded; and ii. improve understanding of the use of site survey and modelling techniques to predict the potential impacts of ammonia at SSSIs. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 79 This will give us a more robust permitting approach that benefits natur e conservation sites and has the confidence and suppor t of the farming industry. The agencies are also reviewing (by April 2013) existing screening distances for all nature conservation sites, based on past permitting experience, to refine them and ensure no sites are screened unless based on evidence. 6.79 We recommend that the EA should est ablish a mediation scheme to address persistent or vexatious complaints regarding odour, noise and other nuisance issues. The EA has a well established mechanism in plac e to address persistent complaints. The EA is also working toward a dedicated sect or approach - existing En vironment Officers have been given specialist training and guidance ov er the last six months to support their work around amenity issues and regulated sites. The EA is also recruiting 20 new specialists before the end of Ma rch 2012 to help resolve amenity issues around regulated sites. Farmers also have a role to play in helping to overcome persistent or vexatious complaints by trying, where possible, to work thr ough problems in a consultative manner with neighbours. The EA is working with the indust ry to develop a Code of Conduct that should be available by spring 2012. 6.81 We recommend that local planning aut horities should consider the possible impacts on new housing developments from existing local farms before granting planning permission. Yes Local planning authorities should consider the possible impacts on new housing developments from existing local farms before granting planning permission. Energy 6.83 We recommend that Government must be consistent in its policies on renewables, and must provide businesses with long-term certa inty and simple application processes that can be dealt with quickly. Yes The Government's financial incentives - t he Renewables Obligation (RO), the Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) and the Renewabl e Heat Incentive (RHI) - are designed to provide long-term support for the generation of r enewable energy. We are committed to achieving the UK's legally binding target of 15% renewables by 2020 in the most cost effective way, which minimises the impact on consumer bills. We are doing this by: Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 80 undertaking regular reviews of technology co sts as the basis for financial incentives; tackling the non-financial barriers and suppor ting development of the supply chain; working within public spendi ng and affordability limits; reforming the electricity market; promoting energy efficiency; and working with industry to reduce costs. The FITs scheme is focused on consumers and communities and is intended to provide a mechanism that is easier to understand and mo re predictable than the RO. Since its launch in April 2010, the FITs scheme has been successful in encouraging the uptake of small-scale low-carbon elec tricity generating installations . In early 2011 we announced the start of the first review of the FITs scheme. This wa s prompted by concerns that demand for FITs, initially from large-scale sola r photovoltaics (PV) and more recently from small-scale solar PV, was placing an unsusta inable pressure on the budget allocated for FITs. We reviewed FITs for large scale solar PV in the first part of 2011: and consulted on changes to FITs for all solar PV from 31 October to 23 Decem ber 2011. We announced the outcome of the consultation on 9 Febr uary 2012 alongside a further consultation considering all other aspects of the FITs scheme, including tariffs fo r other technologies and administration of the scheme. The Renewable Heat Inc entive (RHI) scheme opened for applications from the non- domestic sector on Monday 28 November 2011. Support under the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is index-linked for a 20 year period. In light of the later than expected launch of the non-domestic schem e, as a result of the cha nges required by the European Commission to the large biomass tariff, we ar e reviewing the timetable for introducing the domestic scheme. We will confirm the exact timing for the scheme early this year. The Renewables Obligation (RO) is currently the Government's ma in support mechanism for incentivising the deployment of large-sca le renewable energy technologies. We are currently reviewing the levels of banded support for the period 2013-17 and issued consultation proposals on 20 October 2011. The consultation closed on 12 January 2012 and we aim to publish our response in the spri ng. This will provid e investors with early certainty of the support levels that will apply fr om 1 April 2013. Ofgem are responsible for the administration of all t he schemes. Detailed guidance for generators, setting out an overview of the schemes, the accreditation process and the information Ofgem require in order to issue payment, is published on the Ofgem website. Interested parties may use these consultation s to provide feedback to Government on how the administration of the schemes can be improved. Energy from waste 6.86 We recommend that a higher-level r esolution must be found on the issues around the combustion of manures to generate energy. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 81 We are working with the NFU and poultry farmer s to find cost effective ways of using poultry litter and manures as a renewable energy source while ensuring levels of environmental protection are maintained. The Waste Incineration Directive places signi ficant controls on plants burning waste in order to deliver a high level of protec tion to human health and we recognise that these controls place a dispr oportionately high cost burden on smaller operators. However, we currently have three chicken litter energy plants which meet the Waste Incineration Directive requirements and so provide an opportunity for farmers to dispose of their waste. Poultry litter that is destined to be burnt is within the scope of the revised WFD unless it has passed an end-of-waste test. Any operator who wishes to burn poultry litter can submit to the EA an end-of-waste case for the ma terial they wish to burn. If the material passes the end-of-waste test then it will become ex empt from the controls stipulated in the Waste Incineration Directive. We have been working with industry to explore if end-of-waste criteria for poultry litter can be achieved. Based on the latest application, poultry litter has not been able to meet the end-of-waste test as it contai ns a number of contaminants t hat are likely to result in a 'worse environmental effect' t han the fuel comparat or that had been proposed (in this case virgin wood). The industry are currently exploring w hether there are alternative comparator fuels or treatment options that would enable them to meet the test. 6.87 We recommend that the Government shoul d be ambitious in its Anaerobic Digestion [AD] Strategy. This should set out a range of actions to promote a dramatic increase in the numbers of anaer obic digestion plants for agricultural waste. It should include project ions to illustrate the grow th in numbers of facilities that the Government expects can result. We are committed to substantially increas ing energy from wast e through anaerobic digestion. We published our AD Strategy and Action Plan in June 2011 www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2011/06/ 14/pb13541-anaerobic-digestion-strategy . This sets out how we plan to achieve this increase by removing the barriers to uptake of this technology. We believe that AD has advantages in dealing with certain types of wastes such as food wastes and manures and slurries produced on farms. These advantages include reduced greenhouse gas emissions from diverting waste from landfill and the production of renewable energy and fertilisers. We identified a potential for the AD sector dealing with the producti on of energy from waste to grow 3 - 5 times by 2020 if a number of barriers could be overcome. These barriers include accessing finance, availab ility of waste feedstocks and the regulatory framework. We are working with stakeholde rs to overcome these challenges but we recognise that they are signific ant and make it difficult to set a definitive target for AD at this time. We have engaged with key stakeholders to consi der the evidence on t he sustainability and use of crops as feedstock for anaerobic digest ions. The conclusions of this engagement Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 82 will be reflected in the Government's bioenergy strategy which will be published by March 2012, and proposals from the Gove rnment on future support fo r renewable energy under the FITs scheme and the RO. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and Climate Change Agreements 6.90 We recommend that any future [CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC) or Climate Change Agreement (CCA)] scheme is responsive to the needs of the farming and food-processing sectors, wh ilst helping to secure further significant reductions in emissions. Yes We are committed to simplifyi ng the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and will be consulting on proposals for a simplified scheme early this year. The new leaner and simplified CRC will be less burdensome, making compliance easier for business. We have extended the CCA scheme to 2023 and increased the Climate Change Levy discount on electricity for CCA participants fr om 65 to 90% from April 2013, which gives industry more certainty to invest in energy efficiency measures. Our response to the consul tation detailing proposals to si mplify the CCA scheme before the start of the new schem e period in 2013 was published in January 2012 along with regulations detailing proposals new to the sc heme. The new scheme will achieve reduced administration burdens by revamping the content s of the agreements so they are easier to understand, and managing agreement s via an IT platform enabling participants to manage elements of thei r own agreements. 6.91 We recommend that, as part of negot iations on the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] 2014 20, the Government seeks to reform the Energy Crops Scheme to remove barriers to its take-up . We are currently negotiating t he future of the CAP post-2013 in Europe. At this stage in the negotiations, the emphasis is on providing sufficient flexibility in the regulations so that we are able to develop schemes which achieve our objectives. We aim to secure simplification and sufficient flexibility to achieve our objectives across the CAP regulations, but it is too early in the proce ss to discuss specific scheme design. Other environmental issues Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 6.93 As part of Natural England's [NE] current review of the [Environmental Impact Assessment] ( EIA) guidance, we think Natural England should establish a better way to identify these valuable sites to enable their protection. The upcoming review of Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 83 the guidance on the use of the Regulations provides an opportunity to do so and we would encourage all stakeholders to participate fully. Yes NE has used the 2011 consultation on the EIA public guidance to request views from stakeholders on the Taskforce's recommendat ion. Of the 15 responses to the consultation, which ended in November 2011, ten responded to the specific question on this recommendation. There was strong endorsement of the recommendation and seve ral variations of ideas were put forward as to how this issue can be addressed. A proposal for a feasibility study as to how the NE Grassland Inventory c an be developed further in England has been received and this will be explored with indu stry in 2012 to determine a way forward. The Hedgerow Regulations 6.94 We recommend no change to the current Hedgerow Regulations. Yes We have no plans to make changes to the Hedgerows Regulations 1997.Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 85 Part 7 The Common Agricultural Policy, Single Payment Scheme and cross compliance Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 7.07 We recommend Defra incorporates the follo wing points into its negotiating brief: regulations and regulators should focu s on outcomes rather than process; constant reminders of the complexi ties of 2005 and subsequent costs of administrating the scheme in England; provision should be made for regulators to demonstrate trust in farmers by developing a system of earned recognition to inform their risk-assessment strategy; a need to apply a simplification test against all proposals, e.g. capping; while we welcome the provision in cro ss compliance for Member States to use risk to target inspections, the Eu ropean Commission should remove the disincentive to adopt such an approach and facilitate efficient enforcement; the European Commission should encourag e Member States to improve their use of online tools for gathering information and completing forms, and encourage claimants to employ third parti es if they are unable to use IT services themselves; and barriers to the Energy Crops Scheme should be reduced (paragraph 6.91). Yes The Commission's proposals for the post-2013 CAP were published on 12 October 2011. We want a CAP that is simpler overall for farmers and for administrations; any new requirements that add to the administrative burden must be justified by the public benefits they deliver. We have identified a number of propos als that go against the principle of simplification. For example, the proposals on active farme rs, capping, greening Pillar 1 and new audit procedures are likely to add subs tantially to the admin istrative burden for both farmers and administrators whilst delivering li ttle, if any, benefit and, in the case of capping, damaging the policy objec tive of competitiveness. We have been, we are now and will continue to engage with the Commission to achieve simplification, in a number of ways. For example: The UK Government contributed significantly to drafting a March 2011 Council paper on simplification principles - which was signed by 26 Member States. The paper proposes alternative approaches to existing control procedures and greater use of guidelines rather than regulatory controls. UK ministers have consistently raised the issue of simplification in Council, before the release of the Commission's proposals and during recent discussions of the proposals. Concerns expressed over the complexity of the proposals at the December Agriculture Council has led the European Union (EU) Agricu lture Commissioner to write to Member Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 86 States setting out which measures he thinks c ontribute to simplificat ion of the CAP; we will press for further simplification in our response. In meetings of the CAP si mplification experts group in Brussels we have stressed the need for simplification to be a central elem ent of the CAP refo rm proposals, and in particular the need for a more modern approac h to audit, inspection and sanctions. We have emphasised the UK Government's view that inspections and penalties should be proportionate to the risks posed to EU funds . We will continue to use this forum to push for simplification and clarity in the CAP as negotia tions proceed. We will continue to push for control systems that focus on achieving the desired outcomes, rather than following specified processes. We will also push for outdated control processes and penalties to be made proporti onate to the risks posed by compliance failures. Measures to encourage compli ance and understanding of the rules should be given greater emphasis by the Commission to avoid the risk of disallowance as a result of misunderstanding. To facilitate increased use of risk targeted inspections we will continue to argue that Member States should not have to increase inspection rates unless there is a clear increase in non-compliance in the general population. We also want to ensure that farmers are recognised for the benefits they provide, for example, we are seeking to ensure that Br itish farmers' contributions through agri- environment schemes can count towards \"greeni ng\". We have met the EU Agriculture Commissioner to discuss this and welcome his willingness to expl ore the issue. We support the use of online tools; across Government we are moving to providing services \"digitally-by-default\". However, we believe that Member States should have the choice to decide for themselves the delivery model that will best m eet their requirements and achieve their objectives. At this stage in the negotiations, we want to focus on providing sufficient flexibility in the regulations so that we are able to develop sc hemes which achieve our objectives. It is too early in the process to discuss specific scheme design. 7.08 We recommend assessing the breach rate [of cross compliance] only with the random (and thus probably representative) sam ple of inspections, and not including the results from an already targeted (and thus unrepresentative) risk-based sample . Yes We will negotiate to limit the assessment of the underlying breach rate in the general population to the random inspection sample. This will facilitate improved use of risk targeted inspections and we will continue to argue that Member Stat es should not have to increase inspection rates unless there is a cl ear increase in non-compliance in the general population. 7.09 When considering the CAP 2014 20, Defra should remember the lessons of previous negotiations . Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 87 Yes Throughout the negotiations on post-2013 CAP we have, and will continue to, use the lessons we have learned from previous negotia tions. We will push for simplification and we will negotiate strongly to avoid proposals which we do not think we can implement. We have strengthened links between the negotiating team and Defra' s delivery bodies. We already have some clear negotiating lines from th is process. For example, we know that testing the non-agricultural income of farmers to determine whethe r they are \"active\" or not would be excessively complex fo r farmers and authorities. Single Payment Scheme (SPS) Mapping 7.11 We recommend that every effort shoul d be taken to avoid 're-mapping' . Yes We want to avoid large-scale mapping exercises as they ar e inconvenient to farmers and land managers, as well as being extremely costly to administer. However, some updating is inevitable and the forthcoming CAP re form may add new requirements. The EU Regulations governing CAP schemes require us to keep the Rural Land Register up to date. This is an on-going c hallenge given the significant amount of change on the ground each year that is notified by farmers or discovered on inspections. We will continue to discuss with farming representatives how best to minimise the ext ent of any remapping required. 7.12 We recommend that there is a single map for both SPS and agri-environment schemes . Under consideration We agree that combining maps could offer benefits to farmers. The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and Natural England (NE) maps bot h use the RPA's Rural Land Register as their base layer for SPS and agri-environment m aps, then build the features relevant to each upon that. However, we have investigated using one set of maps in the past, and the variety and overlap of mappi ng requirements between schemes made the map very hard to read. It would also be complicated to update a single map as SPS and agri- environment maps last for different lengths of ti me. We will continue to seek a solution to this challenge, but any changes are unlikel y to take place ahead of CAP reform. 7.13 We believe that regulators determining land eligibility should be able to make greater use of remote sensing as a replacement for physical inspections on-farm. We also recommend: Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 88 that Defra continue to only go to the mi nimum level of accuracy imposed by the European Commission; that Government should continue to push back should the Commission request more accuracy in mapping since this has lit tle benefit for a lot of extra cost. Yes We will continue to push the Commission to ensure that the required mapping accuracy is limited to that needed to achiev e the desired policy outcome. The RPA considers the proportion of inspections carried out by Remote Sensing each year. For 2011 over 75% was completed this wa y. Each year we consider whether we can further increase the percentage (taking account of practica l constraints such as cloud cover), but we are required by EU regulatio n to balance this against specific selection criteria. The Single Payment Scheme form 7.15 We recommend that claimants should proactively notify the Rural Land Registry (RLR) of any changes to their holdings (e.g. when land changes hands) throughout the year . Yes We agree with this recommendation and we will continue to engage with the industry to help deliver this outcome. Farmers and land managers making CAP payment claims are currently required to inform RPA of all changes to their holding during the y ear. An increase in notifications usually takes place immediately after the traditional land tr ansfer dates. But other customers are currently less proactive, which means that penalties may then need to be applied if the changes are only discovered on inspection. Pr ompt notification wo uld reduce the number of such penalties that RPA currently apply. What the SPS should be claimed on 7.17 We recommend that Defra, in CAP negot iations, seeks greater simplification through requiring the claimant to map th e outer boundaries of the holding and any ineligible areas (such as woods and concrete etc.) . Under consideration We will push for as much simplification in mapping requirements as possible during the CAP reform negotiations. Given the requirements of different schemes that currently exist Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 89 and are proposed by the Commission as a part of the CAP reforms, it is not clear whether we will be able to achieve the specific recommendation. 7.18 We recommend that Defra make use of the power Member States have to introduce a minimum size of holding belo w which the SPS is not payable: in England, we recommend 5 hectares of actively managed land (see paragraphs 7.21- 22) as an appropriate minimum. Under consideration We will consult on the minimum size threshol d as we develop our plans for implementing the reformed CAP in England for post-2013. Following consultation with stakeholders, an area minimum of one hectare wa s set for England from 2010. Having made that decision, a change would require amendment to the relevant EU rules. The CAP 2013 reform provides an opportunity to revi sit that decision alongside any wider changes to eligibility rules that may be agreed in those negotiations. Who should be able to claim the SPS? 7.22 We recommend that the SPS should only be available on actively managed land, which we define as 'la nd which is capable or has the capacity to be farmed'. Yes We want CAP direct payments to be restricted, as far as possible, to land which is actively managed. We will push, through CAP reform negotia tions, to achieve that in a way which is both enforceable without significant bur eaucracy and does not inadvertently exclude other land that should remain eligible. 7.23 We recommend that the Government should press for the abolition of entitlements. Under consideration We will explore possible alternatives to entit lements and will feed them into CAP reform negotiations. In practical terms, entitlements do not serve a useful purpose once Member States have moved to a flat ra te model of the SPS, as will be the case in England from 2012. The challenge will be to find a workabl e system that operates without entitlements while still being within permitted rules for subsidies. 7.24 We recommend that there should be a single payment made to the appropriate Commoners Association (o r equivalent). The Association (or equivalent) should be responsible for identi fying the active claimants, notifying the RPA and dividing the payment appropriately on the basis of those who are actively farming the common. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 90 Under consideration We will consider whether and how we could make SPS payments to Commoners Associations (or equivalents) as we develop our plans for implementing the reformed CAP in England. Administering SPS across co mmon land where there are a number of customers is particularly co mplex and will require in-depth consideration with a range of stakeholders. 7.25 We recommend that the Government opposes any proposals in the EU to introduce a cap on direct payments (wheth er absolute or graduated) for single business claims. Yes We have, and will continue to, oppose the Commission's proposal to cap direct payments. Cross compliance 7.26 - Cross compliance is necessary as it allows SPS recipients to demonstrate their contribution to the provision of public goods and enables the Government to judge value for money for the taxpayer. Nevertheless, we believe that there is significant room for simplifi cation, both for the recipien ts and the administrators without compromising outcomes. Yes Cross compliance is an important means to ensure that farmers in receipt of significant public subsidy are complying with the law and bas ic good practice but there is significant room for simplification in the EU rules. We will assess the cross compliance measures and argue for a more risk-based and proportionate control system in EU negotiations on CAP reform. Inspections 7.29 [We recommend that England should aim to move to a syst em with one, or at most two, appropriately skilled inspectorate s responsible for cross compliance]. In our view, the most appropriate organisation would be th e RPA, with input where necessary from [Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency] ( AHVLA ) on animal issues (as per paragraph 3.06). Yes We have altered the legal framework to allow RPA to take on cross compliance inspection responsibilities from the Environment Agency (EA) in time for 2012 inspections. The RPA Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 91 and AHVLA are now the only bodies conducting cross compliance inspections. This will reduce cross compliance visits by more than 1000 per year. 7.31 We recommend that Defra reviews EU risk-selection factor s, and propose changes as appropriate . We recommend that membership of appropriate third-party assurance and other schemes should form part of the cross compliance inspector's risk toolkit. Yes We regularly assess our risk selection criteria to make sure that t hey are appropriate and evidence-based and take account of informati on from other agencies. We intend to consider how earned recognition can be in troduced into all other cross compliance measures from 2013 (see Part 3 for more info rmation on earned recognition). EU rules set the framework for inspection (t he national competent authority is responsible for the details of the inspection process), and we will continue to press for improvements to the way risk is used for determining inspection and enforcement in the EU negotiations on CAP reform. 7.32 Where inspectors are not already doing so, we recommend that they should start by inspecting a sample of the holding/cattle/passports etc. Yes We support a more proportionate, outcome-focused approach to inspections. However there are some cases where this may not be possible without compromising outcomes. Sampling is used; however, the instances wher e this is acceptable are limited. We will push for inspections to be proportionate and outcome focussed as part of CAP reform negotiations. Enforcement 7.34 We recommend that enforcement of cr oss compliance should focus more on the overall outcome rather th an process and exact measurements . Yes We will review cross compliance measures in or der to look at the opportunities available for making the inspection and enforcement more outcome-f ocused, where this can be done without compromising environmental outcomes or breaching EU law. We will report on our findings and next steps in the summer 2012. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 92 Guidance 7.37 We recommend that cross compliance gui dance be thoroughly overhauled to become a short, outcome-based 'summary note'. This should give clear advice on the requirements that Defra and industry jointly believe are the most important. Yes Over recent years we have worked with stakeholders to ensure guidance documents are fit for purpose. For 2012 we raised with st akeholders the possibility of producing a shortened summary guide, but received a clear steer that we s hould ensure that the guidance includes all of the relevant requirements for farmer s so that they had a clear view of what would be required at inspection. We intend to move cross compliance guidance to a fully digital format by 2013 using online tools, tailored guides and innovative digital fo rmats, such as downloadable e-publications for smart phone. We will set up a project group, including key stakeholders and delivery agencies to implement the move, give advice on how it should be done, and what supporting and intermediary services farmers will need following the switch from paper-based guidance. The electronic approach will gi ve us the potential to tailo r guidance for individuals to ensure they can access the information they need for their particularly farming business. We will rely on the industry to support this work and ensure that they encourage the increased use of electronic services. 7.38 Recommend farm advice system should have better provision for targeted, specific, unequivocal and joined-up advice in a way that is tailored locally to the needs and contributions of local partners. Yes In response to this recommendation, in January 2012 we launched the new Farming Advice Service (FAS), replacing the previous Cross Compliance Advice Programme. The FAS will provide joined-up advice on a number of topics including cross compliance, climate change, nutrient managem ent and competitiveness and wil l be delivered in active partnership with industry to ensure that it is tailored to the needs of farmers at a local level. The new service will help farmers to improve their environmental and economic performance and avoid losses to their single farm payment. We are also running an Integrated Advice Pilot (IAP) project wh ich is exploring the potential for, and benefits of, delivering integrat ed advice on a range of t opics. This has so far been created for farm advisors on the dairy , arable, beef and sheep sectors. We will report on this pilot later in 2012 and will use the results of this work, and of the review of advice and incentives for managers announced in the Natural Environment White Paper (NEWP), to further develop our ad vice provision to farmers. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 93 Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition and Statutory Management Requirements General approach 7.41 We recommend that Defra carefully r eviews all cross compliance conditions to ensure that they are properly focused on outcomes as a demonstration of a farmer's duty of care, rather than unnece ssary process, and to ensure that evidence justifies their continuation. Yes We will assess all the cross compliance conditions, taking care to ensure that this is done without compromising environmental standards, to make sure they are outcome focused and not unnecessarily burdensome. We will publish the results of this investigation in summer 2012. The cross compliance measures cu rrently in place will have to remain, as they are required under EU law. 75% of cr oss compliance measures are also based on existing UK law and we are conscious of the need not to create multiple but differing requirements under cross compliance and domestic law. 7.43 On balance, we believe it would be c onsistent with the principles of earned recognition to change/remove standard s that have very low underlying breach rates20 - on two conditions. First, that there have been adequate inspections that mean that the low breach rate is real. Sec ond, that Government is confident that the value of retaining the cross compliance deterre nt is negligible given the retention of underlying legislation. Yes We will look at areas of cross compliance th at have low underlying breach rates as part of the review of cross compliance. We will look at what the underlying reasons for this are and assess the likely impact of their removal wher e this could be done in line with EU law. Where the presence of a standard in cross compliance with very low breach rates is not necessary for compliance with EU law, and where it can be shown that the removal of the standard will not adversely affect outcomes, we will remove them. Good Agricultural and Environmental Condi tion (GAEC) 1 (Soil Protection Review) 7.46 We recommend that Defra changes GAEC 1 to a duty of care to protect the soil and to prevent damaging soil erosion, reduce compaction, damage to landscape features and, over the long run, maintain organic matte r in mineral soils. 20 In 2009, of the 36 standards (GAECs and SMRs), 11 standards (up from eight in 2008) were not found to be breached by any of those farmers inspected for that standard. Of the remaining 24 standards, there is a fall in breaches recorded for nine standards. In the case of 10 cross compliance standards, less than 10 breaches were found under each. The top 10 standards breached account for 96.49% of the breaches recorded. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 94 Under consideration We will work with industry to ex plore the full range of options for the Soil Protection Review (SPR10). We aim to put new arrangements in place by t he end of 2013 when the current SPR10 comes to an end. We have already conducted initial analysis to explore how a duty of care for soils could be implemented and believe a duty could be one of several options which could be considered. As part of the review, we will consider how the SPR and other industry schemes can be used in earned recognition. To start the process, we will launch a farme r survey in February 2012 to evaluate the implementation of the SPR10 so far and expl ore current soil management trends in England. 7.47 We recommend that completion of th e Soil Protection Review remains an advisory feature under GAEC 1 but that not completing the Review correctly (or at all) should not result in a breach of GAEC 1 . Under consideration We do not want to penalise farmers simply for non completion of paperwork. However the SPR10 does provide a risk based approach to managing soil degradation without the need for intensive fieldwork which would greatly increase the inspection time on farm. The challenge for industry is to help Go vernment to find a viable alter native to allow us to put in place improved arrangements by the end of 2013. 7.49 We recommend that unless there are sound reasons for retaining the crop- residue burning restrictions element of the GAEC we be lieve that its removal would not risk lessening envi ronmental impacts. Crop-residue burning restrictions help to pr event air pollution and protect human health and are therefore included in cross compliance as a requirement of EU law. The purpose of cross compliance is to provide a mechanism to limit the payment of taxpayer subsidy to those who fail to comply with the law, especia lly where other members of society may be affected. We are required to make sure that those receiving public subsidy are not breaking the law. GAEC 11 (control of weeds) 7.50 Should it be shown that the injurious weeds element of this GAEC meets the conditions we identify in paragraph 7.42, we believe it would be a candidate for removal. We recommend that Defra explores al ternative ways of combating the spread of invasive weeds. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 95 We will consider GAEC 11 along with the other GAECs as part of the review of cross compliance which will be published in the summer. However, EU law requires us to use cross compliance to ensure that farmers who claim subsidy from the taxpayer under CAP are complying with the law in relation to inju rious weeds on agricultural land, meaning it is very unlikely that we could remove refe rence to existing legal commitments without breaching our legal obligations. It is important that certain injurious weeds, for example ragwort, are effectively controlled as they are highly toxic to grazing animals. In order to understand the current status of these species we recently commissioned an analysis of the change in frequency and abundance of injurious weed and selected invasi ve non native species in England. In reviewing this GAEC, we will take account of this study and ensure that the right controls for controlling these weeds are in place. GAEC 12 (land not in ag ricultural production) 7.52 We recommend that Defra and industry cl osely monitor GAEC 12 to ensure this condition does not continue to have adverse unintended consequences . Yes We improved GAEC 12 in 2010 to make it mo re fit for purpose. In 2011 the RPA received no enquiries from farmers facing problems with this standard. We will continue to monitor all measures as part of our wi der work on cross compliance. GAEC 18 (water abstraction) 7.53 We believe that removing GAEC 18 as a cross compliance condition would not risk lessening envi ronmental impacts. This GAEC will not be removed as it enables the UK to fulfil its statut ory duties as part of the Water Framework Directive. We are pushing for a move towards sustainable agriculture and removing the duty of care for water abstraction does not support this aim. In addition we are explicitly required by the EU to have a standard in place that covers abstraction and GAEC18 provides this without creating any additional obligations beyond those already contained in domestic law. Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) 7.55 We have heard that SMRs 3 (sewage slu dge) is acting as a disincentive to the use of this recycled product. SMR 10 (ho rmones) has a nil breach rate. We believe there is a case for their removal. These SMRs will not be removed. SMRs relate to obligati ons for farmers under EU law and form part of the standards that all EU stat es must implement to ensure that farmers Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 96 receiving subsidy payment are acting legally. We believe that thes e SMRs are important environmentally and it is important to mainta in them because of this: SMR 3 requires a farmer to ensure that sewage sludge applied to land does not contain harmful levels of mercury, lead and other potentially dangerous substances and is applied in a way that does not threaten the local environment or contaminate food supplies. Similarly SMR 10 requires farmers claiming subsid y to be compliant with the law regarding the use of certain medical products (i.e. substances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action) in livestock that, if not administered correctly, coul d enter the human food chain. Paperwork 7.57 We recommend that the current system of crop codes should be disbanded with the exception of energy/protein crops and those essential for [Entry Level Stewardship] (ELS ) agreements . Yes We will continue to review crop codes each y ear and remove those that are no longer required. As an example, with the end of Pr otein Crop and Nuts Premia for 2012, five codes have been removed. There is the potential for further reductions as SPS continues, but the need to retain some specific crop c odes will remain, for example regulatory EU reporting (such as area of permanent pasture ), cross checking against some Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) schemes (such as ELS) and achieving environmental measures including through voluntary initiatives. 7.58 We recommend changes to the paperwork th at a farmer is required to fill in regarding the rotation of entitlements . Yes We have changed the entitlements system so that for 2012 all entitlements within each of the three SPS regions in England will have the same value, removing the main driver to rotate entitlements. RPA will also set the default rotation of entitlements to minimise the chance of any entitlements ex piring due to under usage. Gi ven these changes, it is expected that the need for claimants to submit additional paperwork (SP11) alongside their annual application for payment will be reduced. 7.60 We recommend that the RPA sends SP S application forms and opens the online application facility at the beginning of January. The RPA should communicate clearly to farmers that submit ting their application early in the year will not result in an in creased risk of inspection. Under consideration Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 97 We will consider opening applications in January as we develop our plans for implementing the reformed CAP in England. There would be practical issues to overcome, for example, a change would reduce the accura cy of pre-populated data on the application form and so potentially affect the speed and accu racy of payments. In the meantime, RPA will look for all opportunities, with the assi stance of farmer representative groups, to communicate clearly to farmers that submitting their applicat ion early in the year will not result in an increased risk of inspection. 7.62 We recommend that the RPA offers th e farmer the option of the RPA giving their details to the other [farmer] . This would enable the farmers concerned to resolve the matter themselves and lessen the burden on the RPA. Under consideration RPA will look at what improvements to cu rrent arrangements might be possible now, and we will consider this further as we develop our plans for implementing the reformed CAP in England. Customers would need to opt in to this arr angement in order to avoid contravening data protection regulations. Errors and appeals 7.63 We recommend that Defra should seek to allow the RPA to adopt a proportionate approach to 'obvious errors' on SPS forms. Yes We agree that, in principle, a proportionate approach should be taken to errors on SPS forms. However, the application of obvious erro r rules must continue to fall within what is permissible within EU rules, otherwise t he UK would be exposed to EU fines (disallowance). As the number of farmers who claim SPS on line increases the occurrence of this type of error will diminish due to the existing validation carried out before a claim can be submitted. 7.64 We recommend that the RPA introduces a system of fixed-date replies throughout the appeals process and clearly sets out its timescale . Yes We are currently reviewing and improving t he RPA complaint and appeals process. We will consider fixed-date replies during the design of the end-to-end process which will happen in the first half of 2012. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 98 Miscellaneous points 7.65 We recommend that Defra investigat es a better method of assessing whether or not high-quality (as opposed to all) grassland is being eroded . Yes As part of the negotiations on the reform of the CAP we are arguing for a system of controls on permanent pasture that conserve areas of environmental value but do not place an unnecessary burden on farmers. This includes looking at how we differentiate high and low value permanent pasture. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 99 Part 8 Farmed animals Livestock movements, identification and reporting Recommendations: a new livestock movements regime 8.12 In summary terms, we recommend that the standstill operates within a simpler structure that recognises that some movements are inherently more risky than others . Yes We need robust controls to protect the livestock industry and individual farm businesses from the effects of animal diseases. We agr ee that controls must be simple and clearly understood if they are to be complied with and enforced effe ctively. In response to the Task Force's recommendations, we have made much progress in delivering the proposed changes. We are carrying out the detailed ri sk and cost assessments that are needed to support implementation of t he recommendations. None of these proposed changes is easy. We must make sure t hat changes are practical, affordable and can be implemented effectively without increasing the risk of disease sp read. They must also be cost-effective: not only for farmers, but also to ensure value for money where public money is to be spent on developing new systems. We are working closely with the livestock industry to make sure that changes are worked through thoroughl y and are introduced in the right order and at the right time. The Task Force recommendations cover three main areas: electronic information and reporting; simplification of movement controls including the 6 day standstill; and enforcement. So far we have: introduced electronic reporting for pigs; started the process for es tablishing a sheep database; carried out epidemiological modelling to support decisions on changes to the standstill; agreed with industry possible alter native changes to the standstill; started a major review of rationalisi ng County Parish Holding (CPH) numbers; deferred individual movement reporti ng for the 'historic' sheep flock; and introduced a simpler single page cattle passport. Detail of implementation or furt her work is set out against the specific recommendations in this part. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 100 E-reporting of livestock movements 8.14 We recommend development of rapid an d accurate provision of information on animal movements by adopting electroni c reporting for all species. Specifically, we recommend: immediate adoption of a single data base, commercially and privately operated, to record sheep movements to ultimately replace entirely and make redundant the Animal Movement Licensing System (AMLS); early adoption of electronic reporti ng and recording of pig movements; an end to paper-based reporting of cattle movements; consideration in the longer term to developing a single private-sector database for all species; electronic data entry and reco rding should be immediate; where alternate reporting systems are pr ovided, movements must be reported within 72 hours; maximum use of the Central Po int Recording Centre (CPRC); industry should take the opportunity to offer support to non-IT enabled producers, through livestock markets or 'call-centre' arrangements to collect and record information; and the paper trail currently associated with AMLS should be abandoned as soon as replacement arrangements are robust. Yes We have delivered some of these changes and action is being taken on others. E-reporting of pig movements was rolled out in England on 1 October 2011 and is working well. We have seen a steady increase in the number of movements being reported electronically and are on target to achieve 70% of all pig movements electronically by end 2012. We are considering similar arrangements for sheep (and goats and deer) and the first stage of a procurement process was launched on 10 November 2011. We are working closely with the livestock industry to ensure that the underpinning commercial database provides the additional services that the sheep, goat and ancillary industries need and expect to launch the second stage of t he procurement process in the spring this year. If a suitable supplier exists and the pric e is right, we will aim to implement this as soon as possible. Simplification and the 6-day standstill 8.15 We recommend that the complex rules for linking premises should be simplified to introduce the same arrange ments for cattle, sheep and pigs. Specifically, we propose that: producers should be able to link premises wi thin a single CPH wi thin a radius of 10 miles of the centre of the 'home' premises; each CPH should be managed under the register; and ( CTS)-links and any other links/distance rules should be removed. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 101 8.16 We recommend that movement-reporti ng requirements should be the same for cattle, sheep and pigs. Sp ecifically, we propose that: movement within a single CPH should neither be recorded in the herd book/flock register nor reported; movement to any other CPH, whether or not with a change of owner/keeper, must be reported; and movement to market or to slaughte r must be recorded and reported. Under consideration There is significant work to be done to quantify the impact of the Task Force's recommendations to rationalise the allocation of CPH numbers and simplify rules for defining livestock premises so that the same rules apply across species. In response to these recommendations we have acted promptly to carry out the detailed assessment of the costs, benefits, implement ation and regulatory impacts. This work is now well advanced. This assessment will be available in the spring and will enable us to fully consider, with the livestock industry, all of the facts before taking final decisions on whether to proceed. 8.17 We recommend that the standstill rul es should continue to apply to all susceptible animals on a CPH other than to: movement within a single CPH; movement between farms (or commons), wh ether or not there is a change of owner/keeper and where those farms are not engaged in animal gathering; movement direct to slaughter or via a slaughter market; or where animals are held in an approved separation or isolation facilities (para 8.18); but in all cases, movement restrictions for specific disease regimes (e.g. bovine TB) must take precedence. 8.18 We recommend that approved separation or isolation facilities should provide for animals to move from premises under standstill where it is essential for management reasons. Specifically, we propose that: approved separation requires animals to be held on land managed separately from other animals on that holding or on contiguous holdings (e.g. on distinct parcel of land within a CPH, with separ ate handling, feed and water management, and appropriate distance separation from other animals); approved isolation in a building with in a farm premises requires a dedicated facility with separate arrangements for handling stock and discharges, effluent etc that ensure they do not come into contact with other livestock; approval for an isolation facility would be dependent on the applicant operating electronic reporting; and separation or isolation arrangements should be approved by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratory Agency (A HVLA) on the basis of producer 'self-Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 102 declaration' supported by information prov ided by a private veterinarian and monitored by a private veterinarian and/or annual farm assurance audit; AHVLA should monitor operation in the course of other visits. We commissioned epidemiological modelling to establish whether changing the current standstill arrangements as suggested by the Task Force would increase the size and duration of disease outbreaks. This modelling indicated that effect ive on-farm separation has a broadly similar impact on the spread of exotic disease to that of standstills. We have agreed with industry to work towards removing the current standstill requirement for all movements of cattle, sheep and goats for t hose farmers who choose to introduce separation units. It is fundamentally good practice to keep ne wly purchased stock separate so that their health status can be monitored and assessed. We think that the introduction of separation units approved under farm assurance and/or equivalent accreditation schemes, or possibly by a veterinarian as part of a formal farm health plan could offer a way forward. The Task Force report itself gives a very clear steer on the design criteria and appr opriate operational standards for such units. We have invited industry to develop a proposition for \"approved\" separ ation units that provides sufficient assurance and confidence in the pr oposal, and demonstrates that the industry itself is ready to seize the opportunity to take responsibility for managing livestock movement risks. We see littl e value in retaining the current arrangements for isolation premises on farms. Farmers who chose not to have a separation unit, or for whom such a set up was unnecessary, would remain subject to a 6-day standstill. We believe these changes, tak en together with elec tronic reporting of movements, could offer a clearer and simpler arrangement that would allow producers to manage their business without undue restriction, and r educe the risk of non-compliance through misunderstanding or deliberate corner-cutting. There is a lot of work to be done to develop the proposal further and determine its enforceabi lity and affordability. Getting the details right is now a joint enterpris e for industry and Government. Enforcement 8.19 We recommend that animal identificat ion regulations should be risk-based and proportionate to the objective of en suring clear traceability. We propose that they be designed in a way that facilita tes rather than impedes compliance (e.g. without imposing burdens that are seen as restrictive). Specifically, we propose that: the Government must continue to seek European Commission agreement to arrangements for batch recording and tran sitional arrangements for the 'historic' flock; and in the longer term, the Gover nment should seek to negotiate [European Union] (EU) sheep electronic identification (EID) rules that take greater account of the way the country's flock is managed. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 103 Yes We were pleased to secure changes to EU legislation deferring the introduction of individual movement reporting unt il 31 December 2014 for the 'histo ric flock'. Without this agreement sheep farmers would have had to record individual numbers manually on movement documents for sheep born before 31 December 2009 or retrospectively EID them, at a cost of between \u00a34m illion and \u00a311.5 million. Th is represents a significant financial saving and reduction in administrati ve burden for the industry as a whole. We have also considered the Task Force's recommendation to seek EU agreement for batch reporting of sheep movements. Individual reporting and recording of sheep movements is a fundamental principle of the EU Regulation and, despite significant work to influence the EU position on this, the EU Commission and other Member States do not support such a change. We will keep this under review, although a move to allocating sheep holdings on the basis of a 10 mile radius (as is already the case for cattle and pigs) will alleviate much of the burden. 8.20 We recommend that livestock recording arrangements should also work with best management practices and not duplicate information. Specifically, where it is not already in hand, we propose that: the content, size and weight of cattle passports should be reviewed with a view to replacing documentation with electronic reporting; in the meantime, maximum use should be made of reporting systems that do not require the submission of the passport or tear-off strips; and provision should be considered for herd books and flock registers to be kept electronically, and for such electronic records to remove the need for paper copies. This also provides a chance to si mplify and minimise the data needs of the register. Yes The new single page cattle passport was in troduced on 1 August 2011 and the transition to the new arrangements has been smooth. We continue to encourage and facilitate e- reporting, with the number of transactions reported electronically st eadily increasing. In December 2011 the percentage of cattle mo vements, births and deaths reported electronically was running at 86%. 8.21 We recommend that enforcement must be consistent. In line with our strategic recommendation on the propor tionality of penalties (paragraphs 2.262.27), we believe that poor practice and regular/wilful poor performance must be identified and dealt with effectively - but that the normally compliant producer is not penalised disproportionately . Specifically, we propose that: it must be a high priority to agree with the EU appropr iate tolerance levels to address errors in data reading when using electronic tag readers; there should be clearly defined and comm unicated flexibility in the enforcement of cattle tag rules. For example, we suggest that if an animal that has left a Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 104 holding has lost one of its tw o tags but can still be readily identified, the loss of a tag should not trigger rejection or furthe r enforcement action, provided that the animal can be clearly identified throughout the remainder of its journey and the incident is not evidence of a wider failure on the part of the keeper; in line with our strategic recommendati on that there should be a presumption of data-sharing between regulators (paragraph 2.35), official agencies must share information within their organisations a nd with other agencies, to ensure best use is made of data to identify risk and to co-ordinate a nd monitor inspection and tests. We have put considerable effort into trying to establish flexibility to address sheep farmers' concerns about incomplete EID reading when using CPRCs and the potential for single farm payment penalties. Since our interim response we have analysed the data from inspections in 2011 (3.0% of flocks) and f ound only five sheep farmers in England who would have benefitted from this additional flex ibility, with a total estimated reduction of around \u00a32,680 to their Single Payment Sc heme (SPS) payment s compared with a significant financial risk to the tax payer of up to several million pounds if we opted to operate such arrangements. On balance we are not persuaded that the benefit justifies the introduction of such arrangements in En gland. We will, however keep this under review for future years. We have carefully considered the Task Force's recommendation to maximise flexibility for catt le tagging rules where the identit y of the animal in question is not compromised. The clear EU requirement is that a ll cattle must be double tagged. However we do already offer some flexibilit y whereby single tagged animals presented for slaughter may still enter the human food c hain provided the supervising Official Veterinarian is satisfied that the animal's identity is not in question. 8.22 Finally, in line with the Coalition Go vernment's principl e of 'Government doing only what only Government can do' and our proposed approach of earned recognition (paragraphs 3.12 30), we believe that Government and industry in partnership should generate greater opport unities for trust and adoption of private- sector arrangements in making risk assessment. Yes The work described in this Part is evi dence of effective partnership working and developing the potential for future earned recognition. 8.27 We recommend that livestock producers, whether as indivi duals or through their representative organisations, must take responsibility for improving training and understanding the importance of bio-secu rity and movement controls at times when there is not a disease outbreak. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 105 Good understanding of disease risks and effective bi o-security at all times is essential to prevent disease spread. While everyone re cognises the need for exceptional measures during an emergency we encourage the industry to take leadership and responsibility for making sure that appropriate behaviour and standards are adopted as normal practice the rest of the time. Every day diseases and paras ites cause significant production losses. It makes good business sense to enhance the health st atus of a herd or flock so that food production efficiency and margins can be optimised. Bovine TB 8.32 We recommend that TBEG [TB Eradication Group] , in the near future, should consider options for a system of communicati ng the test history and status of cattle with the aim of developing a join t industry/government solution. Yes The issue is firmly on TBEG's agenda and t he Bovine TB Eradication Programme for England committed to develop risk-based trading options. We will work jointly and engage more widely with industry stakeholders to develop options for risk-based/informed trading during 2012 with a view to introducing changes by the end of the year. 8.33 We recommend to TBEG that owners of non-bovin e susceptible species (e.g. sheep, goats, pigs and camelids) should be part of the national TB eradication programme. To reflect the relatively lowe r risk presented by these animals, we recommend that a proportionate, risk-ba sed approach should be developed. Yes Non-bovine species are included in our comprehensive TB Eradication Programme and we have adopted or are developin g measures proportionate to t he risk. These include: raising awareness of abattoir meat in spectors (April/May 2011) and private vets undertaking post mortems in farmed animals (article planned for 'In Practice' Summer 2012); raising keeper awareness to the risks of TB in their flock or herd and measures to improve bio-security (sheep and goats completed Autumn 2011); reviewing the current policy of movement restrictions in the wake of a suspected TB outbreak (to be completed by March 2012); and reviewing compensation arrangements (March 2012). Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 106 Animal welfare Welfare of animals at slaughter 8.39 We recommend that an authorised veterin ary surgeon should be able to take account of supplementary evidence availabl e about an applicant's competence and skills from another veterinarian. We recommend that this change should be implemented in advance of the new welfare-a t-slaughter rules that come into effect on 01 January 2013. Yes We have in place arrangements with 'Improve the Food and Drink Skills Council' to develop assessments for the Certificate of Co mpetence requirements in the new EU rules and to obtain Ofqual accreditation. This wo rk is being done in consultation with the industry and animal welfare organisations. We ant icipate that the asse ssment strategy will allow assessment to be carri ed out in-house, where appropr iate, and that third party evidence could be used to inform the assessment process The new arrangements should be implemented during 2012 and we will provide further guidance and advice on how to obtain a Certif icate of Competence bef ore the new welfare at slaughter rules come into effect on 1 January 2013. 8.40 We recommend that Ministers consider changing the law now to enable the use of carbon dioxide for poultry slaughter ra ther than wait until 2013: the savings involved would appear to represent a 'c ompelling reason' for early transposition (see paragraph 2.49). Yes We have consulted on changes to the Welf are of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 to permit the use of biphasic carbon dioxide gas mixtures for the slaughter of poultry. Some concerns were raised about the welfare implications of the proposed new gas mixtures and these are being considered further bef ore a final decision is made on whether to amend the current legislation before 2013. Welfare of animals during transport 8.41 We recommend that industry, in c onsultation with Government, bring together existing guidance on fitness for transport so that there is a common reference for producer, haulier and regulator . Yes The Task Force recommended that industry take the lead in bringing together existing non-official guidance to propose a common re ference and understanding. This would be an opportunity to take account of practical experience in consi dering this often difficult and Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 107 subjective judgement. As this is of inte rest to the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and local authorities it may be a candidate for identifying issues at local level in the first instance 8.42 To improve information about the handli ng process, we recommend that, if requested by the exporter, the issuing ag ency informs them of the date on which the documentation will be sent to th e veterinary officer for completion . Yes AHVLA aim to issue Export Health Certificat ion 3-5 days before the export date to the Official Veterinarian to sign on AHVLA's behalf. An exporter can contact the Specialist Service Centre - Exports to find ou t when their paperwork will be processed. To improve the speed and quality of certification, funding has been requested to develop a replacement for AHVLA's Centaur and Unicorn systems in 2012/13. The aim is to provide an online self-service portal for applications and guidance so that exporters will be able to request clearances via a single online applic ation process. This will also reduce duplication for Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) customers who also require an Export Health Certificate. Fallen stock/disposal/on-farm burial 8.44 We recommend: the continued development and adoption of methods of containing stock prior to disposal and bio-reduction; and continuing to seek a derogation for burial of small farm animals. Yes We support farmers having greater choice when disposing of fallen stock than is currently permitted by the EU Animal By-Product Regulations if it can be dem onstrated that the alternatives are safe. Two reviews are in place to help us develop our evidence: The Welsh Government has sponsored research at Bangor University into use of bio-reducers (vessels for storing an imal carcasses pending disposal); and Defra has sponsored research into the risks from Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) transmission in the soil and results are expected later this year to help consideration of relaxation of the rules banning burial of fallen stock. We intend to review the position later this ye ar as this evidence becomes available to see if it can support a case for seeking changes to the current EU controls. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 108 Animal health and veterinary medicines Availability of veterinary medicines 8.45 To address farmer concerns, we recommend that [the Veterinary Medicines Directorate] VMD and industry consider if ther e are additional ways of advising farmers of changes to the regulations Yes VMD will work with the National Farmers Union (NFU) and others to develop more effective ways of reaching farmers: they have already consolidated some Guidance Notes (October 2011) and written articles in trade and farming publications. VMD has approximately 450 approved on-farm manufacturers of medicated feed. If there are any significant changes that affect farmers, VMD will write to them. VMD wil l also provide plain language articles for the wider fa rming sector through their websit e and the farming press. As set out under recommendations 5.21, we will consider how to co-ordinate updates to guidance. 8.46 We recommend that the regulator shoul d continue to seek every opportunity in EU discussion to increase the availability of treatments by adopting regulatory approval processes to allow products to be approved for use across the EU. Yes VMD will continue to seek ways to improve t he availability of veterinary medicines. There is an EU-wide desire to improve the availability of medicines and the UK takes an active part in this initiative. There is already a mechanism whereby veterinary surgeons can use the 'cascade' to prevent unnecessary suffering in animals. The cascade allows vets to import products when no authorised medicine is available (veterinary or human) due to either lack of availability or supply iss ues with authorised products. The VMD has two import schemes: the Special Import Certificate (SIC) Scheme for veterinary medicinal products (VMP) authorised in another EU Member State; and the Special Treatment Ce rtificate (STC) Scheme fo r human products authorised in another EU Member State or , for veterinary or human pr oducts authorised in a third country. Farm veterinary medicines records 8.48 We recommend that the VMD should take steps to simplify record-keeping demands where the regul ation allows. We also recommend that the VMD pursues its policy of asking the European Commission to c onsider the extent of the records to be kept and to retain only those necessary for consumer safety and, on a proportionate basis, for animal safety. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 109 Yes VMD is pursuing simplification of record keepi ng as part of the revision of the Directive on Veterinary Medicines (Directive 2001/82). VMD has asked the Commission to consider that only those records which are necessary fo r consumer safety and, on a proportionate basis, for animal safety should be kept and retained. The review is expected to be completed in 2014 and VMD will work closely with farming and veterinary sectors to obtain changes that provide necessary safeguards and reduce burdens.Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 111 Part 9 Growing and crops EU fruit and vegetables producer organisation scheme Making the scheme work 9.09 We believe it essential for Defra and [the Rural Payments Agency] ( RPA) (in consultation with industry) to review the current [European Union] (EU) Fruit and Vegetables Producer Organisation scheme and make prompt changes to get this model right. Growers must also ensure th at they comply with the scheme rules and co-operate with Government so that the review is eff ectively and speedily executed. Yes We published additional guidance on criteria for the Fruit and Vegetables Producer Organisation scheme in March 2011. We pr oduced guidance in partnership with industry and the NFU which provides further ex planation and underst anding of the scheme requirements. We reviewed all UK Producer Organisations (POs) to determine their compliance with scheme rules and eligibility for ai d. This review concluded in September 2011 and the outcomes have been discussed indivi dually with POs. Suspended POs have been given up to a year to demonstrate compliance or adapt their procedures to achieve full recognition. Short-term recommendations (domestic level) 9.12 We recommend that POs use this guidance to consider whether they need to amend their operational and organisational structure to meet the scheme requirements. Yes The additional guidance we published in March 2011 will help clarify the scheme for POs. The RPA has also offered to work with suspended POs to help them understand how they can more effectively meet scheme requirements. Some POs have already started to implement changes. 9.13 We recommend that POs themselves provid e RPA with a much clearer picture of their operational practices and the evidence of how they meet the scheme requirements . Yes We welcome greater communica tion with POs, to enable us to help them meet scheme requirements and look forward to receiving their evidence. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 112 9.14 We recommend that members of those POs that do not comply with the scheme requirements should be encouraged to join existing compliant POs, and consideration should be given as to how Defra could facilitate this. Changing membership of a PO is a business dec ision for individual growers and individual Producer Organisations. It would be inappropri ate for Defra to seek to influence such decisions. However, the RPA has been wo rking with suspended POs to help them understand the requirem ents for recognition. 9.15 We recommend that RPA staff responsib le for scheme administration should have the opportunity to gain an understandi ng of the fruit and vegetable industry and how PO businesses operate in it. This is something with which POs should assist. Yes We believe farm visits play an invaluable role in training our staff and we welcome the offer of assistance from POs in arranging farm visits. We want to work with POs to make sure we support them as much as we can. 9.16 Where problems arise, we recommend th at Defra, the RPA and POs work together immediately to solve them before they cause difficult ies for the scheme. Yes We will engage POs at the earliest stage when pr oblems occur. We have already taken steps, for example, through the guidance working group to improve the relationship and communication that exists betw een Government and growers. 9.17 We recommend that Government and indu stry should work together to improve communication with POs about the reasons for the separate audit processes, and the auditing of the inspections themselves. Government should seek to improve the efficiency of the audi t process while remaining consistent with EU requirements. Yes We agree that clarity of communication is crucial. In 2010 and 2011, we held meetings with POs, including staff responsible for aud iting who explained the audit process and how inspections are audited. Auditors were also part of the industry/Go vernment \"additional guidance\" working group to help with formulating the guidance and sharing how auditors work. We have engaged in Brussels with auditors from other Member States to increase our understanding of the process. We will continue to engage with EU auditors about the challenges the legislation pr esents and work with other Member States to lobby for improvements to make things easier. Howe ver, we must be clear that the EU audit Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 113 processes remain challenging, both in terms of the lengthy timescale from initial audit through to the auditors final decision, and also the difficulties of influencing current opinion. Longer-term recommendations (EU level) 9.18 We recommend that: the European Commission and auditors purs ue consistent interpretation of the scheme's regulations across the 27 Member States; the European Commission works with in dustry and Member States to draft guidance on interpreting scheme legislation; the European Commission considers developing a 'compliance promotion initiative' along the lines developed by the Directorate-General for the Environment on other regulatory frameworks; and Defra continues its dialogue with Me mber States who have faced similar problems, in order to draw together an approach that encourages clarity and consistency of application of the scheme rules. Yes We will seek consistency, simplicity and clar ity from the European Commission. This will allow our growers to benefit from the scheme and reduce the neg ative impact of audits on taxpayers, through the possibility of disallowance. We have established a group of Northern Member States to discuss POs and audit issues, and will continue to work collaboratively to make progre ss. This group is analysing t he problems each country faces to identify common issues, and we will use this information to decide on the most effective way to influence the Commission. We are al so working to ensure Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform plans reflect the need for clarity and simplicity based on our and other Member States' experiences of administering the PO Scheme. Pesticides Dealing with change 9.25 It is essential for the Government, pesticides manufacturers and distributors, and farming industry associations to clear ly communicate these legislative changes to pesticide users. In line with our strategic recommendation on post- implementation review (p aragraph 2.49) and the Government's commitment to sunsetting (paragraph 2.09), we recomme nd a review of the new legislative framework after it has bedded in. Yes We let pesticides users know about changes to regulatory requirements in several different ways, including updates to the website of th e Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) and directly informing interested parties. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 114 Our domestic law, which gives e ffect to the EU regulation, in cludes a provision for review every five years. We will include a similar revi ew clause in the legislation to implement the EU Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. In addition, the new EU legislation requi res the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council by late 2014. The UK will contribute to this review, focusing on the effectiveness, practicality, costs and benefits of the regi me as a whole. We are gathering evidence, particularly on the scope for simplifying the regime, to put the UK in a position to contribute to the EU debat e well ahead of the Commission's report. 9.26 We are concerned that the EU pestic ides legislation is moving towards a hazard-based approach to regulation rather than one based on risk. We believe that this change is fundamentally contrary to good practice and the principles of better regulation. We are aware th at the UK Government has repeatedly expressed this view and we reinforce its message. Yes We will continue to press this message. Howe ver, to move away from a hazard-based approach we need to get political agreement from the Commissi on, many Member States, and members of the European Parlia ment so that we can amend the EU legislation. To get this agreement, we will need to effect substantia l changes in the positions of these parties. We are working on this. The issue of hazard versus risk assessment goes beyond pesticides and both the Government's and Defra' s Chief Scientific Advisers are engaging at a high level to influence EU thinking in our favour. In the meantime, we are working to limit the impacts of the haz ard-based elements of pesticides legislation which have been introduc ed despite UK opposition. A good example of this is our initiative with the Germ an authorities on the devel opment of endocrine disruptor criteria, where we have proposed an evidence-based and practical approach to identifying those compounds which pose a real risk. Approvals 9.31 We support the move to a zonal approach to approvals that will take effect in June 2011 as a result of the new EU Re gulation 1107/2009. We recommend that the UK should press for the development of this approach so that, ultimately, approvals (including for minor uses) in other Memb er States should immediately be available for use in the UK, and vice versa. Yes We agree that the zonal approach would create a more level playing field for approvals. To this end, we are closely involved in dev eloping the arrangements to support the new zonal approach and chair an expert group on behalf of the European Commission to achieve this. We are a long way from the point where approvals will be fully harmonised Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 115 within EU zones, but we are currently consid ering ways in which other Member States' approvals can be recognised in the UK ahead of this. 9.33 We recommend that the Government shoul d support the introduction of such an EU fund for minor use approvals. On [Specific Off-Label Approval] (SOLAs ), we recommend that re-registration in groups is allowed, and incur a single fee. Under consideration We fully agree that the cost and availability of approvals for mi nor uses are major concerns for growers and that joint action within the EU will be part of the answer. We are waiting for the Commission's report to the Council and Parliament on an EU fund for minor uses, which is now due. The degree to which we can support some form of fund depends on the detail of the Commission's proposal and the net benefit to the UK from any fund. The SOLA scheme allows approval to be gained for minor uses even when the pesticide manufacturer is not prepared to invest in th is approval. A fee is charged for each risk assessment. So, when the Horticultura l Development Company (HDC) submits applications to re-register their existing off-l abel approvals, there is a charge for each crop or crop group to reflect t he fact that different cons umer, operator exposure and environmental risk assessments may be required for each. However, where possible, a single risk assessment is carried out to cover similar crops and a single fee is charged for the group. Our consultation in 2010 found littl e support for subsidising off-labels from other types of fee or from the general industry charge, as used to be the case. We will continue to engage with industry. 9.34 We believe there remains room for signi ficant improvement in the speed of the approvals process. Yes We agree that the approvals process needs to be as swift and consistent as possible, allowing companies to plan the process of introducing new or updated products. As the Task Force notes, the UK currently compares ve ry favourably in these respects with other Member States, but we will keep these procedur es under review. However EU regulation is exacting and, in many cases, timescale s depend on the activities of other Member States, EU agencies and institutio ns. We continue to work with those bodies to simplify and speed up processes. 9.35 We recommend that CRD should actively work for simple interpretation of regulation on bio-pesticides. In particular, we recomme nd that regulation of the plant protection uses of pest-specific semio-chemicals, including the above uses, should be simplified to expedite thei r development, commercialisation and adoption. We will review our approach to bio-pesticides so we get the right balance between legal requirements, risk assessmen t, general Government policy on regulation and cost recovery within the aut horisations system. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 116 As a first step, a research study will review the issues surrounding bio-pesticides and help frame our long-term response to the Sustainable Use Directive's provisions. We plan to complete the review of our approach to bio- pesticides by autumn 2012. In the meantime, we are already making some changes to t he current Bio-pesticides Scheme including facilitating the initial evaluat ion of bio-pesticide applicat ions, which will improve the efficiency of the full application process. Withdrawals 9.37 Where the active ingredient itself rema ins safe to use (and thus there is no risk to health or environment), we recomme nd that growers be a llowed a significant grace period to use up their stock of pesticides following withdrawal. Yes We agree that normal use is often the best way to dispose of stocks. To allow this, we must have significant grace periods which align with the normal season of use. For example, an approval for a product used bet ween May and September can continue to be used through to September, even if it is officially withdrawn in June. The Task Force report recognises that this will require negotiation within the EU. Given that these periods are laid down in a Regulat ion of the Council and adopted in Parliament in 2009 after several years of negotiation, ther e is no realistic prospect of a change in the short term. However, we will continue to hi ghlight problems as they occur and will tackle the issue in the scheduled review of the regulat ion in 2014. 9.38 We recommend that more could be done nationally to communicate the cut- off dates throughout the industry so that growers are clearer on the deadline for using up approved products. We recommend that trade associations, suppliers and other representative bodies take responsibility for cascading this pesticides newsletter more widely. Yes We support the Task Force's push for better co mmunication and will remain in close touch with key industry bodies on whether CRD can take further action to support their initiatives. Pesticides use and harmonisation of worker exposure 9.40 We recommend that the CRD supports th e development of new guidance by the European Food Safety Authority which aims to harmonise exposure assessment methods. We endorse CRD and industry's effo rts to get data needed to refine worker exposure assessments and ju stify increased harmonisation. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 117 We have helped the European Food Safety Aut hority (EFSA) to develop new guidance and will help EFSA finalise it. The Commission and Member States have now endorsed the principles in this draft guidance. We are also supporting other initiatives that aim to improve harmonised databases and models which underpin exposure assessment. These include the EU BROWSE project (expected to be completed in the next couple of years) and, on a shorter time scale, a German initiati ve to provide an interim update to the operator exposure database. We are working in partnership with the horticultural sector to investigate how industry can provide information on work practices and clot hing to reduce potential contact with treated crops. This will allow exposure assessments to be realistic and to make allowance for reductions in exposure, while ensuring that the health of workers is pr otected. Discussions have begun and we are considering specific case examples received from the industry. Engagement between in dustry and Government 9.41 We recommend that CRD and industry establish an industry-only route of communicating sensitive informati on, to allow issues to be raised confidentially at an early stage. We regularly engage with a variety of industr y groups both individually, collectively and with other stakeholders present. We have offe red to meet grower s' representatives separately to discuss matters of specific relevanc e to them or of particular sensitivity. We welcome any ideas on how industry th ink communication can be improved. Minor issues 9.43 We recommend that manufacturers ensure that labels are clear and consistent with CRD guidance in its Labelling handbook . Yes We commend this suggestion to pesticide manufacturers. 9.44 We propose an online central register fo r datasheets for pesticides, so that the requirements for control of substances hazardous to health (COSHH) regulations could be fulfilled digitally rather than on paper. We recommend that CRD and industry together establish how this might best be achieved. Yes We will ask the Pesticides Forum (a group of st akeholders) to look at this in the first instance. This is planned fo r the meeting in February 2012. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 118 Licensing of industrial hemp 9.50 We recommend that the Home Office should immediately establish the [Tetrahydrocannabinol] ( THC)-content below which Cannabis sativa varieties can be considered to be safe and where its cult ivation cannot be considered as intended for drugs use (a figure of 0.5% has been suggested to us). The Misuse of Drugs Act should then be amended to only provide for licensing of Cannabis sativa cultivation of varieties with a THC l evel above the threshold. We do not intend to amend the Mi suse of Drugs Act. It is important that we maintain robust controls on the misuse of drugs and ma intain proportionate licensing regimes to licence specific uses and minimise the risk of di version of drugs to the illicit market. We consider that growing Cannabis sativa must be subject to an appropr iate level of control, and that exempting particular va rieties from the controls will create complexities which do not necessarily remove burdens from farmers w ho want to grow this crop. Indeed, doing so may compromise the integrity of our cannabis laws and increase both the administrative and financial burden on those enforcing the la ws. We accept that growing low-THC varieties of Cannabis sativa are a lower-risk activity and have created a light touch licensing mechanism, in conjunction with the industry and growers, which implements a proportionate level of control, keeping inspecti ons to an absolute minimum. We think that it is reasonable to charge for licences on a cost recovery basis. We have kept charges for licences to cultivate hemp to the minimum (\u00a3580 and a \u00a3326 renewal fee for subsequent years; this is much lower than licences for ot her purposes, including the cultivation of high THC Cannabis which cost from \u00a33, 133- 4700 for a first time issue). 9.51 We recommend that Home Office acts im mediately to ensure that a single general licence and inspection regime is ag reed until such a time as the Misuse of Drugs Act can be amended, in order to no t further restrict th e natural expansion of cultivation of this crop. We have already implemented a si mplified licensing regime for growing low-THC varieties of Cannabis sativa for special purposes, in particular fibre and seeds for hemp oil. This ensures individual growers are appropriately licensed to cultivate low-THC cannabis in accordance with the terms of their licence without commission of an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. We hav e minimised the number of ques tions that farmers need to complete in the licence application form ( only 7 out of 46 questions need to be answered for growing hemp). We do not routinely inspec t farms. Provided farmers provide us with the essential information required, and have appl ied for a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check, most farmers can be issued with a licence within a reasonable time-scale that allows them to start planting. We hav e encouraged feedback from industry organisations on the guidance we provide to help farmers th rough the online application process, which we have kept as simple as possible. In response to the Task Force recommendations we have considered how burdens can be reduced further. In September 2011, we offe red the industry organisations a 3-yearly licensing regime. This will considerably reduce the costs and paperwork for the industry. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 119 Some information, such as a location map of the field and confirmation of the low-THC variety being grown and its purpose of use, will still need to be provided on an annual basis. If the industry wants to move to a 3- year licence, we will work with organisations to finalise the arrangements so that the new regime can be implemented in time for this year's growing season. Farm-saved seed 9.55 We recommend that it should be possible to trade home-saved seed between holdings that are linked by being under th e same management, but understand that this may require renegotiation in the EU. The movement of Farm Saved Seed is rest ricted between holdings which are not owned by the same legal entity, and we understand this creates an administrative and cost burden for farmers. However removing the restriction would weaken intellectual property rights and potentially reduce plant breeders' income. We do not want to encourage practices that might result in a reduction of investment in plant breeding, undermine innovation, lower crop diversity and threaten the development of new, sustainable, UK specific seed. Renegotiating the restriction in EU would take considerable time and effort and have very little chance of success. The Food and Environment Research Agency (FER A) will continue to consult all interested stakeholders through its Advisory Forum. This will inform our position ahead of any European Commission proposals on changes to s eed marketing and plant breeders' rights legislation. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 121 Part 10 TSEs, meat hygiene inspections and food processing The Task Force made several recomm endations about food and meat hygiene inspections, which are the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The FSA is responding separately to those recommendations and their response will be published in parallel to this report at www.food.gov.uk The recommendations covered by the FSA res ponse are listed at the end of this Part. Meat hygiene controls 10.21 We recommend that there should be cons istency of approach in England and Scotland when dirty animals are presente d for slaughter, with the option of returning animals to the producer. Allowing animals to leave an abattoir alive presents significant disease risks. Prompt slaughter of animals once they arrive at the lairage minimises the time they are potentially exposed to, or may be infected by, any undetected virus. We know that the health status of animals arriving at abattoirs can be variable, and animals can be moved long distances for slaughter risking spread of disease over such distances if allowed to return. Put together, we consider the risk of allowing dirty anima ls to leave an abattoir alive is generally unacceptable. Our clean-animal policy is long-standi ng and it is clearly in the best interest of animals and owners if animals are not dispatched when co vered with mud, faeces , or bedding sticking to their body. Dealing with dirty animals that are unloaded at abattoirs presents operational problems. However, there are actions that can be taken to deal with dirty stock. These include leavi ng the animal in a dry holding area to clean themselves, or slaughtering at the end of the day to avoid contamination of slaughter-hall equipment. The removal of pelt covered in mud, faeces, bedding or other contamination within the food establishment is strongly discouraged. In terms of consistency, we understand the Scottish Government is reviewing its legislation and is likely to become far more di fficult for dirty animals to be allowed to return home from Scottish abattoirs in the future. Food safety controls 10.26 We recommend that Defra should engage constructively with this review [sampling milk for veterinary medicines residues] in order to ensure that the surveillance requirements are proportionate. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 122 We have pressed consistently for a more risk based approach to surveillance plans for all sectors, and will continue to do so now that the European Commi ssion has started the review of Council Directive 96/23, on m onitoring substances in animals and animal products in general. However, this is not expected to be complete until late 2013. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) will work with the FSA to purs ue the possibility of splitting milk samples to allow testing for both European Union (EU) hygiene controls and veterinary medicine residues to see if it will be possible to introduce such an arrangement from 1 April 2012. Frozen foods 10.33 In line with our strategic reco mmendation relating to Government industry partnership in EU negotiations, we enc ourage Defra to be more inclusive of comments received from the industry when preparing for negotiations. Yes We have put increasing emphasis on working together with industry to solve problems in recent years and are committed to building a closer partnership to achieve agreed outcomes. We will work in a closer partnership with industry on EU issues. We will engage stakeholders earlier in strategic discussions to establish priorities for influencing in the EU, and will include comments from industr y in preparations for negotiations. See our responses to the recommendations in Part 2 for more information on Government- industry partnerships. Labelling and information 10.40 We recommend that the Government s hould continue to seek to remove EU rules giving rise to the [voluntary] Beef Labelling Scheme . Yes We supported the European Commission's proposal made in 2011 to remove the existing notification and approval procedure for voluntar y beef labelling claims. This will reduce the administrative burden on producers and we will press the European Commission to make this change quickly. Sales, packaging and marketing 10.43 We recommend an earned recognition approach to reducing the inspections of poultry and egg producers. Existing assu rance arrangements should be used in each case to provide the necessary assurance and reduce burdens on the industry. Yes Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 123 See responses in Part 3 on inspections and ear ned recognition. We will consider how an earned recognition approach can be introduced to inspections of poultry and egg producers later in 2012. Recommendations to which the FS A is responding separately ( www.food.gov.uk ) TSEs and meat hygiene controls TSE controls and the EU TSE Roadmap2 10.05 We recommend that the Governmen t makes maximum use of existing derogations in EU legislation, fully s upports moves to more proportionate and risk- based [Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies] ( TSE) controls, and implements changes without delay once revised EU legislation comes into effect . 10.06 We recommend that official controls on removal in abattoirs are reviewed to ensure that they are fully risk-based (not 'tick-box') and take account of the [Food ( FBO ) record of compliance . 10.07 We recommend that the domestic TSE regulations are changed to take advantage of the existing derogation in EU law, which permits authorised cutting plants to harvest head meat. Meat hygiene controls 10.08 We recommend that the Government supports moves to more proportionate and risk-based meat hygiene controls a nd inspection that take account of earned recognition. 10.15 We recommend that consistently comp etent FBOs should be able to use accredited private sector bodies to provide meat inspection services. We recommend that the FSA should approve and designate these accredited private- sector bodies as control bodies . 10.17 We recommend that a joint industry/offi cial group with an independent Chair considers the criteria for accepting prov ision of meat inspection services by accredited third parties and reports to FSA as soon as possible . 10.19 We recommend greater use of cold inspection for small abattoirs . 10.20 We recommend that the FSA continues to work with industry to develop trials of innovative inspection arrangements. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 124 10.22 We recommend reviews of the following elements, where there appear to be issues of consistency, flexibility or propriety that should be addressed: consistency in permitted process for st erilising knives etc in abattoirs and cutting plants; inspection arrangements for udders and testicles; greater flexibility for FBO staff to insp ect and approve young animals and offal; arrangements for moving edible co-produc ts between licensed meat premises; adopting risk-based controls to regul ate the period between slaughter and minced-meat production; and the requirement for the FBO to collect fo rms relating to transporter cleaning of vehicles. Other food-processing issues Food safety controls 10.24 We recommend that the FSA should reope n discussions with the European Commission about the interpretation of legisl ation relating to antibiotic failures in milk. We recommend that Defra and the FS A should work with industry to establish a suitable way forward for disposing of milk that has failed antibiotic tests. 10.25 We recommend that Defra, the FSA a nd dairy trade associations should open discussions on how pasteurised milk from TB-reactor cows could safely enter the food chain. 10.27 We endorse [the European Food Safety Authorities] (EFSA's ) review into trichinella controls. Abattoirs and slaughterhouses 10.29 We recommend a dialogue between the haulage industry, abattoirs and the FSA to ensure that abattoirs provide vehic le-washing facilities in line with their obligations, and appropriate actions are taken against those that do not provide adequate facilities. 10.30 We recommend that the FSA should revi ew the opinion, including the risk assessment, and discuss with Ministers whether the UK should press for revised arrangements to allow for greater re cycling of water in slaughterhouses. Government Response to the Farming Regulation Task Force February 2012 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 125 Labelling and information 10.39 We recommend that existing informati on from contractual arrangements between producers and slaughterhouses, a nd/or farm assurance schemes, should replace the need for food chain information requirements. Import controls on 'high-risk' products of non-animal origin 10.45 We recommend that the FSA work with trade bodies, ports and designated laboratories to minimise delays of products produced to internationally recognised standards. The Food Standards Agency has responded pos itively to these recommendations.
