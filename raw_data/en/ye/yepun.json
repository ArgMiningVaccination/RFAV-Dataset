The curative mechanism of Chinese herbal medicine is compared with that of western medicine at the molecular level. The treatment mechanism of most Chinese herbal medicines is still not clear. How do we integrate Chinese herbal medicine compounds with modern medicine? Chinese herbal medicine drug-like prediction method is particularly important. A growing number of Chinese herbal source compounds are now widely used as drug-like compound candidates. An important way for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs is to discover potentially active compounds from related herbs in Chinese herbs. The methods for predicting the drug-like properties of Chinese herbal compounds include the virtual screening method, pharmacophore model method and machine learning method. In this paper, we focus on the prediction methods for the medicinal properties of Chinese herbal medicines. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the above three methods, and then introduce the specific steps of the virtual screening method. Finally, we present the prospect of the joint application of various methods.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-09-10", "cleaned_text": "Prediction Methods of Herbal Compounds in Chinese Medicinal Herbs [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules23092303](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules23092303) [Computational Analysis for Protein Structure 1. Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-23-02303), [2](#B2-molecules-23-02303), [3](#B3-molecules-23-02303)]. Under a broader definition, the source of Chinese herbal compounds is far wider than that. For the traditional Chinese herbal medicine preparation process, we need to use the processing technology. In the book \"Processing Guide\" by Zhang Rui, a medical scientist in the Qing Dynasty in China, there are records of processing Chinese herbal medicines by baking, cutting, frying, washing, soaking, bleaching, steaming, boiling, etc. [ [4](#B4-molecules-23-02303)]. The purpose is to eliminate or reduce the toxicity of the drug, enhance the efficacy, facilitate preparation and storage, and make the drug pure. It has been gradually found through modern Chinese pharmacy research that the processing technology does not only affect the traits of Chinese medicinal materials [ [5](#B5-molecules-23-02303)]. Through different processing techniques, a variety of active compounds in Chinese herbal medicines also undergo different chemical reactions, resulting in a wider range of active compounds. Similarly, in the process of decoction of traditional Chinese medicine, many active ingredients in the traditional Chinese medicine compound are dissolved in water, and these ingredients also undergo various chemical reactions in water to produce more compounds [ [6](#B6-molecules-23-02303), [7](#B7-molecules-23-02303)]. As far as it is known, Chinese herbal medicines often contain more than one hundred active compounds. For example, the number of active compounds currently known in the traditional Chinese medicine compound Liuwei Dihuang Pill is 183 [ [8](#B8-molecules-23-02303)]. Of course, in such a large number of active compounds of traditional Chinese medicine, the active ingredients and toxic ingredients coexist. How to find a better and faster method to predict the drug-like properties of the active compounds of traditional Chinese medicines? This has become an important task for Chinese medicine R&D workers in the new era. [9](#B9-molecules-23-02303)]. SimhadriVsdna N. et al. studied Sole shine formulations for human dermatophytosis, a mixture of various plant extracts [ [10](#B10-molecules-23-02303)]. Nearly 20 compounds were analyzed by GC-MS, and two important compounds were identified by molecular docking. Studies have shown that compounds derived from natural products are more active than compounds of other origins. After years of research and development in drug production, researchers have developed a variety of methods for predicting drug-likeness, such as virtual screening methods, pharmacophore model methods, and machine learning algorithms, which are widely used in various types of compounds [ [11](#B11-molecules-23-02303), [12](#B12-molecules-23-02303), [13](#B13-molecules-23-02303), [14](#B14-molecules-23-02303), [15](#B15-molecules-23-02303)]. The prediction of medicinal properties also has a good effect on the prediction of the drug-like properties of Chinese herbal medicine-derived compounds. [16](#B16-molecules-23-02303), [17](#B17-molecules-23-02303)]. This article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these three methods, and introduces the detailed steps of the virtual screening method. Through the above research, the research prospects in this field are gradually determined. 2. Virtual Screening Technology [18](#B18-molecules-23-02303)]. Recently, a variety of prediction methods based on virtual screening have been created. Li Xiaoyi et al. proposed a research idea to reduce adverse drug reactions by lowering the pKa value of the nitrogen atom in the pyrimidine ring [ [19](#B19-molecules-23-02303)]. The establishment of molecular data sets follows certain standards, and virtual screening is used to select molecules with the desired pKa values. This method was used to screen out candidate drugs with fewer adverse reactions. Azad L. et al. used a novel heterocyclic derivative as a lead compound to perform virtual screening on 27 compounds previously screened to develop an effective anticancer drug [ [20](#B20-molecules-23-02303)]. Compared with other methods, the virtual screening method is more stable and operable for the prediction of Chinese herbal compounds. It distinguishes between active and inactive compounds and is not as dependent on the training set as machine learning methods, while being more accurate. Virtual screening is also a focused and contextual screening method for drug-like compounds [ [21](#B21-molecules-23-02303)]. First, we need to be clear that the basic task of drug development is to find an active compound that interacts with and corrects a specific drug target. However, drug targets are usually task-type proteins that perform the physiological activities of cells, and drugs are small molecules that can bind to the characteristic regions of proteins and control their function [ [22](#B22-molecules-23-02303), [23](#B23-molecules-23-02303)]. As shown in [Figure 1](#molecules-23-02303-f001), the structure of compounds released in recent years is increasing year by year [ [24](#B24-molecules-23-02303)]. The rapid development of virtual screening has far exceeded expectations and is gradually enriching the treasure trove of drug data [ [25](#B25-molecules-23-02303), [26](#B26-molecules-23-02303)]. Due to its high throughput, low cost and wide application, the virtual screening technology is consistent with the multi-target and multi-channel characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine compound treatment. Therefore, it is the most basic technology in the prediction of the drug-like properties of traditional Chinese medicine compounds. [Table 1](#molecules-23-02303-t001). 2.1. Target Selection [31](#B31-molecules-23-02303)]. Drug acceptability refers to the ability of this protein to bind drug-like molecules [ [32](#B32-molecules-23-02303), [33](#B33-molecules-23-02303)]. However, it is not usually known whether a ligand can bind to a target protein. In these cases, some calculation tools are needed to calculate and characterize potential binding sites. These algorithms are typically based on geometric features or calculate the interaction energy of the ligand with the acceptor. At present, these two types of algorithms have their own advantages and disadvantages, but based on these two algorithms, 95% of the binding sites can be calculated [ [34](#B34-molecules-23-02303), [35](#B35-molecules-23-02303)]. On the basis of the above, the second step requires preparation of the target. The target standard preparation process mainly includes removing the solvent, removing the ligand molecule, adding a hydrogen atom to establish a bonding sequence, and forming a charge. In general, the preparation of the target greatly affects the enrichment of the final result of the virtual screening. 2.2. Ligand Selection [36](#B36-molecules-23-02303), [37](#B37-molecules-23-02303)], the database is a Chinese medicine chemical database, which mainly includes the structure of Chinese herbal medicine-derived compounds. [38](#B38-molecules-23-02303), [39](#B39-molecules-23-02303)]. Methods for reducing the number of ligands in a database are generally classified into the simple counting method and the functional group filter method [ [40](#B40-molecules-23-02303), [41](#B41-molecules-23-02303)]. [27](#B27-molecules-23-02303)]. After the introduction of the five rules, the theory has undergone many revisions and revisions, and the system is now complete. [42](#B42-molecules-23-02303)]. Functional group filters, as the name suggests, remove the compound that is not suitable for use in a drug. These functional groups often include toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic functional groups; as well as inorganic, insoluble, functional groups. [43](#B43-molecules-23-02303)]. 2.3. Molecular Docking [44](#B44-molecules-23-02303), [45](#B45-molecules-23-02303)]. At the heart of the search algorithm is the calculation of the compounds in different poses to fit the ligand into the binding site of the receptor. The core of the scoring function is to sort and score the different poses and positions generated by the search algorithm for the ligand. This scoring value is idealized to represent the thermodynamic values of the interaction between the acceptor and the ligand. In practical research, the molecular docking score is widely used [ [46](#B46-molecules-23-02303)]. Fong P. et al. used molecular docking scores to evaluate the possibility of cordycepin and its derivatives as therapeutic agents for endometrial cancer [ [28](#B28-molecules-23-02303)]. In the study of molecular docking evaluation of 31 compounds, the compound numbered MRS5698 was finally successfully screened as a candidate molecule. The molecule has drug molecular characteristics and is highly safe. Ai H. et al. conducted a study on the inhibition of various influenza viruses by Chinese medicine [ [29](#B29-molecules-23-02303)]. The study utilizes structure-based molecular docking techniques to screen for more than 10,000 molecular structures from the two databases of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, from which molecular structures with potential target inhibitors are obtained. The reverse docking technique is then used to verify the tightness of the resulting molecular structure. Finally, 22 molecules capable of stably binding to the target molecule were obtained. 2.4. Virtual Screening Validation [47](#B47-molecules-23-02303)]. [48](#B48-molecules-23-02303)]. Because of this, the re-docking test is also associated with the quality of the scoring function used in conjunction with the search algorithm. [49](#B49-molecules-23-02303)]. IC50 refers to the semi-inhibitory concentration of the antagonist being measured. It can indicate that a drug or substance (inhibitor) is half the amount that inhibits certain biological processes (or certain substances contained in the procedure, such as enzymes, cellular receptors, or microorganisms) [ [50](#B50-molecules-23-02303), [51](#B51-molecules-23-02303)]. Independent of the scoring unit, higher precision means an increased correlation with the binding affinity of the molecule. Under the guidance of this idea, a linear fit between the score and the experimental value allows prediction of the quality of the virtual screening, since a good fit means that the relative affinities of a series of ligands are well reproduced. The commonly used method is the least squares method, which produces a linear regression equation in which the r free value indicates the quality of the fit. This statistical variable can be compared and selected between different scoring functions, and can be extended to other parameters applied in the virtual filter. [52](#B52-molecules-23-02303), [53](#B53-molecules-23-02303), [54](#B54-molecules-23-02303), [55](#B55-molecules-23-02303)]. The test results of 21 scoring functions in CASF are shown in [Figure 2](#molecules-23-02303-f002). 2.5. Post-Testing and Processing [56](#B56-molecules-23-02303)]. [57](#B57-molecules-23-02303), [58](#B58-molecules-23-02303)]. However, for large-scale detection, it is obvious that this method is not realistic. In order to solve this problem, we introduced the concept of a polymeric molecule, which is obviously clustering compounds that are similar to each other in the final hit list, and then visually detecting the representative compounds therein [ [59](#B59-molecules-23-02303)]. [30](#B30-molecules-23-02303)]. On the protein, it may be a good candidate for inhibiting the Ebola virus. 3. Introduce Other Prediction Methods of Herbal Compounds in Chinese Medicinal Herbs 3.1. Pharmacophore Model [60](#B60-molecules-23-02303), [61](#B61-molecules-23-02303), [62](#B62-molecules-23-02303)]. [63](#B63-molecules-23-02303)]. Their research focused on the analysis and comparison of a large number of drug molecular structures, and concluded that drug molecules have a large degree of structural conservation [ [64](#B64-molecules-23-02303)]. The structurally conservative meaning is that certain structures are very similar between drug molecules [ [65](#B65-molecules-23-02303)]. Although this method can promote the discovery of lead compounds to some extent, it is difficult to ensure that molecules that are not structurally conserved have no drug-like properties. Similarly, this kind of research cannot form a relatively complete set of identification rules. Wang et al. combined statistically relevant methods to compare a variety of predicted molecules with known drug molecules for more comprehensive attributes [ [66](#B66-molecules-23-02303)]. Research suggests that this analogy can preliminarily determine whether a molecule is drug-like. The number of samples in this study is large, and the results have a certain degree of credibility. The study found that the currently marketed drugs and the drug molecules in clinical trials have more than 50% similarity compared to the top50 molecular fragments in the statistical table [ [67](#B67-molecules-23-02303)]. By comparing the ratios of different compound molecular fragment types in drug/drug databases and non-pharmaceutical databases, it is possible to determine to some extent which substructure fragments have better drug-like properties. [68](#B68-molecules-23-02303)]. Starosyla et al. studied a three-dimensional pharmacophore model for the development of inhibitors of apoptosis signaling regulator 1 (ASK1), called the PharmaGistprogram [ [69](#B69-molecules-23-02303)]. The location of the pharmacophore features in the model corresponds to the conformation of the ASK1 high activity inhibitor, which interacts with the binding site of ASK1. The resulting pharmacophore model accurately predicts both active and inactive compounds and can be used to discover virtual screening of novel ASK1 inhibitors. Several representative composite structures of the PharmaGistpharmacophore model development training set are shown in [Figure 3](#molecules-23-02303-f003). In order to design a new pharmacophore model with cytotoxicity against K562 cells, Vrontaki et al. generated a 3D pharmacophore model and a three-dimensional structure-activity relationship model study of 33 novel Abl kinase inhibitors [ [70](#B70-molecules-23-02303)]. The benzylthiochalcone synthesized by the team is a five-point pharmacophore with a hydrogen bond acceptor, two hydrophobic groups and two aromatic rings as pharmacophores. The pharmacophore model can also be used for the alignment of 33 compounds in the CoMFA/CoMSIA assay. Shang J. et al. used chemical informatics to study the physical and chemical structures and pharmacological pharmacophores of terrestrial and marine natural products, and found that most terrestrial natural products and marine natural products have drug-like characteristics [ [71](#B71-molecules-23-02303)]. Marine natural products are more medicinal. Terrestrial and marine natural products have a great potential to become drug guides and even drug candidates. [Table 2](#molecules-23-02303-t002). 3.2. Machine Learning Method [72](#B72-molecules-23-02303)]. Medical robots developed by Watson and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team have applied artificial neural networks to disease prediction research [ [73](#B73-molecules-23-02303)]. This once again brings machine learning to the public eye. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in many fields, such as financial analysis, aerospace industry, autonomous driving technology, health care [ [74](#B74-molecules-23-02303)], bioinformatics [ [75](#B75-molecules-23-02303)], etc. Numerous machine learning methods have also been applied to the study of compound drug prediction, and these methods have shown good results. Machine learning methods use mathematical modelling to find correlations between specific activities or classifications of a group of compounds and their characteristics [ [76](#B76-molecules-23-02303)]. There are several methods currently used: Support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), genetic [ [77](#B77-molecules-23-02303), [78](#B78-molecules-23-02303), [79](#B79-molecules-23-02303), [80](#B80-molecules-23-02303)]. [81](#B81-molecules-23-02303)]. The five compounds screened in this study were effective in mouse model experiments, and the best-performing compounds had a cure success rate of 85.2%. [82](#B82-molecules-23-02303)]. The most widely accepted method at present is the support vector machine method, which is superior to most supervised learning algorithms. It has now been widely adopted for compound drug analysis. The main advantage of the support vector machine method is that the accuracy is improved by a step compared to the neural network algorithm and the recursive segmentation algorithm. Previous studies have used neural networks and support vector machines to construct two network models, and then compare the accuracy of the two. The accuracy of support vector machines is significantly higher than that of neural networks. The relevant experimental data is that the accuracy of the support vector machine algorithm for the training set and the test set is 84.9% and 75.0%, respectively, while the accuracy of the neural network algorithm is 76.6% and 60.8%, respectively. In recent years, research has generally not been limited to a single machine learning method, and multiple methods are often combined to propose a new prediction model. Yosipof et al. used a variety of different machine learning methods to form a new integrated learning method called AL Boost [ [83](#B83-molecules-23-02303)]. The AL Boost model combines decision trees, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbor (kNN), and logistic regression models. The actual test shows that the AL Boost prediction model can not only improve the predictive power, but also reduce the bias. Its resolution exceeds 0.81, which has higher sensitivity and specificity than a single model. MaZiRenWan is a Chinese herbal medicine that can effectively relieve functional constipation. Tao Huang et al. analyzed the active compounds in MaZiRenWan and the biological targets they act on using a methodological system called focused network pharmacology [ [84](#B84-molecules-23-02303)]. The method incorporates a variety of machine learning methods for predicting possible targets for representative compounds. Experiments have shown that active compounds in MaZiRenWan can enhance colonic peristalsis by acting on multiple targets. Ginkgo biloba has a wide range of applications in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Chinese medicine, but the mechanism of action of its active ingredients is not clear. Yingfeng Yang et al. used a machine-based C-P network analysis and C-P-T network analysis method to predict and analyze the extracted active compounds [ [85](#B85-molecules-23-02303)]. The experiment successfully explained the mechanism of action of Ginkgo biloba leaves for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. [86](#B86-molecules-23-02303)]. Current research has found that the types of molecules in training, including the number and relative balance of drug-like and non-drug-like molecules, have a significant impact on the predictive performance of the algorithm in the future. The application examples mentioned above are summarized in [Table 3](#molecules-23-02303-t003). 4.
