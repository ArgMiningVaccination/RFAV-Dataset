Corpora)**: A collection of written or spoken texts assembled for the purpose of studying language --- ### There are many different corpora out there. --- ## The Brown Corpus ~2,000,000 words of English fiction, books, humor, textbooks, reporting, and gov't docs --- ## The Callhome Corpus Transcripts of 120 phone conversations (18.3 hours of speech) --- ## The Switchboard Corpus 2430 conversations (~3,000,000 words of text) from phone calls --- ## The Broadcast News Corpus ~1,243,526 words transcribed from various broadcast news sources --- ## The EnronSent Corpus 96,106 email messages (~13,000,000 words) from the Enron Corporate Email Servers --- ## The Google Books Corpus All the text from every book in the \"Google Books\" service --- ## The Google Corpus The entire internet. At your fingertips --- ## The Lena Corpus Thousands of hours of recorded child and child- directed speech --- ## The Penn Treebank A large corpus of syntactically marked data (showing the tree structure of sentences) --- ## The Callhome Speech Corpus This corpus actually contains sound files, useful for speech geeks like myself --- ### (and many, many, *many* more) --- ### So, that's a bunch of data. How do you actually ask your question? --- ## How to run a corpus search: - 1) Figure out where you want to look (which corpora) - 2) Figure out exactly what you want to search for - 3) Find where and when it occurs - 4) Sift through the results --- ## So, to find out if leveraging is corporate-speak, I want to look... - 1) Someplace businessy (EnronSent) - 2) Someplace not businessy (CallHome) - **Hypothesis: will occur more often in business-related corpora** --- ## What would I need to look for? - leverage? - leveraged? - leverages - leveraging --- ## How would I ask the computer to find that? - Get your geek on by logging into a corpus server - \"Find any lines in which EITHER \"leverages\" OR \"leveraging\" occurs `egrep \"leverages|leveraging\" yourcorpus` - (This all looks complicated, but it gets easier quickly, and there's usually someone around to help.) --- ## This gives you numbers! - Callhome Corpus: 0 Results - EnronSent Corpus: 61 results - By doing statistical analysis on your searches, you can measure whether the data really shows what you claim it does - And move beyond opinion --- > \"Leverage was used as a verb 61 times in the Enron corpus, and none at all in the equally large callhome corpus.\" ### Case Closed. Booyeah. --- Counting word frequency is a very powerful tool! --- # n-Grams --- ### What is an n-gram? - An n-gram is a sequence of words from a sample of text or speech - 1 word is a 'unigram', 2 is a 'bigram', 3 is a 'trigram'... - Counting words is relatively inexpensive - Especially relative to syntactic parsing, etc... --- ### We just did a unigram search - \"How often does word X occur alone in corpus Y?\" - These can be very powerful with many corpora - What if we could search through history with a corpus search to see how words are used over time? --- ## Enter Google Ngrams https://books.google.com/ngrams --- ### --- ### Walk --- ### Eat/Sleep/Walk --- ### Some words, you might expect to change over time --- ### Automobile --- ### Computer --- ### Laptop --- ### Download --- ### Google --- ### Confederacy --- ### Some words are falling out of use --- ### Bilious --- ### Blackguard --- ### Retarded --- ### Society is represented in distributions --- ### Nazi --- ### War --- ### Color Terms --- ### Sex --- ### Let's play a game! --- Clue: Type of person (belonging to a certain group or culture) - Hippy --- Clue: Country - USSR --- Clue: Home/Office Technology - Typewriter --- Clue: Military Technology - Atomic Bomb --- Clue: Transportation Technology - Rocket --- Clue: Food Product - Spam --- ### Warring Words --- ### Vitriol vs. Sulfuric Acid --- ### Aeroplane vs. Airplane --- ### VHS vs. DVD --- ### Handicapped vs. Disabled --- ### Flammable vs. Inflammable --- ### Unigrams are interesting! - ... and they can give us lots of good information - But bigrams and trigrams give much more interesting information about language --- ### Why? - Counting how often word pairs occur together in a corpus gives us more than just counts - \"What is the probability of word X following word Y?\" --- ### These Probabilities tell us about language - \"You are\" is more likely than \"You is\" - more likely than more likely than \"Would did\" - \"By and\" is, by and large, followed by \"large\" - **n-grams provide a very simple *language model* which we can do inference from** --- ### These probabilities tell us about the world - We all have probability models for language - \"Let's go _______\" - \"Take But snow\" or \"Chinese Ceiling\" not so much - **Probable pairings tell us something about how the world works** --- ### n-grams are *really* useful - Provide some grammatical information - \"What word forms regularly occur together?\" - Provide some real-world information - \"What are people most commonly talking about?\" - Inexpensive to generate --- ### n-gram uses in the real world - Typo detection - \"I made a bog mistake\" - \"She got lost in a peat big\" - Speech recognition - \"I need a walk for exercise\" - \"I need a wok for stir fry\" - Sentiment analysis - How often do \"Toyota\" and \"sucks\" co-occur relative Sociolinguistic n-gramming - \"How often is word X used to describe black athletes vs. white athletes?\" - \"Is Unigram frequency of these words predicted by subject race?\" - Words like \"Aggressive\", \"Angry\", \"Unstoppable\" and \"Ferocious\" are preferentially applied to black athletes - Work is ongoing - c.f Wright 2017, The Reflection and Reification of Racialized Language in Popular Media --- ## ... and all of this from counting words! - But we can go deeper! --- # Part 2 ## Natural language processing is really useful --- ## NLP - Natural Language Processing Teaching computers to \"understand\" human language - NLP often uses more sophisticated techniques and language models to describe corpora - n-grams are a starting point, but now we'll go beyond --- ## Machine Learning in easy steps: - 1) Get a corpus of data and annotate it to tell the computer what's going on in one specific domain - 2) \"Train\" the computer by letting it analyze that corpus using a number of tools - 3) Give it a different corpus, have it try to guess what's going on and answer questions - 4) Refine the programming, then get another corpus and annotate it to tell the computer what's going on.. - (Repeat) --- ## What kinds of tools are used? --- ### Tokenizer Breaks sentences into individual words - (breaks,sentences,into,individual,words) --- ### Part of Speech Taggers Labels words with grammatical into syntactic representations for analysis. ~~~~(ROOT (S (NP (DT This)) (VP (VBZ turns) (NP (NNS sentences)) (PP (IN into) (NP (NP (JJ syntactic) (NNS representations)) (PP (IN for) (NP (NN analysis)))))) (. .)))~~~~ --- ### Semantic Frame Annotations \"John boldly threw the stick at the polar bear.\" - Thrower: John - Object Thrown: Stick - Target: Polar Bear - Manner: Boldly --- ### Coreference/Anaphora \"John boldly threw the stick at the polar bear. The beast cast it aside then enjoyed a snack.\" - \"John[1] boldly threw the stick[2] at the polar bear[3]. The beast[3] cast it[2] aside then enjoyed a snack[1].\" --- ### (and many, many more) --- ## This kind of nuanced NLP is very, very useful --- ### Analyzing Speech Data \"Ask people why they're calling, and connect them to the right department based on their answer.\" \"Flag all tech support conversations where the customer mentions a competitor\" \"Redirect all angry-sounding customers to higher-tier support workers\" (Speech emotion detection) \"Are the two people in this skype call flirting, arguing, expressing love, or sadness? Target post-session ads accordingly.\" \"I want to talk to... billing?\" (Uncertainty analysis) \"Yeah, I really like going to Applebees.\" (Spot-the-sarcasm) --- ### Data Aggregation \"Watch Twitter and give me the locations of wildfires, floods, etc, and provide information about damage, shelters and resources in an easy-to-read format\" (EPIC) \"Read every news article about the Ukrainian Revolution and present the information on a cohesive timeline, with sources labeled.\" (RED) \"Collect all case-law involving reverse mortgages in the state of Florida in which the plaintiff's children filed suit against the mortgage company\" --- ### Authorship attribution and stylistic analysis \"Examine these two written passages/books and tell me whether they were both written by the same person\" (Authorship Attribution Analysis) \"Examine these negative reviews and tell me what demographic the authors likely represent based on the language used.\" \"Are these critical forum posts all written by the same person?\" --- ### Predictive analysis of text \"Look for any information in the newswire which will predict a change in this company's stock price, then buy or sell stock automatically.\" \"Based on this person's Facebook post history, how likely is he to click an ad for weight-loss pills?\" \"Based on all the political posts and tweets in Saginaw compared to those in Ann Arbor, how likely is this senator to lose in a recall election?\" - \"Given this large sample of a child's speech, is the child likely to be autistic?\" (Current research at the LENA foundation in Boulder) --- ### Sentiment Analysis \"How often, in this corpus of blogs, do people say nice or awful things about product X?\" \"We've just leaked a picture of our next supercar. How do people on twitter like the design?\" \"What are people saying about our leaked $199.99 pricepoint?\" \"How do people on these forums feel about 9/11?\" - \"This guy talks about guns a lot on Facebook. Should we show him ads for firearms, or ads for gun-control organizations?\" --- ### Language Pattern Detection - \"Is this an inflammatory, hateful, angry, or trollish comment?\" (YouTube) - \"Scan online forums for anything which looks like a threat against the President\" (The US Secret Service) - \"Watch these websites being used by radical groups and look for specific language usage patterns that predict violent behavior.\" (All sorts of defense department grants) - \"Read every email, looking for threats or discussion of terrorist attacks on American soil.\" --- --- ... or my personal favorite NLP task... --- ## Temporal Analysis and Event Discovery --- ### A Case Study Many hospitals around the country are switching to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). These records are easily available within the institution, and contain lots of valuable data. Creating timelines is incredibly time-consuming for humans, as is comparison. What if machines could do this for us? [The THYME Project](https://clear.colorado.edu/TemporalWiki/index.php/Main_Page) --- ### \"The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up\" - Sequence of events: - 1) Surgery - 2) Mild rash - 3) Hydrocortisone, Followup (overlapping) - 4) No more rash --- ### If a computer can be taught to interpret time in medical records, we can ask... - \"I have 30 seconds to learn this patient's history. Go.\" - \"How often do patients have heart attacks within 2 years of starting Vioxx?\" - \"How many people who have a facelift develop persistent facial numbness?\" - \"How long do patients usually live following diagnosis of Glioblastoma?\" - \"Is there a correlation between the administration of vaccines and the development of autism?\" - **[(No, damnit.)](http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110105/bmj-wakefield-autism-faq?print=true)** --- ### Temporal reasoning is important Humans interpret time naturally, and make reference to it often. Temporality interacts with causality in interesting ways. Event detection and reasoning is useful in a variety of domains. \"What happened\" is a very fundamental question that everybody wants answered. - So the sooner computers can do it, the better! --- ## NLP can be used to address answer any questions humans can answer! --- --- ### ... not so fast --- # Part 3 ## Why natural language processing is really hard. --- --- # No. ### Not yours. --- ## Natural Language is difficult at every level --- ## Speech --- ### No two people sound alike, even saying the same things --- ### The right answer depends on the context and prosody. --- \"Bring me the bat, man\" --- \"Bring me the Batman\" --- ### Speech recognition is spectacularly good, but nowhere near good enough. --- ## Modality Did something happen? Is it real? --- is difficult \"The compound might \"If they attack, we'll bomb the compound.\" \"The general stated that bombing the compound overnight \"was still an option\"\" \"We may conduct a bombing at 0300\" \"We will conduct a bombing at 0300\" \"We conducted a bombing at 0300\" --- ### Coreference is difficult - \"The tour group stopped by the Church's annex to grab the group leader's umbrella. They left their building once he had it. \" \"The Bay Harbor Butcher is off the streets, as Dexter Morgan, the alleged killer, was arrested by police over the weekend\" \"\"Bill Clinton was the President of the United States in 1999. Now Barack Obama is POTUS.\" --- ## Metonymy Using a word to refer to a practically or metaphorically related concept --- ### Metonymy is difficult \"The terrorist \"**Moscow** condemned the latest round of sanctions\" --- ## Causality Did one event trigger or cause the next event? --- ### Causality is difficult \"The dam burst when the rockslide hit it.\" \"The over-full dam burst when the rockslide hit it.\" \"She pulled the trigger, firing the gun and killing the man.\" \"She pulled the trigger, releasing the hammer, igniting the powder charge, launching the bullet and killing the man.\" --- ## Temporal Expressions Words or phrases that indicate position in time --- ### Temporal Expressions can be difficult \"The bombing occurred 2/13/12 at 0214\" \"Next Tuesday, she'll come in for a follow-up\" \"She's been having trouble sleeping lately.\" \"She should expect soreness postoperatively.\" \"TSA regulations have grown increasingly restrictive Post-9/11\" --- ## Temporal Relations Linking and arranging different events as part of a greater timeline --- ### \"The patient developed a mild rash after surgery, which was treated at her follow up visit with hydrocortisone\" --- ### \"The patient developed a mild rash after surgery, which was treated at her follow up visit with hydrocortisone, many years after Napoleon's exile to Elba.\" --- ### Every event in the history of the universe is temporally related to every other event in this history of the universe. NumRelations = (NumEvents)*(NumEvents) 100 Events == 10,000 valid Temporal Relations --- ### Yikes. --- ### ... and language users hate us \"Gold covered the miner's hands\"/\"Gold paid for the Queen of England's hat was purple\" \"We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were ripe\" \"We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were hungry\" \"Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana\" \"The old man returned to his house was happy\" --- --- # Not yet. --- ## Hooray! --- # Final Conclusion - 1) You can get a lot of great information just by counting words - 2) More complex analysis gets you even more information - 3) ... but doing that is really, really, REALLY difficult --- ### This presentation is available online at: http://savethevowels.org/talks/ngrams_nlp_2018.html --- ### Thank you! --- "}
