(2015) and Nakaya et al. (2015) perform multi-cohort meta- analyses of immune responses to viruses and vaccines. With increased statistical power and more diverse sampling populations, their ndings promise to be more generally applicable and suggestive of novel mech- anisms for regulating immunity. A central problem in human immunology is to understand why some individualsmount productive immune responses to vaccines and pathogens and others do not. The move toward systems immu-nology stems from the idea that emergent immune system behaviors, such as coor- dinated immune responses, can best beunderstood by discerning the interactions between cells, proteins, and genes that collectively give rise to these responses.Systems analyses aim to quantify asmany components of the system as possible in the same sample and apply high-dimensional data analysis tech-niques to infer probable relationships be- tween the components. By doing this in the context of specic immune re-sponses, the interactions of cells, pro- teins, and genes underlying the response of interest can be understood. Systemsapproaches are particularly well suitedfor studies in human subjects because of the signicant inter-individual variation in immune cell frequencies, protein con-centrations, and transcript abundances. By correlating measurements across indi- viduals, their probable relationships canbe inferred and the regulation of the system as a whole investigated ( Brodin et al., 2015 ). One implication thereof is that these systems immunology analyses can prove more informative when per- formed in heterogeneous populationsthan in more homogenous populations. In these early days of systems immu- nology, whole blood or blood mononu- clear cell gene expression analysis hasbeen the most widely used technology. It provides a powerful yet convenient way to globally prole blood immune sys-tems in humans. The generated blood transcriptome data represent a compos- ite measure of genes expressed withincells and relative frequencies of differentcell populations in the blood ( Whitney et al., 2003 ). By analyzing modules of genes rather than individual genes and by relating the genes within modules to known cellular pathways and biologicalfunctions, the gene signatures identied can become more interpretable ( Subra- manian et al., 2005 ). In systems immunology as in systems biology in general, the ability to perturb the system is key for inferring functionalrelationships between system compo-nents. Vaccination represents the most widely used immune perturbation in humans and several recent studies haveutilized systems immunology analyses before and after vaccination to under- stand immune responses to vaccines.Gene expression signatures predictive of either cellular or humoral immune re- sponses to influenza, meningococci, andyellow-fever vaccines have all been re-ported and reviewed elsewhere ( Hagan et al., 2015 ). Such predictive signatures have also provided novel insights into theregulation of immunity, and some have been pursued mechanistically in follow- up studies ( Furman et al., 2014; Ravindran et al., 2014 ). This illustrates the potential of using gene expression analyses during immune system perturbation as a meansfor generating new knowledge about the regulation of the immune system. Meta-analyses are analytical tech- niques used to summarize the results ofmultiple studies. As such, they hold the potential for allowing conclusions to be drawn from more diverse sampling popu-lations that better represent the population as a whole. The increased total number of individuals analyzed can also increasethe statistical power of the conclusions. Finally, meta-analyses can be particularly useful in systems immunology and theinference of functional relationships be-tween immune system components by al- lowing analyses of data from diverse pop-ulations. Meta-analyses are not trivial or without complications and major obsta- cles have to be overcome to realize thepotential of meta-analyses across public datasets. Many of the obstacles are tech- nology specic and dependent on theexperimental method used for data collec- tion. Efforts to standardize immunological assays are ongoing ( Janetzki et al., 2009 ), and a public repository for immunologicaldata\u2014the ImmPort database\u2014has been established and is being populated with cytometry data and more ( Bhattacharya et al., 2014 ). Gene expression databases such as the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO, and the ArrayExpressare more mature and well-established repositories with impressive amounts of data available to query. For example,the ArrayExpress currently containsmore than 1.8 million assays from more than 60,000 experiments, an incredible resource for those with the right know-how to harvest its full potential through meta-analyses ( Figure 1 ). In this issue of Immunity , two such groups present their recent ndings using data from the NCBI GEO. In the rst study,Khatri and colleagues make use of anelegant and recently described meta- analysis approach ( Khatri et al., 2013; An- dres-Terre et al., 2015 ). By combining two different methods for nding differentiallyregulated genes across multiple studies, more robust signatures can be identied. By performing such meta-analyses in aniterative leave-one-study-out cycle, the authors prevent individual studies from inadvertently dominating the resulting sig-natures. Using this analytical pipeline, the group studies immune responses to res- piratory viral infections and is able to iden-tify a signature specic to such responses Immunity 43, December 15, 2015 \u00aa2015 Elsevier Inc. 1035Immunity Previewswith important diagnostic potential in pa- tients. Using this signature, patients with respiratory viral infection can be distin-guished from healthy controls and, impor-tantly, also from patients with bacterial infections. This important nding made possible through public data meta-anal-ysis should inspire immunologists to formulate novel, testable hypotheses about the role of these identied genesin regulating antiviral immune responses. Moreover, using the same strategy, the group also presents a smaller, 11-genesignature specic to influenza virus infection that is predictive of clinical outcome as well as flu-vaccine re-sponses. Although these 11 genes in theflu-specic signature were differentially expressed across age groups, gender, and disease severity, none of the individ-ual studies included in the meta-analysis had been able to identify all 11 genes, suggesting that the meta-analysisapproach provides enhanced precision over previous published reports. Also, the genes in this signature probablycontain important clues to the mecha- nisms of flu-specic immune responses in the context of both infection andvaccination. In the second study, Nakaya et al. (2015 ) address the important issue of whether immune responses to flu vac-cines are similar across multiple flu sea- sons and across diverse populations of young and old, healthy or diseased. Fluviruses change from one year to the next through antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Whether previously reported genesignatures predictive of early humoralvaccine responses would also be robust enough to predict responses across different years despite antigenic changeswas unknown. The authors perform meta-analyses of blood gene expression data collected across multiple flu sea-sons and in different studies and reveal a signature that was indeed able to pre- dict the humoral response at day 28 aftervaccination across these multiple sea- sons. The same signature was not pre- dictive of the later day 180 humoralresponse, suggesting that differentmechanisms and pathways are involved in regulating the longevity of vaccine re- sponses. These important ndings sug-gest that core mechanisms determine the immune system's early response to flu vaccines\u2014mechanisms that couldpotentially be the target of a universal influenza vaccine in the future. Another important issue addressed by Nakaya et al. (2015 ) relates to the known reduc- tion in flu-vaccine responsiveness among many elderly, a key target population forthis vaccine. It is important to understandwhether signatures predictive of re- sponses are equally predictive in the young and the elderly, and if not, whetherother signatures could better predict the responses in the elderly and provide an explanation to the observations thatsome elderly individuals respond while many others do not. The authors present a predictive gene signature that is equallypredictive in the young, the elderly, andalso in a smaller group of patients with type II diabetes, suggesting that vaccine responders across these different groupsrespond by similar mechanisms. This also suggests that by exploring the genes in this signature, one could learna lot more about these shared vaccine- response mechanisms. Together, the studies of Andres-Terre et al. (2015) andNakaya et al. (2015 )h a v e used innovative ways to generate new in- sights from public datasets that will nowhave immunologists sifting through sup-plementary gene lists in search of novel hy- potheses regarding the regulation of anti- viral and flu-vaccine immune responsesfor future follow-up experiments.

New data from two groups ( Ve\u00b4tizou et al., 2015; Sivan et al., 2015 ) indicate that the abundance of specic commensal bacterial species enhances the anti-cancer activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Humans co-exist in a symbiotic relation- ship with trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that populate the intestine, skin, and upper respiratory and genitouri-nary tracts. Technological advances have unveiled that the normal flora of humans is remarkably complex in that its compo-nents outnumber human cells at a ratio of 10:1. The intestine alone harbors up to 1,000 commensal bacterial species ( Tud- denham and Sears, 2015 ), mostly from four lineages (termed phyla): Pro- teobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Variations in thecomposition of the bacterial flora have been associated with metabolic changes and obesity, as well as inflammation,autoimmunity, and infectious diseases. Studies with germ-free mice have shown that forging a robust immune systemand a broad repertoire of T cell receptors requires colonization by commensal mi- croorganisms. The role of the microbiotain the progression of extra-intestinal tu-mors, however, has only emerged in the last 2 years. Commensal bacteria have been found to influence distal malignant evolutionby modulating systemic tumor-promoting inflammation and, subsequently, the magnitude of T-cell-dependent anti-tu-mor immunity ( Rutkowski et al., 2015 ). In this study, tumor growth depended upon host commensal microbes and was inde-pendent of measurable bacterial translo-cation. Intrinsic differences in some bac- genera, such , were identied in co-housed mice that devel-oped tumors at different growth rates in a toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-dependent manner ( Rutkowski et al., 2015 ). How- ever, the abundance of segmented la- mentous bacteria (SFBs), an obvious target identied to drive interleukin-17(IL-17) production and autoimmunity in tumor-free mice ( Ivanov et al., 2009; Sano et al., 2015 ), was unchanged in mice showing TLR5-dependent acceler-ated malignant progression. Therefore, changes in the equilibrium between commensal microbial communities (or dysbiosis) influence the tumor growthdistally from places of bacterial coloniza- tion. Elegant independent studies have also demonstrated that the effectivenessof immunotherapy against different tu- mors also requires the presence of commensal bacteria ( Iida et al., 2013; Vi- aud et al., 2013 ). However, understanding how the repertoire of commensal mi- crobes can be specically manipulated to synergize with available anti-cancer in-terventions has remained elusive. In a recent issue of Science ,d a t af r o m two groups demonstrate how individualbacterial species can be used to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ve\u00b4tizou et al. (2015) and Sivan et al. (2015) independently demonstrate that the abundance of distinct species fromthe phylumBacteroidetes and distinctgenera from the phylum Actinobacteria is Immunity 43, December 15, 2015 \u00aa2015 Elsevier Inc. 1037Immunity Previews "}
