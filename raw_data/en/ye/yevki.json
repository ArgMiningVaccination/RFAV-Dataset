If you believe you are a candidate for the vaccine our current office policy is requiring a telemedicine appointment in which a medically licensed Healthcare Professional can evaluate for extreme vulnerability. These forms will be provided to patients on a case-by-case evaluation and are still subject to further consideration at the vaccination site. There is no current guidance or definition of extreme vulnerability per the CDC. At this time we are utilizing NHS literature to make appropriate determinations for extreme vulnerability until a CDC statement is released.

Thank you on behalf of the NFIM team. At this time, we are still investigating the mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines. Receiving the vaccine is an individual choice and should be considered based on individual situations. If you have specific questions regarding the vaccine, we recommend making an appointment with one of our health care professionals to discuss them. We do not know when we will have vaccines in our office. However, we will update you as soon as this information is available. If you know that you would like to receive the vaccine and are over 65, this is very reasonable. You can fill out [this form](https://myvaccine.fl.gov/) to register to receive a COVID-19 Vaccine through your County Health Department. We understand the vaccine is only available to persons over 65 at the health department and we recommend that you register. Please survey the health department website frequently for opportunities to register otherwise.
