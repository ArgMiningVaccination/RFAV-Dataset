Aspects of Psychiatry Inwesterncountries,the19thcenturymarksaturningpoint for the beginning of psychiatry as an academic discipline.Since this happened and psychiatry had left the asylumsat the boundaries not only of cities but medicine itself, wecan find quite a row of examples concerning integration [ 1]. Psychiatry has integrated many treatments into the thera-peuticspectrum,forexample,tricyclicantidepressants,SSRI,relaxation techniques like progressive muscle-relaxation orhypnosis,cognitive-behavioural,psychoanalytic,orsystemicpsychotherapy, even acupuncture according to the proto-col of the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA)[ 2,3]orlatelymindfulness-basedcognitivetherapy [4]. However, three aspects seem suitable to understand the openness of psychiatry for new methods: (a) the fact thatsince decades, professional multidisciplinarity in psychiatryis a crucial basis for the in- and outpatient treatment (e.g.,psycho-, ergo-, music-, physiotherapists, nutritionists, andsocialworkers),(b)psychiatriststodayneedtohaveadoublequalification in psychiatry and psychotherapy be ableto work according to (c), Engel's biopsychosocial model,which had been adopted as a solid basis for the previouslymentioned. 2. Aspects of CAM Traditionalmedicinehasbeenpresentforcenturiesindiffer-ent cultures around the globe (e.g., Ayurveda, Homeopathy,Kampo Medicine, Traditional European Medicine, TibetanMedicine,andTraditionalChineseMedicine).However,withthe development of modern medicine, traditional medicine was regarded as an old fashioned way of practice andtheory, and consequently, traditional medicine mostly wasnot taught at medical schools and universities. Only fewchairs or colleges for naturopathy or homeopathy in theUS and some single chairs in Europe for hydrotherapy ornaturopathy can be regarded as an exception to the rule inthe19thand20thcentury.Nevertheless,traditionalmedicineremained in the cultures as a kind of folk medicine oftenprovidedbylayphysiciansandsometimesalsobyphysicianswith their institutions and inventions (e.g., Friedrich Bilzat Bilz'sche Naturheilanstalt, Germany, and his concept ofcombinednaturopathy;MaximillianBircher-BenneratSana-toriumLebendigeKraft,Switzerland,andhisBircher-Muesli;Harvey Kellog at Battle Creek, USA, and his corn-flakes)[5,6]. 3. Research Interestingly,theconceptofEvidence-basedMedicine(EbM) [7] brought a chance for CAM and traditional medicinal systems. Maybe this derived from the fact that EbM wasnew for the whole medical system and activated a neworientation in research. A young generation of academicprotagonists in CAM adopted the promising paradigm ofEbMandhundredsofsystematicreviews;meta-analysisandn e wr a n d o m i z e dc o n t r o l l e dt r i a l s( R C T )b r o u g h tc l i n i c a levidenceforcertainCAMmethods(evenwhenthemodeofactionremainedunclear).So,abroaderscientificacceptancefor certain CAM interventions was achieved. Yet, next toevidencefromRCTswithhighinternalvalidity,theargument2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine that interventions from CAM (the same accounts for psy- chotherapy)workby\"placeboresponse\"(orbetter:unspecifictreatmenteffects)ratherthanspecifictherapeuticeffectshadbeendiscussedaswell[ 8]. The different CAM interventions, t h ee ff e c t so ft h ep h y s i c i a n / p a t i e n tr e l a t i o n s h i p ,a n do t h e rcontextual factors seem to influence outcome as can be seenfromvariousmethodologicalsettings(e.g.,acupuncture versusshamacupuncture,individualizedversusstandardizedhomeopathy). It remains a challenge for research to usemethods to evaluate these patient specific factors. From thispointofview,collaborationandexchangebetweenCAMwithpsychiatryandpsychosomaticmedicineseemspromising. 4. CAM and Psychiatry Funnyenoughandoftenoverseen,therewasatimeforakindof approach between CAM and psychiatry in the beginningofthe20thcentury.TheGermanphysicianGeorgGroddeckcombined naturopathy with psychotherapy: he had a littlenaturopathicclinicinBaden-Badenandwasapromisingpsy-choanalyst in tense contact with S. Freud until they becamekind of rivals over the concept of the Id [ 9,10]. Another protagonistwastheSwissnaturopathicphysicianM.Bircher-Benner who set up the system of Ordnungstherapy, whichmeantthecombinationofnaturopathicsomatotherapieswithpsychotherapy [ 4]. In aspects, this also had similarities with psychiatric Milieu therapy. This is no wonder, as for a time Bircher-Benner was a pupil of the Swiss psychiatrist August Forelandevenadoptedhypnosisfromhim. From the concept of naturopathic Ordnungstherapy derived a short and punctual contact to the new directionin psychiatry, the psychosomatic medicine (PM) in Germanspeaking countries, which somehow criticised the domina-tion by the biological view [ 11]. But in the very beginning, CAM and PM failed to find a strong academic and practicalconnection with each other. Yet, today one might specu-late about a renewed alliance under the term mind-bodymedicine, in which multidisciplinarity including variousforms of psychotherapy and patient-centred healthcare [ 12] iscombinedwitheducationalaspectsforthepatients. 5. CAM in Psychiatry C A Mi np s y c h i a t r ys e e m e da sat i m e l yt o p i cf o ras p e c i a lissue of the eCAM journal, since the journal had focussedin its special issues on specific CAM methods (e.g., Tai-Chi, medicalmushrooms),certaindiseases(e.g.,obesity,diabetes mellitus), or single research questions (e.g., neurobiology ofacupuncture, network pharmacology). On the other hand,patients with psychiatric disorders use CAM (mostly add-on in 20 to 50% in depression and 20 to 40% in anxietyand much less in addiction disorders [ 13,14]). Therefore, it is a crucial responsibility for physicians and researchers toevaluateefficacyandsafetyofCAMtosecurepatients'safetyandinterests. Some psychiatric hospitals or departments have drawn attention for turning CAM into their daily practice. Ther e a s o n sf o rt h i sm i g h tb ea ni n c r e a s ei ne v i d e n c ef o rs i n g l eCAMmethods,thecriticismoftheevidenceforconventionalpsychopharmacology [ 15], the strengthened awareness of its side effects [ 16,17], or simply the marketing advantage in competition. However, by no mean do we expect to drawa representative picture in this issue of what is happeningbetweenpsychiatryandCAMtoday.Wepresentasomewhatrandom cross-sectional perspective among researchers in the field, deriving from the call for papers on the journals homepageandadditionallycontactingabout100researchersorworkinggroupswewereawareof. I ni t sm i x t u r eo fp a p e r s ,t h i si s s u ed i ff e r sf r o me a r l i e r publications on CAM in psychiatry, like reviews on herbalmedicine [ 18-20]o rC A M[ 21], guidelines incorporating, for example, St. Johns' Worth for the treatment of mild tomoderate single depressive episodes based on meta-analyticevidence [ 22-24], or the work of the International Network of Integrative Mental Health (INIMH), founded in 2010 andreviewsofitsprotagonistsonbipolardisordersorADHS[ 25, 26]. So, we hope this special issue can contribute to further discussiononCAMinpsychiatry\u2014thesubjectmaybenamedintegrative mental health [ 27], mind-body medicine [ 28], or integrativepsychiatry[ 29]. For herbal medicine, the most important spectrum of EbM methods could be covered with 3 studies: N. Brondinoet al. systematically review preparations from Ginkgofor different psychiatric disorders. In their meta-analysis, theyevaluate the Gingko-treatment not only for dementia butalso as add-on in schizophrenia. The systematic review ofY. W. Wong et al. on different \"traditional oriental herbalmedicine\" in ADHS gives an idea of the difficulty tracinga cultural/national origin of some herbal preparations in Asiatic countries and the need for profound EbM research.

Al e s s o nw eh a v el e a r n e da r o s ef r o mat a s kn o ti nf o c u s of our integrative view: psychiatry has not yet integrated itsdifferent classification systems.

Introduction Ginkgo biloba (Gb) is one of the most ancient seed plant, often referred to as a \"living fossil.\" This large tree may liveover 1000 years and reach 40m of height. Originally native to China, Gb is now cultivated worldwide. Extract from GbleaveshasbeenusedintraditionalChinesemedicineforcen- turiestotreatcirculatorydisorders,asthma,tinnitus,vertigo, and cognitive problems [ 1]. Today, Gb extracts are one of the most commonly taken phytomedicines globally [ 2]a n d a r eo ft e np r e s c r i b e di nE u r o p ea san o o t r o p i ca g e n ti no l dage and dementia [ 3]. Of note, since 2000, Gb extract isincluded in ATC-classification as an anti-dementia drug to- gether with cholinesterase inhibitors contains mainly terpenoids, flavonol glycosides,a n dp r o a n t h o c y a n i d i n s .Th em o s tp r e v a l e n to ft h e s et h r e egroups are the flavonol glycosides andproanthocyanidinsarethoughttoberesponsibleforthephar-macological properties of Gb [ 1]. On the basis of animal studies, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain thepharmacologicalpropertiesofthisplant:extractfromGb leavesinhibitsplatelet-activatingfactor[ 5]andenhancesNO2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine production in vessels, with subsequent effect on peripheral andcerebralbloodflow[ 6].Gbextractisthoughttomodule different neurotransmitter systems: it is a strong A synaptosomal uptake of DA, 5-HT, and norepinephrine [ 7-9]. Additionally, Gb displays a free radical scavenger activity and has neuroprotective and antiapoptotic properties, such as inhibition of amyloid- neurotoxicity protection against hypoxic challenges andincreased oxidative stress [ 10-12]. Several previous reviews have been mainly focused on the potential efficacy of Gbindementia.However,inconsistentandcontroversialresultshave been reported [ 13-16]. On the other hand, to date no systematicreviewhasbeenconductedontheeffectofGbonneuropsychiatric disorders other than dementia. Therefore,weaimedtoperformasystematicreviewontheeffectsofGbindifferentpsychiatricconditions. 2. Methods In April 2012, we searched the following databases: MED-LINE, dementia (dementia OR cognitive impair-ment OR Alzheimer), autism (autism OR autistic spectrumdisorder), schizophrenia (schizophrenia OR psychosis ORpsychoticdisorderORdelusion),depression(depressionORmajordepressionORdepressivesymptom),anxiety(anxietyOR generalized anxiety disorder OR anxious), attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) (attention deficit disorder ORADHD or attention deficit OR hyperactivity), and addic-t i o n .A l ls e a r c ht e r m sw e r es e a r c h e di n d i v i d u a l l yi ne a c hdatabase and combined together. The search strategy hadno time restriction but was limited to articles in English,Italian,French,Spanish,andGerman.Additionally,allrecov-ered papers were reviewed for further relevant references.Resea r c her sinthefieldw er er eac hedt oo ta inaddi runpublisheddata,ifavailable. We selected controlled randomized clinical trials, yield- ing primary results on the effects of the administration ofGbextractsinneuropsychiatricpatients.Everyneuropsychi-atric disorder was defined according to internationally validdiagnostic criteria such as the International Classificationof Diseases (ICD) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manualof Mental Disorders (DSM). Other inclusion criteria werea minimum number of participants of ten per group, a treatment period of at least 6 weeks, and the availability of a full-text publication. Of note, all the included studies inthemeta-analysiswereconductedusingthestandardizedGbe x t r a c tE g b7 6 1 ,w h i c hi st h em o s tc o m m o n l yu s e df o r mo fGb[17]. Two researchers (NB and SR) independently reviewed all information about the articles provided by the databases.Anydiscrepanciesweresolvedbyconsensus.Weassessedthequalityofthestudydesign,durationofthestudy,comparabil-ityofstudygroups,andclinicaloutcomesondifferentwidelyusedratingscales. The following rating scales were accepted for (1) dementia: Scale for Symptoms [ AbnormalInvoluntaryMovementScale(AIMS)[ 32]. Whenitwaspossible,datawerepooledbymeansofmeta- analysis. Effect measures on rating scales were expressed asstandardized mean differences (SMDs) with the 95% CIs.A random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used a because of heterogeneity.Avalue<0.05wasregardedasstatisticallysignificant.Het- erogeneityofeffectsizeswasevaluatedbythe 2statistic.An alpha error<0.05 and/or2of at least 50% were taken as indicators of substantialheterogeneity of outcomes.If meta-analyses were not possible, the results of individual studiesare presented. Meta-analyses were performed using Meta- AnalystandRevMan5forallcalculations[ 33]. 3. Results Our literature search identified 1109 clinical publications. After the title/abstract screening, 113 publications were ob-tained for detailed evaluation ( Figure1). Summary of the finalarticlesincludedisshownin Table 1.Overall,themeth- odologyoftheincludedstudieswasgood( Figure2). 3.1. Autism. A recent study involving 47 children with a DSM-IV-TRdiagnosisofautismwasidentified[ 34].Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Gb or placebo inadjunction to risperidone. The primary outcome was theABC-Cscale.Therewasnostatisticallysignificantdifferencebetween the two groups according to the aforementionedsubscale.Thus,Gbseemedtobenotanefficaciousadjunctivetherapy to risperidone.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Only one study investigating the effects of Gb on GAD fulfilled the reviewcriteria[37].In2007,82patientswererandomlytreatedwith Gbextract,atthedoseof480mg/die( =27)o r2 40m g/ die (=25), or with placebo (=30).

Response rates were 44% in thehigh-dose group, 31% the for tardive dyskinesia inpatientswithchronicschizophrenia.Onehundredandfifty-seven patients were randomized to on antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equiv- alents were comparable between the two groups). Tardivedyskinesia severity, which represented the primary outcome of the study, was assessed by means of the Abnormal Invol- untary Movement Scale (AIMS). A significant improvement wasfoundintheGbgroupintheAIMSscore.Itisinteresting to note that, the percentage of responders (according toa decrease of at least 30% in the AIMS) was significantly higher in the treatment group (51.3% versus 5.1%). Despite the significant effect of Gb on movement symptoms, no sig-nificant effect of group was observed for psychopathologicalsymptoms (representing a secondary outcome of the study), asbothgroupsshowedanimprovementovertime. 3.6. Schizophrenia. Threerandomizedclinicaltrialsevaluat- ing Gb extract in patients with schizophrenia were included in the analysis [ 39-41]. Two studies were double-blind and placebo controlled. Randomization procedure and method- ology were considered adequate in all cases. Gb was used as an adjunctive therapy to different antipsychotics: cloza- pine (Doruk et al.)

Standardized meandifferencesforSANSscoreweregreaterforGbthanfor placebo, with SMD =2.09(95%CI4.34;0.148,=5.52) (Figure3) but not significant. Heterogeneity was substantial (2=97%). To perform sensitivity analysis, we decided to removethestudyfromAtmacaetal.whichusedlowerchlor-promazine equivalent, in order to determine the impact ofthis trial on the results. Removing this trial did not signif-icantly change our findings. After excluding this study, standardized change scores were significantly g r e a t e rf o rG bt h a nf o rp l a c e b o ,w i t hS M D= 2.89 (95% CI 5.39;0.38,=3.46,=0.001 )(Figure4).Heterogeneity wassubstantial(2=92%). 3.7. Dementia. Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: meta-analysis was performed only on eight studies [ 42-49] which were comparable for clinical purposes. Eight studieswere placebo controlled, while two studies were a head-to-head trial with donepezil as comparison group [ 50]o r a triple-blind study with Gb, donepezil, and placebo [ 51]. The very different dosages of Gb and donepezil renderedmeta-analytical examination unfeasible in the latter studies.All studies were randomized, double-blind trials. Overall,the methodological quality of the included studies wasjudged as adequate, with most studies using an intent-to-treat analysis.

Discussion The effect of Ginkgo biloba has been studied in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, the general lack of evidence prevents drawing conclusions regarding Gb effec- tivenessinmanyneuropsychiatricconditions,suchasautism, ADHD, addiction, GAD, and tardive dyskinesia. Of all the psychiatric disorders reviewed, dementia has been the most extensively studied. Our meta-analysis of eight studies in dementiashowedthatGbdifferedsignificantlyfromplacebo, providing beneficial effects both in cognition and activities ofdailyliving.Ourresultsareconsistentwitharecentmeta-analysis [ 13] on the effect of Gb on cognition. On the other hand, we found a significant difference between Gb andplaceboforactivitiesofdailylivinginpatientswithdementiawhichwerenotsignificantintheaforementionedreport[ 13]. This difference may be at least in part due to the inclusion of a very recent study, yielding significant positive resultsin this area of functioning. We decided to pool togetherstudiesusingdifferentscalesevaluatingthesamedomain(i.e.,SKT and ADAS-cog for cognition). Considering cognition,it has been reported that both ADAS-cog and SKT could bestatisticallycompared[ 52].Additionally,evenifweseparated the two scales, the beneficial effect of Gb remained evidenta tleastfortheSKT .Ofnote,wedidnotobserveasignifican timprovement in heterogeneity. Considering the activities ofdaily living domain, there is a lack of studies using the sameoutcome scale; thus, we pooled together different question-naires(measuringthesamearea)inordertoimprovepower.However,ifweconsideredonlytrialsusingthesameoutcomescale, we still observed a beneficial effect of Gb in the ADL-IS. Although there is clear heterogeneity, we were unableto explain it. Sensitivity analysis excluding trial with poorermethodological quality did not explain the heterogeneity.Under these circumstances, we dealt with the existence ofheterogeneityusingarandom-effectmodel. Notwithstandingtheshortageofspecificstudies,available evidence also supports the use of Gb in chronic schizophre-nia. In particular, Gb seems to exert a beneficial effect onpositive psychotic symptoms. No significant effect on neg- ativesymptomshasbeenobserved.Evenifthethreeincluded studies were similar in design (inclusion/exclusion criteria,time, and Gb dosage), all patients were on antipsychoticmedication. In particular, we performed sensitivity analysisexcluding one study with different chlorpromazine equiv-alents. In fact, the study from Atmaca et al. used a lowerdosage of chlorpromazine equivalent, even if the meandose (16.8mg/day) of the administered drug (olanzapine)was clinically appropriate. However, heterogeneity was notmodified. ThebeneficialeffectofGbinbothdementiaandchronic schizophrenia is however modest. Particularly, the meaneffectobservedincognitionissometimeslowerthanwhatisconsideredclinicallymeaningful[ 52].However,Gbwasequal to donepezil in two recent clinical trials, thus potentiallyproviding an evidence for its use in dementia, which to datecould be treated with few pharmacological agents. Of note,Gb is generally used as an adjunctive therapy in schizophre-nia, not as a first-line intervention, and, thus, even a small additionalimprovementcouldbevaluable.Notably,alltrials demonstratedanexcellentsafetyprofileforGb . Limitations should caution against overinterpretation of thefindings.Theincludedstudiesshowedhighheterogeneity,which could possibly have biased our results. Additionally,whether longer trials would yield more significant results indementia and schizophrenia remains to be seen. Anotherpotential limitation is that even though our search wassystematicandrigorous,wecouldhavemissedeligiblestudiesinadvertently. 5. Conclusion Despite the heterogeneity of the clinical trials, availableevidence is sufficient to support the use of Gb in patientswithdementiaandasanadjunctivetherapyinschizophrenicpatients. Despite the promising results, broad recommenda-tions for the use of Gb in other neuropsychiatric conditions,such as ADHD, autism, and AD are still premature. A betterunderstanding of the mechanisms of Gb effect in theseconditions may be useful as well as linking Gb beneficialeffects with other types of data such as fMRI or SPECTimaging. It should be considered to run major multicenterstudies in order to shed more light on the effectiveness ofGbindementiasubgroupsandschizophrenia.Hopefully,the design of the study should use currently available level of treatment and care, in order to provide a broader generaliz-abilityoftheresults.

Introduction Interestincomplementaryandalternativemedicine(CAM), suchasacupuncture,hasincreasedinpopularityinWesternsocieties in the last part of the twentieth century and therehas been a continued interest ever since [ 1]. The use of CAM includes its application in psychiatric patients [ 2]. Two large groups that need long-term treatment are patientswith depression and patients with schizophrenia. Besidesthe typical depressive or positive and negative symptoms,their disorders are characterized by marked disturbancesof sleep [ 3-8]. Patients with schizophrenia show increased sleeplatency,decreasedtotalsleeptime,anddecreasedsleepefficiency[ 3-5].Abidirectionalrelationshipbetweeninsom- nia and depressive symptoms in patients with depressionis described [ 6-8]. Sleep problems such as increased sleep latency, awakenings in the night or early in the morningwith an incapability to go back to sleep, and decreasedsleep efficiency are typical symptoms of depression, whereas hypersomniaanddreamdisturbancesarealsooftenreported. Thesleepdisordersappeartomaintainorevendeterioratethemooddisorder[ 9]. InWesternpsychiatry,agrowingconsumptionofantipsy- chotic[10]andantidepressantdrugs[ 11]canbeseen.Antipsy- chotic in therapy forpatientswithschizophrenia[ 12],whereasduetotheirpositive2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine effects, antidepressants have found their place in the clinical guidelines for the treatment of, for instance, patients withdepression [ 13]. Despite these clinical successes, a problem withpharmaceuticaltherapies[ 14],likeanyothertherapy,is that they are subject to patient nonadherence and decliningpatientcompliance[ 15,16]. Previousresearchhasshownthatadherencetotreatment correlates negatively with sleep disturbance and depression[17] .I ts e e m st h a tal a c ko fc o n t a c tw i t ht h i sp a t i e n tg r o u p makesitdifficulttoengageinatherapeuticrelationshiportoprescribeandmonitormedicationeffectively.Themedicinesused to treat these conditions often cause drowsiness [ 18]. P a t i e n t sa r et h e r e f o r eo ft e na d v i s e dt ot a k et h e ma tn i g h twhich causes problems with sleep (e.g., excessive dreamingandincreaseintotalsleeptimeinpatientswithschizophrenia[4]), even though taking them at night minimizes daytime drowsiness. Moreover, tiredness, drowsiness, and poor sleepinterfere with the patient's ability to engage with therapeutics e r v i c e sb e c a u s et h e ya r et o ot i r e d ,u n m o t i v a t e da n dt h e ydo not see the point or do not want to take medicines thatcausesuchadverseeffects.Presumably,thesearenottheonlyfactors that are of importance, but they seem highly relevantinpatientgroupsthatsufferfromdepression,aswellasthosethatsufferfromschizophrenia,sincebothdiseasesarepronetosleepdisorders. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( T C M ) ,w h i c hi ni t s e l fi saf o r mo fC A Mt h a ti sb a s e do nthousandsofyearsofpractice[ 21].Oneofthefeaturesofthe TCM approach is the individualization of treatment, whichrelies on a symptom-based diagnostic process [ 22]. TCM diagnoses are based on clinical symptoms and signs that are completely discerned by the oriental medical practitioner[22]. R e c e n ty e a r sh a v es e e na ni n c r e a s ei nt r i a l so np a r t i c u - larly depression and acupuncture [ 23-25]. Various reviews, however, have concluded that evidence for the effects ofacupuncture on depression still remains preliminary [ 26- 28].Inparticularmethodologicalproblems,suchasdifferent techniques (electro-, manual, or laser acupuncture), variouscontrol groups and study designs limit the generalizationof the results [ 23,29]. Although efforts have been made to standardizeandoptimizeresearchandthewayitisreported,furtherresearchiswarranted[ 26,30]. Evenlessresearchwithacupuncturehasbeenconducted on schizophrenia. Some literature research [ 31,32]i n d i c a t e s that more research is necessary to draw firm conclusions onacupuncture'seffectivenessinthetreatmentofschizophrenia.Moreover, even thoughsome research was reported [ 33,34], hintinginthedirectionofeffectivenessandtherebyprovidingthe basis for future research, the existing research remainspreliminary. Acupuncture may be beneficial in the treatment of sleep disorders [ 35] .I tc a nb eu s e da l o n eo rc o m b i n e dw i t h otherinterventions,sincenointeractionswerefoundtodate and adverse events related to treatment seem sufficiently controllable by providing thorough training [ 36]. Although someresearchhasbeenconductedonacupunctureandsleepdisorders [ 37-40], results are still tentative, particularly in patientswithpsychiatricdisorders.Resultscallforresearchina group, in which symptoms are prominent, since acupunc- ture's effectiveness is thought to rely on its homeostaticactions,strivingtoreturnthebodytoitsnormalphysiologicalstate. Therefore, it is thought that acupuncture has moreeffects on patients that experience serious problems than onhealthy participants or patients with only mild symptoms [41]. This pilot study evaluates and compares the effects of acupuncture on the subjective quality of sleep in long-termpatients with schizophrenia and patients with depression.

Intotaltheconvenientsampleconsistedof 40 participants (13 men, 27 women). Sixteen of them (10women, 6 men, mean age was 44.25 years, SD =2.44) were diagnosedwithschizophrenia,16ofthem(12women,4men,mean age was 50.94 years, SD =1.33) were diagnosed with depression. The healthy control group consisted of 5 women a n d3m e n( m e a na g ew a s3 6 . 7 5y e a r s ,S D =12.43).

For an overview of the descriptive statisticsseeTable 1a n df o ra no v e r v i e wo ft h em e d i c a t i o nu s e ds e e Table 2. Recruiting limitations resulted in a higher mean age in the depression waiting list condition than in the healthycontrol group (<0.05).Therewasaposterintheentrance section and in the waiting room that gave informationon the study. Moreover, potential participants (diagnosedwith schizophrenia F20.0 (paranoid schizophrenia), F20.5(schizophrenic residuum), or depression F33.2 accordingto the ICD-10) [ 42] were identified and approached by their therapist at the LVR-Klinik Bedburg-Hau. Patientsthat agreed to participate did so voluntarily and signed aninformed consent form; moreover, their therapist signedfor their mental ability to understand the form.

After the project, the medical fileswere checked for possible changes in medication duringthe time of the project. Moreover, possible use of sleepmedicationwasmentionedbythepatientsonthePittsburghSleep Quality Inventory (PSQI).

TheGermanversion ofthePSQI[ 46]wasusedinordertogaininformationonthe subjective quality and quantity of sleep in the participants. This retrospective list contains questions about sleep during the last four weeks, information on the number of sleep dis-turbances, estimation on sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep latency and sleep times, use of medication, and sleepiness duringtheday.Thequestionnaireconsistsof18items,dividedinto 7 components that can be scored from 0 to 3. The PSQI Total Score results in the sum of the component scores and c a nb ea n ys c o r ef r o mz e r ot o2 1 .Ah i g hs c o r em e a n ss l e e pquality is bad.

Cronbach's alpha for the total score was .77 [ 48]. The validity of the PSQI in patients with primary insomnia was good, sincea high correlation between PSQI scores and a sleep diarywas obtained by Backhaus and colleagues [ 49]. Moreover, they found a significant correlation between the PSQI and polysomnographic measurements. These The needles wereplacedaccordingtoTCMprinciples. 2.3.2. Intervention. The participants in the acupuncture groupsweregivenacupuncturetreatmentonceaweek,twelveweeks in a row. Individualized acupuncture according toTCMprincipleswasappliedaftercarefulindividualdiagnosisby a licensed oriental medical practitioner with more than5 years of clinical experience [ 30]. Acupuncture treatment took place in a light room with (very) soft background music(Enya)playing.Accordingtothedemandoftheethics committee to decrease anxiety [ 51]a sm u c ha sp o s s i b l ei n patientswithschizophreniaandtomakethemfeelcomfort-able,musicalongwithacupuncturewasused.Themusicwaskept constant over all participants and all sessions.

All participants were tested in an exper- imental testing room in the clinic, by apprentices whowere blind to group or time of testing. The healthy controlgroup was tested at T1 (pretest) only. The participants with schizophrenia and depression were tested at T1 and T2(posttest). After the tests at T1, participants were randomlydivided into a treatment and a waiting list condition. Theduration of the whole experiment was 13 weeks, whichincluded 12 weekly acupuncture sessions and pre- and post- testing.Attheendoftheexperiment,allparticipantsreceived a debriefing and were individually informed about theirown test results. Patients on the waiting list were giventhe opportunity to attend acupuncture treatment after T2 ifthey wanted to. The current study stopped at T2, althoughacupuncturetreatmentwasgivenafterT2inordertoprovideequal treatment opportunities. The patients, however, werenot tested afterwards and therefore these data were notincluded in the study. Moreover, any acupuncture that wasprovided after the study was part of their normal treatment,notofanystudy . 2.4. Statistics. Differences between the five groups on the subtests of the PSQI before the start of the treatment were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (one-wayANOVA) with groups as between subjects factor, followedby posthoc (Bonferroni) tests. Repeated measures analysesof variance were used to analyze possible differences on thePSQI Total Score and on the subtests of the PSQI pre- andposttreatment (in the four experimental groups), followedby posthoc (Bonferroni) t-tests if appropriate, that is, t(7) in our pilot-study. A value of<0.05 was considered to be statisticallysignificant. 3. 3.1.AcupuncturePointsThatWereUsed. 3. 3.2.PretestResults. ANOVA.

Discussion Inthispilotstudy,theeffectsofthreemonthsofacupuncture treatment on subjective sleep quality were investigated in a groupofpatientswithschizophreniaandagroupofpatientswith depression that were diagnosed by their therapists according to the ICD-10 [ 42]. All patients were chronically ill. Significant improvements were found on the PSQI TotalScore for both treatment groups, indicating that patientsslept better after 12 acupuncture treatments. The waiting listcondition groups showed no significant improvements. AswassuggestedbyHametnerandcolleagues[ 47],acutoffscore of 6 can be used in order to clinically divide patients withsleep problems from patients with good sleep. The patientgroup with schizophrenia falls below this clinically relevantsc o r ea ft e rtr ea tm e n t .Th epa ti e n tgr o u pwi thd e p r e s s i o nh a sEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 0.351 Disorders) showed significant improvements in theschizophrenia group, but not in the depression group. Thisindicates that the patients with schizophrenia took morebenefit from acupuncture than the patients with depres-s i o n .O fn o t e ,t h e s ep a t i e n t sf e l la s l e e pf a s t e ra n de v e napproached normal levels on the subtest (PSQI Latency),meaningthatpatientswithschizophrenialayawakelesslongbefore falling asleep after acupuncture treatment and that they reached levels that are commonly found in healthy controls. They also used less medication in order to sleepand reached normative levels also on the subtest for sleepdisorders. Five of the patients with schizophrenia (from theacupuncture condition) used sleep medication of differentk i n d sb e f o r e h a n d ,w h e r e a sf o u ro ft h e ma n s w e r e dt h a tt h e yhad stopped using this medication during the time of theacupuncture treatment. Moreover, one of the patients in thewaiting list condition of this group, who had not used sleepmedication beforehand, started using sleep medication. Onthe other hand, six of the patients with depression (two intheacupuncturegroupandfourinthewaitinglistcondition)usedsleepmedicationbeforehandofwhich4(inthewaitinglist condition) stopped using this medication and one of theother patients in the waiting list group started to use sleepmedication. There were no differences between or withinthe depression groups on medication use as reported by thepatient. The intervention phase lasted three months (12 treat- ments)only.Futurestudiesmightconsiderwhetherthenov-elty factor of this intervention or the short-term availabilityimpliesthatpatientsaremorelikelytoattend.Itisnotknownwhether patients would be so keen to attend acupuncturewere it available as part of their normal treatment package.There were no withdrawals from the acupuncture or waitinglist groups in this study. In this clinic, as part of the normaltreatment package, patients can choose to visit treatmentgroups like, for instance; a psychosis education group, sleeptraining,depressiongroup,socialcompetencytraininggroupor a memory training. All of these groups last 10 to 12 times andhaveadropoutratebetween30to40%.Thesedifferencesbetween the regular groups and this study might be causedby the small amount of appointments in the waiting listconditionaswellasapositiveexperienceintheacupuncturegroups. This impression is supported by the absent dropoutand the comments made by participants (that reported, forinstance: feeling less tired, more relaxed, and better able tosleep), that they were satisfied with the treatment and keento have it. On the other hand, it is important to note thatt h ep a r t i c i p a n t sw e r el a r g e l ys e l f - s e l e c t i n g( a st h e ya r ei n every group they attend in this clinic) and therefore more likely to come to the treatments anyway. However, in orderto draw more firm conclusions, it would have been better toimplementameasureoftreatmentsatisfactioninthestudy. Some participants reduced their medication, in consul- tation with their psychiatrist, as a result of the acupuncturetreatment. These participants saw this as a benefit of theacupuncture.Medicationreductionisusuallyseenaspositiveby patients. It is felt to be a sense of improvement orachievement. It may be that the promise of a reductionin medication through acupuncture may be a motivationalfactorforattendanceatacupuncturetreatments.Ontheotherhand, it is important to note that there are possible pitfallsin reducing medication as well. It has been described thatpatients with schizophrenia who improve through the useof acupuncture and as a result reduce or even stop takingmedication may become more vulnerable to breakdown[52]. Further research is needed to confirm these subjective comments that were reported by the patients in this studyand to investigate the possibility that acupuncture may bemisused as an excuse for nonadherence with conventionalmedication. Limitations. Since the study involves acupuncture, it is obvi- ousthattheproblemoftheabsenceofasuitablecontrolgroupor placebo needs to be mentioned [ 30]. In this study, it was chosen to investigate the \"normal\" or \"real-world\" manualindividualizedacupuncturetreatmentthatanypatientwould8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine r e c e i v ei ft h e ys h o u l dg ot oa no r i e n t a lm e d i c a lp r a c t i t i o n e r . The use of a standardized protocol for acupuncture is,besidestheNationalAcupunctureDetoxificationAssociation(NADA) protocol that is used for addiction and trauma[53], unheard of in clinical TCM practice. The use of such a standardization would therefore not shed any light on the possible effect that an acupuncture add-on treatment (that patients seek outside our psychiatric clinics) wouldhave on patients and would not be generalisable to routineclinical practice [ 54]. In this study, a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used; this approach attemptsto answer a \"real-world\" question whether acupuncture asadd-on treatment improves sleep more than without thistreatment. Our overall goal was to deliver better treatmenttopatientsandthisimpliesthatwehavetoevaluatewhatcanbedoneindailypractice.MacPherson[ 55]pa ra p hrasedthis issue by stating that \"the question in acupuncture researchshould be rather whether acupuncture is of better valuethan what is currently on offer instead of asking whetheracupunctureisbetterthanplacebo?\" Due to the ethical problems related to discontinu- ing treatment with antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs,patients continued their medication during the study. Wehave listed the doses in Chlorpromazine equivalents andinformation on medication that was used in Table 2.D u e to the fact that psychiatric patients use a wide variety ofmedication,itwasnotpossible,withintheconvenientsampleinourmonocenterpilotstudy ,toincludeonlythosethatusethesamemedicationandmedicationdoses.

Introduction Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops following a stressful event or situation of an exceptionally threateningor catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasivedistress [1]. PTSD is classified as an anxiety disorder and is typicallydefinedbythecoexistenceof3clustersofsymptoms,namely,reexperiencing ,marked avoidance ,a n dhyperarousal [2] .Th ep r e v a l e n c er a t e so fP T S Dh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e da s6 - 25%[3],andapproximately25-30%ofpeopleexperiencinga traumaticeventmaygoontodevelopPTSD[ 4]. Current first-line PTSD therapy (CBT), stress inoculationtraining, and pharmacotherapies [ 5]. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions include a rangeof therapies that are not considered standard to the practiceof medicine in the USA. CAM therapies are widely used bymentalhealthconsumers,includingveterans,andnumerous stakeholders have expressed strong interest in fostering the evidencebasefortheseapproachesinPTSD[ 6].Inaddition, approximately 21% of CAM users met diagnostic criteria forat least one problematic mental disorder, according to onestudy[7]. Acupuncture is commonly recognized worldwide as a mainstream CAM therapy. Acupuncture is the practice ofinserting a needle or needles into certain points in the2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine body,knownasmeridianacupuncturepoints,fortherapeutic or preventive purposes [ 8]. Numerous studies have shown that acupuncture is well tolerated by patients, safe, and costeffectivecomparedtoroutinecare[ 9]. Additionally, acupuncture is widely used in mental dis- orders such as anxiety disorders [ 10], dementia [ 11], eating disorders [ 12], schizophrenia [ 13], sleep disorders [ 14], and substance-related disorders [ 15,16]. Electroacupuncture is effective in rat models of stress and thus might be a use-ful adjunct therapy in stress-related anxiety disorders [ 17]. Acupuncturehas positiveeffects in PTSD patients,althought h ee v i d e n c ei ss t i l ll a c k i n ga st oi t st r u ee ffi c a c yf o rt h i scondition[ 18]. There have been two reviews published on acupuncture or its variants for PTSD [ 19,20]. David Feinstein reviewed 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 6 outcome studieswhich tested whether brief psychological exposure witha c u p o i n tt a p p i n gw a se ff e c t i v ef o rP T S Do rn o ta n di t sconclusionwasnotconfirmative[ 19].AlsoMichaelHollifield reviewedacupunctureforPTSDreferringonepublishedandoneunpublishedclinicaltrialandsuggestedfurtherdefinitiveresearch is needed because of lack of well-conducted RCTs[20].However,therehasbeennosystematicreviewpublished to date fully summarizing the current total evidence aboutt h eq u a l i t ya n de ff e c t i v e n e s so fa c u p u n c t u r ef o rP T S D .F o rthis reason, we conducted a systematic review of RCTsand prospective clinical trials to assess critically whetheracupuncture improves the symptoms of PTSD and to makerecommendations for future research based on gap areasidentifiedinthisreview . 2. Methods 2.1. Data Sources and Search Strategy. Following the COSI model [ 21], we searched the following electronic databases over time periods from their inception to July2012: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, theCochraneCentralRegisterofControlledTrials(CENTRAL),MEDLINE through PubMed, EMBASE, Allied andComplementary Medicine Database (AMED), CINAHL,Pilots, Google, Korean databases (which include DBpia,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information(KISTI), KoreaMed, Korean traditional knowledge portal,OASIS, RISS, the National Assembly Library, and TheNational Library of Korea), Chinese databases (which includeChinaAcademicJournal, http://www.cqvip.com a Aggregator Electronic).We also searched the grey literature; unpublishedtrials were searched via the Register of the ControlledTrials databases ( http://www.controlled-trials.com and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ), and we communicated with identified experts in the field of acupuncture and PTSD,searched our departmental files, and pearled the referencesof all included articles for otherrelevant articles perhaps notpickedupthroughothermethodsofsearching. Th ek e ys e a r c ht e r m sw e r e\" ( a c u p u n c t u r eO Ra c u p ) AND (stress disorders, post-Traumatic OR posttraumaticstressdisorderORposttraumaticstressdisorderORPTSD).\" MeSH strategy was applied to ensure the most powerfulsearch where applicable. Search strategies were adjusted foreach of the databases. Personal contacts were made withthe original authors of the searched studies to identify anypotentialmissingdatafromthepublications. 2.2. Study Selection. Two psychiatrists (J. H. Lim and H. W. Kang) actively participated in the study selection processbasedonclinicalexpertise,andtwoexperiencedresearchers(B. C. Shin, C. Cindy) monitored the whole process ofsystematic review. All reviewers were fully trained in thesystematicreviewprocessexecuted. 2.2.1. Types of Studies. The review was not restricted by study design, however, study should be prospective clinicaltrials. We included RCTs and nonrandomized controlledtrialsthatcomparedacupunctureoritsvariantswithacontrolor control groups. We also included uncontrolled clinicaltrials (UCTs) of acupuncture for PTSD to give our researchquestion a more solid ground or to make recommendationsfor future research. However, we separately analyzed RCTsandothers,andinterpretedmoreweightedonRCTsbecauseof research quality following the validity of evidence.

After screening titles and abstracts retrieved through oursearch, we excluded all articles that did not match ourinclusion/exclusion criteria according to the predefined eli-gibility criteria mentioned above. Then, expected inclusionswere carefully read in full text, and final inclusion was decided by two independent reviewers (Y. D. Kim, I. Heo) by matching method. If studies were written in languagesincomprehensible for the reviewers, all articles not writtenin native language were translated by colleagues. Then wefirst classified these by the eligibility criteria. If there was aneedforfulltextreview,weevaluatedtheseaftertranslation.Data were extracted independently based on predefinedcharacteristicstodescribeeachstudy(referto Table 1)bythe tworeviewers.Alldisagreementswereresolvedbydiscussionand consensus, or by the first author.

After screening the titles and abstracts, weexcluded 120 studies ( Figure1). 16 articles were read in full andevaluated.Subsequently,5studieswereexcludedbecause 1 was a controlled trial but the control group members werehealthy subjects [ 30], 1 was active status not recruiting [ 31], 1w a sr e c r u i t i n gs t a t u s[ 32], and 2 were completed but with theresultsnotpublished[ 33,34]. Finally 9 RCTs and 2 UCTs were identified. Of 9 RCTs published, Zhang et al. RCT [ 25] was split or duplicated published with same data [ 25,35- 39]. So we included only 1 RCT with full data [ 25]f r o mt h e 6R C T s[25,35-39]. Consequently, 4 RCTs [ 18,25-27]a n d 2U C T s[ 28,29] met our inclusion criteria.

One RCT compared needle acupuncture to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and a waitlist control[18],andanotherusedelectroacupunctureonlyorwithmox- ibustion or with auricular acupuncture versus oral selectives e r o t o n i nr e u p t a k ei n h i b i t o r s( S S R I s )[ 25]. One RCT tested electroacupuncture plus moxibustion versus oral SSRI 26], one RCT compared acupoint stimulation plus CBT to CBT alone [ 27]. One UCT [ 29]u s e dj u s ta c u p u n c t u r e , the other UCT [ 28] used electroacupuncture plus auricular n d1U C T[ 29] used stimulation without electrical stimulation, andthe other 3RCTs [ 25-27]a n d1 U C Control/CBT versus Waitlist Control. One high-quality RCT evaluated the effect of acupuncture against CBT and awaitlist control [ 18]. No statistical difference was found between acupuncture and CBT. But, acupuncture treatmentwas statistically superior to waitlist control on (ES, 0.64;=0.03 , Table 1). The CBT was also statistically superior to waitlist control on CBT 41](Table 1). 3.3.2.

Reporting Quality of 4 Included RCTs Based on CON- SORT 2010 Checklist. Many leading medical journals andmajor international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement, and the statement facilitates criticalappraisal and interpretation of RCTs [ 23]. For this reason, thecurrentreviewassessedthereportingqualityofincluded RCTsbasedontheCONSORT2010guideline.The4included RCTs described items (59.5%) [ 18]a m o n g3 7i t ofCONSORTwasdesignedtoimprovethecompletenessandtransparencyofreportingofinterventionsincontrolledtrialsof acupuncture [ 24], so that such trials may be more accu- rately interpreted and readily replicated [ 24]. The reporting qualityofacupuncturewashighfortwooftheincludedRCTs[18,25], medium in one [ 26], and low in remaining RCT [27 ]. The 4 included RCTs reported 16 items (94.1%) [18],15items(88.2%)[ 25],13items(76.5%)[ 26],and8items (47.1%)[27]accordingtotherevisedSTRICTAguideline.The two high-quality trials [ 18,25] presented almost all items transparently except one or two items, whereas the low- quality trial [ 27] did not describe clearly even the reported 8items(Table 3). 4. Discussion Th i si st h efi r s ts y s t e m a t i cr e v i e wa n dm e t a - a n a l y s i so f prospectiveclinicaltrialsontheeffectivenessofacupuncturefor treatment of PTSD. Only 4 RCTs and 2 UCTs met theinclusion criteria for this review. Our main finding of thisreviewisthatacupunctureiseffectiveforPTSDbasedononehigh-qualityRCT[ 18]andameta-analysis. The high-quality RCT showed that acupuncture had statistically significant effects compared to a waitlist con-trol, although no statistical difference was [25]36.15 [25]6.51 similar with CBT therapy based on the trial. Addi-tionally, the clinical improvement related to acupuncture orCBTlastedforatleast3monthsaftertheendoftreatmentinthehigh-qualityRCT. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture plus moxi- bustion was superior to oral SSRI for PTSD. But, we shouldinterprettheseresultswithcautionbecausethemeta-analysiswas based on one medium-quality RCT [ 25]a n do n el o w - qualityRCT[ 26]. One RCT [ 27]s h o w e dt h a ta c u p o i n ts t i m u l a t i o np l u s CBT was more effective than CBT alone in reducing PTSD symptoms. However, acupuncture treatment was notdescribed transparently. Therefore, this result had doubtfulreliability. We found a similar pattern of reporting quality when comparingtheCochraneriskofbias[ 22]withtheCONSORT 2010 checklist [ 23]. Two of the included studies [ 18,25]h a d a high reporting quality in terms of acupuncture based ontherevisedSTRICTAguideline[ 24].Allthestudiesfailedto describeindetailadverseeffectsrelatedtoacupuncture. W ew o u l dl i k et oe m p h a s i z et h ec l i n i c a li m p o r t a n c e of acupuncture for PTSD. Acupuncture might be usefulin emergency medicine [ 44]. A recent case series study suggestedpossibleeffectivenessofacupunctureinemergencyconditions involving PTSD and emotional trauma [ 45]. In addition, acupuncture is a conveniently portable medicaldevice for taking emergency measures, and it is very cheap,safe,andeasytohandlefortrainedpractitioners. Accordingtoastudy[ 46],duringlong-termSSRItherapy, the most troubling adverse effects were sexual dysfunction, weightgain,andsleepdisturbance.Theincidencerateofsex- ualdysfunctionwasreportedas2%to7%[ 47].Meanweight gain of 10.8kg (24lbs) was found after 6 to 12 months ofparoxetinetherapy[ 48].Ontheotherhand,foracupuncture, \"mild\" adverse events of such as bleeding, bruising, pain onneedlingoccurredinrateof6.8%(2,178outof31,822sessions)[49]. And no serious adverse events were reported in total 66,229 treatment sessions according to two studies [ 49,50]. ThereforeacupuncturemaybearelativelysafealternativeforPTSDincontrasttoSSRI,iflong-termtherapyisneededfortreatment. This systematic review has several limitations. First, although we made strong efforts to retrieve all RCTs onthe subject, the evidence reviewed is potentially incompletebecause only one rigorous study was included. Second,becausetherewasnoRCTonPTSDwithashamacupuncturecontrol, we could not evaluate the effects of acupuncturecomparedtoaninertplacebocontrol[ 51].Third,studydesign wasquitedifferentacrossthefourincludedRCTs.TwoRCTs[18,25] compared acupuncture with different controls (CBT and oral SSRI), and the other two RCTs [ 26,27]e m p l o y e d acupuncture as a cointervention of moxibustion and CBT.Theseverydifferentdesignsacrossstudiespreventedusfromabstracting a firm conclusion. Furthermore, the paucity of includedtrialsandthesuboptimalmethodologicalqualityof theprimarydataoverall,exceptforonehigh-qualitytrial,arealsoimportantvulnerabilitiesofthisreview.In total, from these drawbacks we could suggest several importantrecommendationsforfutureresearchinthisarea.One is a need for appropriate controls such as sham/placebocontrol or other relevant active controls for testing theefficacy or effectiveness of acupuncture for PTSD in thedesignofparallelRCTorcomparativeeffectivenessresearch. The second is outcomes should be used by validated one as primary one is PTSD scale and the secondary one isdepression or anxiety with safety reporting. The third ishighmethodologicalqualityisstronglyrequired,asadequaterandomizationwithallocationconcealment,blindingofpar-ticipantsandassessors,orsamplesizeestimationforpoweroftrial,withfollowingguidelineofCONSORTandSTRICTA. 5.

Conclusions . Preliminary evidence suggests that Gigong may have positive eects on psychological well-being among patients with chronic illnesses. However the published studies generally had signicant methodological limitations. More high- qualitystudiesareneeded. 1.Introduction e word \"Qigong\" is a combination of two concepts: \" Q i , \"t h ev i t a le n e r g yo ft h eb o d y ,a n d\" g o n g , \"t h es k i l lo f working of the Qi. Together, Qigong (or Chi Kung) meanscultivatingenergy[1 ].QigongisbasedonTaoistphilosophy and traditional Chinese medicine theories to cultivate Qi. Ithasahistoryofseveralthousandyears,andisahighlypopularpractice,particularlyinChina,forhealthmaintenance,heal- ing, and increasing vitality [2]. Qigong can be divided into various categories such as static Qigong, dynamic Qigong, internalQigong(neiqi ),andexternalQigong(waiqi )[3]. Qigong exercises consist of a series of orchestrated practicesincludingbodyposture,movement,breathing,andmeditation, all of which have been designed to enhance Qi function\u2014that is, to draw upon natural forces to optimize andbalanceenergywithin,throughtheattainmentofdeeply focused and relaxed states [ 4]. An overview of the research literature pertaining to internal Qigong yields more than a dozenformsthathavebeenstudiedontheireectsonhealth outcomes, including Guo-lin, Chun-Do-Sun-Bup, Vitality or Bu Zheng Qigong, Eight Brocade, and Medical Qigong [5,6]. As a form of gentle exercise, Qigong is composed of repetitive movements that are used for strengthening and stretching the body, increasing circulation of various uids (blood, synovial, and lymph), enhancing balance, and building awareness of how the body moves through space2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine [6].FromtheperspectiveofWesternphilosophyandscience, it could be hypothesized that meditation techniques,elicitstheRelaxationResponseandalleviatesthedysregulationofthehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxis[ 7]. epotentialpsychologicalbenetsderivedfromthepractice ofQigongmayincluderelaxation,exposure,desensitization, deautomatization,catharsis,andcounterconditioning[ 8]. As a form of complementary and alternative medicine , Qigong has been used to treat medical conditions such as high blood pressure [9, 10], bone loss [11], and weight- loss maintenance [12]. Short-term Qigong training appears to improve functions of the respiratory [13 ] and immune systems [14]. Various health claims about Qigong have been made for: patients, and patients with injury,arthritis,andbromyalgia[ 21,22]. Several Qigong review articles have been published, which mainly focus on the eects of Qigong on specic medical conditions such as hypertension [17 ], cancer [ 19], andgeriatricpatients[23 ].However,forhealthpractitioners, itisstillunclearwhetherQigongcanberecommendedasan eective therapy for emotional problems and for improving psychological well-being. e purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically review the eects of Qigong on psy- chological outcomes. Due to the limited number of studiesin this area, we reviewed Qigong studies which reportedon a relatively wide spectrum of outcomes including mood, anxiety,psychologicalwell-being,self-ecacy,andqualityof life. 2.MaterialsandMethods 2.1. Data Searches and Study Selection. Since many Qigong studies were conducted in China and published only inChinese language journals, the authors included threeresearchers from China and ve researchers from the .S.Electronic relevant publications from both Chinese and English databases were reviewed. Two reviewers searched and screened the titles and abstracts of the studies iden- tied by the search against the eligibility criteria for English databases independently. One reviewer searched and screened the studies in Chinese. For potentially eligible studies, the full text publications were obtained and criteriareapplied. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. A pro- fessionallibrarianwasconsultedinoursearchprocess. Research articles published in English on the eects of Qigong on mood and depression were identied from the followingdatabases:fromtheinceptionto2011onMedline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Reviews, Ovid, EBSCOhost, and all of the journals in the Harvard Countway Library of Medicine. Research articles published in Chinese on theeects of Qigong on mood and depression were identied from the following Chinese databases: from the inception to 2011 on CNKI, Wan Fang Med Online, and VMIS. ForEnglish databases, the key words used included a combina- key words used included equivalent Chinesetermsasmainsubjectheadings,textwordsintitles,andabstracts. According to the selection criteria, interventions were restrictedtoQigong.Otherpsychologicalinterventionssuchas yoga and meditation were excluded; mixed interven-tions (e.g., acupuncture and Qigong in combination) were excluded (as described in Figure 1). e primary outcomes evaluated were psychological, with particular emphasis on mood,anxiety,depression,self-ecacy,andqualityoflife. To be included in the meta-analyses, studies needed to have either a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-experimental (Q-E) design. e process of study selectionwasdescribedin Figure1.Astudywasoperationallydened as RCT in this paper if the allocation of participants totreatment and comparison groups was reported to be ran- domized. If allocation of participants was done through a systematicsequence(e.g.,alternatedaysoftheweek)without randomization,thestudywasoperationallydenedashaving a Q-E design in this paper. Studies that did not use any typeofcomparisongroup,ordidnotreportanycomparison results between groups, or used mixed interventions were excluded. Duplicate publications were also excluded. Titles andabstractsgatheredfromthedatabaseswererstreviewedfor relevance to this paper. e full text of papers that metthe inclusion criteria were then obtained, and ndings were summarized. 2.2. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment. We assessed thecharacteristicsoftheoriginalresearchandextracteddata accordingly. Some basic information was collected based on dateofpublication,studysites,languageofstudy,andclinical domains (see Table 1). e methodological quality of RCTs was evaluated based on six criteria: adequate sequence gen- eration, allocation concealment, blinding which including the blindness adopted during the conduct and analysis of the studies, completeness of outcome data, selective report- ing, and other potential biases, for which the compliance assessment, similarity of comparison groups at baseline and appropriateness of the statistical analyses should be assessed[24,25](Table 2). Findings of 15 studies were tabulated regarding sample characteristics(i.e.,totalsamplesize,age,gender,numberofparticipants in Qigong group), duration, intervention style,design of control measures being used, and main outcomes (Table 3).Tworeviewersextracteddataandassessedthequal- ity of each study independently.

Clin- ical heterogeneity usually came from etc.). Methodological heterogeneity refers to dierences between studies in terms of methodological factors, such as sequence generation and concealment of allocation [ 24]. If the studies did not have these hetero- geneities, we performed a meta-analysis and determined whether they showed statistical heterogeneity by visually inspecting the forest plots and by using a standard 2-test with a signicance level of , given the low power of suchtests.Statisticalheterogeneitywasspecicallyexamined with2[25], where2values of 50% or more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity [ 27]. When heterogeneity was found, we attempted to determine potential reasons for itbyexaminingindividualstudycharacteristics. 2.2.2. Assessment of Reporting Biases. Because all 15 studies we reviewed had small samples, funnel plots were used in an exploratory analysis to assess the potential existence of small study bias if 9 or more studies were included in one meta-analysis. If less than 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis,weconsideredthatapotentialriskofselective reportingexisted[24]. 2.2.3. Data Statistical Analysis and Quality Assessments of Outcome Measures. Since all outcomes were continuous variables, if the same measurement was used across studies,eect size (ES) was determined by calculating the mean dierence between groups. If the same underlying concept was measured but dierent outcome measurements were used, ES was determined by calculating the standardized meandierencebetweengroups. Becauseofthedierenttrialsimplementedvariousstyles of Qigong, if any trials with three or more treatment arms were identied, we made two assumptions for the analysis.Firstly, if the trial was comparing two or more styles of Qigong versus control, then the data for those Qigonga r m sw e r ec o m b i n e dt og i v eo n ec o m p a r i s o no fQ i g o n g interventionversuscontrolforthattrial. Secondly, if the trial was comparing Qigong versus two o rm o r ec o n t r o l s ,t h e nt h ed a t af o rt h o s ec o n t r o la r m sw e r e keptseparate,andthedataforthattrialwereincludedinthe appropriatecontrolcategories. Overall outcome was assessed by pooling the ES of each study. In view of the heterogeneity, random-eects model was used for pooling. All analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5 (Version 5.0; e Chinese CochraneCentre, e Cochrane Collaboration; Chengdu, China). Weassessed the quality of the outcome of measures using GRADEprolerversion3. 3.Results 3.1. Study Description. Fieen studies published between 2001 and 2011 were included in this systematic review. Of these, 6 were published in Chinese and identied from Chi- nese databases [28 -33] in English and identiedfromEnglishdatabases[15 ,34-41].Disagreement forarticlesincludedwason5of20.eywereexcludedaer discussion. Only one of these studies was conducted in the United States; the majority ( ) of the remaining studies were conducted in China, including Hong Kong. In six studies,eects of Qigong interventions were examined in healthy adultswithoutanyspecicmedicalconditions.emajority ofthestudies,however,targetedindividualswithavarietyof chronic conditions, including diabetes Index (GSI); e Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); the Hong Kong Chinese Version World HealthOrganizationQualityofLife:AbbreviatedVersion(WHOQOL-BREF[HK]);Self-conceptScale(ASSEI);Psychoticism(PSY);PositiveSymptomTotal(PST);theChineseGeneralSelf-ecacyScale(CGSS); PersonalWell-beingIndex(PWI);GeneralHealthQuestionnaire-12(GHQ-12).8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Table 2presents the methodological quality of the 15 studies reviewed.

Eight studies reported the number of drop- outs and related reasons [ 15,28,34-38,40]. ree studies reported the number of drop-outs, but did not explain the reasons for drop-outs [ 31,32,39]. Two studies described the periods of follow-up [ 15,40]. rough careful reading of the study and contacting the study authors for additional information,wetriedtoexaminewhethertherewasselective reporting of outcomes. Two studies reported all outcome measurements [30, 32]. One study did not address all of the outcomes [ 31]. For the majority of the studies, the existenceofselectivereportingcouldnotbedetermineddue toinadequateinformation. Five studies described the methods to evaluate the adherence of patients to intervention [30, 34,35,38,39]. Comprehensive comparisons of demographic and baseline information were presented in eight studies [28 ,31,32,34, 35,38,40,41],twoofwhichreportedthatsomedemographic characteristics were unbalanced among comparison groups at baseline [34, 40]. e statistical methods in all of the includedstudieswereconsideredappropriatefortheanalysesperformed. Table 3summarized the 15 studies with regard to eects of Qigong on psychological well-being outcomes. e study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 162, with a total of 1154 research participants. Among them, 593 subjects received Qigong intervention. All studies recruited participants aged18yearsandupwiththemajorityintheirmiddleadulthood.Twostudiestargetedparticipantsaged65andolder[ 40,41], andonestudyrecruitedyoungadultsincollegesettings[ 33]. Moststudiesincludemixedgendergroups,thoughonestudyincludedmalesonly[37 ]. e durations of the interventions ranged from 70 min- utes to 4 months. Interventions of 3-4 months' durationappeared to be the norm for demonstrating changes while maximizing study enrollment and adherence. Among theQigong intervention studies, the most popular form was the \"Eight Section Brocade Exercise.\" During and outside of group practice sessions, peer learning and discussions to facilitatesocialinteractionandmutualsupportwereencour- aged since these may be important therapeutic ingredients. In most of the studies, control groups received treatment asusual and routinemedical check-up.ree studiesutilized awaitlistasthecontrolgroup[ 15,35,39]. outcomes,onlythestudybyTsangetal.targetedparticipants withapsychiatricdisorder[ 40].eremainingstudiedeither healthysubjectsorsubjectswithchronicmedicalconditions, andexaminedpsychologicalfactorsassecondarygoalsofthe study. e most frequently reported psychological benets were decreased depressive symptoms and improved mood, reported in seven studies [28- 31,36-38], as evidenced by scores on depression scales (e.g., Hamilton Depression Severity Index-17, Self-Rating Depression Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, etc.). Depression was shown to improve signicantly in studies comparing Qigongtoaninactivecontrol,newspaperreading[ 40],usual care, psychosocial support, controls [30].eneralmeasuresofmood(e.g.,ProleofMoodStates) improvedsignicantlyforthosepracticingQigongcomparedto a wait-list control group [15]. In two studies, depressive symptoms improved, but the change was not statistically signicant, for both Qigong and for exercise comparison groups[34,41]. Participantsintheinterventiongroupsalsodemonstrated reducedanxiety[ 29-31,37,41],asassessedbyscalessuchas theSelf-RatingAnxietyScale.Anxietydecreasedsignicantly for participants practicing Qigong compared to an active exercisegroup[15, 34]. ree studies reported statistically signicant improve- ments in somatic symptoms among the intervention groupas evidenced by scales such as the Symptom Checklist-90 and Somatization Scale [28 ]. In these studies, participants also reported lower perceived stress and intensity of pain comparedwiththecontrolgroup. Some studies employed measures of physical health and biomarkers, including blood pressure [15 ], cholesterol levels [30,31], fasting blood sugar [29, 30,32], and triglycerides [29,30].Inonestudyexaminingbiomarkersrelatedtostress response, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and blood cortisol levels were signicantly decreased in response to Qigong comparedtoawait-listcontrolgroup[15]. Improvement of overall quality of life (QOL) was the second most frequently mentioned benet reported in six studies[28 ,29,31,34,40,41].Instudieswithheterogeneous participants (including healthy adults, patients with cancer,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 post-stroke,arthritis,etc.),atleastoneofthecomponentsof QOL was reported to be signicantly improved by Qigong comparedtonewspaperreading[ 40]ortraditionalremedial rehabilitation [ 41]. In one study, Qigong showed improve- ments in QOL compared to an exercise intervention, but the results did not reach statistical signicance [ 34] .W i t ha few exceptions, the majority of studies indicate that Qigong holdsgreatpotentialforimprovingQOLinbothhealthyandchronicallyillpatients. Self-ecacy was generally assessed in the RCTs as a secondaryoutcomerelatedtotheproblemareaunderinvesti- gation(e.g.,ecacytomanageadiseaseorpainsymptom,or in the case of falls among the elderly, feeling more condent that one will not fall). e perceived ability to handle stressor novel experiences [15 ,40] and exercise self-ecacy [15] werefoundtobeenhancedintheQigonginterventiongroups relativetocontrolgroups. 3.2. Meta Analyses for ree Subgroups. We categorized the studies into three groups based on the type of subjects for further analysis as follows: (1) healthy subjects, (2) subjects with chronic illnesses, and (3) subjects with depression. Only one RCT recruited subjects with depression [ 40] and therefore no meta-analysis was needed for this group. Six RCTs were included in the group of studies with healthy subjects[29,33,35-37,39].Meta-analysiswasnotperformed in this group. One study recruited only male participants, whichmadeithardtocomparetootherstudies[37 ].Another studyusedacrossoverdesignwitheachparticipantservingas his or her own control without a separate comparison group [39]. e remaining four studies used dierent groups as controls,includingalecture[36],TaiChiandtnessYangko[29],awaitlist[35],andanunclearlydescribedcontrol[33]. Eight RCTs were included in the group of studies of patientswithchronicillnesses[ 5,28,30-32,34,38,41]. Five studies were excluded from the meta-analysis. One studywas quasi-experimental [15], and another study had a high dropout rate (32% in the intervention group and 35 %in the control) [38]. e other three studies were excluded since they used a dierent control group than the three RCTs includedinmeta-analysis,whichusedtreatmentasusualand no Qigong intervention as control. ree of the excluded studiesusedthefollowingcontrolconditions\u2014conventional exercise [ 34], traditional remedial rehabilitation under the supervision of qualied professionals [41], and health edu-cation[28]. Aer assessment of heterogeneity and consideration of the choices of varying control groups used in dierent studies, meta-analysis of outcomes related to depression measured by Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were per-formed on the remaining three RCTs of patients with typeII diabetes [ 30-32]. Baseline characteristics were reasonably well balanced between the Qigong group and the controlgroupforthethreetrials.Atendpoint,therewereasignicant dierencesbetweenthetwogroupsonobsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety and anger-hostility in Wang's study, on somatizationinLin'sstudy,andonphobicanxietyinZhang'sstudy ( ). Results of the individual trials for SCL-90 arepresentedin Table 4. We found signicant dierences = 29,9% CI,0.58-0.00), with 2=%(Figure 2(e)). Meta-analysis of outcomes related to anxiety were also performed in the same three studies [30-32 ]. We found signicant dierences between groups (ES = 37;9% CI, 0.660.08),with 2=%(Figure2(f)). Besides depression and anxiety, meta-analysis of other symptoms of SCL-90 were also performed in the same three studies. We found signicant dierences between groups in total in of psy- chological health measured by Diabetes Specic Quality of Life Scale (DSQL) [ 29,36]. Baseline characteristics were reasonably well balanced between the Qigong group and the control group for the two trials. At endpoint, there was a signicant dierence between the two groups on psychological health ( ). Results of the individual trialsforDSQLarepresentedin Table 4. We also found signicant dierences between groups (ES= 8,9% CI,0.910.25), with 2=%(Figure 2(k)). Data synthesis showed that Qigong was eective in reducing depression and anxiety and improving psycholog-ical well-being among subjects with type II diabetes. Yet thequality of the outcomes measures used in these studies was low(Table 5). 4.Discussion estudiesinthispaperdemonstratedthatQigongmayhave benecial eects for a variety of populations on a range ofpsychologicalwell-beingmeasures,includingmood,anxiety, depression, general stress management, quality of life, and exercise self-ecacy. e movements of Qigong is relatively easytolearn,whencomparedtoothermindbodytraditions [2,4]. Hence, people from diverse backgrounds practice Qigong for a variety of reasons, including exercise, recre-ation, well-being, self-healing, meditation, self-cultivation,and training for martial arts. We see a great potential forQigong to be integrated for the prevention and treatment of variouschronicillnesses,includingpsychiatricdisorders. is systematic review highlights the mood and psycho- logicaleectsofQigonginadditiontoitsphysicaleects.e outcomesofthethreeselectedstudiesshowedimprovements in psychological well-being, especially when the control intervention does not include active interventions such asexercise. ese studies used SCL-90 to measure the pre-and post-outcomes related to Qigong intervention.

Due to the small number of studies available in this area, and the diverse outcomes used, we limited meta-analysis on patients with diabetes. Withmorerelevantstudiesinthefuture,itwillbeinformative to review separately, the anxiety and depressive outcomesamonghealthysubjects,patientswithspecicchronicillness (e.g., bromyalgia, tension headache, etc.), and for patients with specic psychiatric disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder,panicdisorder,majordepressivedisorder,etc.). Qigong practice usually involves doing Qigong (move- ments with breathing exercises and visualization), plus peer learning, social support, and positive expectation. All thesecould have benecial eects to psychological well being and so all these are encouraged in Qigong practice. We have acknowledged that the outcomes of studying suchQigong practices will not provide us with the information onthequestionwhetherQigong(movementswithbreathing exerciseandvisualization)aloneisbenecialtopsychological well being. Positive expectations or social interactions may add to eects related to the Qigong intervention, to forma multi-component mind-body practices instead of a single (Qigong)intervention. Inthispaper,weincludedstudiesbothfromtheChinese and in English databases. We consider this approach a strength as many Qigong studies continue to be originated inChinaandpublishedinChineselanguage.Whileonlyone researcherperformedliteraturesearchinChinesewhichmay leadtosomebiases,earlyQigongresearchndingspublished before2003(inEnglish),respectively,2000(inChinese)have notbeenconsidered.isapproachhassubstantiallylimitedthe literature base for the present review and consequently also its ndings. e ndings of this study should be inter- pretedinlightofthemethodologicallimitationsofthestudies reviewed.InbothoftheEnglishandChinesestudiesincluded in the review, most of them used treatment as usual (andone used a waitlist) for the control group. is may lead to bias since positive outcomes from the study could be due to positive expectations or social interactions rather thanto the Qigong intervention. A sham treatment which oerssocial interaction and positive expectations from receiving an intervention could be a better control for these studies. It will also be important in future studies to control for whathasbeencalledthefrustreboeect(i.e.,negativeeectsemanatingfromsubjectfrustrationinnotreceivingthekind ofinterventiontheyfeeltheyneed)[42 ]. emajorityoftheseRCTswerepilotstudiesonpatients with chronic illnesses conducted to collect preliminary data on the ecacy of a group intervention to estimate the eect size needed for a larger, more denitive study. While the studies provided valuable data regarding feasibility andclinical ecacy, the use of a small sample could lead to instability of the outcomes, making it harder to generalize to other populations. In addition, many studies used inad- equate blinding of the intervention, which could lead to more favorable responses among the Qigong intervention groups. Most of the cited studies did not provide data on whether participants continued to practice Qigong aer theintervention period. Subsequently, long-term psychological eectsofQigongareunclear. Generally, Qigong practices are considered safe, and there have been few published adverse events [2, 4]. While Qigonginducedpsychosishasbeenreportedeprevalence has been very low [43, 44]. However, there have been no systematic reviews of its risks either. e potential risks of this practice may have been underestimated, reectingunderreporting of adverse events in studies and in practice. In sum, preliminary evidence from the current literature suggeststhatQigongmayhavepositivepsychologicaleects for the chronically ill individuals with symptoms of depres- sionand/oranxiety.However,thestudiesreviewedgenerally had signicant methodological limitations. Future RCTs with rigorous research design based upon the CONSORTstatements[ 45]areneededtoestablishtheecacyofQigong inimprovingpsychologicalwell-beinganditspotentialtobe used as interventions for populations with various clinical conditions.

America experienced a genuinely vast development of biomedical science in the early decades of the twentieth century, which in turn impacted the community of academic psychiatry and changed the way in which clinical and basic research approaches in psychiatry were conceptualized. This development was largely based on the restructuring of research universities in both of the USA and Canada following the influential report of Johns Hopkins-trained science administrator and politician AbrahamFlexner (1866-1959). Flexner's report written in commission for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of T eaching in Washington, DC, also had a major influence on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in psychiatry throughout the 20th century. This paper explores the lasting impact of Flexner's research published on modern medicine and particularly onwhat he interpreted as the various forms of health care and psychiatric treatment that appeared to compete with the paradigm of biomedicine. We will particularly draw attention to the serious e ects of the closing of so many CAM-oriented hospitals, colleges, and medical teaching programs following to the publication of the Flexner Report in 1910. 1. Introduction Between 1900 and 1930, the United States of America and Canada witnessed a major expansion of research activities inthe eld of biomedicine (most notably impacting academicpsychiatry, clinical research in internal medicine, and theintegration of laboratory-based pathology), a process whichbecame strongly connected with the great and lasting trans-formation of modern universities, colleges, and hospitals[1]. This development was at the same time flanked by an influential strategic report, which US science administratorand politician Abraham Flexner (1866-1959) had written in1909, subsequently published by the Carnegie Foundationfor the Advancement of T eaching in 1910 [ 2]. Flexner himself (Figure 1) was trained in the natural sciences at the preeminent Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,MD (USA), where he received a German-style, researcheducation which was grounded in intensive laboratory work and the active pursuit of scientic experimentation onboth graduate and undergraduate levels. Since its inceptionby founding dean William Henry Welsh (1850-1934), in 1884, the medical school had focused on bedside teaching, concise, and standardized clinical observations and the earlyintroduction of laboratory experimentation and researchwork. This science-based form of academic education hada lasting e ect on Flexner's views about the status of modern medicine, who incessantly promoted this newscientic paradigm of medical education and research. T ohim, illegitimate \"nonscientic\" approaches in the medicalmarketplace (such as the o erings of folk psychologists, naturopaths, homoeopaths, chiropractors, and osteopaths)were actively competing with the scientic paradigm ofresearch and education represented at major American andCanadian universities at the time [ 3].2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Figure 1: Abraham Flexner (1866-1959). At the bottom of these events lays a superb growth in the state funding for biomedical research, new psychiatric hospi-tals, and asylums, along with increasing health care supportthrough company-based plans and state welfare insurancecorporations emerging in the \"American Progressive Era\"since the 1890s [ 4]. These initiatives also included additional monetary support for biomedical research and medicaleducation, and they were made possible by philanthropicfoundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and theCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of T eaching inNew Y ork City. American medical schools and academicpsychiatric departments\u2014most prominently represented inthe Clinical Department of Psychiatry headed by the Swiss \u00b4emigr \u00b4e psychiatrist Adolph Meyer (1866-1950)\u2014benetted greatly from the renewed and increased nancial sup-port from external sources after the end of WWI, whenthe number of scientic research publications reachedan unprecedented level and for the rst time comparedfavorably with former leading countries, such as France,Germany, and Britain [ 5,6]. Flexner's report on \"Medical Education in the United States and Canada\" was written inthe middle of the bourgeoning economic and social contextfollowing the turn of the century, and it exerted a signicant impact on the growth of North American biomedicine, yet it also had a large deleterious e ect on the later development of complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) in psychiatry during the 20th Century. Mediatedthrough the commissions of the Carnegie Foundation forthe Advancement of T eaching and its Carnegie FoundationWashington, D C O ce, Flexner's Report subsequently led to shutting down the majority of CAM-oriented colleges andprograms (e.g., medical schools, homoeopathic colleges, andsome psychiatric institutions) before and after WWI [ 7]. Summarizing the context in which Flexner's report appeared, modern scientic medicine\u2014as it had emergedparticularly with the French experimental physiologists inthe 19th Century\u2014[ 8]h a dc o m et ob ec h a l l e n g e db yav a r i - ety of competing contemporary approaches within the medi-cal marketplace (such as naturopathy, traditional homoeopa-thy, chiropractic, osteopathic medicine, and eclectic formsof therapy) [ 9]. And while having himself been trained in the scientic paradigm at Johns Hopkins University, Flexner developed a great reservation against the reliability and value of other \"nonconformist\" approaches in medicine andpsychiatry which he pejoratively attacked as \"charlatanism\"and \"quackery,\" wanting to weed them out from the moderncanon of North American medicine [ 10]. Flexner became adamant in his strive and polemics against all trainingfacilities that o ered education and postgraduate work in the above-mentioned elds and advocated for the closing ofnearly eighty percent of all the contemporary programs inhomeopathy, naturopathy, eclectic therapy, physical therapy,osteopathy, and chiropractic. He had listed these programsin his report under the pejorative titles of the \"medicalsects\" and stated that he openly aimed to \"antagonize\" themthrough the publication of his report, since he saw no rmjuridical way to discard these nonbiomedical approacheson the American medical and psychiatric market. Onlyvery few institutions (approximately twenty percent of thosementioned in the Flexner Report) were subsequently able tocomply with Flexner's constraints and prescriptions, whilemost had to shut their doors forever, particularly those inthe already medically underserved large rural areas of theAmerican Midwest and the Southern States [ 11]. In this paper, we will begin by outlining some of the basic assumptions of Abraham Flexner's report to the Carnegie Foundation and its continuing e ects on the North Ameri- can clinical and research landscape in CAM and psychiatry.We then explore some of the antagonisms between the\"biomedical model\" of health research and nonconventionalapproaches that Flexner had subsumed under the \"medicalsects\" of the time (e.g., homoeopathy, naturopathy, andhomoeopathy, etc.), while pointing to the schism in medicinethat Flexner had introduced and further aggravated andwhich the Canadian medical historian Don G. Bates (1940-2001) has so intriguingly explored and analysed as follows: Recently, and for slightly di erent reasons, this unusual modern, scientic form of medicine [asit had developed during the 19th century] hasalso given rise to another term: biomedicine. Thebio, of course, is meant to point to its strongbiological and therefore material and scienticorientation, but the term is frequently used ina critical, even mildly pejorative sense, in orderto emphasize the ways in which this caricaturefails to make adequate provision for the socialand cultural complexities that form part of anymedical practice [ ...]. [12]. In the nal part of our paper, we look at the more specic aftere ects of the Flexner Report on North American medicine and psychiatry, while keeping in mind that nearlyfty percent of CAM-treated patients today are su ering from psychiatric disorders and symptoms [ 13]\u2014including, for example, anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar, andEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Figure 2: Front page of the Flexner Report of 1910. personality disorders\u2014not rarely treated in conjunction with traditional psychiatric approaches from biological psychia-try, psychoanalysis, and behavioural therapies. 2. Methods Our historiographical research in this paper is based on an analysis of Flexner's Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching (1910) (Figure 2) and the available secondary scholarly, medical, and psychiatric literature onthe subject. By way of an introduction, textbooks andjournal articles on Complementary and Alternative Medicineand Psychiatry are also briefly discussed. Finally, we willscrutinize gray literature and pamphlets published by boththe American National Institutes of Health (NIH) andthe Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), asthese pertained to the relationship between the biomedicalparadigm and CAM-related approaches after the publicationof the Flexner Report and, in particular, the inclusion ofcomplementary and alternative therapies and approaches inpsychiatry during the second half of the 20th century. Thisperspective will allow the impact of the Flexner Report tobe placed within a contemporary context and its long-lastingeects analyzed. 3. Results 3.1. The Period Ensuing from the Flexner Report from 1910s to 1940s. The decades following the publication of the Flexner Report witnessed considerable pressure on all nontraditionalforms of medical and health care training, which wouldnowadays be associated with CAM, as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and productsthat are not presently considered to be part of conventionalmedicine\" [ 14]. In his report, Flexner had made the fol- lowing claims about the new \"standardization\" of Americanmedical education: Scientic medicine therefore brushes aside all his- toric dogma. It gets down to details immediately.No man is asked in whose name he comes\u2014whether that of [Samuel] Hahnemann [1755-1843], [Benjamin] Rush [1746-1813], or of somemore recent But all are required toundergo rigorous cross-examination. [ ...]T h e r e is no need, just as there is no logical justication,for the invocation of names or creeds, for thesegregation from the larger body of establishedtruth of any particular set of truths or supposedtruths as especially precious. [ ...] The tendency to build a system out of a few partially apprehendedfacts, deductive inference lling in the rest, hasnot indeed been limited to medicine, but it hasnowhere had more calamitous consequences [...].(The original text can be found in: Flexner, 1910[2]). Rejecting historical forms of knowledge because of their traditional renown and medical educators' authority\u2014including that of the acclaimed \"father of American psy-chiatry\" and, signatory of the Declaration of Independence,Benjamin Rush, who worked at the rst academic hospitalin Pennsylvania and who wrote a pioneering American text-book on mental disease, entitled Observations and Inquiries upon the Diseases of the Mind (1812)\u2014was a major part of Flexner's general criticisms of contemporary medical pro-grams. In particular, he dispensed with the continued use ofbloodletting, leeches, and purging, as advocated for by Rush,in American psychiatric wards throughout the 19th and theearly years of the 20th century. Flexner especially disap-proved that such treatments were experimentally unprovennor statistically assessed. Following to his reasoning, thesetreatments did not adhere to the \"gold standard\" of modernmedical education in biomedicine, that is, the laboratory-based and bedside-oriented Johns Hopkins model of medicalresearch. He particularly criticized that many of the teachingprograms in the traditional medical colleges and psychiatrichospitals had no experimental physiological, experimentalphysiological laboratories, calling them \"lthy\" and \"unhy-gienic\" institutions [ 2] . His rhetoric would of course stir massive public criticisms in North America, at the time, when rather more than less medical and psychiatric carefacilities and training programs were needed, especially in theunderserved states of the American Midwest and South andthe Canadian Atlantic and Prairie Provinces [ 15]: Of complete [M.D. granting] homeopathic schools, Boston University, the New Y ork Homeo-pathic College, and the Hahnemann of Philadel-phia alone possess the equipment necessary forthe e ective routine teaching of the fundamental4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine branches. [ ...] Of the remaining homeopathic schools, four are weak and uneven: the Hahne-mann of San Francisco and the Hahnemann ofChicago have small, but not altogether inade-quate, equipment for the teaching of chemistry,elementary pathology and bacteriology; the Cleve- land school o e r sa na c t i v ec o u r s ei ne x p e r i m e n t a l physiology. Beyond ordinary dissection andelementary chemistry, they o er little else. [ ...] Six schools remain\u2014all utterly hopeless: [Hering-Chicago, Southwestern, Cincinnati, Atlantic-Baltimore, Detroit & Kansas City]. The buildingsare lthy and neglected. At Louisville no branch isproperly equipped; in one room, the outt is lim-ited to a dirty and tattered manikin; in another,a single guinea pig awaits his fate in a cage. (Theoriginal text can be found in: Flexner, 1910 [ 2]). By also alluding to of Sir William Osler [1849-1919] and the latter's preceding criticisms ofhomoeopathy, Flexner integrated a local aim with a generalpolitical one in order to promote modern biomedical andreductionist strategies in medical and psychiatric education.Canadian icon of medicine, the internist and pathologistWilliam Osler belonged to the founding fathers of the JohnsHopkins University Medical School\u2014together with theAmerican pathologist William H. Welch, the gynaecologistHoward Kelly (1858-1943), and the surgeon William Stew- art Halsted (1852-1922). Their program for restructuring American medical education was likewise based on themodern natural sciences, which aligned well with Flexner'sstrategy and Johns Hopkins' strive for preeminence amongmajor American medical schools [ 16]: Logically, no other outcome is possible. The ebbing vitality of homeopathic [medical] schools is astriking demonstration of the incompatibility ofscience and dogma. [ ...] Science, once embraced, will conquer the whole. Homeopathy has twooptions: one to withdraw into the isolation inwhich alone any peculiar tenet can maintain itself;the other to put that tenet into the melting-pot. Historically it undoubtedly played an impor-tant part in discrediting empirical allopathy.But laboratories of physiology and pharmacologyare now doing that work far more e ectively than homeopathy; and they are at the sametime performing a constructive task for whichhomeopathy, as such, is untted. It will be clear, t h e n ,w h y ,w h e no u t l i n i n gas y s t e mo fs c h o o l sf o r the training of physicians on scientic lines, nospecic provision is made for homeopathy. [ ...]\" A new school of [medical] practitioners has arisen, \"says Dr. [William] Osler, \"which cares be foundin: Flexner, 1910 [ 2]). \" The process of introducing graduate schools for the purpose of scientic research\u2014following the example ofthe German universities during the latter half of the 19th Figure 3: Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). Figure 4: Community health provisions through homoeopathic neighborhood and district hospitals. century\u2014would also change the hierarchies in medicine, since science-based faculties claimed themselves that theyhad a better understanding of pathophysiology, pharma-cology, and treatment options than any other institutions.This even included leading traditional medical colleges, such as some of the oldest homeopathic schools, for example, The Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia andPalmer's Chiropractic School in Davenport, NH, USA.They had been established on pre-18th century styles ofmedical education\u2014inaugurated, for example, in the spiritof Samuel Hahnemann (Figure 3)\u2014and were primarily patient centered, often humanistically oriented and alignedwith community medicine and mental health perspectives(Figure 4)[17]. It is not a di cult task to determine how Flexner's obser- vations and criticisms came to influence the developmentof Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Psychiatryin North America, since this process can be described asEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 a major hindrance for the eld to develop further. Among the recommendations of the Flexner Report were, for example,that the admission to a medical school should require, atminimum, a high school diploma and at least two yearsof college or university study, primarily devoted to basicscience. The length of medical education was estimated to be four years, on top of basic science education and primary college graduation, a requirement which the Committeeon Continuous Medical Education (CME) of the AmericanMedical Association (AMA) had already agreed upon in1905. Furthermore, medical schools should be part of larger research universities, since a proper stand-alone medicalschool would have to charge fees that were too high forboth of its patients and the students in its educationalprograms and thus would not allow the school to breakeven. In addition, Flexner envisioned clinical teaching inacademically oriented hospitals, where thoughtful physiciansand psychiatrists would pursue research stimulated by thequestions that arose in the course of patient care and teachtheir students to do the same. In general, the report triggereda much-needed reform in the standards, organization, andcurriculum of North American medical schools and alsoresulted in a strong emphasis on formal analytic reasoningand positivism in medical science. A mediating position, one could argue, was taken by the Swiss-American psychiatrist Adolph Meyer, who, asmentioned above, directed the most influential clinicaldepartment of psychiatry in North America for more thanforty years, and as a clinical professor at Johns Hopkins' School of Medicine, he balanced the Flexnerian demands for rigorous laboratory-based training in medicine withcertain nonreductionist views inherent to psychiatry andmental health care. In fact, part of Meyer's academic successand full acceptance in the psychiatric community in theUSA and Canada was in line with his reception at JohnsHopkins University of the thorough research program thatEmil Kraeplin (1856-1926) had developed at the ClinicalDepartment of Psychiatry at the University of Munich in1910, while likewise promoting psychohygiene and facili-tating the development of psychosomatic medicine\u2014whichfor Meyer, similar to Flexner, was also a form of followingthe academic example of the German-speaking universities[18]. Despite the important role ascribed to the Flexner Report, for example, the increase of medical professionalism,closure of medical and psychiatric facilities, reduction ofCAM-related educational programs at the existing medicalschools\u2014, it also reflected broader social and political trends,such as an increasing utilitarianism in American society,the necessity to economize social subsidiaries in the healthcare system, and the strengthening of the performance ofscience and medicine in the USA for applications in industry,the agricultural sector, and the military. Quite intriguing inthis regard is a comparison with the situation in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, which did not experience such strong antagonisms and forms of social regulation asthe USA and Canada with the Flexner Report [ 19]. This dierence can be explained by referring to the considerable cultural di erences in the acceptance of CAM-orientedresearch, health care, and education between the German- and English-speaking medical and scientic communities[20]. 3.2. Comparison with the Reorganization of the CAM Field in Europe from 1960s to 1980s. Professors and chairs of the \"1968 generation\"\u2014on the academic level\u2014had introducedvery di erent interests (such as research, teaching, and political aims) into university-based medicine in the follow-ing two decades, which were often founded on traditional\"holistic ideals\" (such as psychosomatic medicine, pluralityof therapeutic methods, or the broadening of the curativedimension to disease prevention on larger societal scales)[21]. Among current themes, themes, \"1968ers\" featured an explicit critique of the somatic and organ concentrationof the scientic paradigm in medicine as it had originatedin the 19th century (among many medical students ofthe 1970s, the contemporary catchword for example was:\"My rst patient at medical school was a dead body\"),leading to the creation of communication groups for therecording of medical history and for the breaking of bad news (\"On the way to communicative medicine\"); homoeopathy circles and discussion groups on Complementary and Alter-native Medicine (\"Nature, not Chemistry\") [ 22]; political discussion circles on the role of medicine in the globalcommunity (such as in local chapters of the \"InternationalPhysicians for the Prevention of a Nuclear War\" and the\"M\u00b4edecins sans fronti `eres\"); psychosocial psychiatry groups [23]. All of these developments shared a profound criticism of scientic reductionism in medicine, which had gained somuch ground since the advent of medical modernity and wasalso made responsible for many digressions and atrocities ofresearch with human patients in medicine and health care inthe 19th and 20th centuries [ 24,25]. From the perspective of modern medicine, it had become necessary to understand and control bodily phenomena\u2014and for the sake of argument one would need to abstractfrom the recent approaches in CAM\u2014[ 27], clinical thinking, and scientic practices in functional frameworks. At thesame time, modern medicine had barely found ways ofreceiving nonreductionist views in both the medical and psy-chiatric clinical communities, probably with the exception ofpsychosomatic physicians, psychoanalysts, and behaviouraltherapists, who continued to be involved in philosophicalconsiderations about the status of their theories and changes in their practice as a response to the organ-centred and scientic paradigm in medicine and (biological) psychiatry. In his introductory lectures to psychosomatics, Gerhard Danzer (b. 1956) of the Charit \u00b4e Medical School in Berlin, during the 1990s, particularly emphasized the roots ofmodern psychosomatics in late 19th and early 20th psychoanalytical physicianGeorg Groddeck (1866-1934) [ University of Berlin, Ernst Schweninger (1850-1924), who was the personal physician of the GermanReich's Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1815-1889), did notprioritize one medical system over any other. He ratherdeveloped a holistic approach integrated with elements of6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Level in health care system Health policy Profession/regulatory bodyInstitution Clinic PractitionerConsumer Integrated health careConventional health care Complementary and alternative health care Figure 5: Level in health care systems [ 26]. deep psychology, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, narrative litera- ture, and physical therapy, which he argued that would avoid the theoretical and practical pitfalls and limitations that 19th century experimental physiology had introduced intocontemporary medicine. As in the case of Danzer, the criticalworks of the foundations of medical science and practice byGeorg Groddeck also stimulated a larger group, particularlyof German-speaking \u00b4emigr \u00b4e-psychosomatic physicians in Britain and North America, to focus on additional CAMmethods in both the practice of internal medicine andclinical psychiatry [ 29,30]. Through the process of forced migration many, leading psychosomatic psychiatrists in the1930s, such as Franz Alexander (1891-1964) from Budapestand Karl Stern (1906-1975) from Berlin, also introducedSchweniger's and Groddeck's concepts in the Americanand Canadian psychiatric communities [ 31]. In particular, psychiatric milieu therapy has advocated for this type ofpsychotherapy model, by focusing on the total environmentin the treatment of mental and behavioral disorders ormaladjustments by making substantial changes in a patient'simmediate life circumstances, as this was historically advo-cated for and integrated into the therapeutic approaches ofthe American child psychiatrist Emmy Sylvester (b. 1910)and the Austro-American psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim(1903-1990). A further integration of early CAM approacheswith psychiatry was achieved through the advocacy of mind- body-medicine precursors like the Chicago-based psychia- trist and the psychologist Edmund Jacobson (1888-1983)with his introduction of progessive muscle relaxation (PMR)therapy in the 1930s and 1940s (\"Y ou must relax\") for moodand anxiety disorders as well as depression [ 32]. However, such an integration of holistic and psycho- somatic approaches with CAM remained the exceptionrather than the rule until the 1990s, since traditionalmedical departments had scarcely addressed \"integrativeperspectives\" on \"the healing experience\" in Central Europeand North America [ 33]. In this respect, some intriguing comments by German historian of medicine and physiology,Karl Eduard Rothschuh (1908-1984) should be allowedhere, when he asked the question \"What is and to whatend does one study historical medicine?\" in a lecture atthe Westphalian Wilhelms University of Muenster in 1980[34]. The lecture plastically summarized the incomplete picture of modern education in \"physicianship,\" as taughtby many medical faculties in the western world, vis-`a-vis the fragmented body of medical knowledge founded on training in anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry: The large weight, which is undoubtedly placed on the natural sciences with regard to the pur- suit of medicine's healing tasks, does not mean, however, that medicine itself would be a naturalscience. Medicine is neither a natural science,nor a humanist discipline. Medicine is not ascientic discipline at all, but is based on scienticdisciplines. [...] [Medical History, in addition,]develops and represents a set of values; withoutMedicina Historica this set of values would nota ta l lb ei n t r o d u c e di n t ot h em e d i c a lc a n o n .( T h eoriginal text can be found in: Rothschuh, 1986[34]). 3.3. Impact of the Social Movements of the 1960s and the Opening of the NIH in the US. Dierences in philosophical views about the scientic paradigm in medicine, medicalreductionism, the place of the patient, and diverging inter-pretations of medical holism led to intense disputes betweenphysicians, psychiatrists, and alternative practitioners [ 35]. A time of change had been brought about with the riseof the 1960s, increasing the uses of CAM and widespreaddiscussions about the practice and role of medicine andpsychiatry in Western societies and cultures, as is intriguingly represented in the influential criticisms of the Austrian philosopher, theologian, and social scientist Ivan Illich(1926-2002): Physical sickness is conned to the body, and it lies in an anatomical, physiological, and geneticcontext. The \"real\" existence of these conditionscan be conrmed by measurement and experi-ment, without any reference to a value-system.None of this applies to mental sickness: its statusas a \"sickness\" depends entirely on psychiatricjudgment. The psychiatrist acts as the agent of asocial, ethical, and political milieu. Measurementsand experiments on these \"mental\" conditions canbe conducted only within an ideological frame-work which derives its consistency from the generalsocial prejudice of the psychiatrist. The prevalenceEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 of sickness is blamed on life in an alienated society, but while political reconstruction might eliminatemuch psychic sickness, it would merely providebetter and more equitable technical treatment fort h o s ew h oa r ep h y s i c a l l yi l l .( T h eo r i g i n a lt e x tc a nbe found in: Illich, 1976) [ 36]. Of course, these criticisms of the scientic paradigm in medicine were by no means a homogenous trend, butrather triggered through a heterogeneous mixture of social,medical, and psychiatric movements, events, and develop-ments that impacted the changes towards auxiliary andincreased use of Complementary and Alternative Medicineand Psychiatry in places where modern medicine had littleif nothing to o er (e.g., chronic pain management, oncology and palliative care, therapy of complex psychiatric disorderswith compliance problems, etc.). The \"hippie movement\"\u2014on the broader level of society\u2014was certainly one important strand among theseheterogenous criticisms, in which virtues of a simple,natural life, tolerance of diverse lifestyles, consumptionof natural and organic foods, and the social use of psy- choactive drugs were promoted [ 37]. Also, the human potential movement is worth mentioning as they advocatedfor therapeutic approaches such as vegetarianism, naturalbirthing, transcendental meditation, yoga, and biofeedback.Its participants were concerned with the quality of bothpersonal life and social life in the modern world, such as thepreceding protagonists of psychosomatic medicine, wellness,movement, and humanistic medicine. In North America,this movement was centered around the foundation of theAcademy of Psychoanalytic Medicine (APM), in 1954, andthe address by Halpert L. Dunn (1896-1975) from the USPublic Health Service on the concept of wellness in the early1960s, which broke with earlier disease-based models thathad developed during the 19th century scientic paradigmof medicine. Dunn introduced a new integrated concept ofhealth and wellbeing, \"which is oriented toward maximizingthe potential of which the individual is capable, within theenvironment where he is functioning\" [ 38]. Socially, the tradition of postmodernism, feminism and environmentalism were also crucial for the reaction to theprevious era of modernism, characterized by the belief inthe existence of truth, objectivity, determinacy, causality andimpartial observation and with an emphasis on individuality,complexity, and personal experience. These changes became further integrated into the social construction of curricula and values in the medical system in the 20th century [ 39]. The development of Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Psychiatry after the publication of Flexner's1910 Report to the American Carnegie Foundation wasmanifold and in certain respects was also fruitful. On theone hand, Flexner's work led to the closure of colleges,hospitals, and programs in which \"unconscionable quacks\"were working who had been \"a disgrace to the State,\" as theauthor of the report wrote. The political and disciplinaryc r a c k d o w no na l t e r n a t i v ea n dn o n c o n v e n t i o n a lf o r m so fresearch and education in medicine and psychiatry, on theother hand, did not reach the general population, nor did itsbeliefs about the doctor-patient relationship and other forms of healing and medical support. Largely due to such outsidedevelopments, plans for integrative forms of medical practicethat selectively incorporated elements of CAM evolved intocomprehensive treatment plans alongside solidly orthodoxmethods of diagnosis and health care [ 40]: Integrative Medicine is the practice of medicine that rea rms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on thewhole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieveoptimal health and healing. (Consortium of Aca-demic Health Centers for Integrated Medicine)[41]. However, in many ways the current status of \"integrative medicine\" (IM) in medical and psychiatric institutions inNorth America is still (and importantly) future oriented inits thinking\u2014although problematic in vision\u2014, as relativelyfew schools have really integrated conventional medicinewith Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Psychia-try, at least not until recently. 3.4. The Recent Chronology\u2014Increasing International CAM and IM Platforms. The creation of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)in the USA in 1991\u2014even though it was given only acomparatively small budget below one percent of NIH'sexpenditures at the time, brought about by the US SenatorT om Harkin (b. 1939), proved to be a landmark event inthe renewed support of CAM in North America [ 42]. Large scale research could now be pursued under the leadershipof the NIH, by combining mainstream medical therapiesand CAM approaches, while investigating scientic evidence,safety, and e cacy: CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are notpresently considered to be part of conventionalmedicine. Conventional medicine is medicine aspracticed by holders of M.D. (medical doctor)or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and bytheir allied health professionals, such as physicaltherapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some health care providers practice both CAM and conventional medicine. While some scienticevidence exists regarding some CAM therapies,for most there are key questions that are yetto be answered through well-designed scienticstudies\u2014questions such as whether these therapiesa r es a f ea n dw h e t h e rt h e yw o r kf o rt h ed i s e a s e sor medical conditions for which they are used.T h el i s to fw h a ti sc o n s i d e r e dt ob eC A Mc h a n g e scontinually, as those therapies that are provento be safe and e ective become adopted into conventional health care and as new approachesto health care emerge. (NCCAM, 2007) [ 43].8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine In its inaugural year of 2004, the international Consor- tium of Academic Health Centers for Integrated Medicine(CAHCIM) expressed the future hope that integrativemedicine would become the cornerstone of the urgentlyneeded reconstruction of what was perceived as a dysfunc-tional healthcare system, including both the somatic and the psychiatric elds. The development of new frameworks of CAM has also realized that genetic and translational aspectsof modern biomedical and psychiatric research had theirplace in such a new health care paradigm [ 44]. In fact, psychiatrists and psychologists today display an increasingintellectual openness towards the use of CAM and integrativeapproaches in their therapeutic practice, as well as thegrowing evidence base for specic CAM modalities in boththe treatment and prevention of mental illness and disease[45]. These major changes have largely occurred in the USA, or in countries that have adopted the US model. While thefederal organization of Health Canada has also played animportant role in Canada, quantitatively there has been onlya minor level of involvement, especially when compared tothe USA. With the creation of the International Network of Integrative Mental Health (INIMH) in 2010, there nowexists an important institutional platform which furthersthe development of a biopsychosocio-spiritual model inintegrative mental health that is evidence based. Someof these promising changes, which are taking place inmental health care in Western countries, are represented,for example, in the growing use of homoeopathy in moodand mild anxiety disorders and the increasing role of tradi- tional Chinese acupuncture therapies in the management of chronic pain conditions, depression, and anxiety disorders,as well as folate and other substitutional nutritional factorsin depression and bipolar disorders [ 46]. 4. Conclusions For some, the real trend in CAM medicine and psychiatry has become evidence-based medicine (EBM), not complemen-tary and alternative medicine itself. This observation furtheraligned with the fact that medical, and increasingly alsopsychiatric education, has changed considerably over the pastdecade along with new trends in CAM education [ 47], while EBM is now inltrating medical school curricula on both thebasic science and clinical care ends [ 48]. While this paper has looked back from a history of medicine perspective at the publication of the Flexner Report one century ago, it shouldalso be emphasized that the Flexner Report was revolutionaryand and is even today even today widely celebrated as aseminal document that subsequently raised the standards forgeneral education in medicine and psychiatry. However, thelast decades have also seen a disturbing trend away fromFlexner's prescriptions, since medical schools are reverting tomany of the pre-Flexnerian standards by uncritically addingmany pseudoscientic health claims to their course materialsas \"IM,\" without rigorous tests, studying CAM practice orasking trained physicians for their experiences (Figure 5). Certainly, Flexner himself would have \"approved\" of a newevidence-oriented direction in medical and psychiatric edu- cation: Unfortunately, Flexner may be rotating all too rapidly. [ ...] medical schools are teaching and promoting what is often called CAM, despite thelack of logic or evidence supporting many CAMpractices. Meanwhile, the same schools seem togive only lip service to the application of logicand evidence to healthcare, as exemplied by theformal processes of EBM. [ 49]. We increasingly recognize today that treatment is not an isolated event in patients' lives, but it takes part inthe patient's own bio-psycho-social context, which includessocial networks, patients' subjective experiences, and theirmental health status, along with the patient provider rela-tionship (a system). These elements are crucial to testingan intervention, as a patient is not an average patient,with average beliefs, devoid from any contextual influences[50]. As CAM treatments in psychiatry become more and more e cient and safe, as well as increasingly supported by data from randomized controlled trials and other EBMmethodologies in clinical epidemiology, new standards foran appropriate and reliable use of complementary andalternative medicine and psychiatry are emerging, whichgo hand in hand with recommendations for the monitoredand evaluated use of CAM and integrative therapies inmental health care in the USA, Canada, and other developedcountries [ 51]. In this context, INIMH aims at augmenting and adapting approaches in contemporary psychiatry, along with biomed-ical perspectives in health care and research and its attemptsto work out a more adequate paradigm, one of which aims attranscending the boundaries of what Abraham Flexner hadlaid out a century ago in his influential Report on Medical Education in the United States and Canada [52].

Extracts from Cimicifuga racemosa (CR, synonym Actaea racemosa ) have shown e cacy in trials in women with menopausal symptoms. Y et, dose dependency remains unclear. Therefore, 180 female outpatients with climacteric complaints were treatedfor 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-armed trial (CR extract Ze 450 in 6.5 mg or 13.0 mg, or placebo). Primary outcome was the di erence in menopausal symptoms (vasomotor, psychological, and somatic), assessed by the Kupperman Menopausal Index between baseline and week 12. Secondary e cacy variables were patients' self-assessments of general quality of life (QoL), responder rates, and safety. Compared to placebo, patients receiving Ze 450 showed a signicant reduction in the severity of menopausal symptoms in a dose- dependent manner from baseline to endpoint (mean absolute dierences absolute erences 8.47 (95% CI 5.55-11.39) score points, P =0.0003 for 6.5 mg). QoL and responder rates correspond ed with the main endpoint. Changes in menopausal symptoms and QoL were inversely correlated. Reported adverse events and clinical laboratory testing did not raise safety concerns. The CR extract Ze 450 is an e ective and well-tolerated nonhormonal alternative to hormone treatment for symptom relief in menopausal women. 1. Introduction On the one hand, menopause is a normal biological process marking the transition of the lives of mature womenfrom a reproductive into a postreproductive phase. Onthe other hand the profound physiological changes in theperi- and postmenopausal period can provoke complaints. Menopausal changes can lead to vasomotor (e.g., hot flushes, sweating), psychological/vegetative (e.g., insomnia, nervous- ness/irritability, depressive event, and somatic(e.g., joint pain), and urogenital/sexual (e.g., libido changes, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness) symptoms. They vary in frequency and severity, are related to lifestyle, demographicsand sociocultural circumstances, and have been well charac- terized [ 1-3]. Hot flushes and night sweating are the cardinal symptoms with highly varying prevalence between 24 to93% [ 3-6]. However, the interrelationship of hot flushes and sweating with other neuropsychological symptoms seems to diminish QoL in symptomatic menopausal women [ 7,8]. Although the role of estrogen appears to be critical and is underlined by the clinical e ects of estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy [ 9,10], the mechanisms leading to the development of hot flushes have not been fullyelucidated [ 11]. Since large epidemiological studies with long-term hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), such as the Women's Health Initiative and the Million Women Study2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine [12-15], have shown a small but signicantly increased risk for the development of invasive breast cancer, there is anincreasing interest in nonhormonal treatment L., black cohosh) is a perennial medicinal plant native to North America where it has been used for centuries in indigenous medicine for the treatment of various conditions. However, today's sole accepted indications are menopause-related neu-rovegetative and emotional symptoms. Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) extracts are described in a 2003 monograph of the European Scientic Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) as a pharmacologically active treatment of climacteric symp- toms [ 16] and in the 2010 community herbal monograph of the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency [ 17]; a well-established use status was granted. The precise mechanism of action of CR is controversial, with some studies suggesting that it has no estrogenic eect while others indicate a selective estrogen modulating ee c to ns o m et i s s u e s ,s u c ha sb o n e[ 18-20]. In addition, serotonin-binding properties in the brain may contribute to its mechanism of action [ 21,22]. If indeed CR lacks estrogenic e ects, it would have a benecial influence on climacteric vasomotor and psychiatric symptoms withoutadversely a ecting the development of breast or uterine tissue tumors or increasing the cardiovascular risk. Randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have shown clinically signicant e ects of extracts from CR [ 20, 23-26]; but the results have not been consistent in systematic reviews [ 27-29]. The comparability of the trials is di cult because of di erences in dosing, outcome parameters, rating scales, and di erent CR extracts used [ 30]. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis performed showed the e cacy of extracts from CR in vasomotor symptoms; but the authors pointed out the heterogeneity of the trials [ 31]. Dose-dependent e ects of an isopropanolic aqueous CR e x t r a c th a v eb e e np r e v i o u s l yi n v e s t i g a t e db yL i s k ee ta l .[25]. Though no placebo or active control treatment was used in this study, both the low- and high-dose improvedclimacteric symptoms compared to baseline values, and nodierences between the treatments could be demonstrated in the Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI) [ 32]. For the present study, therefore, placebo treatment was comparedto the dose-dependent e ects of the CR extract Ze 450 on climacteric symptoms. 2. Patients and Methods For this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 180 female outpatients withmenopausal complaints were included. The study took placein four outpatient clinics. Patients were randomized toreceive either 13.0 mg Ze 450, 6.5 mg Ze 450 or placebo for 12 weeks. The study was performed between March 19, 2002 and July 23, 2003.2.1. Ethics. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Association (Ethik-KommissionLandes \u00a8arztekammer Hessen), Frankfurt, Germany, and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices(Bundesinstitut f \u00a8ur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM)) was informed prior to its start. Conduct was in accordance with the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informedconsent was obtained from all patients prior to screen-ing/baseline visit. 2.2. Inclusion/Main Exclusion Criteria. Females (age 40 years) su ering from menopausal syndrome with neu- rovegetative components, which have been stable anamnesti-cally during the last 2 weeks, and who consulted a physicianfor the treatment of symptoms were included. The diagnosis of menopausal complaints was conrmed by a Climax Score according to M. Metka and F. H. Fischl. The Climax Score includes neurovegetative, psychical, and atrophic symptoms. By using this tool, the diagnosis of menopausal syndrome was conrmed by the physician. In addition, the baselineKupperman Menopausal Index (KMI) was recorded by the investigator. Patients were excluded due to previous or current psychological disease that could interfere with their ability to participate in the study; anamnestic or current alcohol or drug abuse; concomitant treatment (in malignant contin- uous climacteric bleeding and complaints related to myomas; patients who have taken another experimental drug within a 4-week period prior to the trail; pregnancy/lactation; serious internal disease; previous organ transplantation;premenopausal women with insu cient contraceptive pro- tection; hypersensitivity to one of the ingredients of the trial medication; a body mass index >30. 2.3. Study Medication. A 6.5 mg tablet of the (60% v/v) ethanolic CR extract Ze 450 (from rhizomes drug-extract ratio 4.5-8.5 : 1; Max Zeller S \u00a8ohne AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland) was used. Placebo was identicallooking. The treatment schedule for the double-dummy, parallel group design was 2 tablets/once a day given with a meal in the morning: (a) placebo (PLA) + PLA, (b) PLA + 6.5 mg Ze 450, (low dose; LD), and (c) 6.5 mg Ze 450 + 6.5 mg Ze 450 (high dose; HD). Treatment compliance was assessed by a pill count of the returned medication (return of 25% was considered compliant). 2.4. Outcome Measures. All assessments were done at base- line (visit 1), optionally 6 weeks later (visit 2), and 12 weeks later (visit 3). The severity of menopausal symptoms was assessed at each visit using a modied total KMI score [ 24, 32-34]. Subitems of this index focused on the neurovegeta- tive symptoms: a 10-item questionnaire of single symptomsEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 whose severity ranged from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate, and severe). Score values were multiplied by weightingfactors: hot and \u00d71). For this study, the total KMI equalled the sum of the multiplied subitem scores (maximum =48) and was classied as mild (KMI 20), moderate (KMI =21-35), or severe (KMI >35) [ 32]. The general quality of life (QoL) was assessed by the visual analog scale (V AS). Using a 100 mm printed line,patients checked o how they evaluated their status (0 mm = \"best possible quality of life due to health condition\"; 100 mm =\"worst possible quality of life due to health condition\"). At all visits, routine hematological and clinical-chemical laboratory tests urinalysis were performed only atbaseline. The primary endpoint was the di erence in the total KMI between both verum groups (HD and LD) and PLA at theend of therapy (week 12), stratied by individual baselinescores in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (patientstreated with study medication and with at least one e cacy assessment after baseline). Secondary endpoints were (1) the analysis for each subitem of the KMI; (2) analysis oftreatment responders (patients with a reduction of 50% of the total KMI); (3) a QoL analysis; (4) safety assessment. 2.5. Statistical Analysis. Within each clinical site involved the allocation of the randomised treatment was sequential.The random code was supplied by an external provider,using a validated random program (Mathematica, WolframResearch). Randomization was provided in blocks of six toassure balanced allocation of treatments. Each of the studycentres received their own randomization list according towhich patients were allocated to the treatment groups. Responsible for all statistical aspects, regarding design and analysis of the study, was the Department of MedicalInformation T echnology, University of Giessen, Germany. Data management was done by Brunner and Hess, Zurich, Switzerland. Data were entered in duplicate andindependently by suitably trained personnel at a statistical institute, who were blinded with respect of treatment group allocation. Based on KMI data from previous clinical trials, sample size was conservatively estimated as n =60 patients/group. Assuming an alpha-error =0.05, mean KMI scores (SD) of 27(15) and 18(15) in the placebo and verum groups,respectively, an anticipated 10% drop-out rate and using thetwo-sided Mann-Whitney test, a power (1 )o f>90% could be expected (GPower software, University of Duesseldorf, Germany). A predened hierarchical statistical design wasused. Hierarchically sequenced null hypotheses were that themedians between treatment groups at the end of treatmentwould be the same, stratied by individual baseline scores:H01 : PLA versus HD; H02 : PLA versus LD; H03 : LD versus HD. The respective alternative hypotheses (HA1 to HA3)stated that the medians would be di erent. Comparisons were non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test ( =0.05, 2-sided, StatXact, Version the hypotheses with the following hierarchical- sequentially rejecting procedure: Step 1: H01 versus HA1; versus HA2; Step 3: H03 versus HA3. The testprocedure was terminated once a null hypothesis could notbe rejected. This hierarchical statistical design was used asa method to control type I error for multiple comparisons.Therefore, there was no need to adjust Pvalues for multiple comparisons for the 3-step testing. Responder analysis (fortotal KMI) was done using the same hierarchical sequence byPearson's Chi-square test. For patients terminating participa-tion prematurely at the interim visit, all available e cacy data were treated according to the principle of last observationcarried forward (LOCF). 3. Results Of the 232 patients originally referred to the clinics, 52 failed the selection criteria. A total of 180 patients were randomized. Their mean age was 51.7 years and meanBMI (Body Mass Index) was 25.2 kg/m 2when entering the study. Safety and ITT populations comprised n=177 andn=166 patients, respectively ( Figure 1 ). The majority of patients in the ITT population ( n=85, 51.2%) were in the early postmenopausal stage (less than 5 years sincelast menstruation); fewer patients ( n =43, 25.9%) were in the late postmenopausal (more than 5 years since lastmenstruation) or premenopausal stage ( n =38, 22.9%). A similar categorization was obtained when threshold FSHconcentration of 40 mIU/mL was used. Smoking habits didnot di er between the treatment groups ( Table 1 ). Severity of symptoms (total KMI) ranged from mild ( n =29, 17.5%) There were no signicant di erences between the treatment groups in any of the demographic parameters or for baselinelevels of T3, T4, primary endpoint verum was superior to placebo in reducing the total KMI score in a dose-dependent manner ( Table 2 ,Figure 2 ). Regarding KMI sub- items, a signicant reduction in each item was seen onlywith the HD group. The clinical relevance was the strongestfor vasomotor subitems (e.g., hot flushes, sweating), less for (e.g., insomnia, ner- vousness/irritability, and depressive events/melancholy) andthe smallest for somatic symptoms (joint pain), althoughsignicant ( Table 3 ).

However, in contrast to theearly postmenopausal subgroup, in the late postmenopausalsubgroup no superiority for the HD over the LD group couldbe established. With respect to the secondary endpoints, the responder rate for 50% reduction in total KMI increased from 7.4% in the PLA group to 40.4% in the LD group ( P< 0.001) and increased further to 69.1% in the HD group. The latter wassignicantly higher than in the PLA group ( P<0.001) or the LD group ( P =0.002). Corresponding to the reduction in symptom severity, the QoL V AS increased dose-dependently ( Figure 3 ). Changes in menopausal symptoms and QoL were inversely correlated. As to safety no serious, but 21 nonserious adverse events (AE) occurred in 20 patients: 9 of which were possibly treatment related (5 PLA, 2 LD, and 2 HD group), ve wereunlikely or not related to the study medication, and therelationship was assessed as unknown for seven. Among thenine possibly study-related AEs, ve were of a gastrointestinalnature, a known AE of Ze 450. The frequency of possiblyrelated AEs was higher in the placebo group. Laboratoryassessments revealed no clinically signicant changes, exceptfor three patients (one from each group) with elevated liverenzyme values. Two were likely caused by excessive alcoholconsumption, while the third remained undened. Thesethree AEs were not clustered in one specic treatment group;but they were equally distributed among the three groups.No safety concerns were raised based on the monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory values fromthe beginning to the end of the study. 4. Discussion Our study demonstrated that the CR extract administered for12 weeks decreased signicantly, and in a dose-dependent manner, the severity of climacteric symptoms in the totalKMI. This was predominantly seen in single subitems especially for vasomotor as well as for some psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the administration of CR extract over 12 weeks improved general QoL and was safe. The strengths of the current trial are as follows. (a) It analysed one of the unanswered questions in the nonhor- monal treatment of menopausal complaints with extracts from CR\u2014the dose-dependency. This was done in a suitable methodological manner with the high internal validity of the 3-arm RCT. Blinding was achieved by applying a double-blind, double-dummy setting in order to avoid anyunblinding bias. (b) A subgroup analysis showed that both the LD and HD demonstrated, in a dose-dependent manner, asignicantly larger e ect than placebo in patients with mild and moderate symptom severity. For patients with severe symptoms, however, only the high dose (13.0 mg) of Ze 450 was e ective. Compared to the placebo and LD groups, only6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 3: Change in symptom severity of KMI sub-items after treatment during 12 weeks (ITT population).

Circles test stratied to baseline scores.8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine the high dose reduced signicantly the symptom score in patients at all menopausal stages; the LD was superior toplacebo only in the early and late postmenopausal stage. Nonetheless, there are some limitations. (a) Although the study duration was 3 months, a longer duration of 6-12 months would better meet the necessary long-term treatment of most women. This will be the subject of a future trial. (b) The question which menopause scale shouldbe administered is an ongoing discussion. Although the comparison of the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) with the KMI produced a high correlation of raw scores, the MRS, especially in its second version (MRS-II), is somehow favoured today [ 35,36]. This might be due to its better appropriateness for factor analysis of symptom clusters and QoL measurements. Nonetheless, it is known that CR extracts are most e ective for vasomotor symptoms therefore it seemed appropriate to use the KMI [ 28,31]. Additionally, we tried to overcome this shortcoming with analysing thesingle symptoms next to total KMI score, giving a subgroup analysis and rating general QoL with the V AS. The placebo response might have been low in the present study. However, also in other clinical trials inpostmenopausal women, with a small number of visits, noreduction of the KMI was observed with placebo treatment[36,37] as it was the case in the present study. On the other hand, higher placebo e ects were observed in trials, where more patients visits had been performed (such as in[34]). This suggests that the study design might influence the placebo response. The results of our current study partly conrm previous s t u d i e sw i t ho t h e rC Re x t r a c t s[ 20,23-26]. The age and BMI distribution of the patients are comparable to severalpreviously conducted clinical studies with extracts from CR.Nevertheless, the study population is still small and maygive predictions at best for middle-European women withoutheavy overweight. However, Liske et al. [ 25] have shown that two doses of an isopropanolic aqueous CR extract givenfor 24 weeks reduced signicantly the symptom severityas assessed by KMI to a similar extent. In both treatmentgroups, total KMI decreased by about 50% from baselinescores of 30.5 (low dose) and 31 (high dose) to scores lessthan 15 in 70% and 72% of the patients, respectively. Theresponder rates were comparable to our study, where the rateof patients with at least a 50% decrease in total KMI was69.1% in the HD group. In contrast to the study of Liskeet al., however, we could clearly demonstrate for the rsttime a dose-dependent e ect of a CR extract. The e cacy of other CR extracts was further shown by Osmers et al. [ 23] using a xed dose of an isopropanolic extract and a placebotreatment during a 12-week period. In a further study of the same extract continued for 52 weeks, the e ect on the number and intensity of hot flushes was conrmed [ 38] and, in addition, overall tolerability and endometrial safety were demonstrated. On the other hand, after a short-term, 4-weektreatment in patients su ering from breast cancer, a similar CR extract demonstrated no superior e ect when compared to placebo [ 39]. However, the extract used in the latter study was not su ciently characterized and the durationof treatment was shorter than in previous studies [ 20,23- 26] that have demonstrated a signicant reduction in the number and intensity of hot flushes. Additionally, the dose-eect relationship was not investigated. This underscores the di culties in comparing clinical results between studies using di e r e n te x t r a c t sw i t hp o t e n t i a l l yd i erent spectra of pharmacologically active constituents. Whether the treatment e ects of Ze 450 can be main- tained for longer treatment periods is a subject for furtherresearch. Reported AEs did not raise safety concerns. In conclusion, the CR extract, Ze 450, appears to be an eective and well-tolerated nonhormonal alternative to HRT for symptom relief in menopausal women.

Objective . T o evaluate the e cacy of traditional Oriental herbal medicines (TOHM) for children and adolescents with ADHD. Methods . Randomized clinical trials published from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2010, in English, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean language which evaluated the use of TOHM on ADHD subjects of 18 years old or below, diagnosed based on DSM-IV , were searched from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyINFO, Cochrane Library, 10 other databases. Results . Twelve studies involving 1189 subjects met the inclusion criteria. In general, the included studies claimed that TOHM has similar e cacy to methylphenidate and at the same time has fewer side e ects compared to methylphenidate. Some studies also suggested that the e e c to fT O H M sustained better than methylphenidate. However, solid conclusions could not be drawn because the included studies were not of high quality. Risk of bias issues such as randomization, allocation, concealment and blinding were not addressed in most of thestudies, and the risk of publication bias could not be ruled out. Conclusion . Currently, there is not strong evidence to say that TOHM is e ective in treating the core symptoms of ADHD. 1. Introduction Attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behav- ioral disorder of which patients display persistent pattern ofinattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity or a combinationof the two at an abnormal level that their social, academic, oroccupational functioning is impaired [ 1]. While the etiology of ADHD is not clearly known, studies have suggested thatthe abnormality of the frontal network and dysregulationof catecholamines are the underlying pathophysiology [ 2]. Frontal lobes are involved in decision making to convertimpulse to action, attention, and concentration, and theyare primarily activated by the catecholamines, dopamine,and norepinephrine [ 3]. When frontal lobes are not fully activated, or when there are changes in the levels of dopamineand norepinephrine, the symptoms of hyperactivity andinattention are likely. When making a diagnosis of ADHD, clinicians should determine that the diagnostic criteria have been met byassessing information obtained from primarily parents,guardians, and teachers [ 4]. For adolescents, informationfrom at least two teachers and other sources should be assessed because adolescents usually have multiple teachersand parents have little direct contact to observe their strengths and problems [ 4,5]. Instruments such as the Revised Conners' Parent Rating Scale and Revised Conners'T eacher Rating Scale are useful for screening and assessingbehavioral problems, and also helpful for assessing treatmenteectiveness [ 6,7]. Behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy are two kinds of treatments commonly used in ADHD. Recommenda-tion of treatment for ADHD varies depending on thepatient's age. While evidence-based behavioral therapy isrecommended as the rst line of treatment for preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age), school-aged children (6-11 years of age) and adolescents (12-18 years of age) arerecommended a combination of medication and behavioraltherapy [ 4]. Stimulants are reported to be highly e ective for most children in reducing the core symptoms of ADHD and thusare used as rst line medication for ADHD patients [ 2,4]. They are structurally similar to endogenous catecholamines2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine and are thought to work by enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission [ 2,8]. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is the most commonly used stimulant for the treatment of ADHD [ 2,9]. Around 70% of ADHD patients who receive stimulant treatment are givenmethylphenidate [ 10]. It is shown to be e ective, at least in short term, on improving the core symptoms of ADHD such as attention, distractibility, and impulsivity (e ect size 0.75- 0.84, mean 0.78). Methylphenidate has observable e ects on improving social and classroom behavior (e ect size 0.63-0.85, mean 0.8) [ 9]. Pemoline (Cylert) is a stimulant that is longer acting than methylphenidate, but due to itspotential for hepatotoxicity, it is regarded as a third linetreatment [ 2]. In some cases, nonstimulants are also used in the treatment of ADHD such as the norepinephrine [ 2,11]b u th a v e been found to have signicant di erences in terms of e cacy compared to stimulants [ 8]. While stimulants are e ective for many children with ADHD, they may cause side e ects, with the most common ones being decreased appetite, insomnia, and headache(Cohen's d 0.67, 0.40, and 0.33 resp.) [ 12]. Other side e ects such as motor tics, abdominal pain, irritability, nausea,and fatigue are also reported [ 9]. Therefore, many parents of ADHD children try to search for more natural andsafe treatment options [ 13,14], which has resulted in a growing interest in complementary and alternative therapies(CAM), such as herbal remedies, dietary supplements,dietary modication, neurofeedback, homeopathic therapy, and chiropactic, in treatment of ADHD. Several surveys conducted on the use of CAM in ADHD showed over 50%of ADHD su erers have used CAM [ 13,15]. Herbal medicine is a treatment measure used in tra- ditional Oriental medicine. Although herb usually refersto materials from plant sources, in respect of traditionalOriental medicine, herbal materials can be originated fromplants, animals, or minerals. In this review, traditionalOriental herbal medicine (TOHM) is dened as medicinemade by materials used under traditional Oriental medicaltheory. Herbal materials that are not documented in theKorean Pharmacopoeia, the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Phar-macopoeia of the People's Republic of China, Zhong HuaBen Cao, and Zhong Y ao Da Ci Dian (Chinese Medical GreatDictionary) are considered outside the context of TOHM.TOHM should be taken orally and studies employing otherroute of administration, such as intravenous or transdermal,are excluded from this review. Even though ADHD was not described in literature of traditional Oriental medicine, in traditional Orientalmedical theory, ADHD is related to congenital deciency orinsucient postnatal nourishment that leads to imbalances in the body. It is suggested that the disorder is related to theheart, the liver, the spleen, and the kidneys [ 16]. TOHM is believed to work by adjusting the inner imbalances of ADHD patients and thereby relieving the symptoms. A study on ADHD using an animal model of spon- taneous hypertensive rat treated with the decoction increased the amount of dopamine at the frontal cortex and corpus striatum [ 17], suggesting that its possible mechanism in ADHD is to increase dopamine level and thereby enhancecatecholaminergic neurotransmission. This review aims to evaluate the e cacy of TOHM as a treatment for ADHD in patients under the age of 18. TOHMis natural and often perceived to have fewer side e ects than conventional ADHD pharmacotherapy. Various research andclinical studies have been conducted on TOHM's e cacy on ADHD, but very few articles review the evidence of e cacy of the treatment. A systematic review on complementarymedicines for ADHD suggested that a Chinese herbalmedicine may be e ective for ADHD [ 18] however in the review only one study about Chinese herbal medicine wasincluded and analyzed. Further compilation and analysis ofcurrently available data about TOHM on ADHD may help tounderstand the true e ect of the treatment on the disorders, and provide insight into the direction of future research. 2. Methods 2.1. Database Searching. English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese articles on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) ofOriental herbal treatment on ADHD published betweenJanuary 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010, were searchedfrom various databases. The details of search terms usedin di erent databases are presented in the appendix. The databases were searched: (1) Cochrane Library, Journal Net\u2014Chinese Database,(9) WanFang Data\u2014Chinese Database, (10) Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS)\u2014Korean Database, (11) Scholarly and Academic Information Navigator (CiNii)\u2014Japanese Database, (12) Database of Grants-in-Aid for Scientic Research (KAKEN)\u2014Japanese Database, (13) Japanese Institutional Repositories Online (JAIRO)\u2014Japanese Database, (14) Academic Research Database Repository (NII- DBR)\u2014Japanese Database.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 2.2. Reference List. Other than searching from databases, the reference lists of the included studies were referred to in orderto identify more potential articles. 2.3. Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review 2.3.1. Type of Studies. Randomized clinical trials of TOHM. The e cacy of TOHM treatment should be compared to either a placebo or a conventional medication used fortreating ADHD. If there was a baseline treatment, it had to bethe same in both the treatment and control groups. Studiesonly comparing di erent TOHM formulae, or comparing TOHM with other traditional Oriental treatment such asacupuncture were excluded. Studies without indicating \"ran-domized\" were considered not randomized and excluded. 2.3.2. Type of Participants. Subjects under the age of 18 who were diagnosed with ADHD based on DSM-IV . 2.3.3. Type of Interventions. Traditional Oriental herbal medicine must be used. Herbs that are not documented inthe Korean Pharmacopoeia, the Japanese Pharmacopoeia,Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, ZhonghuaBencao, and Zhongyao Dacidian were not considered. Othertreatment measures of Oriental medicines such as acupunc-ture and moxibustion were excluded. 2.3.4. Types of Outcome Measures. The core symptoms of ADHD (hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention) wereconsidered in this review. Core symptoms should be assessedby at least one of the following tools: Revised Conners' ParentRating Scale, Revised Conners' Conners' Abbreviated SymptomsQuestionnaire, Conners' Global Index for Parents, and/orConners' Global Index for T eachers. 2.4. Risk of Bias Assessment of Included Studies. The risk of bias of all the included studies was assessed according toCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inventionversion 5.1.0. 3. Results The search came up with 1240 results, and 12 studies [ 16,19- 29] involving 1189 subjects were included in this review (see Figure 1 for included studies selection). All of the studies included in this review were conducted in China as single-centre trials. Five results in Japanese andeighteen results in Korean were identied. Only one Japanesearticle was about a clinical trial; however the trial was not arandomized trial and was therefore not selected. Among the twelve included studies, none included the information on how sample size was derived and whetherthe study was statistically powered. The length of studyranged from 4 weeks to 24 weeks. Six studies had follow-up observation on subjects, ranging from 2 weeks to12 months after nishing treatment, to evaluate whetherthe intervention sustained e ectiveness after treatment isstopped while the other six studies did not report if follow-up observations were conducted. T en of the includedstudies reported homogeneity of baseline characteristics, butonly seven [ 20,22,24,26-29] showed relevant descriptive statistical data. Two studies [ 16,19] did not report if baseline c h a r a c t e r i s t i c so fs u b j e c t sw e r eh o m o g e n o u s .O n l yo n eo f the studies [ 27] specied the subtype of ADHD subjects included in the study. Characteristics of included studies aresummarized in Table 1 . 3.1. Assessment of Risk of Bias. In general, the risk of bias in the included articles is unclear. Very limited information wasrevealed in the studies to enable the reviewers to tell if theincluded studies were at risk of bias. Only one of the included studies [ 16] described how ran- domization was done, but the study used two randomizationmethods where part of the subjects were randomized usinga random number table while part were allocated to thetreatment or control groups by their patient record numbers.The allocation concealment issue was not addressed in any ofthe included studies. The blinding method was also not addressed in most of the studies, and only two of the included studies [ 22, 26] claimed to be a double-blind trial. Li et al. (1999) described the blinding method, which was to include aplacebo resembling methylphenidate in the treatment groupand a placebo that looked like the corresponding TOHM inthe control group. Wang et al. (2003) did not describe howblinding was done. Most of the studies indicated no missing data. However, Ma et al. (2007) [ 25] did not specify the initial number of subjects so it could not be determined if there was anyparticipant drop-out. Ma et al. (2007) [ 16]r e p o r t e ds e v e n drop-outs but no explanations were provided, and it wasunclear whether the drop-outs were from the treatmentgroup or the control group. In another study [ 23], three subjects were excluded and there were ve drop-outs, but thereasons were not su ciently provided. Among those eight subjects, it is only known that four of the drop-outs were reported to have terminated the study due to adverse e ect of methylphenidate. Those three studies were considered tohave unknown risk of bias on incomplete outcome data. Study protocols were not available for any of the included studies, therefore it could not be discerned whether all pre-specied outcomes were reported. Lai and Li (2006) [ 21] did not report the baseline score before treatment and score aftertreatment. Xu (2005) [ 27] did not report the baseline score of rating. The two studies were considered to have high riskof reporting bias. The risk of bias graph and summary are presented in Figures 2and 3,r e s p e c t i v e l y . 3.2. Diagnosis and Assessment of the Disorder. Although all included studies specied the diagnostic criteria and methodto assess treatment e ect, only one study [ 16] specied who completed the rating questionnaire or did the ratingassessment. None of the studies addressed under whichsetting the assessment was done. Also, the language of4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: Selected studies characteristics.

T h eh e r b a lf o r m u l a eu s e di n the included twelve studies varied, and dosage forms ofdecoction, granules, oral liquids, pill, and so forth were used.Nine studies [ 16,19-22,25,27-29] provided the ingredients of the formulae, but among them ve [ 22,25,27-29] did not specify the amount of each herb used in the formula,and therefore there was very little information on drug toextract ratio. Three studies [ 23,24,26] did not provide the formula at all. None of the studies mentioned how the herbalmedicines used were standardized. The details of the herbalingredients used in the included studies, their dosage form,and daily dose are presented in Table 2 .Among the twelve studies, there were ten 2-arm studies [16,19-23,26-29] that compared the e ectiveness of TOHM to methylphenidate, and one 3-arm study [ 24]w h i c h included a TOHM treatment group, a TOHM control group,and methylphenidate control group. These studies claimedthat TOHM had no signicant di erence on e ectiveness compared to methylphenidate. However, seven of them [16,21,22,26-29] did not conduct statistical analyses to demonstrate whether there was signicant e cacy compared to the baseline. The remaining one of the twelve included studies [ 24] evaluated the net e ect of TOHM by having a combined treatment group of TOHM and methylphenidate, and amethylphenidate control group. The study reported thatTOHM and methylphenidate worked better in combinationthan methylphenidate alone, with statistically signicantdierences when comparing the rate of e ectiveness of the two groups. 3.4. Follow-Up Observation on E ectiveness. Among the included studies, six had follow-up observations to evaluatethe sustainability of treatment e ect of core symptom after stopping medication, while the other six studies did notspecify if follow-up observation was done. The follow-upperiod varied from 2 weeks to 12 months after stopping thetreatment. For the six studies with follow-up observation,ve [ 20,23,24 ,27,28] compared the treatment e ect of TOHM and methylphenidate after stopping medication andall reported the e ect of TOHM sustained better compared to methylphenidate. The remaining one [ 25] only followed up on the e ect of the TOHM treatment group. 3.5. Safety and Side E ects. In general, TOHM was claimed to have fewer side e ects than methylphenidate. Eight of the included studies [ 19-24,27,28] discussed side e ects. In general, more cases of side e ect were reported in the methylphenidate control group than the TOHM treatmentgroup. Two studies [ 26,28] reported no cases of side eect in the TOHM treatment group. Cheng et al. (2006) reported that among the side e ect cases in their study, dry mouth, sweating, nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite, andheadache were signicantly fewer in the TOHM treatmentgroup compared to the methylphenidate control group(P< 0.05) [ 19]. Lai and Li (2006) reported that cases of loss of appetite and drowsiness were signicantly fewer (P< 0.05) [ 21]. Lin et al. (2007) reported that cases of sleeplessness, dizziness/headache, sweating, dry mouth,nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, and constipation weresignicantly fewer in the treatment group than the controlgroup (P< 0.01) [ 24]. Xu (2005) compared the average score of Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS) in thetreatment group and the control group, and reported that theaverage score was signicantly higher in the control group(P< 0.01) [ 27]. Four other studies [ 19,20,22,26] also c l a i m e dt oh a v eu s e dT E S St oe v a l u a t es i d ee ects but scores were not reported.

Discussion This review included twelve studies, and though ndings ofthis review suggested that the herbal preparations coveredunder the term TOHM may be e ective in treating the core symptoms of ADHD; the overall evidence is not strongenough to draw solid conclusions, because in general theclinical trials were not of high quality and the herbalpreparations far too di erent. Additionally, it cannot be ruled out that there is possibility of publication bias. The included studies that discussed side e ect issues all suggested that TOHM had fewer side e ects compared to methylphenidate. However, such result should be interpretedwith caution, because rst of all it was not clear whetherthe side e ect cases, both in the TOHM group and the methylphenidate group, were investigated to nd out ifthey were related to the intervention. Secondly, it wasnot addressed in most studies whether blinding was done.As mentioned, since TOHM is indigenous to the studypopulation, and is often perceived as natural with fewer sideeects, if measures are not properly done to blind subjects from knowing what treatment they are getting, it may cause bias in reporting side e ects. In the future, should more clinical trials on ADHD using TOHM as treatment be conducted, clinical investigatorsshould consider to address the issues discussed below inorder to improve the robustness of data. In the diagnosis of ADHD and assessment of treatment ecacy, tools such as rating scales are often used. In order to make precise assessment, information should be obtainedfrom di erent parties including parents, guardians, and teachers under di erent settings, such as home and school [4]. However, among the included studies, eleven of them did not specify who completed the questionnaires for assessmentor under which setting the assessment was done. It wasdicult to tell whether su cient information was obtained to facilitate an accurate assessment of the treatment e ect. Also, since the studies were done in Chinese population, itwas possible the questionnaires used were in Chinese, but noinformation was available to tell whether the questionnaires,in case written in another language, were validated or not.Investigators did not indicate whether the tool of assessmenthas been modied to suit the study purpose as well. Suchinformation should be described in the study methods. Among the included studies, the herbal medicines them- selves varied. Some of the studies did not tell what herbswere used, some did not specify the amount of herbs used,and the treatment dosage was not clear in some studies.Also, the treatment period varied for each study. Due tosuch heterogeneity, it is not possible to deduce from the datawhich herbal formulae or ingredients may be e ective for ADHD, nor to conclude that TOHM is e ective for ADHD in children and adolescents. Although it is inevitable thatdierent studies may use di erent herbs and have di erent treatment periods, the materials used and the amount shouldbe stated clearly in the publication of clinical trial results. Asv a r i o u sh e r b a lt r e a t m e n t sa r eu s e di nd i erent clinical studies the results even of the positive studies cannot be compared.Clinical investigators may have to consider repeating a studywith the same herbal treatment, or to conduct a clinical trialin multiple sites. Due to the complex nature of herbs, how the consistency of herbal treatment is maintained throughout a clinical study is often an issue to consider. Most of the studiesincluded in this review used the herbal treatment substancesin form of decoctions or other preparations such as granules or oral liquid prepared by the clinical sites. It was not addressed how the consistency of treatment substances waskept throughout the studies, or how the treatment substanceswere standardized to ensure quality. In addition, in three of the studies [ 16,21,29], prescriptions given to subjects varied according to their symptoms. Although one of thecharacteristics of traditional Oriental medicine is tailor-made treatment according to the patient's condition, ina clinical study setting, this may introduce confoundingvariables. Investigators should make an e ort to ensure the herbal treatment used in a study is of consistent quality14 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine throughout the study period. One of the possible ways to address this problem is to use herbal medicines prepared byqualied pharmaceutical manufacturers, and the treatmentpreparation should also be standardized. 4.1. Strength of This Review . In this review, the reviewers performed a thorough search in various databases. Otherthan major databases that have information of articlespublished mostly in English, additional Chinese, Korean,and Japanese databases were searched to identify potentialstudies. Articles written in English, Chinese, Korean, andJapanese languages were screened in order to include as manysuitable studies in the review as possible. 4.2. Limitation of This Review. Due to limited resources, the reviewers could only seek published studies. For a robustreview, nonpublished data should also be sought. Also, thereviewers were not able to contact the authors of includedstudies for clarication and further information on theirstudies. Even though the reviewers did a thorough search of published studies, the included studies were all conducted onChinese population. Little could be told about the e ect of TOHM on ADHD on populations of other countries . 5. Conclusion This review included twelve studies on di erent herbal preparations from TOHM as a treatment for children andadolescents with ADHD. Findings suggest that some of themmay have similar e cacy to methylphenidate, but solid conclusions could not be drawn due to quality problems of the clinical trials. In conclusion, currently there is no strongevidence to suggest that TOHM is e ective in treating the core symptoms of ADHD. More studies with low risk of biasand using the same herbal preparation are required beforefurther conclusions can be drawn.

Background . Depression is a major reason for counselling in primary care. Our study aims at evaluating pharmacological treatment strategies among physicians specialised in anthroposophic medicine (AM). Methods . From 2004 to 2008, twenty-two German primary care AM-physicians participated in this prospective, multicentre observational study. Multiple logistic regression wasused to determine factors associated with a prescription of any antidepressant medication. Results . A total of 2444 patients with depression were included (mean age: 49.1 years (SD: 15.4); 77.3% female). 2645 prescriptions of were reported. Phytotherapeutic preparations from Hypericum perforatum were the most frequently prescribed antidepressants over all (44.6% of all antidepressants), follo wed by amitriptyline (16.1%). The likelihood of receiving an antidepressant medication did not depend on comorbidity after controlling for age, gender, ph ysician specialisation, and type of depression (adjusted OR (AOR) =1.01; CI: 0.81-1.26). Patients who had cancer were signicantly less likely to be prescribed an antidepressant medication than those who had no cancer (AOR =0.75; CI: 0.57-0.97). Conclusion . This study provides a comprehensive analysis of everyday practice for the treatment of depression in AM -physicians. Further analysis regarding the occurrence of critical combinations is of high interest to health services research. 1. Background Depression is one of the three leading causes of disease bur- den worldwide strongly correlated with increased morbiditya n dam a j o rr e a s o nf o rc o u n s e l l i n ga n dp r i m a r yp a t i e n tcare [ 1,2]. Depending on the study origin and setting, the prevalence of depression in the general population isestimated between 10% and 25% in females and 5-12% inmales with a one-year incidence rate of approximately 2%[3-5]. Thus, early detection and treatment of depression is a major task for health care policy makers. Due to increasingpatient numbers and the development of new antidepressivedrugs, family physicians today play an important role in the treatment of depressed patients [ 6,7]. Although approximately 40% of patients with depression still remainuntreated, those patients who decide to consult a therapistare more likely to see a family physician than a psychiatricspecialist for both diagnosis and treatment. This is quiteimportant as knowledge and accuracy of nonpsychiatricphysicians in treating depression have a great influence theoutcome of the illness. Although research has signicantly advanced in the last years, and depression is now generally more acknowledged as an important factor in primary care, patients, relatives,2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine and physicians still have reservations and prejudices against pharmaco- or psychotherapy, which may aggravate a su - cient and individualized treatment of depression in primarycare and may account for insu cient treatment of depressive symptoms [ 7]. Studies have shown that only a small amount of primary care patients diagnosed with depression receive appropriate care, which may further lead to poor treatment outcome and increased mortality [ 4,7]. Accordingly, national guidelines about depression treat- ment in primary care are a key area of public policy. InGermany that is, the development of a German NationalDisease Management Guideline (DM-CPG) for depressionwas induced to increase transparency and improve patientcare [ 6,8,9]. With respect to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), guidelines from Germany, Canada, and Switzer-land have listed the phytopharmaceutical preparation ofHypericum perforatum [6,10,11] which is traditionally used quite frequently for mild and moderate depressions.Moreover its e ectiveness for unipolar depressive episodes was shown in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ 12,13]. But also other drugs from phytotherapy or homoeopathymay have a potential in the treatment of depression [ 14,15]. However, the prescribing of antidepressants is influencedby physician\u2014as well as patient-related factors, and less isknown about prescribing habits of physicians in primary careparticularly of those being specialized in CAM. The present study, thus, aims to analyse prescribing patterns in a network of GPs and specialists with subspecial-isation in anthroposophic medicine (AM) for patients who e x p e r i e n c e dan e we p i s o d eo fd e p r e s s i o na n dt oi n v e s t i g a t e conformity and variations in antidepressant prescriptions.It was hypothesized that (a) Hypericum perforatum was the most frequently prescribed antidepressant and (b) thatpatients with co-morbidities were more likely prescribed anyantidepressant medication. 2. Methods Physicians for the EvaMed Network were recruited throughthe German National Association of Anthroposophic Physi-cians (GA \u00a8AD) in 2004 [ 16]. At that time, 118,085 primary care physicians were practising in Germany. Of those, 626(0.5%) primary care physicians were members of the GA \u00a8AD. For a physician to be eligible to participate in the study, his or her medical practice had to meet a number of technical requirements, including the presence of a specialcomputerized patient documentation system (DocExpert,DocConcept, TurboMed, Duria, PDE-T op, and Medistar), alocal area network (LAN) connection, and Microsoft Win-dows and Internet Explorer (i.e., as client software). From the626 physicians of the GA \u00a8AD, 362 (57.8%) met these criteria based on self-reported information and were contacted.Physicians were required to give their informed consent toparticipate in the EvaMed Network and to report all detectedserious ADRs (denition provided below \"data collectionand classication of ADRs\") to the EvaMed Network. A totalof 38 physicians from 12 of the 16 federal German statesnally agreed to participate in EvaMed, covering 6.1% of the overall primary care physicians of the GA \u00a8AD [ 17]. They all had practised for at least ve years in primary care in additionto completing training in anthroposophic medicine. For our study, 16 physicians specialized in paediatrics, dermatology, and gynaecology were excluded from the study which led to 22 physicians who participated in this study. The present study is based on secondary data provided by the physicians. As such, the recommendations for goodpractice in secondary data analysis (e.g., anonymization ofdata on prescriptions and diagnoses) were developed bythe German Working Group on the Collection and Use ofSecondary Data were applied in full [ 18]. Patients were included if they had at least one diagnosis of depression according to the 10th revision of the InternationalClassication of Diseases (ICD10: F32 or F33) during a 5-year study period (01 \u00b701\u00b72004-01\u00b701\u00b72009). Patients were excluded if patients were <18 years of age. Patients were also excluded if there was no new diagnosis of depressionduring the study period. \"New diagnosis\" of depression wasoperationally dened as having no diagnosis of depressionbefore and no prescription of any antidepressant medica-tion during the 6 months preceding the index diagnosis.Patients who had no o ce visit before the index depression diagnosis were also excluded because it was not able todistinguish, whether the index diagnosis represented eithera new diagnosis of depression or the entry of an establisheddiagnosis of depression for a new patient. Finally, we alsoexcluded patients with a recorded diagnosis of mania (F30),bipolar disorder (F31), or schizophrenia (F20) because it was thought that these patients would be treated di erently. During the study, physicians continued to follow their routine documentation procedures, recording diagnoses,and all prescriptions for each consecutive patient using theirexisting computerized patient documentation system. Thesedata were exported to the QuaDoSta postgreSQL databasehosted in each practice [ 19]. Physicians used a browser-based interface to match individual diagnoses with the correspond-ing drugs or remedies that had been prescribed. Prescribeddrugs were documented using the German National DrugCode. Diagnoses were coded according to the 10th revisionof the International Classication of Diseases (ICD-10). ICD10: J44). Multi-morbiditywas considered if a patient had at least two co-morbidities. Study investigators identied all drugs and remedies prescribed for depression. Each substance was classiedusing the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Index Germanversion (ATC). Antidepressant medication was clustered into and performed with SPSS 18.0 for Windows. Descriptive analysis was used to determine pre-scription rates. Means and standard deviations (SDs) werecalculated for continuous data. In cases where data were not normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported. Subgroup analyses of prescribing rateswere performed for patient age (18-39 years, 40-59 years,and 60 years and older), gender, and co-morbidities. Thetwo-tailed chi-square test was used to analyse di erences in prescription rates. A Pvalue of less than 0.05 was regarded as indicating a statistically signicant di erence. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% condence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multiple logistic regression with anyantidepressant being prescribed medication as the outcomevariable. For each outcome ORs were calculated for patientswho had and did not have each of the co-morbidities aswell as for who had and did not have any of the 6 co-morbidities. After calculating unadjusted OR, two modelsincluding potential confounders were determined. Model 1was controlled for patient age and gender, and model 2 wascontrolled for patient age, gender as well as for physicians'gender and specialisation and type of depression. Patient agewas introduced in the model as a continuous variable. 3. Results Of the 22 physicians, 17 were GPs (77%) and 5 were spe-cialists working as GPs (23%). The participating physiciansdid not di er signicantly from the overall population of physicians certied in anthroposophy in Germany ( n =362) in terms of age (mean =49.4; SD =6.3 years versus mean =47.5; (60.0% versus 62.2% men; P=0.917) and were only slightly younger and consisted of a similar percentage of women compared to alloce-based physicians in Germany (mean 52.0 years; 61.2% men) [ 20]. During the 5-year study period, a total of 2444 patients with depression were included. The inclusion process isshown in Figure 1 . 73.4% of all patients were treated by a GP (n =1793), 17.9% by an internist ( n=437), and the remaining 8.8% of the patients were treated by a neurologist(n =214). 77.3% of the patients were female ( n=1889). The mean age of the patients was 49.1 years (SD =15.4). Altogether, 26.8% of the patients were 40-59 years years or older ( n=570). Depression was classied as depressive episode (88.3%) and recurrent depressive disorder (11.7%).There was no signicant di erence according to type of depression and age group ( P =0.789) or gender ( P=0.658). In total, 8.3% of all patients ( n=204) had two or more co-morbidities and were, therefore, classied as multi-morbid. The most frequent co-morbidities were cancer(14.4% of all patients), coronary heart disease (8.3%),and diabetes mellitus (7.1%).

Overall, 833 patients were prescribed an antidepressant medication, representing 33.9% of patients who experienceda new episode of depression. In total, 2645 prescriptionsof antidepressants for these patients were reported. Theywere nearly uniformly distributed over the four quarters (1stquarter: 630 (23.8%), 2nd quarter: 4th quarter: 754 (28.5%)). Table gives an overview of antidepres- sants. Phytotherapeutic preparations of Hypericum perfo- ratum were the frequently prescribed antidepressants over all (44.6% of all antidepressants). The most commonclass of conventional antidepressants prescribed was theNSMRI class, and amitriptyline was the most commonlyprescribed individual medication. Table 3 gives a detail overview of the included patients according to antidepressant medication. Phytotherapeuticpreparations from Hypericum perforatum were prescribed to 539 of 833 patients with antidepressant medication(64.7%), followed by NSMRI (28.2%), and SSRI (16.8%).The proportion of patients with antidepressant medica-tion was especially high among neurologists (76.2%). Theproportion of patients being prescribed any antidepressantmedication increased with patient age from 27.7% of patientsunder 40 years to 44.4% of patients of 60 years or older.Patients with multi-morbidity were more likely to receive anantidepressant than patients without co-morbidity (47.1%versus 32.9%; P =0.016 chi-square test).

As shown in Table 4 , the likelihood of being prescribed an antidepressant medication was not signicantly di erent for persons who had a co-morbid condition compared withthose who did not have a co-morbid medical conditionafter controlling for age and gender (model 1: adjustedOR =0.88; CI: 0.71-1.09) and after controlling for further potential confounder (model 2: adjusted OR =1.01; CI: 0.81-1.26). But there were signicant di erences according to the presence or absence of the individual co-morbidities.The adjusted OR for receiving any antidepressant medication was greater than 1 for the co-morbidity cerebrovasculardisease (model 1: adjusted OR =1.78; CI: 1.16-2.74; model 2: adjusted OR =1.76; CI: 1.12-2.76).

Finally model 2 also indicated OR <1 for the co-morbidities heart failure and COPD. Our data, however, suggest an increase in antidepressant medication over the time of the study period.

Discussion In this paper, we presented the results of a secondarydata analysis of electronic health record data from theEvaMed-Network, a German network of physicians with asubspecialisation in anthroposophic medicine [ 16,17,19] which aims at improving clinical practice by collectingprescription and ADR data. In the current study, 2444 patients with a rst diagnosis of depression tted the inclusion criteria. A proportionof 8.3% of them were multi-morbid with more than twodiagnoses. 33.9% of the patients received an antidepressantmedication. The proportion of patients with medications ismuch less compared to the ndings of, for example, 51.9%by Robinson et al., 76.1%, and accordingly 77.4% by Gilland colleagues in 2008 and 2010 respectively 2010 [ 21- 23]. This is even more of relevance as our patients received more complementary drug medication with phytothera-peutic preparations from Hypericum perforatum being the most prescribed drug over all. Within our study period, thenumber of psychiatric diseases and in particular depressivedisorders in Germany signicantly rose which is reflected in the data of prescription costs of antidepressants which according to health insurance data rose from 5 Mio. Euro in2000 up to 14.5 Mio. Euro in 2009 [ 24]. Published data also suggest a higher proportion of female patients receiving such medication [ 25,26]. Both of these are strongly supported by our ndings with three of four medicated patients being female and a doubling in the prescribed drugs per patientfrom 2004 to 2008. T o improve the situation of people with depression in Germany, a rst measure was the implementation of theGerman Disease Management Guideline (DMG-CPG) fordepression [ 6,8,9]. The increased of new antidepressive pharmacotherapies like SSRIs nowadays is6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 4: Likelihood of being prescribed any antidepressant medication by co-morbidity ( n=2444).

One of their major concerns is the unjustied medicationof mild and potentially self limiting depressive episodes withexpensive medications with a high potential of adverse drugreactions. Our study also gives data on the prescription of NSMRI (28.2%) and SSRI (16.8%) which is considerably below theGerman standard. One reason might be the compensation ofsuch drug classes by the use of complementary drug therapieslike Hypericum perforatum. Several publication on prescriptions [ 24] state that citalo- pram, mirtazapin and amitriptylin are the most commonand popular remedies for depression. We also found thesethree remedies to be the most often prescribed conventional drugs. However, we can not tell why the ranking in our study is the other way round (Amitriptylin, Mirtazapinefollowed by Citalopram). This may be due to the comparablylonger time frame of our study or to the di erent sample of physicians. One explanation might also be that Amitriptylinis the \"oldest\" remedy and thus the most known. In the treatment of depression, medication is only one issue; guidelines additionally focus on nonpharmacologicaltreatments like psychotherapy, mind body techniques, orlight therapy. These are also relevant therapeutic optionswhich are very often underrepresented [ 23]. However, our data do not provide detailed information on such therapies. With regards to comorbidities, studies have shown the prevalence of depression to be higher for persons with heartdiseases, diabetes mellitus, stroke, COPD, and cancer [ 28]. This was also conrmed in the study of Gill et al. 2008 ,which found depression to be more likely among patientswith a signicant number of medical comorbidities [ 21]. In our study, 504 (20.6%) had at least one comorbidity, while204 patients (8.3%) had two or more comorbidities. This is nearly comparable to the proportions provided in the studyof Gill et al. from 2010, who found 20.7% with one and5.8% with two or more co-morbidities in their sample of1513 patients [ 22]. They also found that after controlling for age and gender, patients with multiple comorbidities wereless likely to be prescribed medication (adjusted odds ratio,0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.96). In our rst multivariate model,which equates the approach of Gill et al., we were also ableto show this e ect but were not able to reach signicance (adjusted odds ratio 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09). A moredetailed di erentiation between the co-morbidities was not performed to guarantee the statistical model performance. Although there is some comparability of our results with former studies, some discrepancies of our results with another German study of Jacobi et al. [ 29]h a v et ob e mentioned. Although the proportion for one comorbiditywith 20.8% is quite similar, they found 39.9% of depressivepatients with two or more comorbidities. This may beexplained by the fact that all patients with one depressiveepisode form the basis of their study which is not comparablewith our situation. 5. Limitations The present study has several important limitations whichshould be taken into account when interpreting the results.Firstly, additional data on the depression diagnoses arelacking. We do not know to what extent the diagnoseswere made, only clinically or with additional validatedquestionnaires, that is, as a functional evaluation with theWHO-5 or PHQ-D [ 30,31]. We therefore are also not able to give detailed information on the severity of the depression.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Secondly, although physician prescribing data were sub- jected to an internal review, coding inaccuracies cannot beruled out entirely. Thirdly, our data do not provide more detailed infor- mation on the type and dosage of phytotherapeutic Hyper- icum perforatum preparations. For the same methodological boundaries, our data also do not allow a calculation of daily drug doses, which limits the comparability of our data withother studies. Fourthly, data on subsequent medication use in patients who switched physicians were unavailable. Fifthly, our data from the group of 22 participating physicians are not representative for physicians in generalpractice in Germany nor may be seen as such for the smallersubgroup of anthroposophical physicians. The same problemarises for the patients the data are based on. Althoughan earlier paper gives an estimate for the prevalence ofmood and a ective disorders (F00-F39) of about 10% in our patients between 40 and 70 years in 2005 which iscomparable to the numbers given, that is, in [ 7], it is less than the prevalence of 19.8% reported in [ 29]. Thus generalisations from this data are somehow limited. Finally, although there were no major di erences to the studies of Gill et al., the present study lacks a directcomparison group and the options to carry out detailedsubgroup analyses. Further research on this subject wouldbenet from including a comparison group of conventionalprimary care physicians. 6. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive analysis of everydaypractice for treatment of depression in primary care in physi-cians with subspecialisation in anthroposophic medicine(AM). Although the administration of phytotherapeuticpreparations from Hypericum perforatum was signicantly higher, the prescribing frequency for conventional anti-depressive drugs is partly comparable to those found in otherstudies.

Objective . Patients with schizophrenia residing at institutions often su er from negative symptoms, motor, and functional impairments more severe than their noninstitutionalized counterparts. Tai-chi emphasizes body relaxation, alertness, andmovement coordination with benets to balance, focus, and stress relief. This pilot study explored the e cacy of Tai-chi on movement coordination, negative symptoms, and functioning disabilities towards schizophrenia. Methods . A randomized waitlist control design was adopted, where participants were randomized to receive either the 6-week Tai-chi program and standardresidential care or only the latter. 30 Chinese patients with schizophrenia were recruited from a rehabilitation residency. All wereassessed on movement coordination, negative symptoms, and functi onal disabilities at baseline, following intervention and 6 weeks after intervention. Results .T a i - c h ib u ered from deteriorations in movement coordination and interpersonal functioning, the latter with sustained e ectiveness 6 weeks after the class was ended. Controls showed marked deteriorations in those areas. The Tai-chi group also experienced fewer disruptions to life activities at the 6-week maintenance. There was no signicant improvement in negative symptoms after Tai-chi. Conclusions . This study demonstrated encouraging benets of Tai-chi in preventing deteriorations in movement coordination and interpersonal functioning for resid ential patients with schizophrenia. The ease of implementation facilitates promotion at institutional psychiatric services. 1. Introduction Schizophrenia a ects about 24 million people worldwide. Despite a low incidence rate (3/10,000) [ 1,2], its poor recovery prognosis and chronic nature renders it a highlyprevalent disorder (0.4%-1%). Long-term care and symp-toms management become crucial as symptoms may persistlifelong. While mild-graded patients under medication maylive independently, others may benet from residential carewhich prepares them for reentering the community whentheir symptoms and personal care, are well-managed. Under the medical model, the primary focus of care and research on patients prioritizes illness management, self-care, and functioning abilities while physical or psychologicalwell-being falls secondary. Patients with schizophrenia havecomparatively shorter life expectancies due to poor physical health (higher incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases) and psychological health (depression and suicide) [3-5]. However, this may be partially attributable to the side-e ects of medication; poor lifestyles or a simple lack of exercise [ 6]. There are a number of known benets of exercise to patients' psychosocial well-being and their symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Levin and Gimino [ 7] indicated that aerobic exercise reduces depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in hospitalized schizophrenic patients compared to no-exercise controls. Similar interventions improved mood, anxiety and depression, increased self- esteem, energy, concentration, quality of life, and social2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine interactions [ 8,9]. Faulkner and Sparkes [ 10]i n v e s t i g a t e d a 10-week exercise program which reduced auditory hallu-cinations, raised self-esteem, improved sleep patterns, andgeneral behaviors. Randomized controlled trials establishedeven stronger evidence of aerobic and strength exercises inlowering positive and negative symptoms, state anxiety, and psychological distress while improving quality of life [ 11]. More recent research noted anatomical changes associatedwith aerobic exercise particularly in increasing hippocampalvolume [ 12] which potentially improves short-term memory among exercisers with schizophrenia. Besides symptom-related outcomes, a lack of physical activity was associatedwith worse health-related quality of life [ 13]. Exercises based upon Eastern health philosophy like Tai- chi stress the interrelated body and mind. Besides being aform of light-to-moderate intensity physical exercise [ 14,15] which improves cardiovascular tness, balance control, andflexibility [ 16], Tai-chi is also a cultivation of psychological focus and relaxation [ 17]. There is strong empirical evidence on the mind-body e ects of Tai-chi for the elderly, depressed patients and those su ering from coronary heart diseases [18,19]. Besides symptom-specic improvements, regular practice of Tai-chi can also e ectively enhance physical and mental quality of life for various patient populations [ 20,21]. Through a decrease in the neuroendocrinal stress response,it brings about psychological benets for chronic patientsthrough its antidepressant and antiolytic e ects [ 22]. Tai- chi is principled upon body relaxation, mental alertness,movement sequencing, and coordination [ 23]. Targeting both the mind and body, Tai-chi holds promising benets for patients with mental illnesses. A randomized-controlled trial [ 24] on a 12-week Tai-chi program for patients with chronic schizophrenia found reduced negative symptoms.Another form of mind-body intervention, yoga, which alsostresses breathing, relaxation and stretching, was foundeective in reducing positive and negative symptoms while enhancing health-related quality of life in a systematic reviewof randomized-controlled trials [ 25]. Emphasizing focus cultivation, relaxation, bodily coordination, and control, Tai-chi can potentially improve psychopathogical symptoms,movement coordination, and general functioning. However,little research investigated the potential benets of Tai-chi forthese clienteles. The present study explored ectiveness imple- mentation feasibility of Tai-chi (Wu-style Cheng form) onthe movement coordination, negative schizophrenic symp-toms, and general functioning disabilities for residentialschizophrenic patients. This pilot trial was conducted forpatients with schizophrenia residing at residential rehabili-tation facilities. Halfway houses and long-stay care homesoer training on illness management and life skills so as to facilitate community reintegration [ 26]. This reflects a gradual departure from relying purely on medical treatmentto incorporating adjuvant nonpharmalogical interventions. Y et, institutionalized patients with schizophrenia, partic- ularly those in long-stay care homes, su er from higher cognitive impairments, more serious negative symptoms andworse social functioning compared to their counterpartsin other living conditions [ 27]. If the benets of Tai-chican be established, this can be a promising contribution to residential mental illness rehabilitation. Not only doesit facilitate illness management, the mastery of a Tai-chimovement sequence may further promote independence anda sense of control over illness outcomes. The primary aim of this pilot trial is to examine the eectiveness of a 6-week Tai chi program as an adjunctive intervention in a residential rehabilitation setting. The sec-ondary objective is to explore the benets and disadvantagesof such intervention, thereby, informing the feasibility forpromotion and areas for improvement. 2. Methods 2.1. Subjects. The pilot trial recruited thirty residential patients with chronic schizophrenia from the Sheng KungHui Providence Garden for Rehab, a mental health rehabil-itation complex in Hong Kong providing both long-stay careand halfway house services to enhance the heterogeneity ofthe sample. Potential participants were invited to participateby their social workers based on the following inclusion andexclusion criteria. 30 participants were recruited so as toensure an optimal group size of 12 after randomization [ 28] and a dropout rate of 20%. The inclusion criteria included the following. (a) A diag- nosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM IV-TR criteria. ( b )A g eb e t w e e n1 8t o6 5y e a r s .( c )A b i l i t yt ou n d e r s t a n da n dspeak Cantonese. (d) no prior experience in learning Tai-chi. Participants were excluded if (e) diagnosed with acuteschizophrenia requiring hospitalization; (f) su ering from severe schizophrenic symptoms (e.g., persistent withdrawal)that would limit their ability to interact or participate inthe class; (g) su ering from physical disabilities that would limit Tai-chi practice (including past or current seriousspinal, hip or knee injury or pathology; severe pain limitingmovement; or unsuitable for Tai-chi exercise as determinedby their physicians); (h) Su ering from other severe illnesses which may impair cognitive or visuomotor functioning,cause physical pain or limit life expectancy to 10 years or less. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties at theUniversity of Hong Kong. Written informed consent wassolicited from all participants. 2.2. Intervention and Waitlist Randomization. This Tai-chi class was based on the Wu-style Cheng-form Tai-chi Chuan [29] led by mental health professionals. They were provided formal training in Tai-chi before going through a 12-sessionTai-chi trainer's course at a professional Tai-chi institute.While movement is relatively standardized across variousstyles of Tai-chi, the unique strengths of the Wu-style (Chengform) Tai-chi are its emphasis on movement rhythm, withpotential benets on movement coordination. It comprisesof 22 simple movement forms (listed in Table 1) which are relatively easy and emphasizes attention and coordinationin their basic philosophy [ 29]. One is required to name the movement form during practice which demands attention,concentration, memory and physical exertion inclusive inone simple exercise routine. One-hour classes were heldEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Table 1: The 22 movement forms of Wu-style Cheng form Tai-chi.

Additional half-hour trainer-led practice sessions were held on a weeklybasis throughout the 12-week study period, accumulating toa total of 2.5 hours of Tai-chi practice per week. Randomization of participants was done using random numbers. The waitlist group received their standard residen-tial care which includes a 30-minute daily morning stretchingroutine for both the Tai-chi and control participants. 2.3. Measurements. Both the Tai-chi and waitlist groups were assessed (i) before intervention (T1), (ii) within 1 week afterthe 6-week intervention (after intervention T2), and (iii)within the 6th week after the intervention (maintenanceT3). Qualitative feedback on learning and practising Tai-chiwere collected with a structured interview schedule at T3 ontheir perceived benets and di culties of practising Tai-chi. Responses were recorded on paper by the interviewer. A series of patient assessments were administered by trained research assistants who were blinded to the groupassignment of participants. 2.3.1. Movement Coordination Tests. Measurements of arm- hand dexterity and rapid eye-hand coordination wereassessed using the Minnesota Rate of Manipulation T est(CMDT) [ 30], which is a collection of structured and well- established tests on motor disabilities used for occupationalplanning. It consists of ve sub-tests: placing, turning,displacing, one-hand turning/placing, and two-hand turn-ing/placing. Scoring is based on time needed to completethe tasks which involve the manipulation of cylindrical discs o nt w ob o a r d sw i t hp e r f o r a t e dh o l e s .Ap r a c t i c et r i a lw a sgiven for all tests followed by two trials of which the averagescore was taken. Higher scores indicate longer time neededto complete the task, hence greater disabilities in movementcoordination. The CMDT has good test-retest reliability for psychiatric patients (including schizophrenia) [ 31] and is currently being used as a formal motor assessment at the testsite. 2.3.2. Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANSs). T h eS A N S[ 32] was used for the assessment of negative symptoms in 5 dimensions including attention, anhedonia-asociality, avolition-apathy, alogia, and a ective flattening or blunting. The scale is rated on a 6-point Likert scale wherehigher scores indicate greater severity of negative symptoms. T o ensure inter-rater reliability, the rst 5 interviews were conducted with multiple interviewers and nal ratings weregiven after deliberation by the team. The rated scores wouldsubsequently be discussed with psychiatric social workersproviding care to the participants to ensure that ratings givenclosely reflected their actual symptom levels. 2.3.3. World Health Organization Disability Assessment Sched- ule (WHODAS-II). The WHODAS-II [ 33]m e a s u r e sl e v e l s of health-induced disabilities in a number of life domainsin the past 30 days. Domains include cognition, mobility,self-care, interpersonal interactions, life activities, and com-munity participation. The internal consistency, test-retestreliability, and validities of this instrument were satisfactoryfor patients with schizophrenia [ 34,35]. The interviewer-administered 36-item version was adopted. Items were translated and back-translated bythe research team into Chinese to facilitate participants'understanding. Certain items including \"staying by yourselffor a few days\" and \"sexual activities\" were dropped for a lack of relevance at the studied residential facility. Higher scores denote greater functioning disabilities. 2.3.4. Sociodemographic and Clinical Information. Patients' sociodemographic and clinical information were solicited from personal and medical records. This included their age,gender, education level, martial status, and employment.Their period of psychiatric diagnosis, medication, and con-secutive lengths of stay at residential facilities were collectedas clinical data. 2.3.5. Qualitative Feedback. Structured interview questions requiring participants to list their subjective advantages anddisadvantages of Tai-chi were posed at the maintenanceassessment. 2.4. Statistical Analyses. Intention-to-treat analysis was employed, such that participants with missed Tai-chi sessionsor data were still included in the nal analysis. Due to thesmall sample size, nonparametric techniques were adopted.Within and between-group comparisons were conductedwith the Wilcoxon signed ranks the Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively, using the Statistical Package for Social4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Sciences version 18.0. Analyses were conducted on all three time points for intervention and maintenance e ects. All statistical signicance tests are two-sided, at the level ofsignicance of P 0.05. E ects sizes were calculated according to [ 36] ,w h e r em e d i u ma n dl a r g ee ects sizes are indicated by r=0.3a n dr=0.5, respectively. Missing variables were replaced with the median of the respective subscale if the number of missing variables did not exceedhalf of the subscale. Qualitative feedback was analyzed usingtheme analysis. 3. Results 3.1. Participants. 30 participants fullling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to participate into the study(Figure 1). Participants had a mean age of 53 years and were diagnosed for about 28 years. The average consecutive lengthof stay at rehabilitation residencies was 11.8 years. Allparticipants were receiving antipsychotic medication. On Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests, the Tai-chi and the waitlist groups were comparable on their sociodemo-graphic and clinical statues as well as the assessment variables(Table 2). The sole exception is a relatively higher ratio of females in the waitlist group as compared to the Tai-chigroup. Antipsychotic medication use at baseline (T1) did not dier signicantly between the two groups which were assessed based on chlorpromazine equivalents which reflectsmedication dosage ( Z = 0.591;P=0.555) [ 37]. The average daily chlorpromazine equivalents of the Tai-chi and waitlist groups were 391 mg and 365 mg, respectively. Medication change at maintenance (T3) was minimal, whereonly two participants from the Tai-chi group and one fromthe waitlist group had their dosages altered during thestudy period. The average change in the chlorpromazineequivalents did not signicantly di er between the groups (Z = 0.537;P=0.592). Approximately 57% of the participants ( n=17) were taking atypical antipsychotics. 3.2. Movement Coordination. Motor dexterity and eye hand coordination (CMDT) after attending the Tai-chi class (T2)was not vastly di erent from baseline (T1). But the waitlist group experienced signicant deterioration on 3 of the 5 testsof the CMDT, the turning test ( Z =2.22;P=0.026;r= 0.57), ( Z=2.22;P=0.026;r=0.57) ( Z=2.98;P=0.003;r=0.77). There is a signicant di erence in how the Tai-chi group and the waitlist group faired on the displacing test ( Z= marginal the Tai-chi class bu ered from deteriorations in movement coordination but e ects were not sustained at maintenance (T3). 3.3. Negative Symptoms. Changes to negative symptoms were not statistically signicant after the Tai-chi class or inthe waitlist group. Between group comparison also failed toreach signicance.3.4. Functioning Disability. Fewer disruptions in life activities functioning was observed for the Tai-chi group at mainte- nance (T3) ( Z = 2.14;P=0.03;r=0.55). The Tai-chi participants also found fewer di culties with community participation at T2 ( Z= 2.73;P=0.01;r=0.70). The waitlist group, however, experienced in interpersonal functioning at T2 ( Z= 2.22;P=0.03;r= 0.5 7 )a n ds u s t a i n e da tT 3( Z= 2.43;P=0.02;r=0.63). Between group di erences in interpersonal functioning were signicant between baseline and T2 ( (Z= 2.56;P=0.01;r=0.47). Performance outcomes of the two groups are detailed in Table 3. 3.5. Qualitative Feedback on the Benets and Disadvantages of T ai-Chi. Participants generally enjoyed Tai-chi for the benet it brought to their physical and mental health. Others found it to be a pleasurable activity although a few did not enjoy the level of persistence required by the slow yet energy- demanding Tai-chi movements. Other di culties arose from the complexity of movements. Table 4lists the themes and examples of the feedback. 4. Discussion and Conclusion Tai-chi is often taken as a form of alternative therapy in the treatment for physical or mental ailments [ 17,38]. In schizophrenia research, the possible benets of thistraditional form of mind-body exercise have not been receiv- ing similar attention as other types of physical exercises. The benets of physical activity to the rehabilitation of psychosis are well established although patients tend to be less physically active compared to those without psychosis[39]. Poor physical tness, low skeletal-muscle mass, and obesity, all of which are associated with a lack of exercise, are all contributing factors to mortality among patients with schizophrenia [ 40]. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the detrimental manifestations of schizophrenia are amendable by lifestyle modication like regularly practicing Tai-chi. Results lent evidence that Tai-chi can help protect against deteriorations in movement coordination after 6 weeks of Tai-chi. With regular weekly practice, it also bu ered against a decline in interpersonal functioning which was sustainedeven 6 weeks after the class. Reasons for the deteriorations in the waitlist group may reflect the instability of psychomotor or functioning states of residential psychiatric patients. The majority of participants required long-stay care, with unstable illness prognosis and functioning. Particularly sincethe collection of T2 and T3 data happened to fall during festivities, participants' daily functioning and activities may have been a ected by family visits, or other activities held at the facility. Previous exercise interventions for schizophrenia reha- bilitation focused primarily on the alleviation of psychoticsymptoms rather than psychomotor outcomes, despitebeing an important illness manifestation.

Tai-chi emphasizesmovement rhythm, which may have helped prevent motordeteriorations as a result of schizophrenia or extra-pyramidalsymptoms. This outcome concurs with research demonstrat-ing improved motor responses and postural control amongthe elderly regularly practising Tai-chi [ 41]. For patients with schizophrenia, better psychomotor functioning is relatedto social, clinical, and functioning outcomes [ 42]. Motor functioning is a key feature of schizophrenia and can betied in with a number of other psychological symptoms.Hallucination, for instance, was found to be related tothe blood flow to the motor region of the brain [ 43] leading to growing interest in the way mental events controlmovements. This, among other evidence, demonstrates a sophisticated interaction between psychological and motor processes in patients. Mind-body exercises like Tai-chi notonly restore muscular strength and coordination but furthercultivate psychological focus and concentration [ 17]. Given the intricate associations between the mental and motor pro-cesses in schizophrenia, the benets Tai-chi has on the psy-chological states of patients may possibly underlie one of thepathways to better motor functioning. While this pathwayhas yet to be attested in future research, the bu ering e ect Tai-chi demonstrated on motor deteriorations holds impor-tant clinical implications. In residential settings, movementcoordination can possibly help sustain self-care abilities,the completion of daily tasks, while indirectly supportingparticipation in social activities. Among participants in thecurrent study, the general level of movement coordination onall ve tests was substantially impaired, falling within the 1stpercentile of the population norm [ 44]. Their performance was also largely confounded by deciencies in understanding instructions. Therefore, despite promising outcomes, a more simple coordination test may more reliably reflect movementcoordination function in future research.6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 2: Socio-demographical, clinical characteristics and assessment outcomes at baseline.

Despite focusing on the inner self [ 17], traditional Tai-chi practice often takes place in a group, under a belief that stronger qi(a positive healing force) can be better cultivated in a group than by a single person alone. Therefore, the Tai-chi class allows for both verbal and nonverbal connectionsamong participants. Another study on yoga intervention for patients with schizophrenia proposed the role of improved emotional recognition to enhancing social functioning [ 45]. Being socially integrated is especially important in residential settings, where many participants in the study complained ofbeing emotionally a ected by indi erent or disruptive rela- tionships with fellow residents. Indeed, social functioning isEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Table 3: Performances outcomes of the Tai-chi and the waitlist control group on the assessed variables.

Y et, it bears signicant clinical relevance where interpersonal interactions and community participation arepredictive of clinical outcomes in a high risk psychosis group[47]. Participant feedback provided anecdotal suggestions for the possible mechanisms of the benets of Tai-chi. Similar toyoga, Tai-chi distinguishes itself from other forms of physicalexercises. Recognizing the mind-body nature of this activity,some participants expressed appreciation for both physicaland mental benets. They experienced improvements inhealth, flexibility, assured of the benets for bones andligaments. On the cognitive and psychological level, someparticipants were happier, more relaxed, alert, thinking moreopenly, and feeling more regulated. A hallmark disability ofschizophrenia is poor learning and memory, believed to arisefrom hippocampal atrophy. With a high cognitive compo-nent involving the memorization of movement sequence, itcan possibly help instigate hippocampal neurogenesis, hence,leading to cognitive improvements [ 48]. Future studies could also expand understanding on the benets of Tai-chi towards other functional arenas. From this preliminary study, Tai-chi supplementing regular antipsychotic and rehabilitation care has a protectiveeect for institutionalized patients. It is also a sustainable form of treatment that may o er a sense of mastery towards illness control. A persistent obstacle is participants' lowmotivation to continue practising independently. Tai-chicalls for mental endurance and patience, which provedchallenging for some who found it mundane, or experi-ence di culty remembering the movements. Consequently, trainer-led weekly practice sessions could be helpful. Outsideresidential facilities however, practice sessions may becomeless feasible in the community, where preinterventionpsychoeducation on the health benets of exercise andenhancing self-e cacy may improve participation rates [ 49]. In addition, this study was conducted with participants withconstrained lifestyles where diet, sleep, medication, exerciselevels, smoking, amongst others were carefully controlled.Under such favourable conditions, the e ectiveness of Tai-chi is maximal, as it often takes collaborative e orts in lifestyle changes to bring about improvements to illness symptoms.Consequently, the e ectiveness of Tai-chi for community patients with a less healthy lifestyle has yet to be explored. Despite numerous studies demonstrating the e ects of exercising and Tai-chi, this is one of the few randomizedcontrolled trials on Tai-chi for patients with schizophrenia.However, this remains a small-sampled pilot study, which isconfounded by the lack of a group exercise control conditionto account for the possible e ects of exercise or peer gather- ing. Another limitation lies in the assessment of functioningdisability, WHODAS-II which was translated to Chinese buthas yet to be validated in the population. Two items werealso removed from the scale for their irrelevancy to thecontext but should also be assessed in a larger study withboth residential and community patients. Notwithstanding such limitations, Tai-chi proved promising in areas where psychotropic medication currently has limited e ectiveness. As the rehabilitation of mental illness gradually moves awayfrom the medical model, Tai-chi can be promoted as anadjunct to improving patients' general functioning.

In recent years, Taiji has been frequently investigated and considered as a stress management intervention. Although health care providers' appraisals and consumers' expectations are regarded as essential for treatment outcome, little attention has been drawnto this issue in Taiji research. In our study we have conducted two surveys to explore beginners' ( n =74) expectations and teachers' (n=136) appraisals of their Taiji courses in general as well as more pa rticularly related to stress management. Qualitative data analysis revealed that beginners mainly expected to learn a new met hod that is applicable in their daily life to foster peace of mind and to enhance their stress management. Congruently moderate -to-high improvements in stress management have also been found in quantitative analysis, whereby a lower ed ucational level predicted higher expectations ( P=0.016). Taiji-teachers stated body- and mind-related benets most frequently and appraised moderate-to-high improvements in stress management. Higher appraisals were predicted by a shorter teaching experience ( P=0.024). Our results inform about beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals related to a Taiji-beginners course and highlight the role of educational background and teaching experience in shaping stress-management-related beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals. 1. Introduction In the recent past, the interest in mind-body practices for health promotion and stress management has considerablyincreased in the general and clinical population as well asin the scientic community [ 1-5]. In particular, Taiji (or T'ai Chi, T'ai Chi Chuan, Taijiquan), a mind-body practiceoriginating from China, became more popular in westerncountries in the last decades [ 6-8] .T a i j ii sd e n e db yW a y n e and Kaptchuk [ 6] as \"an exercise based on slow intentional movements, often coordinated with breathing and imagery,which aims to strengthen and relax the physical body- andmind, enhance the natural flow of what the Chinese call qi (..., life energy), and improve health, personal development, and self-defense\" (page 96). In fact, numerous clinical trialsand systematic reviews examined the e ectiveness of Taiji for various health conditions, underlining its preventive andtherapeutic value, for example, for fall prevention [ 9-12], for treatment of chronic diseases [ 9,13-16], and for improve- ment of mental health [ 9,10,17], where a particularly growing body of evidence is supporting the benecial e ects of Taiji practice on stress management [ 17-22]. However, hitherto only a few studies have been published explicitlyinvestigating the underlying modes of action of Taiji [ 6,23, 24]. Taiji is regarded as a complex intervention, comprising multiple components of which each may have independent and synergistic therapeutic value. Two of these componentsare students' expectations and teachers' attitudes [ 6]. As shown in previous research, treatment expectations of health care consumers may influence treatment outcome; in2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine particular higher treatment expectations have been repeat- edly found to be associated with better treatment results [ 25- 29]. The impact of health care practitioners' expectations on treatment results has also been documented [ 30-32]a sw e l l as the crucial importance of the match of treatment-relatedappraisals and expectations for an outcome enhancing working alliance [ 33-36]. Even though the above-mentioned ndings underline the relevance of expectancies and appraisals on treatmentresults, to date studies exploring this issue in the eld ofTaiji and other mind-body practices are scarce. We havefound an early Taiji study, where the enhancement of moodafter Taiji practice has been partially explained by a higherexpectation of a positive outcome (i.e., mood enhancement)in the Taiji group [ 37]. Although the need for further research into the role of participants' motivation in stressmanagement practices such as Taiji has been highlighted[37], only one qualitative study assessed treatment-related expectations of Qigong beginners [ 38]. The ndings of this study suggest that Qigong beginners with no furtherspecied health status mainly expect improvement of theirhealth condition and relaxation as well as professionalism,provision of information, and empathy from the teachers[38]. T o the best of our knowledge, beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals regarding the benets of their Taijicourses have not yet been investigated. Based on the relevance of treatment-related expecta- tions and appraisals for treatment outcome, an increasedawareness and knowledge about beginners' expectations andteachers' appraisals of their Taiji-beginners courses may have an impact on treatment outcomes in Taiji interventions. Therefore, the aim of our present study was to explorebeginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals of their Taiji-beginners courses. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design. We have conducted two surveys, one among Taiji-beginners in the area of Bern and one withTaiji teachers in the German speaking area of Switzerlandincluding the Bern area. The survey of Taiji-beginners wasnested within a trial examining psychobiological e ects of Taiji on psychosocial stress reactivity [ 22]a n dw a sf o r m a l l y approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of Bern,Switzerland. For the survey of the Taiji teachers, no approvalof the ethics committee was required. However, participants'information about the study and the voluntary nature ofsurvey participation, and data protection were handled alike. 2.2. Selection of Subjects. In the rst survey, healthy Taiji- beginners were recruited through announcements on pinboards and on the websites of the University of Bern and theUniversity Hospital in Bern. Eligible participants had to bebetween 18 and 50 years old and fluent in German. Exclusioncriteria are reported elsewhere in detail [ 22]. All participants who completed baseline examination were included in thisstudy.For the second survey, we identied electronically registered Taiji teachers in the German-speaking part ofSwitzerland by conducting an Internet search in November2010 using the Google search engine. All of them were invitedto participate in an online survey by e-mail. Participants hadto be fluent in German and actively engaged as Taiji teachers. 2.3. Data Collection. Both study groups participated in an online survey. After assessing sociodemographic data (forall participants: gender, age, and occupation status; forTaiji-beginners only: education level; for Taiji teachers only:years of Taiji practice experience and years of Taiji-teachingexperience) the rst question asked to Taiji-beginners aimedto assess their general expectations and was \"What are your expectations towards the upcoming Taiji course ( =two lessons per week during 3 months)?\" Comparably, the Taijiteachers were asked to answer the open question \"Whichbenets can a newbie expect from a Taiji-beginners course( =two lessons per week during 3 months)?\" also by writing down their narrative responses. T o assess beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals related to changes in stress management in response toregular Taiji practice, all study participants were addition-ally asked to rate 12 statements expressing Taiji-inducedchanges in stress coping (6 items) and resource activation(6 items), by indicating the degree of their agreement ona 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)to 6 (strongly agree). T o avoid priming e ects, these items w e r ep r e s e n t e do nan e ws c r e e np a g e .T h ef u l ls e l f - d e v e l o p e dquestionnaire is shown in the Appendix. We dened thesum of all rating scores as an index representing expectedor appraised changes in overall stress management inducedby regular Taiji practice. This stress management index witha theoretical score range from 12 to 72 has a high internalconsistency in Taiji-beginners (Cronbach's =0.89), as well as in Taiji teachers (Cronbach's =0.94). Construct validity was estimated by pooling data of both study groups andcalculating a principal component factor analysis across all 12 items. An analysis of the eigenvalues using scree test [ 39] resulted in a one general factor solution (eigenvalue =6.5) with 54.4% explanation of variance. The item loadings onthe general factor ranged from 0.45 to 0.83. 2.4. Data Analysis. Data analysis was conducted by using SPSS (version 18) statistical software package for Macintosh (IBM SPSS Statistics. Somers, NY, USA). Sociodemographic characteristics of Taiji-beginners and Taiji teachers wereanalyzed by using descriptive statistics. Unless indicated, allresults are presented as mean \u00b1standard deviation (SD). Narrative questionnaire data were systematically pre- pared and analyzed by using a qualitative and quantitativeapproach [ 40]. In the qualitative approach, each analytical step has been conducted independently by two authors(MN and CB). After each step, results were comparedand di erences were discussed until consensus was found. In a rst step, each narrative response was screened todetect and mark all analytical units (e.g., beginners' expec-tations, resp., teachers' perceived benets). In a secondEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 step, those analytical units lacking in terminological clarity were explicitly stated. Afterwards, all analytical units werereduced to short paraphrases, comprehensible independentfrom its originally embedded context. In a next step, weconducted a content analysis of about 50% of all analyticalunits and inductively generated thematic categories. The suitability of these categories was tested by classifying the remaining 50% of all analytical units. After amending theinitially dened categories, we reclassied all analyticalunits. Finally, we thematically captured the nal categoriesinto main categories. Both the main and the subcategorieswere quantitatively described by indicating the frequency ofmentions in absolute and percentage values. In explorative data analysis, we compared beginners' general expectations with teachers' general appraisals relatedto Taiji-beginners courses by examining group di erences of frequency values in each main category using 2tests. In the quantitative approach, we conducted explorative comparisons of stress-management-related to beginners'expectations and teachers' appraisals using a t-test for independent samples. Prior to t-test calculation, normal distribution of data and homogeneity of variance wereveried by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Levene test.All analyses were two tailed, with the level of signicance setatP 0.05 and the level of borderline signicance set at P0.10. For Taiji-beginners, we calculated a hierarchical linear regression analysis to examine the predictive value of theindependent variables \"age,\" \"gender,\" and \"education level\"on the expected changes in overall stress-management- related to regular Taiji practice (dependent variable). Simi- larly, we computed a hierarchical linear regression analysisin the group of Taiji teachers to investigate the potential roleof the variables \"age,\" \"gender,\" and \"teaching experience\" asindependent predictors of their appraised changes in Taiji-beginners' overall stress management due to regular Taijipractice (dependent variable). 3. Results 3.1. Group Characteristics. Of the 112 initially registered applicants for a Taiji-beginners course, 74 subjects completedbaseline examination and met the inclusion but none of theexclusion criteria. There was no missing data in this group. Of the 355 invited Taiji teachers, 24 had no valid e-mail address and could not have been reached otherwise, 19 wereoering Qigong but no Taiji classes, 10 were not teaching anymore, and 10 were registered twice. Of the remaining 292potentially eligible Taiji teachers, 136 (47%) completed thesurvey. Stress-management-related appraisals were missingfrom three Taiji teachers. An overview of sociodemographiccharacteristics of both study groups is presented in Table 1. 3.2. Beginners' Expectations towards Their T aiji Course 3.2.1. Qualitative Analyses. Analyzing Taiji-beginners' answ- ers on the rst question assessing course expectations ingeneral, a total of 299 expectations (mean 4 .04 \u00b11.84) werestated .As shown in Figure 1, beginners mentioned daily- life-related expectations (comprising 20% of all expectations (11%) were mentioned less frequently. With respect to frequencies of expectations as repre- sented in the subcategories, \"get to know Taiji in general\"was mentioned by 57% of all Taiji-beginners followed by\"improvement of stress management\" (41%) \"increaseof and of mind\" 27% of allbeginners also expected \"transferability of \"increase of relaxation\" was mentioned by 26%of the course applicants. Complete results are shown inTable 2. 3.2.2. Quantitative Analyses. From regular Taiji practice (i.e., one hour twice a week during three months) beginnersexpected a moderate-to-high improvement of their stressmanagement (mean 53 .50 \u00b19.56; range =12 to 72). Regression analysis revealed that a lower education levelsignicantly predicted higher improvements in the successful management of stress ( = 0.29;P=0.016), whereas age and gender did not (see Table 3). The whole model explained 9.1% of total variance in beginners Appraisals of Their T aiji Courses 3.3.1. Qualitative Analyses. A total of 816 general appraisals (mean =6.00\u00b12.76) were stated by the Taiji teachers in their answers to the initial question assessing potential benets aTaiji-beginners course may o er to newbies. As shown in Fig- ure1, 76% of all appraisals belonged to the main categories of body-related (43%) and mind-related appraisals (33%),while the less frequently mentioned appraisals were capturedby the remaining four main categories andprocess- and of appraisals in the subcategories, results revealed that 60% of all Taiji teachers mentioned an\"increase of internal balance and peace of mind\" as a benetTaiji-beginners may expect from regular Taiji practice. Otherfrequently mentioned benets were \"improvement of bodyawareness\" (46%) and \"improvement physical function-ing\" (44%) such as breathing, circulation, blood pressure,immune system, digestion and sleep, \"improvement and (32%). For complete results see Table 2. 3.3.2. Quantitative Analyses.

The overall explanation of variance by our model is small (R2=0.075;R2corr=0.053; F Comparison of Beginners' Expectations with Teachers' Appraisals. The comparison of the main cate- gories of beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisalsis depicted in Figure 1. In contrast to the Taiji teachers, beginners generally stated signicantly fewer expectations(t 2=104.61;P< 0.001) toward their upcoming Taiji course. Taiji teachers in turn were more frequently emphasizing group dierences were observed for mind-body-related statements (P=1.00). Process- and context-related statements were theleast mentioned ones in both groups, yet signicantly more often mentioned by Taiji-beginners ( 2=62.48;P< 0.001). Both groups did not di er regarding their ratings related to expected, respectively, appraised Taiji-induced changes inoverall stress management ( P =0.54). 4. Discussion Our study is the rst to examine beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals towards Taiji-beginners courses. In the following, we will summarize, discuss, and compare our ndings of our two surveys. While both beginners and teachers expressed comparable mind-body-related expectations and appraisals, we foundsignicant di erences in mind- and body-related statements. Taiji-beginners expected to learna new approach that is particularly helpful to foster peaceof mind and to improve their stress management. Theyexplicitly emphasized the transferability of course contentsinto their daily life. In contrast to Taiji-beginners, only a fewteachers mentioned knowledge-related and daily-life-relatedbenets, but many of them stated mind- and body-relatedbenets of Taiji practice. It might be that Taiji teachers areEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 2: Frequency of mentioned beginners' expectations and teac hers' appraisals of the expectations/appraisals Improvement of stress management 41 13Transferability of course content into daily life 27 9 Counterbalance to daily work 14 3 Knowledge-related expectations/appraisals Get to know Taiji in general 57 2 Learning the motion sequences 15 4 Get to know the philosophical background 5 2Improvement of self-defense 1 1 Mind-body-related expectations/appraisals Increase of body awareness 27 46Increase of relaxation 26 29Holistic health promotion 16 19 Perception of the flow of Qi/energy 1 8 Mind-related expectations/appraisals Increase of internal balance and peace of mind 32 60 Increase of power of concentration 14 32 Expansion of consciousness 5 6Fostering of self-compassion 5 7 Fostering of equanimity 4 16 Increase of contentedness 3 16Fostering of mindfulness 3 5Increase of mental flexibility/openness 1 11 Increase of self-e cacy 1 5 Increase of patience and tenacity 1 1Increase of self-esteem 0 10 Fostering of compassion and tolerance towards others 0 8 Increase of mental alertness 0 18Improvement of memory 0 2 Body-related expectations/appraisals Be physically active 16 3Increase of physical well-being 14 16Strengthening of the body 8 21 Improvement of motor coordination 7 37 Increase of flexibility 5 32Improvement of balance 4 38 Improvement of body alignment/posture 3 21 Improvement of physical functioning 3 44Alleviation of physical ailments 1 23 Increase of postural stability 0 16 Increase of looseness 0 4Reduction of risk of falls 0 1 Process- and context-related expectations/appraisals Enjoyment of practicing Taiji 12 5Meeting new people 9 2Professional instruction 9 0 Experience of learning progress 7 1 Pleasant course ambience 5 1 1%v a l u e sr e f e rt ot h ep e r c e n t a g eo fs u b j e c t si ne a c hs t u d yg r o u p .6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 3: Hierarchical regression analyses for (a) Taiji-beginners' expec tations related to stress management and (b) for Taiji-teachers' appraisals related to stress management.

On theother hand it should be kept in mind that the beginnersunder study took part in a research project that examinedwhether Taiji training-related to psychosocial stress reactivity[22]. This participation might have contributed to a frequent mentioning of improvement of stress management amongbeginners' daily-life-related expectations. However, sincestress-management-related benets of Taiji practice are com-monly described in basic literature for Taiji-beginners [ 7,42, 43], these expectations might also occur in subjects attending Taiji-beginners classes in naturalistic settings. A possiblereason explaining why beginners did not mention body- andmind-related expectations as frequently as teachers did mightbe the lack of knowledge about these potential e ects of Taiji practice. This reasoning is in line with the high frequencyof knowledge related expectations in Taiji-beginners. Alsoto be taken into account is the young to middle age andthe good health status of the beginners under study. While older people with an impaired physical condition are likely to expect more body-related benets when engaging intophysical activity programs [ 44] this might not have been the case for our study group. Only a few beginners and even fewer teachers mentioned process- and context-related expectations and appraisals.This nding suggests that the vast majority of our studyparticipants are not aware of the potential relevance ofprocess- and context-related factors for treatment outcome[45-48]. It may be that Taiji teachers take the agreeableness and the appropriateness of their teaching methods employedin their courses for granted and therefore rarely mentioncontext and process related aspects of their work. For Taiji-beginners, it is very unlikely that they are already familiarwith the special role of a Taiji-teacher in terms of being notonly teacher but also motivator, coach and therapist [ 6]a s they never experienced a Taiji-lesson before. Congruence of both study groups was observed in terms of moderate to high expected and appraised improvementsin stress management in response to regular Taiji practice.Our quantitative data shows that a lower educational level predicted higher stress-management-related expectations inTaiji-beginners. This might be due to the fact that peoplewith a less favorable educational background are a ected more strongly by the presence of various stressors andabsence of multiple resources [ 49] and therefore are more likely to express higher stress-management-related expecta-tions. Personal resource factors such as mindfulness and self-compassion are regarded as stress protective trait character-istics [ 50,51]. Therefore, it may be speculated, that subjects with low scores in these two variables have a higher needfor improvements in stress management and that this needinfluences stress-management-related expectations. Notably,in this study we have also assessed self-reported mindfulnessand self-compassion scores in all study participants atbaseline examination [ 52]. Indeed, our explorative analysis revealed that there are signicant correlations ofthe score of ( r= 0.17;P=0.15). Hence, our data partially support a potential association between lower levels of personal resource factors and a higher level of stress-management-related expectations. Forthe Taiji teachers interestingly, a shorter teaching experiencepredicted more optimistic teachers' appraisals regardingimprovement in stress management. As more experiencedteachers are believed to have larger teaching experiencewith advanced Taiji students, they therefore might perceivebenecial e ects in long-term Taiji-practitioners as more pronounced than in beginners. Hence, our nding might beexplained by a broader frame of reference employed by themore experienced Taiji teachers. Our study results provide information with practi- cal relevance. Considering the self-conrming nature ofexpected treatment responses [ 25-28], our data suggest that Taiji-beginners are likely to foster mental well-beingand enhance stress management by implementing theiracquired Taiji-related knowledge and skills in their everydaylives. In fact, we have observed decreased psychobiologicalreactivity to psychosocial stress [ 22] and enhanced levels of mindfulness and self-compassion [ 52]i ns u b j e c t si nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 the Taiji group compared to subjects in the waiting-list control group. However, as explorative analyses revealed,these e ects have not been found to be directly modulated by stress-management related expectancies (data not shown).Potential synergistic e ects of beginners' expectations with other treatment components such as teacher's appraisals on treatment outcomes should be subject of future research. Since beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals di er in several points, we recommend Taiji teachers to proactivelyask their new students about their course expectations andto inform them about potential benets of regular Taijipractice early in the course. This can prevent students fromdisappointment due to clinging to inadequate expectanciesand helps them to modify their expectations towards greatercongruence with teachers' appraisals of potential benets aTaiji beginner course may o er. Also teachers might adapt their courses to respond to their students' needs more e ec- tively. Such congruence in turn would be likely to enhancethe working alliance and to increase beginners' coursesatisfaction and course adherence. Despite this reasoningbeing highly plausible, our data do not allow to draw anyconclusion about the impact of the observed incongruencebetween beginners' expectations and teachers' appraisalson the outcomes of the Taiji courses or the beginners'and/or teachers' course satisfaction. Still our ndings mayprovide information of practical relevance: Since Taiji is notcommonly practiced among health care professionals [ 53], our data collected from 136 Taiji teachers provides valuableinsights into potential benets of Taiji-beginners courses thatmight be helpful for health care professionals for their own as well as for their patients' information. The following limitations need to be addressed. First, Taiji-beginners were not students of the investigated teachers;thus we were not able to assess the degree of workingalliance between both study groups. For the same reasona potential negative influence of the mismatch betweenbeginners' expectations and teachers' appraisals on course-related outcome values could not have been investigated.Secondly, the results of Taiji-beginners' expectations arerestricted to healthy young to middle-aged and predom-inantly well-educated participants. People with functionallimitations should be included in future studies, as thispopulation is regarded to represent a large proportion of allTaiji practitioners [ 54]. Third, because our survey of Taiji- beginners was nested within a trial examining e ects of Taiji on psychobiological stress reactivity, this circumstance mighthave influenced stress-management-related expectations ofour Taiji novices. Therefore, we recommend for futurestudies in this eld to investigate Taiji-beginners and theircorresponding teachers under naturalistic conditions. In addition to the above-mentioned practical impli- cations of our ndings, the main strengths of this studyare the consideration and comparison of both beginners'expectations as well as teachers' appraisals, the combination of qualitative and quantitative data assessment, which allows us to provide an overview of general as well as more speci-cally stress-management-related expectations and appraisals.Moreover, a relatively large population of active Taiji teachershas participated in our survey.5. Conclusion The results of our study increase the awareness of andknowledge about the nature of expectancies and appraisalsin Taiji-beginners practice. We have found that educationalbackground, the level of self-compassion, and teachingexperience are involved in shaping stress-management-related expectations and appraisals. The impact of students'expectations, teachers' appraisals, and the interaction of bothon treatment outcomes of Taiji interventions remains to befurther investigated.

Auricular acupressure is widely used in complementary and alternative medicine to reduce body weight, but little is known about the e ects of auricular acupressure on body weight parameters in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the e ects of auricular acupressure on body weight parameters in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Eighty-six inpatients with schizophrenia were recruited from chronic wards in a psychiatric center. The participants were randomly divided into experimental (acupressure at 4 acupuncture sites: hunger, stomach, shenmen and endocrine) and control groups, and body weight parameters were determined weekly for 8 weeks. There was no signicant di erence between the experimental and control groups in mean body weight, waist circumference, or body fat percentage at the pretest or during the entire 8-week study period.Therefore, auricular acupressure did not cause body weight reduction in patients with chronic schizophrenia. 1. Introduction Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with a chronic course. The diagnosis of schizophrenia, excluding schizoa ective or mood disorder, substance use or general medical condition, and pervasive developmental disorder, is dened by theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,4th Edition (DSM-IV) as the presentation of positive and negative symptoms for 1 month (or less if successfully treated) and deterioration of interpersonal and occupational relations for6 months [ 1]. The positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disor-ganized or catatonic behavior, and the negative symptoms include a ective flattening, alogia, social withdrawal, and the lack of spontaneity. Patients with schizophrenia have an increased prevalence of obesity and unfavorable body composition compared with the general population [ 2-4]. The prevalence of obesity among patients with schizophrenia is increasing each year [5-9].Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease [ 10-16]. Obesity also has become a major concern in the treatmentof mental disorders because it may adversely a ect treatment adherence and relapse rates [ 17,18]. Furthermore, obesity is associated with reduced quality of life [ 19], social stigma [ 20], and greater morbidity and mortality [ 21]. The United States National Institute of Mental Health convened a meeting in October 2005and concluded that obesity among individuals with mentaldisorders has not received adequate research attention [ 22]. Auricular acupressure is a simple, self-manipulated treat- ment method that applies vaccaria seeds or steel beads to the ear to stimulate auricular acupoints. It is widelyused in complementary and alternative medicine to reducebody weight, but little is known about its e ect on weight reduction. Previous animal studies suggest that stimulationof the auricular regions is associated with the ventromedialhypothalamus, which a ects the satiety center and leads to weight loss [ 23]. Needle point stimulation on auricular2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 86 subjects who met inclusion criteria (41 men, 45 women) Assigned with stratied randomization into 2 groups according to wards Experimental group ( n=43) Auricular acupressure (vaccaria seeds with surgical tape), 10 withdrew: (7 discharged from hospital; 3 did not tolerate acupressure) Subjects who completed the 8-week program ( n=33)4 withdrew: (3 discharged from hospital ; 1 referred to acute ward) Subjects who completed the Statistical analysisControl group ( n=43) Surgical Tape only, twice weekly for 8 weekstwice weekly for 8 weeks 8-week program ( n=39) Figure 1: Study flowchart. acupoints may increase the secretion of ghrelin, which is a peptide hormone that induces satiation and is inverselyrelated to caloric intake [ 24]. The purpose of this controlled, single-blind study with stratied random sampling was toexplore the e ects of auricular acupressure on body weight parameters, including body weight, waist circumference, andbody fat percentage, in patients with chronic schizophrenia. 2. Methods The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee ofthe Tsao-Tun Psychiatric Center Institutional Review Board(TTPC IRB99002) in February 2010, and carried out incompliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Volunteerswere recruited through posters placed in chronic psychiatricwards, all of them were hospitalized Chinese schizophreniapatients. Protocol contents were thoroughly explained toeach patient by the investigator. Patients were told that theycould withdraw from the study anytime if they were not willing to continue. After patients and their families agreedand signed the informed consent forms, the patients weregiven the \"precautions for auricular acupressure for weightreduction\" and related health education pamphlets. There were 86 patients (41 men [48%] and 45 women [52%]) who were recruited and assigned by stratiedrandomization according to the wards. Each patient was assigned a sequence number according to the medical record number, and then random numbers were obtained from arandom number table to divide the patients into 2 groups(43 patients in each group): (1) experimental auricularacupressure group and (2) control group ( Figure 1 ). During the study period, patients maintained their normal daily lives and were not required to manage diet and exercise themselves to control weight. Inclusion criteria were meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, staying in a chronic psychiatric ward for >2Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Table 1: Standards for reporting interventions in clinical trials of acupuncture (STRICTA 2010).

Experimental Design. The participants were randomly divided into a treatment and a control group, that mea-surements would take place weekly and that pre- andposttreatment data would be compared. T o improve data objectivity, auricular acupressure was performed and main outcome measures were determinedby di erent persons. There were 6 sta members who were responsible for collecting e ect indicators. T o increasereliability of data collection, the interrater agreement on waist circumference was assessed from March 8 to 12, 2010;after 6 raters measured 20 patients for waist circumference,the interrater reliability of the results were computed byPearson correlation analysis. Through communication andtraining, the interrater reliability reached 0.95 to 1.0 among the 6 raters. The weight control program was conducted over 9 weeks (including one pretest and 8 subsequent tests, at 1-weekintervals); the follow-up time between the 2 groups wasconducted as follows for the e ect indicators: (1) body weight and waist circumference were measured weekly 9times in a time series, including once at 1 week before theintervention and weekly through the rst to the eighth weeksafter the intervention; (2) body fat percentage was measuredonly 1 week before the intervention and at 8 weeks after theintervention. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1 . 2.2. Auricular Acupressure Group. Auricular acupressure was performed by a licensed acupuncturist, who had 540 hoursof acupuncture training before participating in the trial.The checklist of consolidated standards of reporting trials(CONSORT) was complete [ 25]. The complete details of the intervention are presented in Table 1 in conformance to standards for reporting intervention in clinical trials ofacupuncture (STRICTA 2010) [ 26]. Auricular acupressure was given twice weekly for 8 weeks; auricular acupressure was administered to each ear and left in place for 3 and 4 consecutive days alternately. Vaccar ia seeds with Surgical Tape (3M, Taiwan) were applied at 4 acupuncture points,including the hunger, stomach, shenmen, and endocrinepoints on the ear. Acupuncture points were selected basedon previous studies and clinical experience. Patients wereinstructed to press on the Vaccaria segetalis plaster at each acupuncture point before consuming each of 3 meals everyday (4 minutes total, 1 minute for each acupuncture pointuntil the ear had a burning sensation). Compliance with self-pressure at the acupuncture points was monitored with 2methods: (1) nursing sta of the chronic psychiatric wards reminded and monitored patients while they pressed theacupuncture points at morning, noon, and evening mealsand (2) researchers provided a form on which each patientrecorded the time of self-application of acupressure. 2.3. Control Group. In the control group, Surgical Tape was applied twice weekly, for 3 and 4 consecutive days,for 8 weeks. Selected acupuncture points were the same asthose for the AA group, but only Surgical Tape was applied and no points were pressed. The contact moment was just comparable to that in the AA group. The same acupuncturistapplied the Surgical Tape in the control group. 2.4. Body Composition Measurement. Inpatients received controlled meals from the central kitchen in the hospital.Body weight and waist circumstance were measured 2 hoursafter dinner. A night snack and drink were served 2.5 hoursafter dinner. All patients had weight parameters measuredbefore having the night snack and drink.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 2: Comparison of control variables and dependent categorical variables between the two groups.

For the measurement, patients were asked to wear only underwear. The scale precision was calculated as \u00b10.1 kg. The BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by thesquare of height in meters. The measuring tape was placedaround the waist at the level of the umbilicus. The tape was held horizontally and close to the skin without disturbing breathing. At the end of expiration, the waist circumferencewas measured with a precision of \u00b10.1 cm. Body fat percentage was measured 2 hours after meals with a body fat analyzer, based on bioelectrical impedanceanalysis (Type Tanita-519, Japan). Patients were asked tourinate before measurement. 2.5. Statistical Analysis. Data were entered in an Excel worksheet and were analyzed with SPSS Statistical Software(version 14.0) (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), for descriptivestatistics (percentage, mean, standard error, and 95% con-dence interval) and analytical statistics (chi-square test,ANOV A, and generalized estimation equation; GEE) [ 27].3.

There was no di erence between the AA group and control groups in mean body height, age, disease duration,age at onset of schizophrenia, or length of hospitalization (Table 3 ). In waist circumference and body weight, there was no signicant di erence between the 2 groups at pretest (week 0), and no signicant di e r e n c ef r o mw e e k1t o8c o m p a r e d with week 0 in the control group, and no signicantdierence between the slopes of AA group and control group f r o mw e e k1t ow e e k8( T a b l e s 4and 5). No signicant dierences were shown in body fat percentage between the two groups at pretest; no signicant di erences were found between pre- and posttest body fat percentage in the controlgroup. During the study, 10 experimental patients withdrew from the study; 7 patients refused to continue and 3 patientscould not perform the auricular acupressure or reliablyrecord a treatment form. 4 control patients withdrew fromthe study; 3 patients refused to continue and 1 patient wasreferred to an acute ward because of relapse of psychosis. 3 experimental patients and 1 control patient experi- enced skin itch after applying plasters on the ear for 2-4days. The symptom improved and disappeared completelyafter sticking the plaster on the contralateral ear. And no onewithdrew the study because of skin itch. 4. Discussion The present study showed that auricular acupressure didnot reduce body weight parameters signicantly in patientswith chronic schizophrenia. All participants were inpatients,and factors relating to diet, and activity level were bettercontrolled than in outpatient studies. It had been suggestedthat auricular acupressure may stimulate the sympatheticnervous system, and cause a temporary increase in basalmetabolic rate and decrease in appetite that would resolveafter the second week [ 28]. The failure of auricular acupres- sure to decrease body weight may be a result of the e ects of antipsychotic medication. These drugs were required fortreatment, and 80% patients treated with antipsychotic med-ication experience gain [ 29]. fewer extrapyramidal adverse reactions than rst-generation antipsychotics, but they increase body weight and risk of comorbidities suchas hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke[30,31]. For example, weight gains for patients treated with Clozapine, Olanzapine, and Risperidone were 4.5, 4.2,and 2.1 kg, respectively, over 10 weeks of treatment [ 32]. Additional studies showed that the use of Aripiprazole for1 year caused a mean weight gain of approximately 1 kg [ 33]. The American Diabetes Association reported that Cloza- pine and Olanzapine were associated with the greatestpotential for weight gain, with evidence of increased risk ofdiabetes and dyslipidemia. Risperidone was associated with6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 5: Comparison of intervention e ects between the two groups.

Aripiprazolewas associated with minimal weight gain, with no evidence ofrisk for diabetes and dyslipidemia [ 34]. A review of Zotepine studies reported a mean body weight gain of 3.6 kg and that28% of Zotepine-treated patients experienced body weight gain [ 35]. There were limited published data examining the possible association between Zotepine therapy and thedevelopment of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia.A pooled analysis of data reported an estimated meanEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 weight gain of 0.8 kg with Amisulpride after 10 week of treatment [ 35], this limited weight gain potential predicts that Amisulpride may be associated with a low risk ofadverse metabolic events. The mechanisms may be relatedto several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, histamine,and dopamine and the adrenergic and muscarinic systems [36,37]. In addition to medical treatment, all patients received supportive psychotherapy, family therapy, and a series ofcurriculums on psychiatric rehabilitation, including socialskills training, self-care training, and psychoeducation ondrug compliance. Referring to dropouts and withdrawals it has to be mentioned that the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival conflictedwith the study schedule, 7 patients in the AA group and3 patients in the control group were discharged for familygathering. 3 patients in the AA group could not performthe auricular acupressure or record the form by themselvesreliably, possibly due to cognitive function decline caused bythe mental illness. There was one patient in the control group who withdrew from the study due to flare up of psychosis ( Figure 1 ), and was transferred from chronic psychiatric ward to acutepsychiatric ward which was not related to the use of SurgicalTape. It happens frequently in the chronic psychiatric wardand previous studies have revealed that signicant predictorsfor the relapse of schizophrenia are the number of previoushospitalizations and the number of di erent antipsychotics previously used [ 38]. The ear skin itch was related to the use of the Surgical Tape, for it happened in both AA group and control group. According to the classication of WHO's Adverse ReactionT erminology (WHO-ART) [ 39], the adverse reaction was classied as time-related type. The symptom improvedand disappeared after sticking the Surgical Tape on thecontralateral ear. We chose the Surgical Tape due to its highviscosity, preventing the tape from sliding o the ear. It is suggested that future studies should consider both theviscosity and antianaphylaxis before performing auricularacupressure. The traditional Chinese medicine syndrome, a prole of symptoms and signs, is important for understandinghuman homeostasis and guiding the application of Chineseherbs and acupuncture [ 40]. Damp stasis syndrome (excess) and Qi deciency syndrome (deciency), are commonsyndromes in obese patients. The excess syndrome includesaccumulation or stagnation of metabolic waste, body fluids,and blood, and the deciency syndrome includes weaknessand the deciency of nutrients [ 40]. Depending on the symptoms and signs, di erent patients may be given di erent traditional Chinese medicine treatments, even when theyhave the same clinical diagnosis. Future studies may includeauricular acupressure according to the di erentiation of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and the needs of each patient. In the present study, we adopted random assignment by wards primarily to control the 2 confounding factors, dietand exercise, which could greatly a ect body weight. The diets in each ward were similar, and it was assumed thatsimilar diet and exercise frequency or intensity were a feature of all the wards. Other confounding factors such as sex, age,and medications were controlled. Limitations of the present study included the small sample size, which enabled only 2 study arms, and a shamgroup was not included. Furthermore, the antipsychotic medication were classied only as typical (rst generation) and atypical (second generation) drug therapies. The single-blind study design could not be extended to a double-blinddesign because the AA group patients could easily becomeaware that the seeds of Vaccaria segetalis were contained in the plaster when they performed acupressure. Furthermore,the baseline BMI in the rst intervention episode could notbe obtained retrospectively. 5. Conclusion Auricular acupressure had no demonstrated e cacy in con- trolling body weight and waist circumference in patients withchronic schizophrenia. Applying the principles of traditionalChinese medicine, future studies may evaluate auricularacupressure according to the di erentiation of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and each subject's individual needs.
