When you take time to make yourself a soothing cup of herbal tea, you are allowing yourself to go within. You soften your thoughts and begin to hear the voice of your intuition. The Art of Spiritual Tea Making In our current convenience-focused age, many just grab a tea bag and pop it into a cup of hot water. This instant tea is really just flavored water. If you want to gain all the spiritual benefits that a [healing herbal infusion](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/he-shou-wu-fo-ti-benefits-spiritual/) has to offer, you need to take some time in preparing it. Tea is best made in a closed vessel\u2014either a teapot or a cup with a small saucer placed on top to serve as a lid. When you brew tea this way, you allow the beautiful aromatic qualities to recirculate back into the liquid. You know that uplifting fragrance emanating from peppermint tea? Well, that represents most of the spiritually healing herbal oils floating off into the atmosphere. If you brew it in a teapot or cup with a lid, the steam condenses back into the infusion. For most herbal teas and for maximum spiritual benefit to be had, you'll want to brew it for at least five minutes in boiling water. You can allow your tea to brew longer and get an even more potent [spiritually activating herbal infusion](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/gotu-kola-benefits-of-the-herb-of-enlightenment/). A general rule is one teaspoon of herb per cup of water, plus one extra for the teapot. So if your teapot holds two cups of water, you would add three teaspoons of herb.

Where it may take others three to four weeks to observe a change, you might see improvements in just a matter of days. You understand that what you eat changes your entire energy. You've noticed that you can't handle certain foods or drinks because they just don't agree with your delicate body. So, before you dive into high doses of [spiritual herbs](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/shilajit-benefits-ancient-superfood/), check in with your intuitive feelings. Herbal medicines come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, teas, liquid extracts, and tinctures. Whichever form you choose, please ensure it's sourced from a reliable company, sustainably harvested, and organic or wild-crafted. This will give you the best results, as well as the highest energy and spiritual activation. Any form of spiritual herb will have a healing influence, yet there is something especially powerful about a liquid. When you take a tincture, it brings through the energy and vibration of the spiritual plant. Add the appropriate dose to a small glass of water. The amount of water isn't important as long as you drink the entirety. If you are on any other medications or have preexisting health concerns, please always check with your health-care practitioner before starting any herbal medicines. Spiritual Herbs to Support Your Hand Chakras There are a number of herbal medicines that can help stimulate the eccrine glands and your hand chakras in a supportive way. Don't worry\u2014taking these herbs won't mean you'll suddenly be dripping in sweat. The wisdom of nature connects with your body and determines what healing you need right now. If your sweat glands are blocked or sluggish, these herbs can help stimulate and awaken them. If they're fine, these spiritual herbs nourish and support you more generally. Elder (Sambucus nigra) Elder (Sambucus nigra) is available in two forms\u2014the berry and the flower. Elderberry is an excellent antiviral.

As your blood spreads through the superficial layers of your skin, it clears the eccrine glands. The ginger carries with it the nutrition that's available to your body. Think of it like a courier transporting your vitamins and minerals to the locations that need them most. Along with this nutrition, your energy also flows through the same path. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the blood and [energy/vital force](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/qigong-exercises-healing-energy/) follow one another.
