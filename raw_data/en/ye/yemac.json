[7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 11 Section II Program's Performance Measurement and Progress This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures your e nrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. Section IIB captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Unduplicated Number Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these changes (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in autom atically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complete this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and th en refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data.

Please explain any factors that may account for enrollment increases or decreases exceeding 10 percent. [7500] 2. The tables below show trends in the number and rate of uninsured children in your state. Three year averages in Table 1 are based on the Current Population Survey. The single year estimates in Table 2 are based on the American Community Survey (ACS). CARTS will fill in the single year estimates automatically, and significant changes are denoted with an asterisk (*).If your state uses an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children, please explain in Question #3.

Please explain any activities or factors that may account for increases or decreases in your number and/or rate of uninsured children. [7500] Ohio suspended renewals for most CFC/MAGI enrollees in 2014 and did not resume until 2015. The impact of Medicaid expansion in Ohio is reflected by the increase in enrollment in 2015. The decline in enrollment started in 2017 and extended into 2019. This decline followed a pause in Medicaid's eligibility renewal process as the new Ohio Benefits eligibility system was implemented. While these factors alone do not entirely capture the dynamics of Medicaid enrollment, the decline is a natural extension of the renewal process and an improving economy over the same time period. For more information on changes in Medicaid en rollments over time, please see medicaid.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Resources/JMOC/Child -Caseload -White -Paper.pdf CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 13 B. Please note any comments here concerning ACS data limitations that may affect the reliability or precision of these estimates. [7500] 3. Please indicate by checking the box below whether your state has an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuri ng the change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. Yes (please report your data in the table below) No (skip to Question #4) Please report your alternate data in the table below. Data are required for two or more points in time to demonst rate change (or lack of change). Please be as specific and detailed as possible about the method used to measure progress toward covering the uninsured. Topic Description Data source(s) Ohio Family Health Survey (1998 -2010)/ Ohio Medicaid Assessment Surv ey (2012, 2015, 2017) Reporting period (2 or more points in time) 1998, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 Methodology Phone Sample Population (Please include ages and income levels) Ohio Residents (households) Sample for two or more points in time Children with insurance at any time in the past significance of results See Below A. Please explain why your state chose to adopt a different methodology to measure changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. [7500] The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) uses the Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey (OMAS), previously known as the Ohio Family Health Survey (OFHS), as an additional source of data. Since this survey is not administered yearly, it does not supplement the use of the Current Population Survey or ACS However, due to its size and scope, it validates the Current Population Survey and ACS and provides additional information for policy planning. B. What is your state's assessment of the reliability of the estimate? Please provide standard errors, conf idence intervals, and/or p -values if available. [7500] The OMAS is significantly larger in sample size compared to the CPS. The sample and weighting are more representative of Ohio's population. The 1998 OFHS had a standard error of 0.5% with a 95% lower and upper CL at 93.4% and 95.3% respectively. The 2004 OFHS had a standard error of 0.2% with the 95% lower and upper CL at 96.7% and 97.3% respectively. The 2008 OFHS had a standard error of 0.2% with the lower CL at 96.7% and the upper CL at 97.0%. The 2010 OFHS CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 14 had a standard error of 0.5% with a 95.0% lower and upper CL at 95.9% and 97.9%, respectively. The 2012 OMAS had a standard error of 0.3% with a 95% lower and upper CL at 96.3% and 97.4%, respectively. The 2015 OMAS had a standard error of 0.13% with a 95% lower and upper CL at 98.5% and 99.0%, respectively. The 2017 OMAS had a standard error of 0.22% with a 95% lower and upper CL at 96.0% and 96.9%, respectively. C. What are the limitations of the data or estimation methodology? [7500] The most sig nificant limitation is that this survey cannot be produced annually. D. How does your state use this alternate data source in CHIP program planning? [7500] ODM has used this alternative data source to better understand the uninsured population and to estima te the fiscal impact for projected growth and new programming. This information has also been made available to others through a dynamic data analytics platform such as Tableau for analysis and academic inquiry. Communities are also able to access the data through a website for grant writing purposes. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIA below. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 15 Section IIB: State Strategic Objectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your state with an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for rep orting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2017 and FFY 201 8) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now hav e data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 2019 ). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appro priate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Ch ild Core Set reporting migrated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to repo rt up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For eac h goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 16 New/revised : Check this box if you have revised or added a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing : Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued : Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. C. Status of Data Reported: Please i ndicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way befor e you finalize them for FFY 2019 . Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: C heck this box if the data you are reporting a re considered final for FFY 2019 . Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report: Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the data. D. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventa tive care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. In this section, for each goal, please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., wer e the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must b e completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2016). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification . \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification ha s been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enroll ment, please indicate whether you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the two were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the ot her source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please explain the source. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 17 F. Definition of Population Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of prevent ative care, please Check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the C HIP population only, or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing repor ting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report information on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the states and over time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to exp lain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae use d to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. H. Date Range: available for 201 9 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"F rom\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \"To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 18 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to cal culate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state -level rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states c alculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delivery systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state co mbines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progress: The in tent of this section is to allow your state to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollee s, and relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rat es. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement p lans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 20 20, 202 1 and 202 2. Based on your recent performan ce on the measure (from FFY 2017 through 201 9), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuating over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data o r the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases in subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to th e objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet future objectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such a s data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM)'s Quality Strategy serves as a framework for communicating Ohio's approach to ensuring that individuals have timely access to high quality services in a coordinated, cost -effective manner that ultimately contributes to the improved health of our population. ODM's strategy delineates the complexity of t he populations served and utilizes a person -centered approach to meet health needs within the context of community, supporting sustainability through actionable data linked to how care is financed through Value -Based Purchasing (VBP). See ODM's to improve quality are consistent with the HHS National Quality Strategy and focus on reliably delivered, proven interventions to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions within the context of family. ODM is fostering greater transparency in quality and cost of care through the continued implementation of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's (CMMI's) payment innovation models, as well as the ongoi ng improvements through Ohio Medicaid's Managed Care Plans (MCPs). ODM's Value Based Purchasing initiatives include Ohio's Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) Program that builds upon Patient Centered Medical Home infrastructures with operational effectivenes s in driving the population health outcomes summarized in Figure1. The episodes of care (EOC) is another example of implementing alternative payment models with specific clinical areas of focus designed to improve systems of care. 1. VBP Initiatives a. CPC Program Ohio CPC is an investment in Ohio's primary care infrastructure that is accompanied by a financing methodology intended to support improved population health outcomes by attributing members to specific providers. This process allows every Medica id member to participate in population health improvement, even if the individual does not actively seek care. CPC is anchored in team -based care with transparency in health care data that creates population risk - tiering to guide more effective, holistic care. In addition to the traditional FFS payment structure, practices are paid a tiered per -member -per-month (PMPM) for a cluster of activities associated with ideal care and for meeting both efficiency and quality metric targets. b. Episodes of Care Ohio's Episodes of Care program initially launched with 43 episodes or bundles of care that cover a diverse array of conditions and procedures. While these are in various stages of implementation, 18 are currently tied to financial incentives. Initial resul ts from the program suggest a positive impact on cost with no adverse impact on quality. See ODM's website for more information: https://www.medicaid.ohio.gov/Provider/PaymentInnovation 2. Quality Measurement Strategies with MCPs Ohio's work to promote evidence -based prevention and treatment practices at the clinical practice level continues to focus on the performance of our five contracted MCPs which serve the majority of the SCHIP population. Given that most children eligible for Medicaid are enrolled in an MCP, all the MCPs are expected to participate in the State's efforts to meet the associated requirements and outcomes established in the Ohio Medicaid Quality Strategy. MCP performance is evaluated through a system of internal compliance reviews, mo nitoring in key areas (e.g., clinical quality, access, consumer satisfaction), and independent reviews by an external quality review organization (EQRO). Financial penalties and incentives are used for both program compliance and continuous performance imp rovement. The key quality -related performance areas to which MCPs are held accountable includes clinical quality measures, as well as consumer and provider satisfaction ratings. Thresholds are set for clinical performance measures and plans are held acco untable in both incentive and penalty programs. These programs include Quality Withhold, Clinical Quality Measures Financial CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 53 Penalties, and Quality Based Assignments. Key results of the CQMs and Consumer Surveys include: a. HEDIS Clinical Performance Measures Primary Care, Well -Care and Behavioral Health: HEDIS measures specific to primary care, well -care and behavioral health for children and adolescents are used to monitor and evaluate MCP performance. Financial penalties are applied for measure results that do not meet minimum performance thresholds that are designed to ramp up over a period of time. For children receiving comprehensive preventive well -care visits, the percent of children in the first 15 months of life who received 6 or more visits increased from 57.9% in FFY 2018 to 59.1% in FFY 2019. Well-care visit rates for children ages 3 thru 6 increased from 71.2% to 72.2%. Well-care visit rates for adolescents remained relatively unchanged, with 51.0% received care in FFY 2018 and 50.8% in FFY 2019. The percent of children receiving at lea st one primary care service decreased slightly from FFY 2018 to FFY 2019 for all age groups with decreases ranging from 0.2% to 1.5%. The changes by age group are as follows: 94.6% to 94.4% for the 12 -24 month age group, 87.2% to 86.4% for 25 months to 6 years. 90.9% to 89.4% for 7 to 11 years, and 90.7% to 89,2% for 12 to 19 years. Behavioral health measures for children and adolescents on antipsychotics focused on medication management and related psychosocial services. For children and adolescents ages 1 to 17 years, 3.5% were on two or more concurrent antipsychotic medications in FFY 2018, with performance improving to 3.4% for FFY 2019. Use of psychosocial care for children and adolescents on antipsychotics, ages 1 to 17 years, improved more signific antly from 75.1% in FFY 2018 to 78.3% in FFY 2019. In comparison to the national Medicaid HEDIS percentile, Ohio ranked in the 25th -50th percentiles for both access to PCP for children in all age groups as well as for Well -Care visits for children age 15 months to 6 years and adolescents. The use of two or more concurrent antipsychotic medications also ranked in the 25 -50th percentile, but the use of psychosocial care for youth on antipsychotics ranked above the 90th percentile. b. CAHPS Annual CAHPS sur veys are used to collect information on members' experiences with their health plans' care and services. Survey results are used to evaluate MCP performance, identify opportunities for quality improvement, aid consumers in plan selection, and increase prog ram transparency through public reporting. From 2018 to 2019, mean scores for the Ohio Medicaid general child population improved for 7 of the 9 core survey measures, with one score remaining unchanged (specifically the Rating of Health Plan). Compared to 2019 national Medicaid percentiles, the Ohio Medicaid Managed Care Program's performance for the general child population was good to excellent for 7 of the 9 core survey measures. The mean scores for the Rating of Health Plan and Getting Care Quickly mea sures were between the 25th and 50th percentiles, indicating opportunity for improvement in performance. Areas of good performance (above the 50th percentile) included Rating of All Health Care, Rating of Personal Doctor and Specialist Seen Most Often. Customer Service and Getting Needed Care ranked above the 75th percentile, while the areas of excellent performance above the 90th percentile included How Well 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] A. Quality Withhold (QW) Program Beginning in CY 2018, ODM phased in a Quality Withhold (QW) incentive system using Quality Indices to measure the effectiv eness of the Ohio Medicaid managed care plans' (MCPs) population health management strategy. Quality indices align with the population streams and incentives are awarded to MCPs based on improved plan performance as evaluated by multiple CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 54 measures for each index. The 'Healthy Children' index performance measures include 'Well - Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life, 'Well -Child Visits in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th Years of Life,' 'Adolescent Well -Care Visit's', and 'BMI percentile documentation for children and adolescents'. The children and adolescent well care visit measures are included in the QW incentive system for calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020, with the BMI measure also included for 2019 and 2020. The 'Behavioral Health (BH)' index also includ es measures for the child and adolescent populations. For calendar year 2018, BH index measures included the 'Initiation of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependence (AOD) Treatment' (to include adolescents age 13 and older), 'Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness (MH Follow -Up) 7 -day visit' (to include children and adolescents ages 6 and older) and two measures specific to children and adolescents: 'Use of First-Line Psychosocial Care for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics' and 'Use of Multi ple Concurrent Antipsychotics in Children and Adolescents'. It should be noted that for CY 2018 and 2019, the AOD and Follow -Up measures included, but were not limited to, children and adolescents. The calculated rates were for the overall measure populati on, including adults. In order to incentivize more focused performance improvement on the children and adolescent segments of the behavioral health population stream, an 'Engagement of AOD Treatment' measure specific to adolescents (ages 13 -17) and a 'MH Follow -Up' visit measure for children and adolescents (ages 6 -17) are being added to the Behavioral Health QW Index. B. Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) for Kids Providers participating in CPC for Kids will be measured against established thresholds f or the following clinical quality metrics: well -child visits in the first 15 months of life; well -child visits in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th years of life; adolescent well care visits; weight assessment and counseling for nutrition and physical activity for ch ildren and adolescents; lead screenings; immunizations for children, combination 3; and immunizations for adolescents, combination 2. Providers must pass at least half of the metrics for which they have at least 30 patients in the denominator. In additio n, providers must pass at least one of the following metrics: lead screenings; immunizations for children, combination 3; or immunizations for adolescents, combination 2. Providers also will receive information for tobacco cessation for adolescents, and fluoride varnish, but no thresholds or passing rates will be applied to those two metrics. Providers that fail to meet these standards may be disenrolled from the program. C. Community -Based Care Management ODM Infant Mortality Community Partnerships: Infant Mortality Community Partnerships were developed to specifically address the disparities in preterm birth and infant mortality. This effort brought together Ohio's nine counties with the highest disparities, activating communities to address racism , social determinants of health. Some communities are already demonstrating measurable improvements in preterm birth and sleep -related deaths in particular to better understand the issues pertinent at a person level. ODM hosted focus groups of women to lis ten to their pregnancy and postpartum experiences. Women in the Medicaid program expressed distrust in the health systems in general, citing lack of provider empathy and inadequate communication. They also expressed a lack of social supports, community r esources and routine coverage of community services such as doulas and lactation nurses. ODM subsequently embarked upon a person -centered design for a maternal and infant support program. ODM's Multi -System Youth Support Effort: In 2019, ODM partnered wi th the Ohio Department of Job and Families Services which houses Child Protective Services to develop a state -level program to provide technical and financial assistance to children, youth and families with complex multi -system needs. The aim of this progr am is to prevent custody relinquishment of children and youth solely for the purpose of obtaining needed treatment, and to assist local entities with obtaining services that support children and youth who have been relinquished and are transitioning back t o community and/or non -custody settings. In -home and community supports that include intensive care coordination, wraparound services as well as respite or residential (room and board) assistance is supported through this effort in order to fill well -docu mented gaps for Ohio's youth. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 55 1115 Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Waiver: In January 2019, ODM submitted an 1115 Demonstration waiver for Medicaid funded SUD treatment for adults and children. ODM obtained CMS approval on September 24, 2019 and began implementation of this five -year wai ver on October 1, 2019. Conditions of the SUD 1115 waiver require that Ohio Medicaid cover a full continuum of SUD services and assure sufficient provider capacity to meet the treatment needs of Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries with opiate and other substance use disorders. Under the SUD 1115 waiver, ODM will continue to implement and improve multiple interventions and strategies to improve coordination and transition of care for youth and other individuals with SUD. The SUD 1115 Waiver has several monitori ng and evaluation measurement requirements on which ODM has been collaborating on with CMS: mid -point assessment due 12/31/2021; monitoring measures which will be quarterly through 2024 with the monitoring protocol due 2/29/2020; and an evaluation with the design due 3/29/2020; and final evaluation due 8/30/2025. Main areas of measurement (CMS 1115 SUD goals) are: reduced utilization of emergency departments and inpatient hospital settings for treatment where the utilization is preventable or medically in appropriate through improved access to other continuum of care services; increased rates of identification, initiation, and engagement in treatment; increased adherence to and retention in treatment; improved access to care for physical health conditions a mong beneficiaries; reductions in overdose deaths, particularly those due to opioids; and fewer readmissions to the same or higher level of care where the readmission is preventable or medically inappropriate. One additional proposal under Ohio's SUD 111 5 waiver is to extend Medicaid eligibility for new mothers with an SUD diagnosis up to one full year during their postpartum period. Current Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women is limited to 60 days post -partum. Ohio will submit an amendment to our ap proved SUD 1115 waiver to expand Medicaid eligibility for women with a SUD diagnosis from the current period of 60 days to a full year following the birth of their child to align with best clinical practice. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] Each year, ODM selects quality improvement topics that are burgeoning issue s or high priority clinical issues for the Ohio Medicaid managed care population and also reflect our Quality Strategy. ODM's current Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs) include the following: A. ODM has a long -standing preterm birth prevention effort a nchored in the partnership between the agency, the MCPs and the clinicians participating in Ohio's Perinatal Quality Collaborative. While this effort has achieved moderate past success in reducing preterm births (in part linked to identifying candidacy fo r Progesterone use), most recent efforts have focused on simplifying notification of pregnancy risk for more timely intervention for a larger group of women. ODM created and implemented a web -based version of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Form (PRAF 2.0) as a platform for real -time population health management. This application directly links to Ohio's eligibility system to prevent the inadvertent loss of health care coverage during pregnancy and creates links to other maternal and infant supports. Curren t and future efforts are specifically focused on the complex needs of minority populations and communities, mitigating toxic stress and more diligently screening and engaging patients with behavioral health issues (including S) in evidence -based care, supp orting both the mother and infant together in care. B. ODM has continued to partner with Ohio Perinatal Quality Collaborative (OPQC) on the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and the Maternal Opiate Medical Supports Plus (MOMS+) Projects. a. The Neon atal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) Project has been in a sustain phase since2017, holding steady the length of opiate treatment to 14 days and the total duration of newborn hospital stays to 18 days through the continued use os standardized protocols. As more infants are able to be treated with the non -pharmacologic bundle, the effort is shifting to support CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 56 Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) -challenged mothers and their infants outside of hospital settings. At the forefront is a culture of compassion with an emphasis on sustaining care of the mother infant dyad through the first year of the child's life, fostering community connections to family resources including peer supports. b. The Maternal Opiate Medical Supports Plus (MOMS+) quality improvement initiative build s on the Maternal Opiate Medical Supports (MOMS) pilot project which expanded the use of medication assisted treatment (MAT) through an integrated care model that coordinated behavioral health and prenatal care with social supports for opioid -dependent pregnant women. The pilot resulted in greater utilization of behavioral health services including MAT, greater postpartum retention in MAT, and reduced out -of-home placement for program participants compared to a matched sample of opioid dependent pregnant wo men who received treatment as usual. The MOMS+ project launched in 2018 and utilized these integrated sites as the \"hubs\" of a hub -and-spoke model to mentor and support newly engaged outpatient maternity care teams across Ohio. While the hubs are more clos ely associated with the larger tertiary centers where higher risk MAT inductions and other care can be delivered, the spoke sites are supported by stronger local behavioral health and medication assisted treatment programs as well as pediatric practitioner s who can continue care long -term. The mentoring sites also help maternity care providers develop the capacity to provide induction therapy close to home, collaborate with local child welfare, and link to housing and other social service resources in their communities, culminating in more effective plans of safe care as referenced in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). MOMS+ is currently in the early stages of developing best practices for the transition of maternal and infant care to th e community with a longer -term focus on preventive care, specific developmental and infectious -disease -related considerations, parenting and social services support, and continued trauma -informed care. c. Pediatric Comprehensive and Coordinated Behaviora l Health Services In January 2019, ODM launched the Pediatric Comprehensive and Coordinated Behavioral Health Services project to improve behavioral health outcomes for children 0 -5 years of age. The project utilizes quality improvement (QI) processes to evaluate to the effectiveness of preventive behavioral health services at the time of well child checks at three high Medicaid -volume clinic sites affiliated with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The goals are to reduce ER and urgent care ut ilization following a well child care (WCC) visit, to increase adherence to the WCC visit at 6 months of life, and to improve behavioral health outcomes for the target population. To date, WCC at 6 months have improved, but ED utilization seems unaffected as many other variables outside of access to primary care and anticipatory guidance influence ED utilization. Parents have reported improvements in child behaviors as they tried interventions discussed at WCC, but early signals suggest that the \"dose\" of preventive BH services are insufficient to significantly impact BH outcomes. The older the infant becomes, the farther apart the preventive services, which may not be ideal for behavior reinforcement. C. For CYs 2017 to 2019, the quality improvement proj ect chosen to serve as a the federally required and externally validated performance improvement project (PIP) focused on identifying and refining proven strategies to increase hypertension control, particularly for minority populations. Although the PIP t argets adults, it may impact children indirectly by improving the care and health outcomes of their caregivers. D. In CY 2018, ODM began planning its next PIP around reductions in disparities in diabetes control. Like hypertension, the project will impac t children by improving treatment of their caregivers. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performanc e. Please include any analyses or descriptions of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 57 The following are current initiatives targeted at improving the access and quality of health care for the Medicaid child population: A. Research Partnerships One of the many strategies aimed at reducing infant mortality in Ohio has been ongoing research in order to identify risk long before a poor outcome so that prevention strategies could be deployed. ODM worked in conjunction with academic partners on the Infant Mortality Research Partnership to develop predictive modeling for infant mortality and pre -term births in Ohio using data from multiple sources including public health, mental health, education, and child welfare. Analyses examined the clinical, sociodemographic, and area -level patterns and determinants of infant mortality and pre -term births, culmi nating in a comprehensive report and an innovative interactive geospatial dashboard both of which may be useful in implementing place -based strategies. In addition, a web -based risk calculation tool (addressing both infant mortality and pre - term births) wa s developed to aid in shared decision making between clinicians and patients. Efforts are underway to test the integration of the infant mortality risk calculation tool into electronic health record systems (EHRs). Obstetrical clinicians are currently eval uating the impact of this tool on how care is delivered. ODM's research partnerships also developed Opportunity Indices, mapping out the state by census tract along 7 domains of social determinants important to maternal and infant outcomes. This will be u sed for more accurate risk adjustment in the perinatal episode of care as well as for place -based interventions. A Children's Opportunity Index is also under development, highlighting risks for poor outcomes including out -of-home placement. B. Continuing its assertive response to the opioid crisis in Ohio, ODM supported best - evidence treatment guidelines for the utilization of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) by minimizing the administrative barriers to MAT. While some of the MCPs instituted a \"gold carding\" process for high quality providers, the most important action was eliminating prior authorization on all brand and generic forms of oral short acting buprenorphine -containing products, thereby facilitating access to treatment for Medicaid members o f all ages. Other examples of increasing access within the Pharmacy program included the removal of the fibrosis requirement for Hepatitis C treatment as well as the step therapy requirement removal for asthma medications. Also noteworthy, the Department expanded its coverage policy to allow Omnipod, a two -part tubeless insulin system for the management of diabetes, to be covered under the pharmacy benefit. C. Collaborative Partnerships CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 58 1. 1. To demonstrate the administration's commitment to ensure that all children lead meaningful, fulfilling lives, Governor Mike DeWine created the Office of Children's Initiatives in January 2019. This new office was charged with advancing policies related to home visiting, early intervention services, early childhood education, foster care, and child physical and mental health. The budget bill signed in July 2019 allocated funds to support these efforts, allowing ODM to play a critical role in the design and implementation of related initiatives in partnership with ot her state agencies. 2. ODM continues to engage in collaborative efforts with agency partners to improve children's health coverage and inform families about Medicaid enrollment options and available services. The main thrusts continue to include a fo cus on infants and school aged children. In SFY 2018 -2019, Ohio Medicaid wrapped up the Children in the Vanguard Collaboration, the Healthy Students Promising Futures Collaboration, and the Affinity School Based Health Collaboration. These collaborative ef forts provided opportunities to identify innovative outreach methods, employ best practices for increasing Ohio's Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) screening rates, enhance the provision of services in school -based settings, and str engthen policies to support Medicaid services to Ohio's pregnant women and children. 3. Additional collaborations include Ohio's partnership with ODH to increase lead testing and abatement activities, which includes an approved CHIP Health Services Initi ative (HSI). This effort ultimately helps families secure lead -safe housing. ODM is leveraging CPC -kids to improve lead testing and follow -up. ODM also participates in ODH's Ohio Lead Advisory Committee to make recommendations for Ohio's response to lead poisoning, reviewing local, state, and national best practices to prevent lead poisoning. 4. With leadership from the Governor's Office of Children's Initiatives in 2019, Ohio Medicaid began a new collaborative effort with the education and mental health systems to expand access to behavioral health in schools using telehealth technologies. 5. 5. ODM has partnered with Department of Youth Services (DYS) on several initiatives to facilitate direct enrollment of youth under DYS custody into Medicaid. F irst, DYS was provisioned as a Qualified Entity to determine presumptive eligibility for children taken into their custody. DYS identifies any children within a week of release and inputs their information into the Presumptive Eligibility (PE) portal. If approved for PE coverage, an approval letter is printed by the DYS worker and given to the child's parole officer who works with the family to complete a full Medicaid application for the newly released child. The DYS Inpatient Program allows youth under DYS custody to have Medicaid coverage during an inpatient hospital stay. Lastly, if a child is residing in an alternative placement facility and the child is not IV -E eligible Child Welfare, DYS sends a Medicaid application to ODM. If Medicaid eligible, the child is approved for full Medicaid and enrolled in a Managed Care Plan. ODM realizes that even the work with adult populations benefits the children within those families. Future work is focused on reconfiguring data to honor families in stead of individuals to more accurately assess risks of harm in order to implement more effective interventions. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 59 6. Dental Quality Alliance ODM has participated in the Dental Quality Alliance (DQA), a comprehensive multi -stakeholder quality measure deve loper in oral health that is supporting the Medicaid Quality Improvement Learning Academy (MeQILA). ODM is exploring options to improve preventive and treatment services for children as part of this forum that allows peer -to-peer learning. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIB below.

Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . The measure is designed to capture continuity of coverage for a cohort of children in t itle XIX and title XXI for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years, with enrollment status at 6 months being reported in the first reporting ye ar, and 12 and 18 month enrollment status reported in the seco nd reporting year. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, February, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CARTS report. This same co hort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newly identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2 018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or uniqu e identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2019 CARTS report is the second year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identif ied in the second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report, States only reported on lines 1 -4a of the tables. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will be made to lines 1-4a. For the FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2020 (January, February and March of 2020). Instructions : For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in both title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2 018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Simil arly, children enrolled in February 2018 must have birthdates afte r August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must have birthdates after September 2001. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your eli gibility system alr eady has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment crea tes an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month time span) Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2019 report you will enter data on lines 5 -7a related to the 12 -month enrol lment status of children identified on line 1. You will also enter data on lines 8 -10a related to the 18 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or unavailabl e, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and move to the next page . The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" column for that row. And in each column, the d ata within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the tot al in row 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 must sum to row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a child's enrollment status over time, so when data are added or modif ied at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total number of children accounted for in line 1 \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" over the entire 18 month period. Rows numbered with an \"a\" (e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective ro ws. The system will not move to the next section of the report until all app licable sections of the table for the reporting year are complete and sum correctly to line 1.

Managed Care Year Number of Eligibles $885 Enter any Narrative text related to Section IV below. [7500] In Ohio the CHIP program follows a mandatory managed care model. Following Ohio's implementation of managed care Day 1 in January 2018 almost all Medicaid eligibles a re enrolled into a managed care plan during their first month of coverage. However, there is still a minimal fee -for-service component as retroactive and backdated eligibility are paid on a fee -for-service basis. The state of Ohio also makes wrap around p ayments to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and similar entities outside of managed care capitation payments and these payments show up as FFS, inflating the FFS PMPM since the denominator of FFS recipients is small. Note: a) Costs reflected in the Benefit Costs section for managed care and fee for service for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 are net of drug rebates. b) Amounts estimated in the Health Services Initiative line are for lead abatement activities.

For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] During the reporting period Govenor Mike DeWine put children as a top priority of his administration. His commitment to ensure that all children lead meaningful, fulfilling lives was evident by the creation of the Office of Children's Initiatives in January 2019, which was charged with advancing policies related to home visiting, early intervention services, early childh ood education, foster care, and child physical and mental health. The executive budget released in March 2019 and approved in July allocated funds to support these efforts, allowing ODM to play a critical role in the design and implementation of the init iatives as described above. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] From January through July of 2019, ODM was challenged by the budget process but successfully worked with the legislature to keep most of the governor's child -focused initiatives in the final bill. The Ohio Department of Medicaid partnered with key stakeholders such as consumer advocates, providers, payors, and CMS staff to begin the design and implementation of these new initia tives. At the same time ODM worked on budget initiatives, the agency continued to enhance existing programs in order to improve children's outcomes. In brief: CPC was enhanced to bring a focus to kids; the perinatal episode of care was refined to focus on high -risk women; a maternal -infant support program was designed to supplement existing Ohio Department of Health -funded home visiting programs; community infant -mortality partnerships were strengthened and new grants were awarded through the MCPs; an O DM care management and financial support team was developed for foster youth and others with severe behavioral health issues to prevent custody relinquishment; quality measures and incentive structures for the MCPs were adjusted for greater emphasis on yo uth; and a majority of Quality Improvement efforts were focused on children and infants. The development and implementation of these programs simultaneous with aggressive timelines presented administrative challenges. 3. During the reporting period, what ac complishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] a. ODM received early reports of success with the Infant Mortality Community Partnerships. Established 4 years ago, this effort brought together Ohio's nine counties with the highest disparities, ac tivating communities to address racism, social determinants of health and isolation that have particular impact during the critical period of pregnancy. To date, there has been a focus on group education with or without prenatal care (\"Centering\"), home v isiting, utilizing community health workers through the Pathways hub model as well as independently, and a variety of other efforts that include peers, doulas and fathers. Sites have activated neighborhoods and report different improvements including redu ced sleep related deaths, improved connectivity and trust among women, improved breastfeeding rates and reduced preterm births. ODM hosted focus groups to listen to the voices of women in their pregnancy and post -partum experiences. Women in the Medicai d program expressed distrust in the health systems, citing lack of provider empathy and inadequate communication. They also expressed a lack of social supports, community resources and routine coverage of community services such as doulas and lactation nu rses. In order to continue support for community services such as these, ODM released a request for proposals during the reporting period. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 91 b. On August 19, 2019, Governor DeWine announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approv ed Ohio's Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) initiative to enhance and expand Medicaid's lead abatement program in partnership with the Ohio Department of Health (ODH). This approval built on a more limited program that was launched in December 201 7. The Lead CHIP Program enables Medicaid to fund ODH lead hazard control projects in residences in which a Medicaid -eligible child or pregnant woman live or spend significant time (over 6 hours per week), and to remove lead hazards in residential properti es within targeted areas of the state. Ohio plans to eliminate lead in homes in two phases: Phase 1 - focuses on homes with lead hazard control orders issued by ODH or one of its delegated boards of health. These targeted properties are known to have poisoned at least one child. This phase will continue throughout the program. Phase 1 properties will be prioritized over referrals received in Phase 2. Phase 2 - targets primary prevention before a child is poisoned. This phase began implementatio n in June 2019. The focus of Phase 2 is to prevent children and pregnant women from exposure to lead in their environments. c. ODM has continued to invest in the infrastructure of primary care through CPC. CPC has expanded to 250 participating practices participating with nearly 1.4M million members, 680,000 of whom are pediatric. This sets the stage for continued integration of behavioral health services, inclusion and support of schools with successful academic performance as the desired health outcome , special attention to foster youth and others who share a large burden of uncoordinated care. d. ODM phased -in 32 episodes of care that include children since 2015 using a phased -in approach. For 2019, 18 episodes were in the performance year and 25 epi sodes were reporting -only. Episodes focused on children include: i. Neonatal, 3 categories: high -risk, moderate -risk, and low -risk; ii. Asthma; iii. Upper respiratory infection, iv. Pediatric acute lower respiratory infection; v. Otitis media; vi. Oppositional -defiant disorder (ODD). The perinatal episode of care is relevant for infants as well as the proposed reports to obstetrical providers will include neonatal metrics in additional to maternal measures. e. The Care Innovation and Community Improvement Program (CICIP) was implemented in SFY 2019 to rethink care within health systems and bring person -centered focus to prevention and more effective treatment, for opioid use disorder, and extensious to improved care for the maternity and frequent Emergency Department populations. The four health systems are large Medicaid safety -net and academic medical centers that worke d together to develop strategies to optimize care, creating data dashboards to track progress along agreed -upon measures and sharing lessons learned. To date, most of the systems have leveraged their electronic health records to bring different parts of th e health system together, creating alerts and engaging patients. In addition, peer supports and community workers have been deployed effectively, for engagement and connectivity to care, and to support a cultural shift of compassion for those struggling w ith addiction. 4. What changes have you made or are planning to make in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 92 a. Maternal -Infant focus: The Community Infant Mortality and Ohio Perinatal Quality Collaborative (OPQC) Quality Improvement efforts likely will join together as we strive for one hundred percent submission of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Form (PRAF) for pregnant women, creating a real -time database of women in need. Community inclusio n and activism may spur renewed interest in birthing centers that have demonstrated superior patient experiences. Settings of care embedded within a supportive community such as Brigid's Path may be seen as viable alternatives as the positive track record and operational efficiencies improve. Programs that assist the mom/baby dyad through the first year of life will take shape through the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) waiver and other programs supporting moms and infants while ODM addresses workforce constr aints, integrated settings and shared understanding of a holistic family health. b. We are planning to continue to support the infrastructure of Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) as \"home base\" for the care of children and families with the following in itiatives: In 2020, ODM designed an optional CPC for Kids program honoring the importance of prevention in lifelong health. The payment methodology also provides options for bonuses based on levels of full integration of behavioral health to the practic e, accommodating the special needs of foster youth, facilitating or providing school -based services and effectively transitioning youth into adult systems of care. As approximately 680,000 individuals under 21 years of age are attributed to primary care c linicians in this model of care, a \"CPC kids\" infrastructure will set the stage for measurably improving children's health and wellness statewide. ODM hopes that its new telemedicine rules will allow both CPC and non -CPC practices and patients a new avenue to develop and maintain longitudinal relationships as well as provide needed care and therapies in a more convenient manner. This may help bridge the gap that has been developing in rural communities as value -based purchasing arrangement have conso lidated care. Planned changes in ODM's pharmacy program that include a unified Preferred Drug List (PDL) should reduce complexity and promote greater adherence to medications for chronic conditions (e.g. asthma, depression) within populations that CPC pra ctices manage as well. c. Caring for Multi -System Youth through better systems of care that emphasize prevention efforts are a priority. ODM has a more robust Behavior Health system since the 2018 Behavior Health Redesign effort that covers more codes in the new benefit package also carved in to Managed Care. However, workforce issues and gaps are still challenging. The agency's budget allows for a MSY fund targeting existing programs' non -billable services for youth with complex CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 93 needs -including those w ith autism. This, in conjunction with foster system reforms and a state - level care management team should impact custody relinquishment as well as out -of home and out-of-state placements.
