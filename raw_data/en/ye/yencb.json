{"title": "Societal Experts Action Network: Understanding and Communicating Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2013-02-17", "cleaned_text": "Confusing messages about how well COVID-19 vaccines work pose a barrier to public understanding and broad vaccine uptake. When deciding whether to get vaccinated, members of the public may ask, \"Should I take the currently available vaccine or wait for a 'better' one?\" \"Do the differences really matter?\" \"Is my community being treated fairly?\" To answer these questions, public officials at all levels can use clear, consistent, and readily accessible communications to build a shared understanding of vaccine efficacy and promote uptake among vaccine-hesitant populations. This new guidance from the Societal Experts Action Network (SEAN) can help public officials prepare and evaluate their communications efforts around vaccination. For additional information on public engagement and communications strategies for building confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, view SEAN's [earlier guidance](https://www.nap.edu/resource/26068/interactive/index.html). To explain to a diverse public how well the COVID-19 vaccines work, public officials need to explain the concepts of vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness. These rapid expert consultations were produced by [SEAN](https://www.nationalacademies.org/SEAN) (supported by the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation) and the [Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats) (supported by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Science and Technology Policy).
