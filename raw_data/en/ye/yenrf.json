Indian spice intake is also double the world average and healthy cooking oil use such as Mustard, and may also explain it. Inflammation is the foundation for many ailments and challenges the immunity and vital in non-communicable ailments are at the centre stage in an aeing world. Polypehnols are crucial anti-inflammatory chemicals from spices that can for wellbeing and reduce adverse drug rections. We show this using Arthritis- a chronic auto-immune disorder, with the hlep of pharmacokinetic studies. Molecular Docking study was performed on the key bioactive compounds of important spices regarding COX2 active site (PDB ID 5IKR). Piperine in Black Pepper had most stability (Black Pepper, 9.99 Kcal/mol... Plant Science Today Since the ancient time medicinal plants and spices are used as herbal medicine because of their medicinal values. They are the valuable resources of the natural antimicrobial compounds used to treat the infectious disease caused by bacteria and other pathogens. Plant's extract, essential oil and numerous kinds of secondary compounds had antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antioxidants activities with less or no toxic effects; that are essential to cure many diseases. The compounds isolated from the medicinal spice plants show antimicrobial activity against some bacterial strains that has the ability to affect the food quality and shelf life of the food. These plants have various medicinal properties like anti-inflammatory action, tonic, expectorants, diuretics, astringents, digestives, carminative, antibiotics and stimulants etc. The spectrum of compounds present in medicinal spice plants, and the structure of major compounds discussed in this review, are responsible for all of... Antioxidants Spices, condiments and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are crucial components of human history and nutrition. They are substances added to foods to improve flavor and taste. Many of them are used not only to flavor foods, but also in traditional medicine and cosmetics. They have antioxidant, antiviral, antibiotic, anticoagulant and antiinflammatory properties and exciting potential for preventing chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiomyopathy and cancer when used in the daily diet. Research and development in this particular field are deeply rooted as the consumer inclination towards natural products is significant. It is essential to let consumers know the beneficial effects of the daily consumption of spices, condiments and extra virgin olive oil so that they can choose them based on effects proven by scientific works and not by the mere illusion that plant products are suitable only because they are natural and not chemicals. The study begins with the definition of spices, co... 2021 Spices, which is key ingredient in every household products not only used for adding aroma to food but however, has health promoting and protective activity against foreign pathogens. Different spices used in day to day life boosts the immune system that leads to healthy and prosperous life. The commonly used spices not only have antimicrobial or antiviral activity, but also serve as a rich source of various vitamins, minerals, antioxidants etc. The medicinal importance of spices dates from ancient Ayurveda and many studies indicating the potential of spices as immunoboosting agent had been carried out in the recent years. Therefore, this review highlights the medicinal importance of commonly used spices in North-East India as immunobooster against the current coronavirus pandemic. European Journal of Medicinal Plants Presently, our world is suffering with COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS- CoV-2. The high rate of mutation in SARS- CoV-2 helps viruses to become resistance against pre-existent anti-viral medications. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection except some vaccines. Curcumin, Allicin and Gingerol are natural bioactive compounds having anti-viral, anti-inflamatory, anti-pyretic, anti-fibrotic properties and were used as spices in food in South East Asian and Indian subcontinent that could be a potential treatment for COVID-19 disease. This review will help in understanding the biology and potential of bioactive compounds present in turmeric, garlic and ginger as therapeutic against COVID-19 infection. Computational study suggested that gingerol, curcumin, and allicin showed good interaction with proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor of host cell and might have an important role in impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. Clinical trials hav... Bangladesh Pharmaceutical Journal The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been a healthcare disaster because of the unique and distinct characteristics of the pathogen, the easy and rapid transmission of the virus from humans to humans, the challenges in diagnosis and confirmation of the disease and the inability to invent and distribute safe and effective drugs or vaccines worldwide that would work against all the variants of coronavirus. Bangladesh, despite being a third-world country with limited health resources, has not been one of the worst-hit countries in the world but has still suffered with the loss of nearly eleven thousand people. Traditional and herbal remedies have become popular in this sub-continent since long ago and used for the treatment and management of different diseases including infectious disease. In this review, we have summarized the reports of immunostimulating, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and respiratory distress syndrome improving activities of prospective indigenou... 2020 Since 12th December 2019, the epidemic outbreak of an unknown acute respiratory tract infection has emerged in Wuhan City, China The World Health Organization (WHO) discovered that this outbreak was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the extreme acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) No vaccine or no specific anti-viral treatment against COVID-19 has been made available so far Therefore, COVID-19 can be prevented by enhancing the body's immune system and fighting off the symptoms Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) is one of the essential transcription factors in humans which are responsible for the regulation of immune cell, synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression of inflammatory molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) Phytochemicals derived from Indian spices (turmeric, garlic, ginger, etc ) can modulate the gene expression in the NF-B pathway In the midst of pandemic COVID-19, adding spi... India is the land of traditions and religious beliefs that stand proudly next to the global technology. The great sages of India chanted shantih mantra and its echoes have reverberated through centuries. The quest for happiness and success has been the dynamic factor in the course of evolutionary history. It is reflected in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, which conveys that \"May all be free from illness/ disease\" which speaks about Universal health. Ayurveda advocates several non-pharmacological measures that are critical to overall health, including diet, sleep, mental factors, and environmental hygiene. There is a need to decode some of the non pharmacological, prophylactic measures that might sound superstitious to many, but are age-old practices of our ancestors and widely followed. This paper highlights prophylaxis aspects practiced traditionally in different parts of India along with Ayurvedic views and rationale behind these practices. Many age-old practices widely followed by our ancestors to prevent infectious diseases like daily regimens, seasonal regimens, personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, dietary guidelines, immunity boosting measures are relevant even today. British Journal of Medical and Health Research Molecules The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the more general global increase in viral diseases, has led researchers to look to the plant kingdom as a potential source for antiviral compounds. Since ancient times, herbal medicines have been extensively applied in the treatment and prevention of various infectious diseases in different traditional systems. The purpose of this review is to highlight the potential antiviral activity of plant compounds as effective and reliable agents against viral infections, especially by viruses from the coronavirus group. Various antiviral mechanisms shown by crude plant extracts and plant-derived bioactive compounds are discussed. The understanding of the action mechanisms of complex plant extract and isolated plant-derived compounds will help pave the way towards the combat of this life-threatening disease. Further, molecular docking studies, in silico analyses of extracted compounds, and future prospects are included. The in vitro production of antiviral ch...
