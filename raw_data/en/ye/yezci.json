Here are 5 self-care Ayurvedic tips to help your heart feel lighter. [Grief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/grief) and bereavement are natural in the course of life; whether it is because of a death, chronic illness, losing a job, divorce, moving, or any other loss...

According to the root text Ashtanga Hridayam, the unemployed, diseased, or those afflicted by grief should be helped to the utmost extent. Here are some principles of grief management. Grief mainly vitiates [Vata Dosha](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/how-to-balance-vata-dosha-9-tips-for-balancing-your-body-and-mind)(energy principle of air and ether) but any [Dosha](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/balancing-your-health-and-dosha-types)imbalance needs addressing. Grief causes an imbalance in Gunas (qualities of the mind); it could lead to Tamas (lethargy) or aggravate Rajas (restlessness) and healing is achieved through enhancing the natural, clear quality of the mind, Sattva. Ayurveda treats mental health in a holistic way (read more in [this article](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/mental-health-solutions-ayurveda-treats-the-whole-mind-body-complex)) In the management of mental health issues, it employs three treatments; spiritual, rational (diet, lifestyle, formulations, and cleansing therapies), and [Ayurvedic psychotherapy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308955374_Concept_of_Satwavajaya_Chikitsa_Psychotherapy)(Sattvavajaya Chikitsa).

It can also be a cause in ailments like shosha (emaciation), shoka atisara (diarrhea), [vatika prameha](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316415697_THE_ROLE_OF_PSYCHOSOCIAL_FACTORS_IN_THE_AETIOPATHOGENESIS_OF_DIABETES_MELLITUS_MADHUMEHA)(a type of diabetes shokaja unmada (a psychiatric condition similar to PTSD).

While many look for [closure](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201105/grief-isnt-something-get-over) after a loss, he asserts that finding meaning can transform grief into a peaceful, hopeful experience. To quote Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of Art of Living about the loss of a loved one, \"Time will take care of it. If someone you love crosses over, grief overtakes you. But see it from a broader angle; we all have to go one day. Someone has taken an earlier flight and we have to take a later flight. When you see the impermanence of everything, you will gain the strength to overcome grief.\" A way to find meaning and strength is through the comfort of meditation.
