There are various subtypes of the A viruses, and two lineages of the B viruses: Victoria and Yamagata. Influenza virus is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with virus -containing respiratory fluids. Symptoms of influenza include fever, chills, coughing, sore throat or difficulty swallowing, headache, joint and muscle pain, runny nose, dizziness and a loss of appetite. Possible complications include upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections. Pregnant women, premature newborns, the elderly and people with certain chronic diseases are at increased risk of complications from influenza. In Switzerland, influenza results in approximately 112,000 to 275,000 doctor's consultations, several thousand hospitalisations due to complications and several hundred deaths every year . The risk of seasonal influenza infection can be reduced by the use of influenza vaccines.

The available assessment reports and respective product information from these authorities were used as a basis for the e valuation. 5.4 Safety The evaluation of the clinical data of this application has been carried out in reliance on previous regulatory decisions by the EMA and FDA. The available assessment reports and respective product information from these authorities were used as a basis for the evaluation. 5.5 Final Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology Benefit -Risk Assessment Influenza is caused by influenza A and influ enza B viruses. Typical symptoms include fever, chills, coughing, sore throat or difficulty swallowing, headache, joint and muscle pain, runny nose, dizziness and a loss of appetite. Possible complications include upper respiratory tract infections, pneumo nia and secondary bacterial infections. In Switzerland, influenza and its complications result in approximately 112,000 to 275,000 doctor's consultations, several thousand hospitalisations and several hundred deaths every year . BENEFICIAL EFFECTS Baloxavi r marboxil demonstrated efficacy in the prevention of influenza virus infection in study 1719T0834, a randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase 3 study. The study included 749 subjects who were household members of influenza -infected patients who had been symptomatic for 48 hours. They received either baloxavir at the dose approved for treatment of influenza or placebo. Significantly fewer laboratory -confirmed influenza infections were observed in the group who received baloxavir marboxil (1.9%) as compared to the group who received placebo as post -exposure prophylaxis (13.6%). Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 UNCERTAINTIES IN THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS Data on the efficacy and safety of baloxavir in post -exposure prophylaxis are only available from Japanese st udy participants. The efficacy results from study 1719T0834 were extrapolated to non - Asian subjects based on a PK bridging approach . Overall, baloxavir concentrations tend to be higher in Asian adults/adolescent patients compared to those in non -Asian adul ts/adolescent patients. However, this difference in exposure is not expected to impact efficacy and safety in prevention of infection. The data from study 1719 T0834 support efficacy in case of early initiation of prophylaxis (within 48 hours of symptom ons et in the index case and even earlier, within 24 hours, for the majority of subjects) . Efficacy in the case of >48 hours between symptom onset in the index case and Xofluza prophylaxis is unknown. This should be reflected adequately in the information for healthcare professionals. UNFAVOURABLE EFFECTS Baloxavir marboxil was generally well -tolerated and no unexpected safety findings were observed in the PEP study. The incidence of AEs was 22.2% (83/374 subjects, 102 events) in the baloxavir marboxil group and 20.5% (77/375 subjects, 99 events) in the placebo group. The incidence of treatment -related AEs was 1.9% (7/374 subjects, 7 events) in the baloxavir marboxil group and 1.6% (6/375 subjects, 7 events) in the placebo group. The incidence of AEs and treat ment -related AEs was similar between the treatment groups. No deaths were reported. The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, presence of blood in urine, pharyngitis and increased ALT. Presence of b lood in urine, pharyngitis and incr eased ALT were reported more frequently in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group. BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT Based on the demonstrated efficacy in the prevention of influenza infection and the relatively good safety profile, the benefit/ris k assessment for post -exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older is positive. 5.6 Approved Indication and Dosage See information for h ealthcare professionals in the A ppendix.

Patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, complete lactase deficiency or glucose -galactose malabsorption should not use this medicine. This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, i.e. it is almost \"sodium - free\". Product information for human medicinal products 4 / 20 Interactions No clinically significant drug -drug interactions are anticipated between baloxavir marboxil or its active cation -containing products may decrease plasma baloxavir concentrations. Xofluza should not be taken concomitantly with polyvalent cat ion-containing laxatives or antacids, or oral supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calciu m and magnesium. Effects , its active metabolite, baloxavir , did not inhibit any of the following isozymes in the CYP or UGT family in in vitro studies conducted of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in in vitro studies conducted at clinically relevant concentrations. Baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir inhibited the efflux transporter P-glycoprote in (P-gp) in in vitro transporter studies conducted at clinically relevant concentrations. Baloxavir , but not baloxavi r marboxil , inhibited BCRP . Based on in vitro transporter studies, despite a weak in vitro inhibitory potential, baloxavir is not expected to be pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated between baloxavir and active substances which are substrates of these transporters. A single 40 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate . This suggest s that neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir are expected to affect the of co -administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates . A single 80 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a P-gp substrate . This suggest s that neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir are expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of co -administered drugs t hat are P -gp substrates . A single 80 mg dose of the Cmax and substrate , by 18% and 17%, respectively. These decreases are not considered to be clinically meaningful and indicate that neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir are expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of co -administered drugs tha t are BCRP substrates . Product information for human medicinal products 5 / 20 Effects of other drugs on baloxavir marboxil or its baloxavir 1.33 -fold and 1.23 -fold, respectively. These increases are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Probenecid, a UGT enzyme by 21% and 25%, respectively. These decreases are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Immun e response No studies have been conducted on the interaction between influenza vaccines and baloxavir marboxil. A clinical study carried out on naturally acquired and experimental ly induced influenza revealed that treatment with Xofluza had no adverse effect on the normal humoral antibody response to infection. Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy No adequate and well -controlled studies have been con ducted with Xofluza in pregnant women. The potential risk associated with Xofluza in pregnant women is unknown. Animal experiments have not revealed drug-induced reproductive toxicity (see \u00abPreclinical data \u00bb). Xofluza should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus. Product information for human medicinal products 6 / 20 Labo ur and delivery The safe use of Xofluza during labo ur and delivery has not been established. Lactation It is not known whether baloxavir marboxil and its active metabolite, baloxavir, are excreted in human milk. Animal experients have shown that baloxavir marboxil passes into maternal milk (see \u00abPreclinical data \u00bb). A decision should therefore be made on whether to discontinue nursing and to initiate treatment with Xofluza , taking into consideration the potential benefit of Xofluza to the nursing mother and the potential risk to the infant. Fertility No effects were observed on fertility in animal studies conducted with balox avir marboxil (see \u00abPreclinical data \u00bb). Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies have been carried out on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines. Undesirable effects The overall safety profile of Xofluza is based on data from 19 clinical studies . Treatment of Influenza No adverse drug reactions were identified based on pooled data from 3 placebo -controlled clinical studies (studies 1518T0821, 1601T0831 and 1602T0832) carried out in adult and adolescent patients, in which a tota l of 1640 patients were given Xofluza . This includes otherwise healthy adults and adolescents , as well as patients at high risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g. elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory d isease. 1 '334 patients (81.3%) were adults aged 18 to 64 years, 209 patients (12.7%) were adults aged 65 years , and 97 patients (5.9%) were adolescents ( aged 12 to < 18 years). Of these 1'640 patients , 1'440 patients received Xofluza at a dose of 40 mg or 80 mg and 100 patients each received a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg. The safety profile in patients at high risk was similar to that in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents. No adverse drug reactions have been identified in children 1 to < 12 years of age based on one active controlled, double -blind study (CP40563), in which a total of 115 patients received the recommended dosage of Xofluza . Prophylaxis of Influenza Product information for human medicinal products 7 / 20 No adverse drug reactions have been identified based on a placebo -controlle d clinical study (study 1719T0834) in 374 subjects , of which 303 were adult and adolescent subjects 12 years, received Xofluza (see \u00abProperties/Effects, Clinical efficacy, Prophylaxis of Infuenza, BLOCKSTONE (Study 1719T0834 )\u00bb). Undesir able effects after market launch The following undesirable effects of Baloxavir Marboxil were identified after the market launch based on spontaneous case reports and cases from non -interventional study programs. Undesirable effects are listed according to MedDRA system org an classes and the estimated frequency category for each undesirable effect is based on the following convention: very common ( 1/10); common ( ( 1/10'000 to < 1/1'000); very rare (< 1/10'000); not known (cannot be estimated based on the available data) . Immune system disorders Not known : anaphylaxis 1 Not known : anaphylactic reactions , including anaphylactic shock 1 Not known : hypersensitivity 1 Not known: erythema multiforme Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon : urticaria 2 Not known : angio -oedema 1 1 was not observed in the clinical trial. A reliable estimate of their frequency is not possible as these events were reported on a voluntary basis, on a patient collective for which the sample size is not known. 2 was calculated based on the frequency of events in completed clinical studies. Description of selected undesirable effects after market launch Hypersensitivity reactions were reported after the market launch, includ ing anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions, on the one hand, as well as less serious hypersensitivity reactions , such as urticaria and angio -oedema . Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected new or ser ious adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch . Product information for human medicinal products 8 / 20 Overdose Reports on overdoses with Xofluza stem from clinical trials a nd postmarketing experience. No adverse events were noted i n the majority of cases reporting an overdose. Whil e cases of overdose were reported in association with adverse events, the data are insufficient to determine what symptoms are to be expected as a result of an overdose. Treatment There is no known antidote to Xofluza . In the event of an overdose, standard supportive medical care should be initiated based on the patient's signs and symptoms. Baloxavir is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis due to high serum protein binding. Properties/Effects ATC code J05AX25 Mechanism of action Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis into its active metabolite, baloxavir, the active form that exerts anti -influenza activity. Baloxavir acts on the cap -dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza virus -specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex , and thereby inhibits the transcription of influenza virus genomes , resulting in the inhibition of influenza virus replication. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of baloxavir was 1.4 to 3.1 nmol/L for influenza A viruses and 4.5 to 8.9 nmol/L for influenza B viruses in an enzyme inhibition assay . Pharmacodynamics Preclinical studies demonstrate potent antiviral activity of baloxavir against influenza A and B virus in vitro and in vivo . The antiviral activity of baloxavir against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses was determined in the MDCK ce ll culture assay. The median effective concentration (EC baloxavir cell -based virus titer reduction assay, the EC90 (90% effective concentration (EC 90)) values for baloxavir were in the range of 0.46 to 0.98 nmol/L subtype A/H1N1 subtype A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses, and 2.21 to 6.4 8 nmol/L for type B viruses . Product information for human medicinal products 9 / 20 Viruses bearing the PA/I38T/M /F/N/S mutation , selected in vitro or in clinical studies , exhibited reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. Baloxavir is A/H3N2, R152K es, H274Y in A/H5N1, R292K in A/H7N9 . The relationship between antiviral activity in cell culture and inhibition of influenza vir us replication in humans has not been investigated . Xoflza did not prolong the QTc interval a t a concentration corresponding to twice the expected exposure compared with recommended dosing. Clinical efficacy Treatment of Influenza Otherwise Healthy Adult and Adolescent P atients CAPSTONE -1 (Study 1601T0831 double -blind, multicent re, placebo - and active -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo or oseltamivir in otherwise healthy adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 to 64 years , weighing at least 40 kg) with influenza. A total of 1 '436 patients were treated in this study in the 2016 -2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Patients were randomi sed to receive 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza according to their weight (< 80 kg or 80 kg, respectively), or oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (if aged > 20 years) , or placebo. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was the A/H3 subty pe (84.8% to 88.1%) , followed 9.0%) and the A/H1N1pdm subtype (0.5% to 3.0%). In this study, 78% of patients were Asian, 17% were White, and 4% were Black or African American. Out of the 1'436 patients who were enrolled, 1'062 had in fluenza confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR ) and were included in the efficacy n=455, pla cebo n=230 or oseltamivir n=377). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, fever or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue). A statistically significant improvement was seen in the primary endpoint for Xofluza when compared with placebo (see Table 2). Table 2: Time to Alleviation of Symptoms in Otherwise Healthy Patients with Influenza (Xofluza vs Placebo) Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (Median [hours]) Product information for human medicinal products 10 / 20 Xofluza 40/80 mg (95% CI) N=455 Placebo (95% CI) N=230 between Xofluza Confidence interval There was no statistically significant difference in time to alleviation of symptoms when the Xofluza group was compared with the oseltamivir group (53.5 h vs 53.8 h , respectively). The number of patients who received Xofluza at the recommended dose and who were infected with influenza type B virus was limited to 38 patients . In the influen za B subset, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 93 hours (95% CI: 53, 135) in patients who received 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza compared with 77 hours (95% CI : 47, 189) in patients who received placebo. Study 1518T0821 This phase 2 study was designe d to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo in otherwise healthy adult s (aged 20 to 64 years) with influenza. A total of 400 patients were randomi sed to one of three Xofluza dose groups (10, 20 or 40 mg) or placebo in the 2015 -2016 influenza season in Japan. The predominant influenza virus strain was the A/H1N1pdm subtype (61% to 71%) , subtype (5% . The median time to al leviation of symptoms was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) in all dose groups compared with the placebo group . Following administration of 40 mg Xofluza , the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 49.5 hours (95% the group . The number of patients who received Xofluza at the recommended dose and who were infected with influenza type B virus was limited to 24 patients . In the influenza B subset, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 63 hours (95% CI: 43, 70) in patients who received 40 mg Xofluza compared with 83 hours (95% CI : 58, 93) in subjects who received placebo. Otherwise Healthy Pediatric Patients (aged 1 to < 12 years) miniSTONE -2 (Study CP40563) Study CP40563 was a randomized, double -blind, multicenter, active -controlled study, designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with oseltamivir in otherwise healthy pediatric patients (aged 1 t o < 12 years) with influenza -like symptoms. A total of 173 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil Product information for human medicinal products 11 / 20 based on body weight (2 mg/kg for patients weighing < 20 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 20 kg) or os eltamivir (dose based on body weight) for 5 days. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was the A/H3 subtype. The primary objective was to compare the safety of a single dose of baloxavir marboxil with the safety of oseltamivir administered twice daily over 5 days (see section Undesirable Effects, Treatment of Influenza ). A secondary objective was to compare the efficacy of baloxavir marboxil with oseltamivir based on the efficacy endpoints including time to alleviation of influenza signs and symptoms ( cough and nasal symptoms, time to restoration of normal condition in relation to health and activity, as well as duration of fever ). Table 3: Time to Alleviation of Influenza Signs and Symptoms Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (Median [hours]) 1602T0832 was a randomi sed, double -blind, multicent re, placebo - and active -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo or oseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 years ) with influenza and at high risk of influenza -related complications (e.g. asthma or chronic lung disease, endocrine disorders, heart disease, age 65 years, metabolic disorders, morbid obesity) . Patients who had suffered from cancer within the past 5 years ( apart from non-melanoma skin cancer), an untreated HIV infection or a treated HIV infection with a CD4 count of below 350 cells/mm3 in the last 6 months , were not enrolled. A total of 2'184 patients were randomi sed to receive a single oral dose of 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza depending on body weight (40 to < 80 kg or 80 kg respectively) , oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days , or placebo . The predominant influenza viruses in this study were the A/H3 subtype (46.9% to 48.8%) and influenza type B (38.3% to 43.5 %). Of these patients, 43% were Asian, 4 6% White and 10% Black or African American (1% other). The majority of patients had underlying asthma or chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, morbid obesity or were aged 65 or older. In this study , 1'158 of the 2 '184 patients who were enrolled had influenza confirmed by RT -PCR and were included in the Product information for human medicinal products 12 / 20 efficacy analysis ( Xofluza n=385, placebo n=385 or oseltamivir n=388 ). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal cong estion, fever or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue). This endpoint included the alleviation of new symptoms and improvement of any pre -existing symptoms that had deteriorated due to influenza. A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint was observed for Xofluza when compared with placebo (see Table 4). Table 4: Time to Improvement of Influenza Symptoms ( Xofluza vs Placebo) Time to Improvement of Influenza Symptoms (Median [hours]) Xofluza 40/80 mg (95% CI) N=385 the Xofluza group was compared with the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically significant difference in time to improvement of influenza symptoms (73.2 h vs 81.0 h , respectively) . Virus subtype For patients infected with the sub type A/H3 virus (predominant strain), the median time to improvement of the symptoms was shorter in the Xofluza group compared with the placebo group , but not compared with the oseltamivir group (see Table 5). In the patients infected with type B virus, the median time to improvement of the symptoms was shorter in the Xofluza group compared with both the placebo and oseltamivir group . Table 5: Time to Improvement of Symptoms by Influenza Virus Subtype Time to Improvement of Symptoms ( hours) products 13 / 20 N=166 N=167 N=148 Incidence of influenza -related complications There were no significant treatment differences for the complications death, hospitalisation, otitis media and pneumonia. Prophylaxis of Influenza BLOCKSTONE ( Study 1719T0834) Study double -blind, multicenter , placebo -controlled study conducted in 749 subjects in Japan to evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo in the prevention of influenza in subjects who are household members of influenza -infected patients . A total of 60 7 subjects 12 years of age and over received either baloxavir marboxil dosed according to weight, as in the treatment studies, or placebo. The majority (74%) was enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset in the index patient group. The predominant influenz a virus strains in the index patients were the A/H3 subtype (49.1%) and the A/H1N1pdm subtype (46.2%) followed by influenza B (0.9%). There were 142 subjects under 12 years of age, who were dosed according to body weight . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of household subjects who were infected with influenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day 1 to Day 10 (Table 6). Table 6 : Proportion of Subjects with Influenza Virus, Fever, and at least one Respiratory Symptom ( Xofluza vs Placebo) Proportion of Subjects with Influenza Virus, Fever, and at least one Respiratory Symptom (%) Xofluza (95% CI) N=374 Placebo (95% CI) N=375 Adjusted Risk Ratio (95% CI) P-value 1.9 (0.8, 3.8) 13.6 (10.3, 17.5) 0.14 (0.06, 0.30) < 0.0001 Proportion of Subjects 12 years with Influenza Virus, Fever, and at least one Respiratory Symptom (%) N=303 1.3 N=304 13.2 Product information for human medicinal products 14 / 20 (0.4, 3.3) (9.6, 17.5) Proportion of Subjects <12 years with Influenza Virus, Fever, and at least one Respiratory Symptom (%)* N=71 4.2 (0.9, 11.9) N=71 15.5 (8.0, 26.0) * Based on subgroup analysis Resistance monitoring during clinical development Cell culture: Influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir were detected by the serial passage of the virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of baloxavir. Reduced susceptibility of influenza A virus to baloxavir was associated with the amino acid substitutions I38T (H1N1 and H3N2) and E 199G (H3N2) in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein of the viral RNA polymerase complex . No influenza B virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir were detected in cell culture . In clinical studies, influenza A virus isolates were detected with treatment -related amino acid substitutions in the PA protein at position I38T/F/M/N/S in association with a > 10-fold reduction in sensitivity to baloxavir and influenza B virus isolates wi th treatment -related amino acid substitutions in the PA protein at position I38T association with a > 5-fold reduction in sensitivity to baloxavir. The clinical effects of this reduced sensitivity are unclear. No pre -treatment isolates, with amino acid sub stitutions associated with a reduced susceptibility to baloxavir, were found in clinical studies. Prescribers should consider available surveillance information (e.g. from WHO or CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ]) on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use Xofluza . In the phase 3 study conducted in otherwise healthy patients (1601T0831), the amino acid substitution PA/I38T/M was detected in 36 of 370 influenza -infected patients (9.7%) in the Xofluza treatment group. In the phase 3 study conducted in high risk patients (1602T0832), the amino acid substitution PA/I38T/M/N was detected in 15 of 290 influenza -infected patients (5.2%) in the Xofluza treatment group . In the phase 3 study conducted in paediatric patients (CP40563), the amino acid substitution PA/I38T/M/S was detected in 11 of 57 influenza -infected patients (19.3%) in the Xofluza treatment group. In the prophylactic study (1719T0834), the amino acid subs titution PA/I38T/M was detected in 10 of 374 subjects (2.7%) in the Xofluza group. Product information for human medicinal products 15 / 20 Cross -resistance No single amino acid substitution was identified that might confer cross -resistance between baloxavir and neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir). However, a virus may carry amino acid substitutions in the PA protein and in the neuraminidase that are associated with a reduced susceptibility to baloxavir and to neuraminidase inhibitors , respectively, and which effect reduced s usceptibility to both classes of inhibitors. The clinical relevance of evaluations of phenotypic cross -resistance has not been investigated . Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration , baloxavir marboxil is into its active arylacetamide deacetylase in the gastrointestinal lumen, epithelium, and liver. The plasma concentration of baloxavir marboxil was very low or below the limit of quantitation (< 0.100 ng/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters for baloxavir in healthy Japanese adult s after a single oral administration of 40 mg baloxavir marboxil in the fast ing and postprandial states are summari sed in Table 7. The pharmacokinetic parameters for baloxavir in healthy Caucasian adult s after a single oral administration of 80 mg baloxavir marboxil in the fast ing state are summari sed in Table 8. Table 7: Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Baloxavir in the Plasma in Healthy Japanese Adults after Administration of a Single Oral Dose of 40 mg of Baloxavir Marboxil in the Fasting and Postprandial State s Parameters Geometric Mean (CV%) Fasting Postprandial N 14 14 Cmax (ng/mL) (L) 647 (19.1) 1'050 (35.6) Product information for human medicinal products 16 / 20 a Median ( min, max) Table 8: Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Baloxavir in the Plasma in Healthy Caucasian Adults after Administration of a Single Oral Dose of 80 mg of Baloxavir Marboxil in the Fasting State (Study 1612T081C) Parameters Geometric Mean (CV%) N 12 CL/F (L/h) 10.3 (22.5) Following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil, the time to peak plasma baloxavir concentration (T max) was reached after approximately 4 hours in the fast ing state . The absolute bioavailability of baloxavir marboxil was not investigated . A food -effect study on absorption, involving the administration of baloxavir marboxil to healthy volunteers under fast ing conditions and after a meal (approximatel y 400 to 500 kcal , including 150 kcal from fat) , indicated that the C max and AUC for baloxavir were decreased by 48% and 36%, respectively, after a meal . Tmax was unch anged in the presence of food . No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were observed in clinical studies with influenza patients where Xofluza was administered with or without food. Distribution In an in vitro study, the binding of baloxavir to human serum proteins, primarily albumin, was 92.9% to 93.9%. The apparent volume of distribution for baloxavir following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil is approximately 1 '180 lit res in Caucasian patients and 647 lit res in Japanese subjects. Product information for human medicinal products 17 / 20 Metabolism In vitro studies revealed that baloxavir marboxil is primarily converted to baloxavir by arylacetamide deacetylase gastrointestinal lumen, Baloxavir is primarily metaboli sed by UGT1A3 , with a minor contribution from CYP3A4. In a human mass balance study, after administration of a single oral dose of 40 mg of [14C]-label led baloxavir marboxil, the active metabolite baloxavir accounted for of total radioactivity in the plasma. Baloxavir glucuronide (16.4% of total radioactiv ity in the plasma) and (12aR,5R,11S) sulfoxide of baloxavir (1.5% of total radioactivity in the plasma) were also detected in the plasma . This confirm s that the in vivo metabolism of baloxavir marboxil occurs via ester hydrolysis baloxavir baloxavir were excreted mainly via the faeces in humans. Following a single oral administration of 40 mg of [14C]-labelled baloxavir marboxil, the proportion of total radioactivity eliminated in the faeces was 80.1% of the administered dose , 14.7% was excreted in the urine. The amount of baloxavir excreted in the urine was 3.3% of the administered dose , 48.7% was excreted in the faeces. Elimination The apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2,z) for baloxavir after a single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil is 79.1 hours in Caucasian patients, and 93.9 hours in Japanese subject s, see Tables 7 and 8. Linearity/non -linearity Following the single oral administration of 6 mg to 80 mg baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the fasting state. Kinetics in specific patient groups Body weight Body weight was a significant covariate based on the population -related pharmacokinetic analysis. The dosage was therefore adjusted to body weight in both adult and adolescent subjects. In adults and in adolescents, the dose is 40 mg for a body weight of 40 kg to < 80 kg and 80 mg for a body weight of 80 kg. Gender A popul ation pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. Therefore, n o dose adjustment is required based on gender. Product information for human medicinal products 18 / 20 Ethnicity Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, ethnicity was identified as a covariate of plasma clearance of baloxavir after oral administration (CL/F ), in addition to body weight . However, no dose adjustment is required for baloxavir marboxil based on ethnicity . Age A population pharmacokinetic analysis of baloxavir plasma concentrations in patients aged 12 to 64 years who received baloxavir marboxil in clinical studies did not identify age as a clinically relevant covariate for the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. Hepatic impairment Geometric mean values (90% confidence interval) for Cmax and AUC in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class B) compared with healthy controls were 0.80 (0.50 - 1.28) and 1.12 (0.78 - 1.61), respectively. Since no clinically meaningful differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class B) compared with healthy controls with normal hepatic function, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or mod erate hepatic impairment . The pha rmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impai rment . Renal impairment The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir have not been investigated . Renal impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir. Renal excretion represents a minor pathway of elimination for baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir. A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal functio n on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment . Baloxavir is unlikely to be signi ficantly removed by dialysis . Elderly patients Pharmacokinetic data collected in patients aged 65 years show that exposure to the active substance, baloxavir , was similar to that in patient s aged 12 to 64 years . Children and adolescents Product information for human medicinal products 19 / 20 The pharmacokinetics of Xofluza have not been investigated in paediatric patients below 12 years of age. Preclinical data Non-clinical data reveal no particular risks to humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity . Mutage nicity The pro -drug baloxavir marboxil and its active form, baloxavir, were negative in bacterial reverse mutation tests and in micronucleus tests conducted in mammalian cell culture s. Baloxavir marboxil was negative in an in vivo micronucleus test conducted in rodents . Carcinogen icity No studies have marboxil. Reprodu ctive toxicity Baloxavir marboxil had no effects on fertility when administered orally to male and female rats at doses of up to 1 '000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h). Baloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. A study conducted on the embryo - foetal development in rats after the oral administration of daily doses of baloxavir marboxil from gestation day 6 to 17 revealed no signs of maternal or f oetal toxicity up to the highest tested dose of 1'000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h). In rabbits, a dose of 1 '000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 14 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h) caused maternal toxicity , resulting in 2 miscarri ages (out of a total of 19 pregnancies) and an increased number of foetuses with skeletal variation (cervical rib), but no malformations. A dose of 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h) caused no adverse effects in rabb its. The pre - and postnatal study conducted in rats revealed no active substance -related adverse findings in dams and pups up to the highest tested dose of 1 '000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h). When dosed at 1 mg/kg, baloxavir marboxil and metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats .
