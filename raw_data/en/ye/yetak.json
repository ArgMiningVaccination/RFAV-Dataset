No, the ingredient list for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is available on both [the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) website](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) and [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Appendix-C). Yet, there are now claims circulating on social media that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is around 99% graphene oxide, despite the fact that graphene oxide does not appear on either the FDA or CDC list. One example of such a claim was an Instagram post that stated: \"99% Graphene Oxide in Pfizer V4X? Spanish scientists obtain vial of Pfizer v4xin3 and find that 98-99%.\" In this case, \"V4X\" presumably is shorthand for \"vaccine\" rather than \"vagina for your ex.\" [As PolitiFact.com, a nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute, described](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/08/facebook-posts/no-evidence-graphene-oxide-s-toxic-pfizer-covid-19/), the post indicated that graphene oxide, \"is toxic to the human body and causes a number of problems.\" A video accompanying the post featured someone named \"Dr. Jane Ruby.\" Ruby advanced claims that over 99% of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine consists of graphene oxide and that \"There's no other reason for this to be in here except to murder people.\" Murder people? The Covid-19 vaccine is being used to murder people? You can't just slip in the word \"murder\" without offering more explanation or evidence. Imagine telling someone, \"I had a great dinner with you, except for when you tried to murder me\" or \"my boss is OK, except for that whole murder thing.\" OK. Let's unpack this Instagram and its accompanying claims. First of all, who exactly is Ruby? Well, here's [a Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/PunchyMr/status/1413865261023772677) that featured her: As you can see, @PunchyMr pointed out that Ruby has a doctorate in psychology and not in medicine. Yet, Ruby lists herself as a \"Medical Expert\" on the bio portion of her Twitter profile: The word \"medical expert\" is not something that you can just throw out there. It's not like saying that you are an \"asparagus petting\" expert or a \"long walks on the beach\" expert. If you position yourself as a medical expert, what you say can really affect other people's health. What specific degrees, training, and experience does Ruby have? Well, [Ruby's website](http://drjaneruby.com/) has the following description: \"Dr. Jane Ruby is a Washington DC health economist and New Right political pundit with fascinating conservative insights and breaking news in the world of New Media!\" Does that sound like a \"medical expert\"? Secondly, the post mentioned Spanish \"scientists\" without specifying their qualifications or presenting their actual data for the scientific community to review. Beware of anyone offering the word \"scientists\" without much more details on why anyone should believe them. Say you had a basketball game that you had to win? Would you then rely on a stranger telling you that she has assembled a bunch of \"players\" without any real guarantee of how well they could actually play basketball? In fact, the word \"players\" could simply mean people not interested in monogamy, which, of course, wouldn't help you win the basketball game. Similarly, terms like \"scientists\" alone are quite general and vague and aren't enough to offer credence to any scientific claims. The same applies to the term \"Spanish lab,\" which was also used by social media posts making the graphene oxide claim: \"Spanish lab\" may sound official but alone is meaningless without more details and clarification. The word \"lab\" is vague and could refer to a lot of different things, including a dog. A Labrador Retriever in Spain testing vaccines would have very different implications. Thirdly, these so-called Spanish lab findings have not been published in any respectable peer-reviewed scientific journals. [According to Health Feedback](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/there-is-no-conclusive-evidence-that-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-contains-graphene-oxide/), a member of the World Health Organization (WHO)-led project Vaccine Safety Net (VSN), there are claims that this Spanish lab is located at the University of Almer\u00eda in Almer\u00eda, Spain, yet this university has \"unequivocally distanced itself from the analysis,\" as the following tweet showed: Keep in mind that vaccines are a lot more highly regulated than things such as dietary supplements, food, and underwear. Imagine what could have happened had Pfizer not included a key ingredient, especially one that comprised 99% of the vaccine, on the Covid-19 vaccine ingredient lists submitted to the FDA and CDC. Such an omission could have put Pfizer at major legal risk and jeopardized their entire business. The FDA also conducts periodic evaluations of the manufacturing processes involved in producing the vaccines. So slipping in an undeclared ingredient wouldn't have been that easy. Besides, what would have been the purpose for such an omission? Murder Yeah, it's usually bad business practice to murder customers because have to kind of alive to buy things. Here's a question. Rather than pushing unfounded graphene oxide or any similar anti-vaccination claims, why not instead push to further strengthen the FDA? Why not advocate to increase funding and resources for the FDA. After all, everyone should be interested in an FDA that can better protect the public against bogus health products... unless, of course, you yourself are trying to push products with unknown ingredients such as a dietary supplement spiked with an erectile dysfunction medication that's hard to see, so to speak.
