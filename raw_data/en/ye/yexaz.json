It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. Its use is not dependent on one's intellectual capacity or spiritual development and therefore is available to everyone. It has been successfully taught to thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds. A Reiki treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit and creates many beneficial effects including relaxation and feelings of peace, security and well-being. Many have reported miraculous results. How Does Reiki Work? We are alive because life force is flowing through us. Life force flows within the physical body though pathways called chakras, meridians and nadis. It also flows around us in a field of energy called the aura. Life force nourishes the organs and cells of the body, supporting them in their vital functions. When this flow of life force is disrupted, it causes diminished function in one or more of the organs and tissues of the physical body. The life force is responsive to thoughts and feelings. It becomes disrupted when we accept, either consciously or unconsciously, negative thoughts or feelings about ourselves. These negative thoughts and feelings attach themselves to the energy field and cause a disruption in the flow of life force. This diminishes the vital function of the organs and cells of the physical body. Reiki heals by flowing through the affected parts of the energy field and charging them with positive energy. It raises the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where the negative thoughts and feelings are attached. This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away. In so doing, Reiki clears, straightens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way. Reiki Can Never Cause Harm Because Reiki is guided by the God-consciousness, it can never do harm. The energy knows what a person needs, and will adjust itself to create the effect that is appropriate for them. One never need worry about whether to give Reiki or not. It is always helpful. In addition, because the practitioner does not direct the healing and does not decide what to work on or what to heal, the practitioner is not in danger of misusing the Reiki energy. Because the practitioner is not doing the healing, it is easier for the ego to stay out of the way and to maintain a sense of detachment as the practitioner simply allows the Reiki energy to flow. Energy is Never Depleted Because it is a channeled healing, the Reiki practitioner's energies are never depleted. In fact, the Reiki consciousness considers both practitioner and client to be in need of healing, so both receive treatment. Because of this, giving a treatment always increases one's energy and leaves one surrounded with loving feelings of well-being. What is it? How does it heal? The word Reiki is composed of two Japanese words - Rei and Ki. Rei can be defined as the Higher Intelligence that guides the creation and functioning of the universe. Rei is a subtle wisdom that permeates everything, both animate and inanimate. This subtle wisdom guides the evolution of all creation ranging from the unfolding of galaxies to the development of life. On a human level, it is available to help us in times of need and to act as a source of guidance in our lives. Ki is the non-physical energy that animates all living things. Ki is flowing in everything that is alive including plants, animals, and humans. When a person's Ki is high, he or she will feel strong, confident, and ready to enjoy life and take on its challenges. When it is low, a person will feel weak and is more likely to get sick. We receive Ki from the air we breathe, from food, from sunshine, and from sleep. It's also possible to increase our Ki by using breathing exercises and meditation. With the above information in mind, Reiki can be defined as life force energy that is guided by the Higher Intelligence, or spiritually-guided life force energy. Reiki energy seems to have an intelligence of its own, flowing where it is needed in the client and creating the healing conditions necessary for the individual's needs. It cannot be guided by the mind and therefore it is not limited by the experience or ability of the practitioner. Neither can it be misused as it always creates a healing effect. An important attribute of Ki is that it responds to one's thoughts and feelings. Ki will flow more strongly or be weakened in its action depending on the quality of one's thoughts and feelings. It is our negative thoughts and feelings that are the main cause of restriction in the flow of Ki. All negative or dis-harmonious thoughts or feelings will cause a disruption in the flow of Ki. Even Western medicine recognizes the role played by the mind in creating illness and some Western doctors state that as much as 98% of illness is caused directly or indirectly by the mind. The negative thoughts and feelings that are lodged in the unconscious mind/body are the greatest problem, as we are not aware of them and therefore we are greatly hampered in changing or eliminating them. The great value of Reiki is that because it is guided by the Higher Intelligence, it knows exactly where to go and how to respond to restrictions in the flow of Ki. It can work directly in the unconscious parts of the mind/body which contain negative thoughts and feelings which are inhibiting the flow of Ki, and eliminate them. As Reiki flows through a sick or unhealthy area, it breaks up and washes away any negative thoughts or feelings lodged in the unconscious mind/body, thus allowing a normal healthy flow of Ki to resume. As this happens, the unhealthy physical organs and tissues become properly nourished with Ki and begin functioning in a balanced, healthy way. "}
