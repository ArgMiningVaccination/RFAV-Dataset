Bhalla Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety Office of Nuclear Material Safety and SafeguardsU.S. Nuclear Regulatory CommissionWashington, DC 20555-0001 ABSTRACT iii NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1ABSTRACT As part of its redesign of the materials licensi ng process, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is consolidating and updating numerous guidance documents into a singlecomprehensive repository, as described in NUREG-1539, \"Methodology and Findings of theNRC's Materials Licensing Process Redesi gn,\" dated April 1996, and draft NUREG-1541, \"Process and Design for Consolidating and Updating Materials Licensing Guidance,\" datedApril 1996. NUREG-1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 \"Consolidated Guidance about Materials Licenses:Program-Specific Guidance about Medical Use Licenses,\" dated May 2005, is the ninthprogram-specific guidance document developed for the new process and is intended for use byapplicants, licensees, and NRC staff and will also be available to Agreement States. This document contains information that is intended to assist applicants for licenses for the medical use of byproduct material in preparing their license applications. In particular, itdescribes the types of information needed to complete NRC Form 313, \"Application for MaterialLicense\" and NRC Form 313A, \"Training and Experience and Preceptor Statement.\" Thedocument provides an overview of the types of licenses issued by the NRC; the commitmentsand responsibilities that must be undertaken by a licensee; applicable regulations; the process forfiling a license application; and the contents of a pplications for different types of medical uses of byproduct material. In particular, this document provides a description, on an item-by-itembasis, of the information to be provided by an applicant on NRC Form 313. Because of the widevariety in the types of medical uses of byproduc t material, indicators have been placed in the document to alert applicants for particular types of medical uses to material that pertains to thosetypes of uses. The document also contains appendices that include (1) copies of necessary forms; (2) a sample license application and completed licenses for different types of medical uses of byproduct materials; and (3) examples of the types of supporting documents, such as implementingprocedures, that may need to be prepared by applicants. NRC is placing added emphasis onconducting its regulatory activities in a risk-informed and performance-based manner. Thisapproach is intended to be less prescriptive and to allow for the implementation by licensees thatmay be specific to their needs while meeting the regulatory requirements. By supplyingexamples, NRC seeks to provide information to meet the needs of applicants for licensure,without being prescriptive. Guidance in this document represents one means acceptable to NRCstaff of complying with NRC regulations and is not intended to be the only means of satisfying requirements for a license. Volume 9 of NUREG-1556, Rev. 1 provides guidance for licensure under revised Title 10, Part 35, \"Medical Use of Byproduct Material.\" It is also available for use by Agreement Statesand combines and supercedes guidance found in the documents listed below: CRegulatory Guide (RG) 10.8, Revision 2, \"Guide for the Preparation of Applications for Medical Use Programs;\"ABSTRACT NUREG -

This report isintended for use by applicants, licensees, NRC license reviewers, and other NRC licensepersonnel addressing the medical use of byproduct material.

The NRC staffmembers were P.A. Lanzisera, A.R. Jones, R. G. Gattone, R.D. Reid. A revised draft was published in March 2002. Appendix Z of the March 2002 draft included a summary ofcomments on the 1998 draft and NRC responses. The NRC held two public workshops, onApril 25 and April 30, 2002, to receive stakeholder comments on the March 2002 draft. TheNRC also received written public comments during a 60-day comment period (April 5 toJune 4, 2002). A summary and analysis of both sets of comments was published as a separatedocument: Appendix BB to NUREG-1556, Vol. 9. This document is available as noted insidethe front cover of this document. Appendix BB to NUREG-1556, Vol. 9 is also available on theNRC's web site <http://www.nrc.gov> in the Electronic Reading Room. Questions and Answers (Q&As) on implementation of Part 35 are posted on the NRC's web page on the Medical Use of Byproduct Material <http://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/med-use-toolkit.html>, serving as another source of guidance about implementation ofrevised Part 35. After the October 2002 publication of NUREG-1556, Vol. 9, the NRC amended 10 CFR Part 35, \"Medical Use of Byproduct Material\" (March 70 FR 16335). The licensing guidancecontained in NUREG-1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1, includes updated guidance on requirements fortraining and experience appearing in the amended rule. The guidance also reflects the extensionof the effective date of Subpart J to October 24, 2005 (69 FR 55736). In addition to combining and updating the guidance for applicants and licensees previously found in numerous Regulatory Guides, Policy and Guidance Directives, draft Regulatory Guides, Standard Review Plans, and Information No tices, this guidance incorporates input from stakeholders received in the public workshops and comments. This report follows the risk-informed, performance-based approach adopted for revisions to 10 CFR Part 35. It reduces the amount of information submitted by an applicant seeking topossess and use certain quantities of byproduct material for medical use. In a number ofinstances, the regulations found in 10 CFR Part 35 and reflected in this report do not require thesubmission of detailed procedures. Instead, applicants are requested to confirm that they havedeveloped and will implement and maintain procedures required by Part 35, but they are notrequired to submit those procedures as part of their license application. This report containsappendices containing suggested procedures that applicants may consider. The risk-informed, performance-based approach to the regulation of NRC licensed materials is also beingemphasized in the inspection and enforcement arena. This document addresses those topics that an applicant must provide in preparing a license application on NRC Form 313. The report also includes descriptions of certain key elements of amedical use program that do not require a response on Form 313. This material is presented forclarification only. NUREG-1556, Vol. 9, is not a substitute for NRC regulations. The approaches and methods described in this report are provided for information only. Guidance in this document representsFOREWORD xiii NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 one means acceptable to the staff of complying with NRC regulations and is not intended to be the only means of satisfying the requirements for licensing. The NRC's \"Procedures for Recognizing Certifi cation Processes of Specialty Boards\" may be found on the NRC's web page regarding the medical use of byproduct material<http://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/med-use-toolkit.html>. Complementary guidance on inspection procedures for inspections of medical use licensees is contained in the following documents available at the NRC's web page on the Medical Use ofByproduct Material <http://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/med-use-toolkit.html>.

To assist license applicants, this guide includes text boxes at the beginning of each section to indicate the type of use to which the guidance pertains (identified by the pertinent section of10 CFR Part 35). These boxes are intended to guide the applicant through the sections of theguidance that are relevant to the applicant's particular type of use of byproduct material.

CProvisions of 10 CFR Part 30 that relate to licensing (e.g., \u00a730.33). This report does not address certain aspects of licensing and radiation safety for the medical use of byproduct materials. In particular, applicants and licensees should consider the following: CNUREG-1556, Volume 11, \"Consolidated Guidance about Materials Licenses: Program-Specific Guidance About Licenses of Broad Scope,\" dated April 1999, provides additional licensing guidance on medical use programs of broad scope. Section 1.2.1 below provides a general discussion on specific licenses of broad scope. C10 CFR Part 19, \"Notices, Instructions and Reports to Workers: Inspection andInvestigations.\" C10 CFR Part 20, \"Standards for Protection Ag ainst Radiation,\" and other regulatory requirements potentially applicable to medical use licensees listed in Section 4 below. C10 CFR Part 21, \"Reporting of Defects and Noncompliance.\" CThis report does not address the commercial aspects of manufacturing, distribution, andservice of sources containing byproduct mate rial in devices. NUREG-1556, Volumes 12, 13, and 18 provide additional licensing guidance. CThis report does not describe the licensing, possession, or use of pacemakers, which arelicensed under 10 CFR Part 70, \"Domestic Li censing of Special Nuclear Material.\" However, a sample pacemaker license is included in Appendix F. As a guidance document intended to assist a wide variety of applicants, this report contains a considerable amount of information about how licensees may choose to implement theirprograms to meet NRC regulatory requirements. The information in this document is notintended to impose any conditions beyond those required by the regulations in 10 CFR. Thisreport provides specific guidance on what information should be submitted in an application tosatisfy NRC requirements. Except for proce dures required by Subpart H of 10 CFR Part 35, written procedures do not need to be submitted as part of the license application. Guidance and model procedures provided in this NUREG that are not required to be submitted are for illustrative purposes to guide licensees in developing their programs. Use of the word\"should\" implies \"may\" and is not intended to mean \"must\" or \"shall;\" the procedures providedin this guidance are intended to serve only as examples. Sections 1 through 7 of this document provide background information. Section 8 describes, item-by-item, the information that should be provided in Items 1 through 11 of NRC Form 313,OVERVIEW 1-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1in completing a license application. The format within this document for each item of technical information is as follows: CRegulations - references the regulations applicable to the item; CCriteria - outlines the criteria used to judge the adequacy of the applicant's response; CDiscussion - provides additional information on the topic sufficient to meet the needs of most readers; and CResponse from Applicant - provides suggested response(s) or indicates that no response is needed on that topic during the initial licensing process. Some sections of the guidance include references to other documents that may be useful to the applicant. Appendix AA provides a complete list of documents used to prepare or referenced inthe guidance. While specific availability information is included for some reference documents,the documents also may be accessed at the NRC Public Document Room, which is located atNRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, or the NRC Electronic Reading Room at<http://www.nrc.gov>. See the Notice of Availability on the inside front cover of this report formore information. When NRC Form 313 does not have sufficient space to provide full responses to Items 5 through 11, provide the information on separate attachments, label the attachments to indicate which itemis being addressed, and submit the attachments with the completed NRC Form 313. Appendices to this report provide the following supplementary information: CAppendices A and B provide sample application forms; CAppendix C provides license application checklists for responding to Items 5-11 on NRC Form 313; CAppendix D describes how to fill out NRC Form 313A; CAppendix E includes a sample application; CAppendix F provides sample licenses; CAppendices G and H provide information regarding required submissions; CAppendices I through W provide model procedures; CAppendices X through AA provide reference materials; and CAppendix BB, published as a separate document, provides a summary of public comments ondrafts and NRC responses. In this document, \"dose\" or \"radiation dose\" means absorbed dose, dose equivalent, effective dose equivalent, committed dose equivalent, committed effective dose equivalent, or totaleffective dose equivalent (TEDE). These quantities are defined in 10 CFR Part 20 and areexpressed in units of rem and its SI equivalent, the Sievert (Sv) (1 rem = 0.01 Sv). (TheOVERVIEW NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 1-6quantities absorbed dose and exposure, and their associated units, the rad and the roentgen, are not used in 10 CFR Part 20 to specify dose limits.) Furthermore, the byproduct materialscommonly used in medicine emit beta and photon radiation, for which the quality factor is 1; auseful rule of thumb is an exposure of 1 roentgen is equivalent to an absorbed dose of 1 rad and dose equivalent of 1 rem. This NUREG not only updates the information a nd guidance provided in Revision 2 of RG 10.8, \"Guide for the Preparation of Applications fo r Medical Use Programs,\" but also revises the format in which it is presented to assist with the preparation of a medical use license. Revision 2was issued in August 1987 to provide guidance for the revised 10 CFR Part 35, which became effective April 1, 1987. Since then, 10 CFR Part 35 has been amended a number of times. Technology-specific information has been revised and expanded to include technologies that are now more commonly used, for example, computerized remote afterloading brachytherapy andgamma stereotactic radiosurgery (GSR). defines \"Medical use\" as \"the intentional internal or external administration of byproductmaterial, or the radiation from byproduct material, to patients or human research subjects underthe supervision of an authorized user\" (10 CF R 35.2). An Authorized User is defined as \"a physician, dentist, or podiatrist\" who meets the training and experience requirements specified inthe board certification pathway in the applicable sections of 10 CFR Part 35 or who is identified as an authorized user on an NRC or Agreement State license; on a permit issued by aCommission master material licensee or a Commission master material permittee that isauthorized to permit the medical use of byproduct material; or on a permit issued by aCommission or Agreement State broad scope licensee authorized to permit the medical use ofbyproduct material (10 CFR 35.2). NRC issues two types of specific licenses for th e medical use of byproduct material in medical practices and facilities: Cthe specific license of limited scope (see Section 1.2.1), and Cthe specific license of broad scope (see Section 1.2.2). Medical use includes research involving human subjects, which may occur under either limited scope or broad scope specific licenses (see Section 1.2.3). NRC also issues a general license pursuant to 10 CFR 31.11, under which a physician, veterinarian in the practice of veterinary medicine, clinical laboratory, or hospital may usebyproduct material for certain in vitro clinical or laboratory testing. Such testing may not involve internal or external administration of byproduct material, or the radiation therefrom, to human beings or animals (see Section 1.2.4). NRC usually issues a single byproduct material license to cover an entire radionuclide program. (Note, however, that nuclear-powered pacemakers are licensed separately under 10 CFRPart 70.) A license including teletherapy may also contain the authorization for source materialOVERVIEW 1-7 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1(i.e., depleted uranium) used as shielding in many teletherapy units, and a license may include authorization for possession of sealed sources to be used to calibrate dose calibration devices. NRC may issue separate licenses to individual li censees for different medical uses. However, NRC does not usually issue separate licenses to different departments in a medical facility or toindividuals employed by a medical facility or with whom the medical facility has contracted. Only the facility's management may sign the license application. Applicants should study this report, related guidance, and all applicable regulations carefully before completing NRC Forms 313 and 313A. NRC expects licensees to provide information onspecific aspects of the proposed radiation prot ection program in attachments to NRC Form 313. When necessary, NRC may ask the applicant for additional information in order to gainreasonable assurance that an adequate radiation protection program has been established. After a license is issued, the licensee must conduct its program in accordance with the following: CStatements, representations, and procedures contained in the application and in correspondence with NRC, when incorporated into a license by reference; CTerms and conditions of the license; and CNRC regulations. In 10 CFR 30.9, NRC requires that the information in the application be complete and accurate in all material aspects. Information is considered material if it has the ability to change or affectan agency decision on issuing the license. 1.2.1 SPECIFIC LICENSE OF LIMITED SCOPE NRC issues specific medical licenses of limited scope to private or group medical practices and to medical institutions. A medical institution is an organization in which more than one medicaldiscipline is practiced. In general, individual physicians or physician groups located within alicensed medical facility (e.g., hospital) may not apply for a separate license because 10 CFR30.33(a)(2) refers to the applicant's facilities. Since a physician group does not normally havecontrol over the facilities, the hospital remains responsible for activities conducted on itspremises and must apply for the license. On specific licenses of limited scope, the authorizedusers are specifically listed in the license. Byproduct material may be administered to patients on an inpatient (i.e., hospitalized) or outpatient basis. For patients to whom byproduct material is administered and who are notreleasable under 10 CFR 35.75, inpatient facilities are required. In general, facilities for privateand group practices do not include inpatient rooms and, therefore, procedures requiring hospitalization of the patient under 10 CFR 35.75 cannot be performed. A specific license of limited scope may also be issued to an entity requesting to perform mobile medical services (10 CFR 35.80, 10 CFR 35.647). A medical institution or a private or group practice may apply for authorization to use byproduct material in a mobile medical service.OVERVIEW NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 1-81.2.2 SPECIFIC LICENSE OF BROAD SCOPE Medical institutions that provide patient care and conduct research programs that use radionuclides for in vitro , animal, and medical procedures may request a specific license of broad scope in accordance with 10 CFR Part 33. No medical use of byproduct material,including research involving human subjects, may be conducted without an authorization in a license from the NRC or an Agreement State as provided in 10 CFR Part 35. The criteria for the various types of broad scope licenses are found in 10 CFR 33.13 through 10 CFR 33.17. Generally, NRC issues specific licenses of broad scope for medical use (i.e., licenses authorizing multiple quantities and types of byproduct material for medical use under Part 35 as well as otheruses) to institutions that (1) have experience successfully operating under a specific license oflimited scope; and (2) are engaged in medical research and routine diagnostic and therapeuticuses of byproduct material. NUREG-1556, Vol. 11, offers additional guidance to applicants fora specific license of broad scope. 1.2.3 RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS 10 CFR 35.2 defines \"medical use\" to include the administration of byproduct material or radiation therefrom to human research subjects. Furthermore, 10 CFR 35.6, \"Provisions for theprotection of human research subjects,\" addresse s the protection of the rights of human subjects involved in research by medical use licensees. For these licensees, prior NRC approval is notnecessary if the research is conducted, funded, supported, or regulated by another FederalAgency that has implemented the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Otherwise, the licensee must apply for a specific amendment and receive approval for theamendment before conducting such research. Whether or not a license amendment is required,licensees must obtain informed consent from human subjects and prior review and approval ofthe research activities by an Institutional Review Board in accordance with the meaning of those terms under the Federal Policy. In accordance with 10 CFR 35.6(a), research involving humansubjects shall be conducted only with byproduct materials listed in the license for the usesauthorized in the license. 1.2.4 GENERAL IN VITRO LICENSE In 10 CFR 31.11, \"General License for Use of Byproduct Material for Certain In Vitro Clinical or Laboratory Testing,\" NRC establishes a genera l license authorizing physicians, veterinarians, clinical laboratories, and hospitals to receive, acquire, possess, or use small quantities of certainbyproduct material for in vitro clinical or laboratory tests not involving \"medical use\" (i.e., not involving administration to humans). Section 31.11 explains the requirements for using the materials listed. If the general license alone meets the applicant's needs, only NRC Form 483,\"Registration Certificate - In Vitro Testing With Byproduct Material Under General License,\" need be filed. Medical-use licensees authorized pursuant to 10 CFR Part 35 do not need to filethe form. NRC limits possession to a total of 200 microcuries of photon-emitting materials listed in 10 CFR 31.11 at any one time, at any one location of storage or use. The use of materials listedin 10 CFR 31.11 within the inventory limits of that section is subject only to the requirements ofOVERVIEW 1-9 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1that section and not to the requirements of 10 CFR Parts 19, 20, and 21, except as set forth in 10 CFR 31.11. An applicant needing more than 200 microcuries of these materials must apply for a specific license and may request the increased inventory limit as a separate line item on NRC Form 313. This type of applicant generally requests an increased limit of 3 millicuries. If requesting anincreased inventory limit, the applicant will be subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Parts 19,20, and 21, including the requirements for waste disposal. 1.3 OTHER REQUIREMENTS 1.3.1 THE \"AS LOW AS IS REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE (ALARA)\" CONCEPT 10 CFR 20.1101, \"Radiation Protection Programs,\" states that \"each licensee shall develop, document, and implement a radiation protection program commensurate with the scope andextent of licensed activities ...\" and \"the licensee shall use, to the extent practical, proceduresand engineering controls based upon sound radiation protection principles to achieveoccupational doses and doses to members of the public that are . . . ALARA.\" This section alsorequires that licensees review the content of the radiation protection program and itsimplementation at least annually. The RSO is responsible for the day-to-day operation of theradiation protection program. References: The following documents contain information, methods, and references useful to those who are establishing radiation protection programs to maintain radiation exposures atALARA levels in medical facilities: CRG 8.10, \"Operating Philosophy for Maintaining Occupational Radiation ExposuresALARA.\" CRG 8.18, \"Information Relevant to Ensuring That Occupational Radiation Exposures at Medical Institutions Will Be ALARA.\" C NUREG-0267, \"Principles and Practices for K eeping Occupational Radiation Exposures at Medical Institutions ALARA.\" C NUREG-1134, \"Radiation Protection Trai ning for Personnel Employed in Medical Facilities.\" CInformation directly related to radiation prot ection standards in 10 CFR Part 20 is contained in NUREG 1736, \"Consolidated Guidance: 10 CFR Part 20 - Standards for ProtectionAgainst Radiation.\" Applicants should consider the ALARA philosophy detailed in these reports when developing plans to work with licensed radioactive materials.OVERVIEW NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 1-101.3.2 WRITTEN DIRECTIVE (WD) PROCEDURES 10 CFR 35.41 requires certain medical use licensees to develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to provide high confidence that before each administration requiring a WD, thepatient's identity is verified and the administration is in accordance with the WD. Thisregulation also specifies what an applicant must, at a minimum, address in these procedures. Appendix S provides further information on developing these procedures. 1.3.3 TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF TRANSFER OF CONTROL Under 10 CFR 30.34(b) and 10 CFR 35.14(b) licensees must provide full information and obtain NRC's written consent before transferring control of the license, or, as some licensees refer to the process, \"transferring the license.\" Control may be transferred as a result of merger s, buyouts, or majority stock transfers. Although it is not NRC's intent to interfere with the business decisions of licensees, it is necessary forlicensees to obtain NRC's written consent before transferring control of the license. This is toensure the following: CRadioactive materials are possessed, used, or controlled only by persons who have validNRC licenses; CMaterials are properly handled and secured; CPersons using these materials are competent and committed to implementing appropriateradiological controls; CA clear chain of custody is established to identify who is responsible for final disposal of thematerial; CPublic health and safety are not compromised by the use of such materials. As provided in 10 CFR 35.14(b), if only the licens ee's name or mailing address changes, and the name change does not constitute a transfer of control of the license as described in 10 CFR30.34(b), a licensee must file a written notificati on with NRC no later than 30 days after the date(s) of the change(s). Otherwise, prior NRC written consent must be given prior to thetransfer. Guidance on information to be supplied to the NRC when seeking approval for transfer of control of licensed material is available in Appendix G.

Appendix G, excerpted from Appendix F of NUREG-1556, Vol. 15, identifies the information to be provided abouttransferring control. 1.3.4 TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS Immediately following filing of a voluntary or i nvoluntary petition for bankruptcy for or against a licensee, the licensee is required by 10 CFR 30.34(h) to notify the appropriate NRC RegionalAdministrator, in writing, identifying the bankruptcy court in which the petition was filed andthe date of the filing. Even though the licensee may have filed for bankruptcy, the licensee remains responsible for compliance with all regulatory requirements. NRC needs to know when licensees are inbankruptcy proceedings in order to determine whether all licensed material is accounted for andadequately controlled and whether there are any public health and safety concerns (e.g.,contaminated facility). NRC shares the results of its determinations with other entities involved (e.g., trustees) so that health and safety issues can be resolved before bankruptcy actions arecompleted.

Any applicantother than a Federal Agency who wishes to possess or uselicensed material in one of these Agreement States needs tocontact the responsible officials in that state for guidance onpreparing an application. These applications are filed with stateofficials, not with NRC. In the special situation of work at Federally-controlled sites in Agreement States, it is necessary to know the jurisdictional status of the land to determine whether NRC or the Agreement Statehas regulatory authority. NRC has regulatory authority over land determined to be under \"exclusive Federal jurisdiction,\" while the Agreement State has jurisdiction over non-exclusiveFederal jurisdiction land. Applicants and licensees are responsible for finding out, in advance,the jurisdictional status of the specific areas where they plan to conduct licensed operations. NRC recommends that applicants and licensees ask their local contacts for the Federal Agencycontrolling the site (e.g., contract officer, base e nvironmental health officer, district office staff) to help determine the jurisdictional status of the land and to provide the information in writing,so that licensees can comply with NRC or Agreement State regulatory requirements, asappropriate. Additional guidance on determining jurisdictional status is found in All AgreementStates Letter, SP-96-022, dated February 16, 1996, which is available from NRC upon request. Table 2.1 provides a quick way to check on which agency has regulatory authority. Table 2.1 Who Regulates the Activity?

Applications must be signed by the applicant's or licensee's management as required by 10 CFR 35.12(a), see Section 8.30, \"Certification.\" All license applications will be made available for review by the general public in NRC's Public Document Rooms and electronically at the Public Electronic Reading Room. For moreinformation on the Public Electronic Reading Room, visit <http://www.nrc.gov>. If it isnecessary to submit proprietary information, follow the procedure in 10 CFR 2.390. Failure tofollow this procedure could result in disclosure of the proprietary information to the public orsubstantial delays in processing the application. Employee personal information, i.e., homeaddress, home telephone number, social security number, date of birth, and radiation doseinformation, should not be submitted unless specifically requested by NRC.HOW TO FILE NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 5-2NRC's new licensing process will be faster and more efficient, in part, through acceptance and processing of electronic applications at some future date. NRC will continue to accept paperapplications. However, these will be scanned through an optical character reader (OCR) toconvert them to electronic format. To ensure a smooth transition to electronic applications, applicants should: CSubmit printed or typewritten - not handwritten - text on smooth, crisp paper that will feedeasily into the scanner; CChoose typeface Times New Roman; CUse 12-point or stylized characters such as script, italic, etc.; CBe sure the print is clear and sharp; CBe sure there is high contrast between the ink and paper (black ink on white paper is best). 5.2 ELECTRONIC APPLICATION As the electronic licensing process develops, it is anticipated that NRC may provide mechanismsfor filing applications via diskettes or CD-R OM and through the Internet. Additional filing instructions will be provided as NRC implements these new mechanisms. When the electronicprocess becomes available, applicants may file electronically instead of on paper.6-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T6 WHERE TO FILE Applicants that wish to possess or use licensed material in any State or U.S. territory or possession subject to NRC jurisdictionmust file an application with NRC Regional Office for the localein which the material will be possessed and/or used. Section 8.36and Appendix V provide further information on filing proceduresfor applicants that wish to perform mobile medical services. Figure 2.1 shows NRC's four Regional Offices and theirrespective areas for licensing purposes, and identifies AgreementStates. In general, applicants for possession or use of byproduct material in an Agreement State must file an application with the Agreement State, not NRC. However, if work will be conducted at Federally-controlled sites in Agreement States, applicants must first determine the jurisdictionalstatus of the land in order to determine whether NRC or the Agreement State has regulatoryauthority. Section 2, \"Agreement States,\" has additional information.7-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T7 LICENSE FEES Application fees are required for new license applications and some other licensing actions. Each application for which a fee isspecified must be accompanied by the appropriate fee. Refer to10 CFR 170.31 to determine the amount of the fee. NRC will notissue the licensing action before it receives the appropriatepayment. Consult 10 CFR 170.11 for information on exemptionsfrom fees. Once technical review has begun, no fees will berefunded. Application fees will be charged regardless of NRC's disposition of an application or the withdrawal of an application. Most NRC licensees are also subject to annual fees; refer to 10 CFR 171.16. Consult 10 CFR 171.11 for information on exemptions from annual fees and 10 CFR 171.16(c) onreduced annual fees for licensees that qualify as \"small entities.\" Direct all questions about NRC fees or comp letion of Item 12 of NRC Form 313 (Appendix A) to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, (301) 415-7554 (or toll free at (800) 368-5642, extension 415-7554).

List the legal name of the applicant's corporation or other legal entity with direct control over use of the radioactive material; adivision or department within a legal entity may not be alicensee. An individual may be designated as the applicant onlyif the individual is acting in a private capacity and the use of theradioactive material is not connected with employment by a corporation or other legal entity. Provide the mailing address where correspondence should be sent. A post office box number isan acceptable mailing address. See Section 8.30, \"Certification.\" Note : NRC must be notified before control of the license is transferred or whenever bankruptcy proceedings are initiated. See Sections 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 for more details. NRC IN 97-30,\"Control of Licensed Material During Reorgani zations, Employee-Management Disagreements, and Financial Crises,\" dated June 3, 1997, discusses the potential for the security and control oflicensed material to be compromised during periods of organizational instability.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-6Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T8.3 ITEM 3: ADDRESS(ES) WHERE LICENSED MATERIAL WILL BE USED ORPOSSESSED Regulations : 10 CFR 30.33(a)(2); 10 CFR 35.14(b)(2). In order to ensure compliance with 10 CFR 30.33(a)(2) and as referenced in NRC Form 313 Item 3, specify the street address,city, and state or other descriptive address (e.g., on Highway 10,5 miles east of the intersection of Highway 10 and State Route234, Anytown, State) for each facility. The descriptive addressshould be sufficient to allow an NRC inspector to find the facility location. A post office boxaddress is not acceptable. If byproduct material is to be used at more than one location under thelicense, the specific address (e.g., street and bu ilding) must be provided for each facility. If applying for a license for mobile medical services as authorized pursuant to 10 CFR 35.18(b),the applicant should refer to Section 8.36 and Appendix V of this report for specific licensingguidance. NRC must be notified if the mailing address changes. Being granted an NRC license does not relieve a licensee from complying with other applicable Federal, state, or local regulations (e.g., local zoning requirements; a localordinance requiring registration of a radiation-producing device). Note : As discussed in Section 8.7 \"Recordkeeping for Decommissioning and Financial Assurance,\" licensees must maintain permanent records on where the licensed material was usedor stored while the license was in effect. These records are important for making futuredeterminations about the release of these locations for unrestricted use (e.g., before the license isterminated). For medical use licensees, acceptable records include sketches and writtendescriptions of the specific locations where material is (or was) used or stored and anyinformation relevant to spills (e.g., where contamination remains after cleanup procedures orwhen there is reasonable likelihood that contaminants may have spread), damaged devices, orleaking radioactive sources. 8.4 ITEM 4: PERSON TO BE CONTACTED ABOUT THIS APPLICATION Identify the individual who can answer questions about the application and include his or her telephone number. This istypically the proposed RSO, unless the applicant has named adifferent person as the contact. NRC will contact this individualif there are questions about the application. Notify NRC of changes of contact name or telephone number so that NRC can contact the applicant or licensee in the future withquestions, concerns, or information. This notice is for \"information only\" and does not require a license amendment or a fee.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-7 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TThe individual named in Item 4 may or may not be the same individual who signs the application as the \"certifying officer\" on behalf of the licens ee with the authority to make commitments to NRC (see Item 13 on NRC Form 313). NRC recognizes that licensees may use a consultant or consultant group to help prepare the license application and provide support to the radiation protection program. However, NRC reminds licensees that regardless of the role of the consultant in radiation protection programmanagement, the licensee remains responsible for all aspects of the licensed program, includingthe services performed by the consultant. 8.5 ITEM 5: RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL Regulations : 10 CFR 30.32; 10 : 10 CFR Part 35 divides byproduct material for medical use into seven types of use (10 CFR 35.100, 35.200, 35.300,35.400, 35.500, 35.600, and 35.1000). Discussion : The applicant should indicate the byproduct material requested. The amount and type of information necessary will vary according to thetype of use requested. 35.100 and 35.200 Use : For 35.100 and 35.200 use, the chemical/physical form may be \"Any\" unsealed byproduct material permitted by 10 CFR 35.100 or 35.200, as appropriate. For 35.100and 35.200 use, the total amount requested may be \"As Needed.\" The following format may beused: Byproduct Material Chemical/ Physical Form Maximum Amount Any byproduct material permitted by 10 CFR 35.100Any As needed Any byproduct material permitted by 10 CFR 35.200Any As needed 35.300 Use : For 35.300 use, the chemical/physical form may be \"Any\" unsealed byproduct material permitted by 10 CFR 35.300. The total amount requested must be specified.

The maximum activity fora single source or source loading may not exceed the activity specified by the manufacturer forthe specific device and source combination as stated in the Sealed Source and DeviceRegistration (SSDR) Certificate. However, an applicant may request a maximum activity for the source in the shipping container that exceeds the maximum activity allowed in the device. Torequest this authorization, applicants should provide certification that the source transport container is approved for the requested activity. A source that is received with a higher activitythan permitted in the device must be allowed to decay to or below the licensed activity limitprior to installation in the device. Calibration, Transmission, and Reference Sources : For calibration, transmission, and reference sources covered under 10 CFR 35.65, the specific sources do not need to be listed onthe license as long as the licensee is authorized pursuant to 10 CFR 35.11 for medical use ofbyproduct material.CONTENTS OF AN NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Shielding Material/Depleted Uranium : Some high activity radionuclide generators used to produce byproduct materials for 35.200 and 35.300 uses (e.g., Tc-99m generators) may includedepleted uranium (i.e., uranium depleted in uranium-235 (U-235)) as shielding material. If agenerator has depleted uranium shielding, an applicant should request authorization to possessdepleted uranium as shielding material. Applicants receiving large therapy sources and devicesalso should determine if depleted uranium is used to shield the therapy sources and devices. Ifapplicable, the applicant should request authorization to possess depleted uranium (i.e., uraniumdepleted in uranium-235 (U-235)) in quantities sufficient to include shielding material in boththe device(s) and source containers used for source exchange and shielding for other devices. The applicant should review the manufacturer's specifications for each device specified in thelicense request to determine: (1) if depleted uranium is used to shield the source(s) within thedevice; and (2) the total quantity of depleted uranium present in the device (in kilograms). Theapplicant should also consult the manufacturer's specifications or the source supplier todetermine if depleted uranium is contained in shielding source containers used during sourceexchange, as well as the total quantity of depleted uranium in such containers (in kilograms). The following format may be used: Byproduct Material Chemical/ Physical Form Maximum Amount Depleted Uranium Metal 999 kilograms Other Material : The applicant should make a separate entry for other items that need to be listed (e.g., more byproduct material for in vitro testing than is allowed under 10 CFR 31.11, survey meter calibration source, dosimetry system constancy check source, material for in vitro , animal, or human research studies). The following format may be used: Byproduct Material Chemical/ Physical Form Maximum Amount Any byproduct material permitted by 10 CFR 31.11Prepackaged kits 50 millicuries Sources that are authorized by 10 CFR 35.65, \"A uthorization for calibration, transmission, and reference sources,\" should not be listed. Applicants should number each line entry consecutively, following the 10 CFR Part 35 material. Blood Irradiators : If the use of a device to irradiate blood is anticipated, the applicant should review NUREG-1556, Vol. 5, \"Program-Specifi c Guidance About Self-Shielded Irradiator Licensees.\" When determining both individual radionuclide and total quantities, all materials to be possessed at any one time under the license should be included [i.e., materials received awaiting use (newteletherapy or brachytherapy sources for exchange), materials in use or possessed, material usedfor shielding, and materials classified as waste awaiting disposal or held for decay-in-storage]. Response from Applicant : The applicant should submit the information as described above.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-10Part 35 Applicability 100 200300400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T8.6 ITEM 5: SEALED SOURCES AND DEVICES Regulations : 10 CFR 30.32(g); 10 CFR 30.33(a)(2); 10 CFR 32.210. Criteria : In accordance with 10 CFR 30.32(g), applicants must provide the manufacturer's name and model number for eachrequested sealed source and device (except for calibration,transmission, and reference sources authorized by 10 CFR35.65). Licensees will be authorized to possess and use onlythose sealed sources and devices specifically a pproved or registered by NRC or an Agreement State. Discussion : NRC or an Agreement State performs a safety evaluation of sealed sources and devices before authorizing a manufacturer to distribute the sources or devices to specific licensees. The safety evaluation is documented in an SSDR Certificate. Applicants mustprovide the manufacturer's name and model number for each requested sealed source and deviceso that NRC can verify that they have been evaluated in an SSDR Certificate or specifically approved on a license. Applicants should include all possible new sources they might use, inorder to minimize the need for license amendments if they change model or vendor. If such areview has not been conducted for the specific source/device model(s), licensees should requesta copy of the latest version of NUREG-1556, Vol. 3, Rev. 1, \"Consolidated Guidance aboutMaterials Licensees: Applications for Sealed Source and Device Evaluation and Registration\" from NRC Regional Office and submit the information requested therein to NRC for review. An applicant may consult with the proposed supplier or manufacturer to ensure that requested sources and devices are compatible with each other and that they conform to the SSDRdesignations registered with NRC or an Agreemen t State. Licensees may not make any changes to the sealed source, device, or source-device combination that would alter the description orspecifications from those indicated in the re spective SSDR certificates without obtaining NRC's prior permission in a license amendment. To ensure that sealed sources and devices are used inways that comply with the SSDR Registry and registration certificates, applicants may want to obtain copies of the appropriate sections of the Registry certificates and review or discuss them with the manufacturer. The SSD Registry comp ilation of these registration certificates may be found at <http://www.hsrd.ornl.gov/nrc/sources/index.cfm>. Response from Applicant : If possession of sealed source(s) or device(s) is requested, the applicant shall submit the information described above.

Criteria : All licensees are required to maintain records important to decommissioning. Licensees authorized to possess licensedmaterial in excess of the limits specified in 10 CFR 30.35 mustprovide evidence of financial assurance for decommissioning. Discussion : All licensees are required, under 10 CFR 30.35(g), to maintain records important to decommissioning in an identified location. These records must, in part, identify all areas wherelicensed material is (or was) used or stored and any information relevant to spills (e.g., wherecontamination remains after cleanup procedures or when there is a reasonable likelihood thatcontaminants may have spread) and leaking sealed sources. As an alternative to the potentialneed for site characterizations, some licensees prefer to maintain information on surveys andleak tests on an ongoing basis and as a low-cost means of providing evidence and assurance ofan appropriate decommissioning status upon the termination of licensed activities and/or releaseof a site for non-licensed use. Pursuant to 10 CFR 30.35(g), licensees must transfer the recordsimportant to decommissioning either to the new licensee before licensed activities are transferredor assigned in accordance with 10 CFR 30.34(b), and must transfer records to the appropriateNRC Regional Office before the license is terminated (see 30.51(b)). Licensees using sealed sources authorized by 10 CFR 35 generally use licensed material in a manner that would preclude releases into the environment, would not cause the activation ofadjacent materials, or would not contaminate work areas. The licensee's most recent leak testshould demonstrate that there has been no leakage from the sealed sources while the sealedsources were in the licensee's possession. However, any leakage of the sealed source in excessof the regulatory limits would warrant further NRC review of decommissioning procedures on a case-by-case basis. Licensees authorized to possess byproduct material in excess of the limits specified in 10 CFR 30.35 must also provide evidence of financial assurance for decommissioning. The requirementsfor financial assurance are specific to the types and quantities of byproduct material authorizedon a license. Some medical use applicants and licensees may not need to take any action tocomply with the financial assurance requirements because their total inventory of licensedmaterial does not exceed the limits in 10 CFR 30.35 or because the half-life of the unsealedbyproduct material used does not exceed 120 days. Applicants requesting licensed material witha half-life in excess of 120 days should determine whether financial assurance is necessary. Inaddition, applicants requesting more than one radionuclide must use the sum-of-the-ratiosmethod to determine if financial assurance is needed.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-12Applications for authorization to possess and use unsealed byproduct material with a half-life exceeding 120 days must be accompanied by a decommissioning funding plan or certification offinancial assurance when the trigger quantities given in 30.35(a) are exceeded. Acceptablemethods of providing financial assurance include trust funds, escrow accounts, governmentfunds, certificates of deposit, deposits of governme nt securities, surety bonds, letters of credit, lines of credit, insurance policies, parent company guarantees, self guarantees, external sinkingfunds, statements of intent, special arrangements with government entities, and standby trustfunds. NUREG-1757, Vol. 3, \"Consolidated NMSS Decommissioning Guidance: Timeliness, Appendix A\" dated September 2003 containsacceptable wording for each mechanism authorized by the regulation to guarantee or securefunds. NRC will authorize sealed source possession exceeding the limits given in 10 CFR 30.35(d) without requiring decommissioning financial assurance, for the purpose of normal sealed sourceexchange, for no more than 30 days. Determining Need for Financia l Assurance for Decommissioning The half-lives of unsealed byproduct material used by medical licensees have traditionally been less than 120 days. Therefore, most medical use applicants need only consider licensed materialin sealed sources to evaluate the need for financial assurance. Use Table 8.1 to determine iffinancial assurance is required for the sealed sources listed. If requesting sealed sources otherthan those listed or any other unsealed byproduct material with a half-life greater than 120 days,refer to 10 CFR 30.35 and Appendix B to Part 30 for possession limits requiring financialassurance. The sum of the fractions procedure is also depicted in Table 8.1 and must be used todetermine the need for financial assurance for both sealed and unsealed byproduct material.

The convers ion to the International System of units (SI) is: 1 Curie = 37 gigabecquerel. As 10 CFR 30.35 describes, if the sum of the fractions is greater than or equal to 1, the applicant will need to submit a decommissioning funding plan or financial assurance, as applicable. Response from Applicants : No response is needed from most applicants. If financial assurance is required, applicants must submit evidence as described above and as provided for in NUREG-1757, Vol. 3.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-13 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TReference : See the Notice of Availability on the inside front cover of this report to obtain copies of NUREG-, 1757, Vol. 3, \"Consolidated NMSS Decommissioning Guidance: FinancialAssurance, Recordkeeping, and Timeliness\" dated September 2003. 8.8 ITEM 6: PURPOSE(S) FOR WHICH LICENSED MATERIAL WILL BE USED Regulations : 10 CFR 30.33(a)(1); 10 10 CFR Part 35 divides byproduct material for medical use into seven types of use as follows: 10 CFR 35.100 Medical Use of Unsealed Byproduct Ma terial for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion Studies for Which a Written Directive is Not Required 10 CFR 35.200 Medical Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material for Imaging and Localization Studies for Which a Written Directive is Not Required 10 CFR 35.300 Medical Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material for Which a Written Directive is Required 10 CFR 35.400 Medical Use of Sources for Manual Brachytherapy10 CFR 35.500 Medical Use of Sealed Sources for Diagnosis10 CFR 35.600 Medical Use of a Sealed Source(s) in a Device for Therapy-Teletherapy Unit Medical Use of a Sealed Source(s) in a Device for Therapy-Remote Afterloader UnitMedical Use of a Sealed Source(s) in for Therapy-Gamma Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit 10 CFR 35.1000 Other Medical Uses of Byproduct Ma terial or Radiation from Byproduct Material Discussion : 35.100, 35.200, and 35.300 Use : For 35.100, 35.200, and 35.300 use, the applicant should define the purpose of use by stating the applicable section of 10 CFR Part 35 (e.g., 10 CFR 35.100, 10 CFR 35.200) and the description of the applicable modality (e.g., any uptake,dilution, and excretion procedure for which a written directive is not required). The use of unsealed byproduct material in th erapy (10 CFR 35.300) involves administering a byproduct material, either orally or by injection, to treat or palliate a particular disease. Themost common form of use of unsealed byproduct material for therapy is the treatment ofhyperthyroidism with iodine-131 (I-131) sodium i odide. Other therapeutic procedures include, for example, ablation of thyroid cancer metastasis , treatment of malignant effusions, treatment of polycythemia vera and leukemia, palliation of bone pain in cancer patients, and radiationsynovectomy for rheumatoid arthritis patients. References to particular diagnostic or treatmentmodalities in this section are intended to be examples and are not intended to imply thatlicensees are limited to these uses.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-14If an applicant's request is limited to I-131 under 10 CFR 35.300, the license will be limited to that radionuclide. 35.400 Use : For 35.400 use, the applicant should define the purpose of use by stating the applicable section of 10 CFR Part 35 (i.e., 10 CFR 35.400). If a source is to be used in a device, applicants may need to define the purpose of use by describing the manufacturer's name andmodel number of the device. The licensee should relate the sealed sources listed in Item 5 to thedevices described in this item. In manual brachytherapy several types of treatments are available. These may include, for example: CInterstitial Treatment of Cancer. CEye Plaque Implants. This is considered interstitial, not topical, treatment. CIntracavitary Treatment of Cancer. For purposes of NRC's sealed source and deviceevaluation on radiation safety issues, intraluminal use is considered analogous tointracavitary use. CTopical (Surface) Applications. 35.500 Use : For 10 CFR 35.500 use, the applicant should define the purpose of use by stating the applicable section of 10 CFR 35 (i.e., 10 CFR 35.500) and describing the manufacturer'sname(s) and model number(s) of devices containing sealed sources (where applicable). Thelicensee should correlate the sealed sources listed in Item 5 with the devices described in thisitem. Typically, a licensee should use the sealed sources according to manufacturer's radiationsafety and handling instructions and must use the sources as approved in the SSDR. 35.600 Use : For 10 CFR 35.600 use, the applicant should define the purpose of use by stating the applicable section of 10 CFR Part 35.600 (e .g., teletherapy, remote afterloading, GSR) and describing the manufacturer's name(s) and model number(s) of the device containing a sealedsource(s) (e.g., for use in a Manufacturer's Name and Unit Type, Model xxxx radiation therapyunit for the treatment of humans). The applicant should correlate the sealed source(s) listed inItem 5 with the device described in this item. If applicable, the applicant should state thatdepleted uranium is used as shielding for the device and specify that an additional source isrequested to be stored in its shipping container incident to source replacement. 35.1000 Use : Applicants must apply for authorization to use byproduct material, or radiation therefrom, in medical applications under \u00a735.1000 when the type of use is not covered under\u00a7\u00a7 35.100-35.600. When applying for use under provisions of 10 CFR 35.1000, applicants should describe the purpose of use and submit the information required under Section 35.12(b) through (d), reviewregulatory requirements in other Subparts of 10 CFR Part 35, and use them as a guide on how to determine what should be included in an application that is required in \u00a735.12 ,. It is anticipated that many of the uses of byproduct material under the provisions of \u00a735.1000 may involveCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-15 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 Tresearch or product development; thus, applicants should ensure review and compliance with 10 CFR 35.6, \"Provisions for the protection of human research subjects,\"and 10 CFR 35.7, \"FDA, other Federal, and State requirements.\" Use of byproduct material in a source or device afterapproval by U.S. Food and Drug Administration, e.g., under an IDE (investigational deviceexemption) or an IND (investigational new drug exemption), does not relieve individuals of the responsibility to obtain a license to use the byproduct material in medicine under the provisionsof 10 CFR Part 35. If the source for the type of use sought under 35.1000 is a sealed source, Section 8.6 of this guide describes the information that must be provided at the time of application. Broad scope licenseesare exempted under 35.15(a) from requirements of 35.12(d) (which relates to including certain information in an application about radiation safety aspects of medical use under 35.1000). However, broad scope licensees should make sure that the quantity needed for the proposed useis authorized on their license or apply for an increase if not. Applicants should refer to IN 99-024, \"Broad-Scope Licensees' Responsibilities for Reviewing and Approving UnregisteredSealed Sources and Devices\" for more information on sealed sources. Applicants for uses under 35.1000 should consult with their Regional Office to discuss the contents of their application. Non-Medical Uses : Applicants may also describe non-medical uses (e.g., survey meter calibrations with NIST traceable brachytherapy sources) and reference the applicable radioactivematerial provided in response to Item 5. Response from Applicant : The applicant must submit information regarding the purpose for which the licensed material will be used. The applicant should consider including theinformation described above, as applicable to the type of use(s) proposed. 8.9 ITEM 7: INDIVIDUAL(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR RADIATION SAFETY PROGRAMAND THEIR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE Regulations : 10 CFR CFR35.690. Criteria : The RSO, AUs, AMPs, and ANPs must have adequate training and experience. Discussion : 10 CFR 35.24 provides the requirements regarding the authority and responsibilities for the radiation protection program, including those of the licensee'smanagement and the RSO appointed by licensee management. Other personnel who have a rolein the radiation protection program are AUs, AMPs, ANPs, and members of the RSC (if the licensee is required to establish a RSC). In 10 CFR 30.33(a)(3), NRC requires that an applicantCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-16be qualified by training and experience to use licensed materials for the purposes requested in such a manner as to protect health and minimize danger to life or property. Subparts B, D, E, F,G, H, and J of 10 CFR Part 35 give specific cr iteria for acceptable training and experience for AUs for medical use, ANPs, the RSO, and AMPs. A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a curriculum vitae is likely to be insufficient because such documents usually do not supply all the information needed to evaluate an individual's training and experience for NRCpurposes. Applicants should ensure that they submit the specific training information requiredby NRC regulations in Part 35. NRC Form 313A provides a convenient format for submittingthis information. Licensees are responsible for their radiation protection programs; it is essential that strong management control and oversight exist to ensure that licensed activities are conducted properly. The licensee's management must appoint an RSO, who agrees in writing to be responsible forimplementing the radiation protection program, a nd must provide the RSO sufficient authority, organizational freedom, time, resources, and management prerogative to communicate withpersonnel and direct personnel regarding NRC regulations and license provisions, including: identifying radiation safety problems; initiati ng, recommending, or providing corrective actions; stopping unsafe operations; and verifying the implementation of corrective actions. Nevertheless, the licensee retains the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of licensedactivities. Licensees that are authorized for two or more different types of uses of byproduct material under Subparts E, F, and H, or two or more types of units under Subpart H are required under 10 CFR35.24(f) to establish a Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) to oversee all uses of byproductmaterial permitted by the license. Membership of the committee must include an authorized userfor each type of use permitted by the license, the Radiation Safety Officer, a representative of thenursing service, and a representative of management who is neither an authorized user nor theRadiation Safety Officer. The committee may include other members the licensee considersappropriate. Licensees may contract for medical use services, including those involving patient services. However, the licensee should not assume that by hiring a contractor to provide certain services ithas satisfied all regulatory requirements or that it has transferred responsibility for the licensedprogram to the contractor. Licensee management should ensure that adequate mechanisms foroversight are in place to determine that the radiation protection program, including training of contractor staff, is effectively implemented by the appropriate individuals. Training for experienced RSO, teletherapy or medical physicist, authorized user or nuclear pharmacist; recentness of training. 10 CFR 35.57 provides that experienced individuals, who may be candidates to serve as RSO, AMP, or ANP, are not required to meet the requirements ofSections 35.50, 35.51, or 35.55, respectively, (are \"grandfathered\") under certain conditions,e.g., the individual is named on an NRC or Agreem ent State license. AUs are also not required to meet the requirements in Subparts D-H of 10 CFR Part 35 under certain conditions, e.g., ifthey are named on an NRC or Agreement State License. The individuals must have been namedon a license or permit before the applicable date in Section 35.57. Regulations in 10 CFR 35.59require that the training and experience specifi ed in 10 CFR 35 Subparts B, D-H, and J mustCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-17 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 Thave been obtained within 7 years preceding the date of application or the individual must have related continuing education and experience. Response from Applicant : Refer to the subsequent sections specific to the individuals described above. 8.10 ITEM 7: RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER (RSO) Regulations : 10 CFR : RSOs must have adequate training and experience. The training and experience requirements for the RSO aredescribed in 10 CFR 35.50 or 35.900 and allow for followingtraining pathways: CCertification as provided in 10 CFR 35.50(a) by a speciality board whose certificationprocess has been recognized by the Commission or an Agreement State, plus writtenattestation signed by a preceptor RSO as provi ded in 35.50(d) and training as specified in 35.50(e); or Completion of classroom and laboratory tr aining (200 hours) and 1 year of full time radiation safety experience as described in 10 CFR 35.50(b)(1) plus written attestation signedby a preceptor RSO as provided in 35.50(d) and training as specified in 35.50(e); or CCertification as provided in 10 CFR 35.50(c)(1) as a medical physicist under 35.51(a), pluswritten attestation signed by a preceptor RS O as provided in 35.50(d) and training as specified in 35.50(e); or CIdentification as provided in 10 CFR 35.50(c)(2) on the licensee's license as an AU, AMP, orANP with experience in the radiation safety aspects of similar types of byproduct materialuse for which the individual has RSO responsibilities, plus training as specified in 35.50(e);or Until October 24, 2005, certification as provided in 10 CFR 35.900(a) for certifications listed in 10 CFR 35.900(a); or classroom and laborator y training and experience as specified in 10 CFR 35.900(b)(1) and one year of full time experience as specified in10 CFR 35.900(b)(2); or identification as an authorized user on the licensee's license asspecified in 10 CFR 35.900(c). The licensee must also establish, in writing, the authority, duties, and responsibilities of the RSOas required by 10 CFR 35.24(b).CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-18Discussion : The RSO is responsible for day-to-day oversight of the radiation protection program. In accordance with 10 CFR 35.24, the licensee must provide the RSO sufficientauthority, organizational freedom, time, and resources to perform his or her duties. Additionally,the RSO must have a sufficient commitment from management to fulfill the duties andresponsibilities specified in 10 CFR 35.24 to ensure that radioactive materials are used in a safemanner. The NRC requires the name of the RSO on the license, and an agreement in writingfrom the RSO, to ensure that licensee management has identified a responsible, qualified personand that the named individual knows of his or her designation and assumes the responsibilities ofan RSO. Usually, the RSO is a full-time employee of the licensed facility. The NRC has authorized individuals who are not employed by the licensee, such as a consultant, to fill the role of RSO orto provide support to the facility RSO. In orde r to fulfill the duties and responsibilities, the RSO should be on site periodically to conduct meaningful, person-to-person interactions with licenseestaff, commensurate with the scope of licensed activities, to satisfy requirements of 10 CFR35.24. Appendix I contains a model RSO Delegati on of Authority. Appendix B contains NRC Form NRC 313A, which can be used to document the RSO's training and experience. RSO Responsibilities : Some of the typical duties and responsibilities of RSOs include ensuring the following: CUnsafe activities involving licensed materials are stopped; CRadiation CMaterial accountability and disposal; CInteraction with NRC; CTimely and and maintenance of appropriate records; program audits; CProper use and and CInvestigation of incidents involving byproduct material (e.g., medical events). Appendix I contains a detailed list of typical duties and responsibilities of the RSO.Applicants are reminded of recentness of training requirements described in 10 CFR 35.59. Specifically, RSO applicants must have successfully completed the applicable training andexperience criteria described in 10 CFR Part 35 within 7 years preceding the date of theapplication. Alternatively, RSO applicants must have had related continuing education andexperience since completing the required training and experience.

Criteria : Training and experience requirements for AUs are described in 10 CFR 35.190, CFR Part 35 Subpart J. Discussion : The responsibilities of AUs involved in medical use include the following: CRadiation safety commensurate with use of byproduct material; CAdministration of a radiation dose or dosage and how it is prescribed; CDirection of individuals under the AU's supervision in the preparation of byproduct material for medical use and in the medical use of byproduct material; CPreparation of WDs, if required.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-23 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Applicants must meet recentness of trai ning requirements described in 10 CFR 35.59. AU applicants must have successfully completed the applicable training and experience criteriadescribed in 10 CFR Part 35 within 7 years preceding the date of the application. Alternatively,applicants must have had related continuing education and experience since completing therequired training and experience. This time provision applies to board certification as well as toother training pathways. Section 35.57 of 10 CFR Part 35 provides that experienced AUs who are named on a license or permit are not required to comply with the training requirements in Subparts D through H tocontinue performing those medical uses for which they were authorized before the effective dateof changes to the regulations in Section 35.57 (check the regulations to determine this date). Forexample, a physician who was authorized to use sodium iodine-131 for imaging and localization,involving greater than 30 microcuries (a quantity for which a written directive is required under10 CFR 35.40), would continue to be authorized for this use. Technologists, therapists, or other personnel may use byproduct material for medical use under an AU's supervision in accordance with 10 CFR 35.27, \"Supervision,\" and in compliance withapplicable FDA, other Federal, and State re quirements (10 CFR 35.7). Examples include FDA requirements for conduct of certain types of clinical research after submission of applications for INDs (Investigational New Drugs) and under the auspices of a Radioactive Drug ResearchCommittee (21 CFR 361.1). There is no NRC requirement that an AU must render an interpretation of a diagnostic image or results of a therapeutic procedure. NRC recognizes that the AU may or may not be the physicianwho interprets such studies. Additionally, NRC regulations do not restrict who can read and interpret diagnostic scans or the results of therapeutic procedures involving the administration ofbyproduct material to individuals. AU's for Non-Medical Uses : For in vitro studies, animal research, calibration of survey instruments, and other uses that do not involve the intentional exposure of humans, the list ofproposed AUs should include the individuals who will actually be responsible for the safe use ofthe byproduct material for the requested use. An applicant should note which user will be involved with a particular use by referring to Items 5 and 6 of the application and providing informa tion about the user's training and experience. Authorized non-medical use or uses that do not involve the intentional exposure of humans (e.g., in vitro and animal research, calibration, dosimetry research) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 4 The names of board certifications that have been recognized by the NRC or an Agreement State are posted on the NRC's web page <http://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/med-use-toolkit.html>.

A written description should be submitted for simple changes. For teletherapy units, it may be necessary to restrict use of the unit's primary beam if the treatment room's walls, ceiling, or floor will not adequately shield adjacent areas from direct orscattered radiation. Electrical, mechanical, or other physical means (rather than administrativecontrols) must be used to limit movement or rotation of the unit (e.g., electrical or mechanicalstops). Some applicants have found it helpful to have a sample response for guidance. Thefollowing is an example of an acceptable response on the use of a rotational unit with an integral beam absorber (also called a beam catcher). C\"For the primary beam directed toward the integral beam absorber, electrical or mechanicalstops are set so that the primary beam must be centered (within plus or minus 2 degrees) onthe integral beam absorber and, in that configuration, the attenuated primary beam may berotated 360 degrees pointing toward the floor, east wall, ceiling, and west wall.\" C\"For the primary beam directed away from the integral beam absorber, electrical ormechanical stops permit the unattenuated primary beam to be directed in a 95-degree arcfrom 5 degrees toward the west wall to vertically down toward the floor to 90 degrees towardthe east wall.\" Experience has shown that, given this type of example, many applicants can make changes to accommodate their own situations (e.g., use of a vertical unit, use of a rotational unit without anintegral beam absorber).

Criteria : All licensees shall possess calibrated radiation detection and measuring instruments that will be used forradiation protection, including survey and monitoringinstruments and quantitative measuring instruments needed tomonitor the adequacy of radioactive materials containment and contamination control. Discussion : The radiation protection program that licensees are required to develop, document, and implement in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101 must include provisions for surveyinstrument calibration (10 CFR 20.1501). Licensees shall possess instruments used to measureradiation levels, radioactive contamination, and radioactivity, as applicable. Instruments usedfor quantitative radiation measurements must be calibrated for the radiation measured. Theinstruments should be available for use at all times when byproduct material is in use. Thelicensee should possess survey instruments sufficiently sensitive to measure the type and energyof radiation used, including survey instruments used to locate low energy or low activity seeds(e.g., I-125, Pd-103) if they become dislodged in the operating room or patient's room. Usually, it is not necessary for a licensee to possess a survey meter solely for use during sealed source diagnostic procedures, since it is not expected that a survey be performed each time sucha procedure is performed. In these cases, it is acceptable for the meter to be available on shortnotice in the event of an accident or malfuncti on that could reduce the shielding of the sealed source(s). Surveys may be required to verify source integrity of the diagnostic sealed source andto ensure that dose rates in unrestricted areas and public and occupational doses are withinregulatory limits. Survey meter calibrations must be performed by persons, including licensed personnel, who are qualified to perform calibrations. One method a licensee may use to determine if the service isqualified to perform these activities is to determine that it has an NRC (or an equivalentAgreement State) license. Alternatively, an applicant may choose to develop, implement, andCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-36maintain procedures to ensure instruments are calibrated, or propose an alternate method for calibration. Appendix K provides guidance regarding appropriate instrumentation and model survey instrument calibration procedures to meet the requirements detailed in 10 CFR 35.61. Response from Applicant : Provide the following: CA statement that: \"Radiation monitoring instruments will be calibrated by a person qualified to perform survey meter calibrations.\" AND/OR CA statement that: \"We have developed and will implement and maintain written survey meter calibration procedures in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR 20.1501 and that meetthe requirements of 10 CFR 35.61.\" AND CA description of the instrumentation (e.g. ga mma counter, solid state detector, portable or stationary count rate meter, portable or stationary dose rate or exposure rate meter, single ormultichannel analyzer, liquid scintillation counter, proportional counter) that will be used toperform required surveys. AND CA statement that: \"We reserve the right to upgrade our survey instruments as necessary as long as they are adequate to measure the type and level of radiation for which they are used.\" Note : If calibrations will not be performed by the licensee or by a person qualified to perform survey meter calibration, the applicant should propose an alternate method of calibration forreview by NRC.

Discussion : As described in 10 CFR 35.63, dosage measurement is required for licensees who prepare patient dosages. CIf the licensee uses only unit dosages made by a manufacturer or preparer licensed under 10CFR 32.72, (and does not split, combine, or otherwise modify unit dosages) the licensee isnot required to possess an instrument to measure the dosage. Furthermore, licensees mayrely on the provider's dose label for the measurement of the dosage and decay-correct thedosage to the time of administration. CIf the licensee performs direct measuremen ts of dosages in accordance with 10 CFR 35.63 (e.g., prepares its own dosages, breaks up unit dosages for patient administration, or decidesto measure unit dosages) the licensee is required to possess and calibrate all instruments usedfor measuring patient dosages. Currently, no NRC-regulated alpha-emitting nuclides are used in unsealed form in medicine. This document, therefore, does not provide guidance on the measurement of these radionuclides. Equipment used to measure dosages must be calibrated in accordance with nationally recognized standards (e.g., ANSI) or the manufacturer's instructions. The measurement equipment may be awell ion chamber, a liquid scintillation counter, etc., as long as the instrument can be calibratedappropriately and is both accurate and reliable. For other than unit dosages, the activity must be determined by direct measurement, by a combination of radioactivity measurement and mathematical calculation, or by a combination ofvolumetric measurement and mathematical calculation. However, there are inherent technicaldifficulties to overcome. For beta-emitting radionuclides, these difficulties include dependenceon geometry, lack of an industry standard for materials used in the manufacture of vials andsyringes, and lack of a NIST-traceable standard for some radionuclides used. For instance, whendetermining the dosage of P-32, assays with a dose calibrator may result in inaccuracies causedby inherent variations in geometry; therefore, a volumetric measurement and mathematicalcalculation may be more accurate. Licensees must assay patient dosages in the same type of vialand geometry as used to determine the correct dose calibrator settings. Using different vials orCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, 1 8-38Part 35 Applicability 100 200300400 T* 500600 T* 1000 T Special requirements re: brachytherapy and LDRafterloader sources and Sr-90sources.syringes may result in measurement errors due, for example, to the variation of bremsstrahlung created by interaction between beta particles and the differing dosage containers. Licensees arereminded that beta emitters should be shielded using a low-atomic-numbered material tominimize the production of bremsstrahlung. When a high activity source is involved,consideration should be given to adding an outer shield made from material with a high atomic number to attenuate bremsstrahlung. Response from Applicant : If applicable, provide the following: CA statement that: \"Equipment used to measure dosages will be calibrated in accordance with nationally recognized standards or the manufacturer's instructions.\" 8.18 ITEM 9: THERAPY UNIT \u2014 CALIBRATION 10 35.2645. Criteria : The above regulations contain NRC requirements, including recordkeeping requirements, for verification andperiodic spot-checks of source activity or output. To performthese measurements, the applicant must possess appropriatelycalibrated dosimetry equipment. For manual brachtherapysources and LDR remote afterloader sources licensees may use source activity or outputdetermined by the manufacturer, provided that the manufacturer's measurements meet applicablerequirements. Discussion : Except for manual brachytherapy sources and low dose-rate remote afterloader sources where the source output or activity is determined by the manufacturer in accordance with10 CFR Part 35, the applicant must possess a calibrated dosimetry system (e.g., Farmer chamber,electrometer, well-type ionization chamber) that will be used to perform calibrationmeasurements of sealed sources to be used for patient therapy. Dosimetry systems and/or sealedsources used to calibrate the licensee's dosimetry systems must be traceable to NIST or to alaboratory accredited by AAPM, pursuant to 10 CFR 35.630. The licensee must maintainrecords of calibrations of dosimetry equipment for the duration of the license. The licensee's AMP must perform full calibrations of sealed sources and devices used for therapy in accordance with published protocols currently accepted by nationally recognizedbodies (e.g., AAPM, ACR, ANSI). (Note: Calibration by an AMP is not required for manualbrachytherapy sources, except for calculating the activity of strontium-90 sources.) Thelicensee's AMP must calculate the activity of each strontium-90 source that is used to determinethe treatment times for ophthalmic treatments. In addition, the licensee must perform spot-checkmeasurements of sealed sources and devices used for therapy in accordance with writtenprocedures established by the AMP (10 CFR 35.642, 10 CFR 35.643, and 10 CFR 35.645). CONTENTS AN APPLICATION 7 For brachytherapy sources, \"first medical use\" is defined as the first use following the effective date of the revised 10 CFR Part 35, October 24, 2002. 8-39 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Calibration procedures described by the AAP M or any published protocol approved by a nationally recognized body, as applicable, may be used. The calibration procedures shouldaddress, in part: CThe method used to determine the exposure rate (or activity) under specific criteria(i.e., distances used for the measurement, whether the measurement is an \"in air\"measurement or done using a phantom configuration of the chamber with respect to thesource(s) and device, scatter factors used to compute the exposure rate, etc.). Full calibrations must be performed before first medical use 7, whenever spot-check measurements (if required) indicate that the output differs by more than 5% from the output obtained at the last full calibration corrected mathematically for decay, following replacement ofthe sources or reinstallation of the unit in a new location not previously described in the license,following any repairs of the unit that include removal of sealed sources or major repair of thecomponents associated with the source exposure assembly, and at intervals as defined in 10 CFR35.632, 10 CFR 35.633, and 10 CFR 35.635. Manual brachytherapy sources must be calibratedonly initially, prior to use. For sealed sources used in therapy, and in particular, for new types of use, licensees should select dosimetry equipment that will accurately measure the output or the activity of the source.

Criteria : Facilities and equipment must be adequate to protect health and minimize danger to life or property. Discussion : The applicant should describe, in Item 9 of the application, other equipment and facilities available for safe use and storage of byproduct material listed in Item 5 of thisapplication. This description should be identified as Attachment 9.4. The applicant must describe additional facilities and equipment for the radiopharmaceutical therapy program to safely receive, use, store, and dispose of radioactive material. The applicantshould focus on facilities to be used for radioactive drug therapy administration and patientaccommodations (i.e., private room with private bath). I-131 sodium iodide is the most widelyused source of radiopharmaceutical therapy. If the radionuclide is administered in volatile liquidform, it is important to place the patient dosage in a closed environment (i.e., a fume hood). Also note there are hazards associated with volatile iodine in pill form; applicants shouldconsider this in establishing their radiological controls. When patients are treated with I-131sodium radioidide, sources of contamination in clude airborne I-131, , and HDR facilities , the licensee shall require any individual entering the treatment room to ensure, through the use of appropriate radiation monitors, that radiation levelshave returned to ambient levels. One method of meeting the requirements of 10 CFR 35.615(c)is a beam-on radiation monitor permanently mounted in each therapy treatment room that isequipped with an emergency power supply separate from the power supply for the therapy unit. Such beam-on monitors can provide a visible indication (e.g., flashing light) of an exposed or partially exposed source. Applicants may propose an alternative to a permanently mountedmonitor. 10 CFR 35.615(d) requires that, except for LDR units, each licensee shall construct or equip each treatment room so as to permit continuous observation of the patient while the patient is inthe treatment room. If a shielded viewing window will be used, the thickness, density, and typeof material used should be specified. If a closed-circuit television system (or some otherelectronic system) will be used to view the patient, the backup system or procedure to be used incase the electronic system malfunctions should be specified, or the applicant must commit tosuspending all treatments until the electronic system is repaired and functioning again. Thecommunication system should allow the patient to communicate with the unit operator in theevent of medical difficulties. An open microphone system can be used to allow communicationwithout requiring a patient to move to activate controls.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-41 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1The regulations require adequate equipment and controls to maintain exposures of radiation to workers ALARA and within regulatory limits. 10 CFR 35.615(b), in part, requires that eachdoor leading into the treatment room be provided with an electrical interlock system to control the on-off mechanism of the therapy unit. The interlock system must cause the source(s) to beshielded if the door to the treatment room is opened when the source is exposed. The interlocksystem must also prevent the operator from initiating a treatment cycle unless the treatment roomentrance door is closed. Further, the interlock must be wired so that the source(s) cannot beexposed after interlock interruption until the treatment room door is closed and the source(s)on-off control is reset at the console. Due to the unique characteristics of PDR remote afterloaders and the lack of constant surveillance of their operation, a more sophisticated alarm system is essential to ensure thepatient is protected during treatment. In addition to the above, consider the following: CThe PDR device control console is not accessible to unauthorized personnel during treatment; CA primary care provider checks the patient to ensure that the patient's device has not beenmoved, kinked, dislodged, or disconnected; CA more sophisticated interlock/warning system is normally installed for PDR devices. Thissystem should perform the following functions or possess the following characteristics: - The signal from the PDR device and the signal from the room radiation monitor should be connected in such a manner that an audible alarm sounds if the room monitor indicatesthe presence of radiation and the device indicates a \"safe\" or retracted position; - The alarm circuit should also be wired in such a manner that an audible alarm is generated for any device internal error condition that could indicate the unintendedextension of the source. This would constitute a circuit that generates the audible alarmwhen either the \"source retracted and radiation present\" or appropriate internal errorcondition(s) exist; - The \"source safe and radiation present\" signal should also be self-testing. If a \"source not safe\" input is received without a corresponding \"radiation present\" signal, the circuitshould generate an interlock/warning circuit failure signal that will cause the source toretract. Reset this circuit manually before attempting to continue treatment; - The audible alarm should be sufficiently loud to be clearly heard by the facility's responsible device/patient monitoring staff at all times; and - No provisions for bypassing this alarm circuit or for permanently silencing the alarm should be made to the circuit as long as the room radiation monitor is indicating thepresence of radiation. If any circuitry is provided to mute the audible alarm, suchcircuitry should not mute the alarm for a period of more than 1 minute. Controls thatdisable this alarm circuit or provide for silencing the alarm for periods in excess of 1minute should be prohibited.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-42Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TIf the alarm circuit is inoperative for any reason, licensees should prohibit further treatment of patients with the device until the circuit has been repaired and tested. If the alarm circuit failsduring the course of a patient treatment, the treatment in progress may continue as long as continuous surveillance of the device is provided during each treatment cycle or fraction. Applicants may submit information on alternatives to fixed shielding as part of their facility description. This information must demonstrate that the shielding will remain in place duringthe course of patient treatment. For patient rooms where LDR remote afterloader use is planned, neither a viewing nor an intercom system is required. However, the applicant should describe how the patient and devicewill be monitored during treatment to ensure that the sources and catheter guide tube are notdisturbed during treatment and to provide for pr ompt detection of any operational problems with the LDR device during treatment. Response from Applicant : For manual brachytherapy facilities, provide a description of the emergency response equipment. For teletherapy, GSR, and remote afterloader facilities, providea description of the following: CWarning systems and restricted area controls (e.g., locks, signs, warning lights and alarms, interlock systems) for each therapy treatment room; CArea radiation monitoring equipment; CViewing and intercom systems (except for LDR units); CSteps that will be taken to ensure that no two units can be operated simultaneously, if otherradiation-producing equipment (e.g., linear accelerator, X-ray machine) are in the treatmentroom; CMethods to ensure that whenever the device is not in use or is unattended, the console keyswill be inaccessible to unauthorized persons; and Emergency response equipment. 8.20 ITEM 10: RADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM Regulations : 10 CFR 10 CFR 20.1101 states that each licensee must develop, document, and implement a radiation protectionprogram commensurate with the scope of the licensed activity. The program must be sufficient to ensure compliance with theprovisions of Part 20 regulations. The licensee is responsible for the conduct of all licensedCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-43 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 200300400500600 T 1000 Tactivities and the acts and omissions of indivi duals handling licensed material. 10 CFR 30.34(e) provides that NRC may incorporate into byproduct material licenses, at the time of issuance orthereafter, additional requirements and conditions that it deems appropriate or necessary to, inpart, protect health or to minimize danger to life and property. 10 CFR 35.24 describes thelicensee management's authorities and responsibilities for the radiation protection program. 10CFR 35.26 sets forth four circumstances in which the licensee may revise its radiation protectionprogram without NRC approval. For example, no NRC approval is required when the revision does not require a license amendment. Discussion : Applicants/licensees must abide by all applicable regulations, develop, implement, and maintain procedures when required, and/or provide requested information about theproposed radiation protection program during th e licensing process. Tables C.1 and C.2 in Appendix C may be helpful in determining what information should be provided whenrequesting a license. Response from Applicant : Respond to subsequent sections of this document regarding Item 10 of the application. 8.21 ITEM 10: SAFETY PROCEDURES AND INSTRUCTIONS Regulations : 10 CFR Criteria : Before using materials under 35.600, the applicant must develop, document, submit, and implement written safetyprocedures for emergency response. 10 CFR 35.610 requires, inpart, that written procedures be developed, implemented, andmaintained for responding to an abnormal situation involving aremote afterloader unit, a teletherapy unit, or a gamma stereotactic radiosurgery unit. Theprocedures needed to meet 10 CFR 35.610 must include: CInstructions for responding to equipment failures and the names of the individualsresponsible for implementing corrective actions; CThe process for restricting access to and posting of the treatment area to minimize the risk ofinadvertent exposure; and CThe names and telephone numbers of AUs, AMPs, and the RSO to be contacted if the unit orconsole operates abnormally. A copy of these procedures must be physically located at the therapy unit console. The instructions must inform the operator of procedures to be followed if the operator is unable toplace the source(s) in the shielded position, or remove the patient from the radiation field withcontrols from outside the treatment room.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-44Discussion : The applicant must establish and follow written procedures for emergencies that may occur (e.g., a therapy source fails to retract or return to the shielded position, or a GSRcouch fails to retract). A copy of the manufacturer's recommendations and instructions shouldbe given to each individual performing thera py treatments or operating the therapy device. Practice drills, using nonradioactive (dummy) sources (when possible), must be practicedannually or more frequently, as needed. The drills should include dry runs of emergencyprocedures that cover stuck or dislodged sources and applicators (if applicable), and emergency procedures for removing the patient from the radiation field. Team practice may also beimportant for adequate emergency coordination for such maneuvers as removing a patient from amalfunctioning GSR unit and manual movement of the patient treatment table. Theseprocedures, designed to minimize radiation exposure to patients, workers, and the general publicshould address the following points, as applicable to the type of medical use: CWhen the procedures are to be implemented, such as any circumstance in which the sourcebecomes dislodged, cannot be retracted to a fully shielded position, or the patient cannot beremoved from the beam of radiation. CThe actions specified for emergency source recovery or shielding that primarily considerminimizing exposure to the patient and health care personnel while maximizing safety of thepatient. CThe step-by-step actions for single or multiple failures that specify the individual(s)responsible for implementing the actions. The procedures should clearly specify which stepsare to be taken under different scenarios. The procedure should specify situations in whichsurgical intervention may be necessary and the steps that should be taken in that event. CLocation of emergency source recovery equipm ent and specification of what equipment may be necessary for various scenarios. Emergency equipment should include shielded storagecontainers, remote handling tools, and if appropriate, supplies necessary to surgically removeapplicators or sources from the patient and tools necessary for removal of the patient fromthe device. CGiving first consideration to minimizing exposure to the patient, usually by removing thepatient from the room (rather than using tools to attempt to return the source to the off position). Note : If the first step of the emergency procedures for teletherapy units specifies pressing the emergency bar on the teletherapy unit console, the applicant is advised that thisaction may cause the source to return to the off position but may also cut power to the entireteletherapy unit or to the gantry or the couch. CInstructing the staff to act quickly and calmly, and to avoid the primary beam of radiation. CSpecifying who is to be notified. CRequirements to restrict (lock, as necessary) and post the treatment area with appropriatewarning signs as soon as the patient and staff are out of the treatment room.

Figure 8.2 Annual Occupational Dose Limits for Adults OR CMonitor external and/or internal occupational radiation exposure, if required by 10 CFR Part 20.1502. Discussion : The radiation protection program that licensees are required to develop, document, and implement in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101, must include provisions for monitoringoccupational dose. The licensee must evaluate the exposure of all occupational workers (e.g.,nurses, technologists) to determine if monitoring is required to demonstrate compliance withSubpart F of 10 CFR Part 20. Licensees must consider the internal and external dose and theoccupational workers' assigned duties when evaluating the need to monitor occupationalradiation exposure. Review of dosimetry histor ies for workers previously engaged in similar duties may be helpful in assessing potential doses. When evaluating external dose from xenon gas, the licensee may take credit for the reduction of dose resulting from the use of xenon traps. Additionally, periodic checks of the trap effluentmay be used to ensure proper operation of the xenon trap. Licensees may vent xenon gasdirectly to the atmosphere as long as the effluent concentration is within 10 CFR Part 20 limits.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-46When evaluating dose from aerosols, licensees may take credit for the reduction of dose resulting from the use of aerosol traps. Licensees may vent aerosols directly to the atmosphere as long asthe effluent concentration is within 10 CFR Part 20 limits. Appendix M provides a model procedure for monitoring external occupational exposure.If external dose monitoring is necessary, the applicant should describe the type of personnel dosimetry, such as film badges, optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSL), andthermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), that personnel will use. If occupational workers handlelicensed material, the licensee should evaluate the need to provide extremity monitors, which arerequired if workers are likely to receive a dose in excess of 0.05 Sv (5 rems) shallow-doseequivalent (SDE), in addition to whole-body badges. Additionally, applicants should ensure thattheir personnel dosimetry program contains provisions that personnel monitoring devices beworn so that the part of the body likely to receive the greatest dose will be monitored. Some licensees use self-reading dosimeters in lieu of processed dosimetry. This is acceptable if the regulatory requirements are met. See American National Standards Institute (ANSI) N322,\"Inspection and Test Specifications for Direct and Indirect Reading Quartz Fiber Pocket Dosimeters,\" for more information. If pocket dosimeters are used to monitor personnelexposures, applicants should state the useful range of the dosimeters, along with the proceduresand frequency for their calibration (10 CFR 20.1501(b)). When personnel monitoring is needed, most licensees use either film badges or TLDs that are supplied by a processor holding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the NationalVoluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Under 10 CFR 20.1501, licensees must verify that the processor is accredited by NVLAP for the type of radiation for which monitoringwill be performed. Consult the NVLAP-accredited processor for its recommendations forexchange frequency and proper use. It may be necessary to assess the intake of radioactivity for occupationally exposed individuals in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1204 and 20.1502. If internal dose assessment is necessary, theapplicant shall measure the following: CConcentrations of radioactive material in air in work areas; or CQuantities of radionuclides in the body; radionuclides excreted from the body; or CCombinations of these measurements. The applicant should describe in its procedures the criteria used to determine the type of bioassay and the frequencies at which bioassay (both in vivo and in vitro ) will be performed to evaluate intakes. The criteria also should describe how tables of investigational levels arederived, including the methodology used by the evaluated internal dose assessments, i.e., theempirical models used to interpret the raw bioassay data. The bioassay procedures shouldprovide for baseline, routine, emergency, and follow-up bioassays. If a commercial bioassayservice will be used, the applicant should ensure that the service is licensed by an NRC (or anequivalent Agreement State) license or provi de another alternative for NRC to review.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8 67 FR 16298 8-47 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1RG 8.9, Revision 1, \"Acceptable Concepts, Models, Equations, and Assumptions for a Bioassay Program,\" and NUREG/CR-4884, \"Interpretati on of Bioassay Measurements,\" outline acceptable criteria that applicants may use in developing their bioassay programs.

Criteria : Licensees are required to make surveys of potential radiological hazards in their workplace. For example, licenseesmust perform surveys to: CEnsure that licensed material will be used, transported, and stored in such a way that doses tomembers of the public do not exceed 1 mSv per year (100 millirem/year) and that the dose inany unrestricted area will not exceed 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any 1 hour from licensedoperations; CEnsure that licensed material will be used, transported, and stored in such a way thatoccupational doses to individuals will not exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR 20.1201; and CControl and maintain constant surveillance over licensed material that is not in storage andsecure licensed material from unauthorized access or removal. CEnsure that licensed material will be used, transported, and stored in such a way that the airemissions do not exceed the constraint value in 10 CFR 20.1101. Discussion : The radiation protection program that licensees are required to develop, document, and implement in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101 must include provisions for area surveys. Surveys are evaluations of radiological conditions and potential hazards. These evaluations maybe measurements (e.g., radiation levels measured with survey instrument or results of wipe testsfor contamination), calculations, or a combination of measurements and calculations. Theselection and proper use of appropriate instruments is one of the most important factors inensuring that surveys accurately assess radiological conditions.CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION 8-49 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1There are many different kinds of surveys performed by licensees: CContamination: -F i x use, transfer, or disposal of licensed material). Surveys are required when it is reasonable under the circumstances to evaluate a radiological hazard and when necessary for the licensee to comply with the appropriate regulations. Themost important types of surveys are as follows: CSurveys for radioactive contamination that could be present on surfaces of floors, walls,laboratory furniture, and equipment; CMeasurements of radioactive material concentrations in air for areas whereradiopharmaceuticals are handled or processed in unsealed form and where operations couldexpose workers to the inhalation of radioactive material (e.g., radioiodine) or where licensedmaterial is or could be released to unrestricted areas; CBioassays to determine the kinds, quantities, or concentrations, and in some cases, thelocation of radioactive material in the human body. Radioiodine uptake in a worker'sthyroid gland is commonly measured by exte rnal counting using a specialized thyroid detection probe; CSurveys of external radiation exposure levels in both restricted and unrestricted areas; and CSurveys of radiopharmaceutical packages entering (e.g., from suppliers) and departing (e.g.,returned radiopharmaceuticals to the supplier). The frequency of routine surveys depends on the nature, quantity, and use of radioactive materials, as well as the specific protective facilities, equipment, and procedures that aredesigned to protect workers and the public from external and internal exposure. Also, thefrequency of the survey depends on the type of survey. Appendix R contains model procedures that represent one acceptable method of establishing survey frequencies for ambient radiationlevel and contamination surveys. For example, licensees are required to perform daily surveys inall areas used for the preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals for which a writtenCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-50Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 500600 1000 Tdirective is required (diagnostic activities exceeding 30 \u00b5Ci of I-131 and all therapy treatments); when the licensee administers radiopharamaceuticals requiring a WD in a patient's room, thelicensee is not required to perform a survey of the patient's room. Licensees should performsurveys after the patient's release. Licensees mu st perform surveys prior to the release of the room for unrestricted use. Licensees should be cognizant of the requirement to perform surveysto demonstrate the public dose limits are not exceeded. Because therapy sealed sources (including applicators and catheters) may become dislodged during implantation or after surgery, and inadvertently lost or removed, the following surveysshall be performed: CImmediately after implanting sources in a patient or a human research subject, the licenseeshall make a survey to locate and account for all sources that have not been implanted; and CImmediately after removing the last temporary implant source from a patient or humanresearch subject, the licensee shall make a survey of the patient or human research subjectwith a radiation detection survey instrument to confirm that all sources have been removed. In addition, licensees should also consider the following: CThe therapy patient's bed linens before removing them from the patient's room; CThe operating room and the patient's room after source implantation (e.g., radiation level and/or visual check); CAll trash exiting the patient's room; and CAreas of public access in and around the patient's room.

Licensees are responsible for developing, documenting, and implementingprocedures to ensure the security and safe use of all licensed material from the time it arrives attheir facilities until it is used, transferred, and/or disposed. The written procedures shouldprovide reasonable assurance that only appropriately trained personnel will handle and uselicensed material without undue hazard to themselves, other workers, or members of the public. In addition, licensees must develop, implement, and maintain procedures for protective measures to be taken by occupational workers to maintain their doses ALARA. Protective measures mayinclude: CUse of syringe shields and/or vial shields; CWearing laboratory coats and gloves when handling unsealed byproduct material; and CMonitoring hands after handling unsealed byproduct material. Appendix T contains model procedures that provide one method for safe use of unsealed licensed material. Response from Applicant : Provide the following statement: \"We have developed and will implement and maintain procedures for safe use of unsealed byproduct material that meet the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1101 and 10 CFR 20.1301.\" 8.25 ITEM 10: 35.27.

Discussion : The radiation protection program that licensees are required to develop, document, and implement in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101 must includeprovisions for responding to spills or other contamination events in order to prevent the spread ofradioactive material. Appendix N contains model emergency response procedures, includingmodel spill procedures. Spill procedures should address all types and forms of licensed materialused and should be posted in restricted areas where licensed materials are used or stored. Theinstructions should specifically state the names and telephone numbers of persons to be notified(e.g., RSO, staff, state and local authorities, a nd NRC, when applicable). Additionally, the instructions should contain procedures for evacua tion of the area, containment of spills and other releases, appropriate methods for reentering, and for decontaminating facilities (whennecessary).CONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-52Part 35 Applicability 100 200300400500600 T 1000 TResponse from Applicant : Provide the following statement: \"We have developed and will implement and maintain written procedures for safe response to spills of licensed material in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101.\" 8.26 ITEM 10: INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, ADJUSTMENT, REPAIR, ANDINSPECTION OF THERAPY DEVICESCONTAINING SEALED SOURCES Regulations : 10 10 CFR 35.605 and 10 CFR 35.655, licensees must ensure that therapy devices containing sealed sources are installed,maintained, adjusted, repaired, and inspected by persons specifically licensed to conduct theseactivities. The above activities should be conducted according to the manufacturers' writtenrecommendations and instructions and according to the SSDR. In addition, 10 CFR 35.655requires that teletherapy and GSR units be fully inspected and serviced during sourcereplacement or at intervals not to exceed 5 years, whichever comes first, to ensure that the sourceexposure mechanism functions properly. Maintenance is necessary to ensure that the devicefunctions as designed and source integrity is not compromised. Discussion : Maintenance and repair includes installation, replacement, and relocation or removal of the sealed source(s) or therapy unit that contains a sealed source(s). Maintenanceand repair also includes any adjustment involving any mechanism on the therapy device,treatment console, or interlocks that could expose the source(s), reduce the shielding around thesource(s), affect the source drive controls, or compromise the radiation safety of the unit or thesource(s). NRC requires that maintenance and repair (as defined above) be performed only by persons specifically licensed by NRC or an Agreement State to perform such services. Most licenseeemployees do not perform maintenance and repair because they do not have the specializedequipment and technical expertise to perform these activities. Applicants requestingauthorization to possess and use LDR remote afterloaders should review 10 CFR 35.605 before responding to this item. 10 CFR 35.605 allows for an AMP to perform certain service activitieswith regard to LDR remote afterloader units. Response from Applicant : No response is necessary if the licensee contracts with personnel who are licensed by NRC or an Agreement State to install, maintain, adjust, repair, and inspectthe specific therapy device possessed by the licensee. However, if the applicant requests that anemployee who is trained by the manufacturer be authorized to perform the aforementionedactivities, the applicant must provide sufficient information to allow the NRC to evaluate andapprove such authorization (see CFR 35.605 and 10 CFR 35.655).

Criteria : Applicants for new licenses must describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation willminimize, to the extent practicable, contamination of the facilityand the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, andminimize, to the extent practicable, the generation of radioactivewaste. Discussion : All applicants for new licenses need to consider the importance of designing and operating their facilities to minimize the amount of radioactive contamination generated at thesite during its operating lifetime and to minimize the generation of radioactive waste duringdecontamination. This is especially important for licensed activities involving unsealedbyproduct material. As described in Item 8.25, \"Spill Procedures,\" cleanup procedures shouldbe implemented for contamination events. Recommended limits for acceptable levels of surfacecontamination in restricted and unrestricted ar eas are provided in Appendix R, Tables R.2 and R.3. Sealed sources and devices that are approved by NRC or an Agreement State and located and used according to their SSDR Certificates usually pose little risk of contamination. Leak testsperformed as specified in the SSDR Certificat e should identify defective sources. Leaking sources must be immediately withdrawn from use and stored, repaired, or disposed of according to NRC requirements. These steps minimize the spread of contamination and reduce radioactivewaste associated with decontamination efforts. Response from Applicant : A response from applicants is not required under the following condition: the NRC will consider that the above criteria have been met if the informationprovided in applicant's responses satisfy the criteria in Sections 8.14, 8.15, 8.20, 8.24, 8.26, andCONTENTS OF AN APPLICATION NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-54Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T8.28, on the topics: Facility and Equipment; Facility Diagram; Radiation Protection Program; Safety Program; and Waste Management. 8.28 ITEM 11: WASTE MANAGEMENT Regulations : 10 CFR CFR 71.5. Criteria : Licensed materials must be disposed of in accordance with NRC requirements by: CTransfer to an authorized recipient (10 CFR 30.41(b)); CDecay-in-storage; in effluents within the limits in CFR 20.1301; or CAs authorized under 10 CFR 20.2002 through 20.2005. Discussion : The radiation protection program that licensees are required to develop, document, and implement in accordance with 10 CFR 20.1101 must include provisions for waste disposalof licensed material. Appendix W contains model procedures that represent one way to provide for decay-in-storage and generator or other licensed material return. Applicants are reminded totake into account the following information when they develop procedures (as applicable): CExcept for material suitable for decay-in-storage and some animal carcasses handled by thelicensee, solids are transferred to an authorized recipient licensed to receive such waste inaccordance with 10 CFR 20.2001(b), 10 CFR 20.2006, or in applicable regulations in 10CFR Parts 30 or 61. Follow the packaging instructions received from the transfer agent andthe burial site operator. Keep the consignment sheet from the transfer agent as the record ofdisposal. CWhen setting up a program for decay-in-storage, consider short-term and long-term storage. Consider designing long-term storage to allow fo r segregation of wastes with different half- lives (e.g., the use of multiple shielded containers) and use of containers with shielded coversto maintain occupational exposure at ALARA levels. Storage areas must be in a securelocation. CWaste from in vitro kits (except mock iodine-125) that are generally licensed under 10 CFR 31.11 is exempt from waste disposal re gulations in 10 CFR Part 20, as set forth in 10 CFR 31.11(f). Radioactive labels should be defaced or removed. There is no need tokeep any record of release or make any measurement.

NRC will return all unsignedapplications for proper signature. Note : It is a criminal offense to make a willful false statement or representation on applications or correspondence (18 U.S.C. 1001).PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED FROM APPLICANTS ON NRC FORM 313 The information provided in the following sections is included because this topic is a key element of a licensee's program and the information is provided as guidance to applicants insetting up their programs to satisfy regulatory requirements.PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-59 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T8.31 ITEM 8: SAFETY INSTRUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN ORFREQUENTING RESTRICTED AREAS Regulations : 10 CFR CFR 35.2310. Criteria : Individuals working with or in the vicinity of licensed material must have adequate safety instruction as required by 10CFR Parts 19 and 35. For individuals who, in the course ofemployment, are likely to receive in a year an occupational doseof radiation over 1 millisievert (mSv) [100 millirem (mrem)], the must provide safetyinstructions as required by 10 CFR 19.12. Additional requirements for training in radiationsafety for individuals involved with therapeutic treatment of patients are described in 10 CFR 35.310, 10 CFR 35.410, requires the licensee's AUs andANPs to provide safety instruction to all personnel using byproduct material under theirsupervision. Discussion : AUs, ANPs, AMPs, RSOs, and their supervised employees are most likely to receive doses in excess of 1 mSv (100 mrem) in a year. However, licensees also must evaluatepotential radiation doses received by any individual working in or frequenting restricted areas. All individuals working with or around licensed materials should receive safety instruction commensurate with their assigned duties, and if it is likely that they could receive doses over 1mSv (100 mrem) in a year, they must receive instruction as specified by 10 CFR 19.12. Forexample, a licensee might determine that housekeeping staff, while not likely to receive dosesover 1 mSv (100 mrem), should be informed of the nature of the licensed material and themeaning of the radiation symbol, and instructed not to touch the licensed material and to remainout of the room if the door to the licensed mate rial storage location is open. Providing minimal instruction to ancillary staff (e.g., housekeeping, security, etc.) may assist in controllingabnormal events, such as loss of radioactive material.` In addition to safety instruction required by 10 CFR 19.12 and in accordance with 10 CFR 35.310, 10 CFR 35.410, and 10 CFR 35.610, the licensee must provide radiation safetyinstruction to personnel (e.g., nurses) caring for patients undergoing radiopharmaceutical therapyand/or implant therapy who cannot be released in accordance with 10 CFR 35.75. This safetyinstruction should be commensurate with the duties of the personnel and include safe handling,patient control, visitor control, contamination control, waste control, and notification of the RSOand the AU if the patient has a medical emergency or dies. In accordance with 10 CFR 35.27(a), individuals working with licensed material under the supervision of an AU must receive instruction on the licensee's written radiation protectionprocedures, written directive procedures, and NRC regulations and license conditions with respect to the use of byproduct material. In accordance with 10 CFR 35.27(b), a licensee that permits the preparation of byproduct material for medical use by an individual under the supervision of an ANP or an AU, as allowedPROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-60Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 Tby 10 CFR 35.11(b)(2), shall instruct supervised individuals in the preparation of byproduct material for medical use and require the individuals to follow their instructions, the licensee'swritten radiation protection procedures, the li cense conditions, and NRC regulations. 10 CFR 35.27(c) states that a licensee that permits supervised activities, under paragraph 10 CFR35.27(a) and (b), is responsible for the acts and omissions of the supervised individuals. Appendix J provides a model training program that provides one way to satisfy the requirements referenced above. Response from Applicant : No response is necessary. 8.32 PUBLIC DOSE Regulations : 10 CFR 20.1003; 10 Licensees must do the following: CEnsure that licensed material will be used, transported, and stored in such a way that members of the public will notreceive more than 1 mSv (100 mrem) in 1 year, and the dosein any unrestricted area will not exceed 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour from licensedoperations. CEnsure air emissions of radioactive materials to the environment will not result in exposuresto individual members of the public in excess of 0.1 mSv (10 mrem) (TEDE) in one yearfrom these emissions. CControl and maintain constant surveillance of licensed material that is not in storage andsecure stored licensed material from unauthorized access, removal, or use. Discussion : Members of the public include persons who are not radiation workers. This includes workers who live, work or may be near locations where licensed material is used orstored and employees whose assigned duties do not include the use of licensed materials andwho work in the vicinity where it is used or stored. Public dose is controlled, in part, byensuring that licensed material is secure (e.g., located in a locked area) to prevent unauthorizedaccess or use by individuals coming into the area. Some medical use devices containing licensedmaterial are usually restricted by controlling access to the keys needed to operate the devicesand/or to keys to the locked storage area. Only AUs and personnel using byproduct materialunder their supervision should have access to these keys. Typical unrestricted areas may include offices, shops, laboratories, areas outside buildings, property, and nonradioactive equipment storage areas. The licensee does not control access tothese areas for purposes of controlling exposure to radiation or radioactive materials; however,the licensee may control access to these areas for other reasons, such as security.PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 9 IN 94-09, \"Release of Patients with Residual Radi oactivity from Medical Treatment and Control of Areas Due to Presence of Patients Containing Radioactivity Following Implementation,\" dated February1994. 8-61 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TFor areas adjacent to facilities where licensed material is used or stored, calculations or a combination of calculations and measurements (e.g., using an environmental TLD) are oftenused to show compliance. The definition of \"public dose\" in 10 CFR 20.1003 does not include doses received due to exposure to patients released in accordance with 10 CFR 35.75. Dose to members of the publicin waiting rooms was addressed in Informational Notice (IN) 94-09. 9 The provisions of 10 CFR 20.1301(a) should not be applied to radiation received by a member of the general public frompatients released under 10 CFR 35.75. If a patient is released pursuant to 10 CFR 35.75,licensees are not required to limit the radiation dose to members of the public (e.g., visitor in awaiting room) from a patient to 0.02mSv (2mrem) in any one hour. Patient waiting rooms needonly be controlled for those patients not meeting the release criteria in 10 CFR 35.75. 10 CFR 20.1301(c) allows licensees to permit visitors to a patient who cannot be released under 10 CFR 35.75 to receive a dose greater than 0.1 rem (1 mSv) provided the dose does not exceed0.5 rem (5 mSv) and the authorized user has determined before the visit that it is appropriate. In assessing adequacy of facilities to control public dose, licensees should consider the design factors discussed under \"Facility Diagram\" in Section 8.15 and may find confirmatory surveysto be useful in assuring compliance with 10 CFR 20.1301. The licensee must control emissions of byproduct material to air such that the individual member of the public likely to receive the highest total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) does not exceedthe constraint level of 0.10 mSv (10 mrem) per year from those emissions. If exceeded, thelicensee must report this in accordance with 10 CFR 20.2203, and take prompt actions to ensureagainst recurrence.

Response from Applicant : No response required. 8.34 PROCEDURES FOR ADMINISTRATIONS WHEN A WRITTEN DIRECTIVE ISREQUIRED Regulations : 10 CFR : 10 CFR 35.40 sets forth the requirements for WDs. 10 CFR 35.41 requires medical use licensees to develop,maintain, and implement written procedures to provide highconfidence that licensed material is administered as directed byauthorized users. Discussion : The procedures do not need to be submitted to NRC. This gives licensees the flexibility to revise the procedures to enhan ce effectiveness without obtaining NRC approval. Appendix S provides guidance on developing the procedures. Response from Applicant : No response required. 8.35 RELEASE OF PATIENTS OR HUMAN RESEARCH SUBJECTS Regulations : 10 CFR 35.75; 10 CFR 35.2075. Criteria : Licensees may release from confinement patients or human research subjects (patients) who have been administeredlicensed material if the TEDE to any other individual fromexposure to the released patient is not likely to exceed 5 mSv(0.5 rem). Licensees must provide radiation safety instructions topatients released (or their parent or guardian) in accordance with10 CFR 35.75(b). Discussion : 10 CFR 35.75 requires that the licensee provide the released individual (patient) with instructions, including written instructions, on actions recommended to maintain doses toother individuals ALARA if the TEDE to any other individual is likely to exceed 1 mSv(0.1 rem). If the dose to a breast-feeding infant or a child could exceed 1 mSv (0.1 rem),assuming there was no interruption of breast-feeding, the instructions also shall include:PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-63 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TCGuidance on the interruption or discontinuation of breast-feeding; and CInformation on the potential consequences of failure to follow the guidance.

Response from Applicant : No response required. 8.36 MOBILE MEDICAL SERVICE Regulations : 10 CFR 35.2; 10 49 CFR Parts 171-178. Criteria : In addition to the requirements in 10 CFR 35.80, and 35.647 as applicable, mobile medical service licensees mustcomply with all other applicable regulations. Discussion : Applicants for licensure of mobile medical services should review Sections 8.1 through 8.30 of this NUREG for information to be submitted as part of their applications; manyof the requirements in these sections are relevant to use of byproduct material by mobile medicalservice providers with details being dependent upon the scope of such programs. \"Temporaryjob site\" means a location, other than specific loca tion(s) of use authorized on the license, where mobile medical services are conducted. Mobile medical service licensees may transport licensedmaterial and equipment into a client's building, or may bring patients into the transport (e.g.,van). In either case, the van should be located on the client's property that is under the client'scontrol. Self-contained mobile medical service involves a mobile treatment or administration facility that provides ready-to-deliver mobile medical services on arrival at a client's site. Companiesproviding transportation only will not be license d for medical use under 10 CFR Part 35. Before using a remote afterloader for this type of service, the device should be installed in anappropriately shielded treatment room.

These mobile medical service providers are responsible for all aspects of byproductmaterial use and authorized patient treatments (or administrations). CMobile medical service providers (byproduct material and trained personnel) that provide thetransportation to and use of the byproduct material within the client's facility. These mobilemedical service providers are also responsible for all aspects of byproduct material use andauthorized patient treatments (or administrations). Mobile medical service licensees must ensure that the criteria in 10 CFR 35.75 are met before releasing patients treated in their facilities. Refer to Appendix V for additional guidance on information to provide in applications. Note : Agreement State licensees that request reciprocity for activities conducted in non- Agreement States are subject to the general license provisions described in 10 CFR 150.20. Thisgeneral license authorizes persons holding a speci fic license from an Agreement State to conduct the same activity in non-Agreement States if the specific license issued by the Agreement Statedoes not limit the authorized activity to specific locations or installations. NRC licensees whowish to conduct operations at temporary job sites in an Agreement State should contact thatstate's Radiation Control Program Office for information about state regulations, including notification requirements, and to determine if mobile medical services are allowed within theAgreement State through reciprocity. Therefore, to ensure compliance with Agreement Statereciprocity requirements, an NRC licensee shall request authorization well in advance ofscheduled work. In addition to the requirements specified in 10 CFR 150.20, applicantsrequesting a mobile medical service license should contact all states where they plan to conductmobile medical services, to clarify requirements associated with an authorization to practicemedicine within the state's jurisdiction. Response from Applicant : No response required. 8.37 AUDIT PROGRAM Regulations : 10 CFR 20.1101; 10 CFR 20.2102. Criteria : Under 10 CFR 20.1101, all licensees must annually review the content and implementation of the radiation protectionprogram. The review should ensure the following: CCompliance with NRC and applicable DOT regulations andthe terms and conditions of the license; and COccupational doses and doses to members of the public are ALARA (10 CFR 20.1101).PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-65 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TDiscussion : The applicant should develop and implement procedures for the required review or audit of the radiation protection program's c ontent and implementation. Appendix L contains model procedures that are only a suggested guide and are one way to meet this requirement. Some sections of Appendix L may not be pertinent to every licensee or to each review or audit. For example, licensees do not need to address areas that do not apply to their activities, andactivities that have not occurred since the last review or audit need not be reviewed at the nextreview or audit. Reviews or audits of the content and implementation of the radiation protectionprogram must be conducted at least annually. NRC encourages licensee management to conduct performance-based reviews by observing work in progress, interviewing staff about the radiation protection program, and spot-checking required records. As part of their review programs, licensees should consider performingunannounced audits of authorized and supervised users to determine if, for example, Operatingand Emergency Procedures are available and are being followed. It is essential that once identified, violations and radiation safety concerns are corrected comprehensively and in a timely manner. The following three-step corrective action process hasproven effective: CConduct a complete and thorough review of the circumstances that led to the violation. CIdentify the root cause of the violation. CTake prompt and comprehensive corrective actions that will address the immediate concernsand prevent recurrence of the violation. NRC's goal is to encourage prompt identification and prompt, comprehensive correction of violations and deficiencies. Response from Applicant : No response is necessary.

Many of these procedures are covered in greater detail in other sections of this document. CDevelop, implement, and maintain specific operating and emergency procedures containing the following elements: - Instructions for opening packages containing licensed material (see Section 8.33);- Using licensed material, operating therapy treatment devices, and performing routine maintenance on devices containing sealed sources, according to the manufacturer'swritten recommendations and instructions and in accordance with regulatoryrequirements (see Section 8.26); - Instructions for conducting area radiation level and contamination surveys (see Section 8.23); - Instructions for administering licensed material in accordance with the WD (see Section 8.34); - Steps to ensure that patient release is in accordance with 10 CFR 35.75 (see Section 8.35); - Instructions for calibration of survey and dosage measuring instruments (see Sections 8.16 and 8.17); - Periodic spot checks of therapy device units, sources, and treatment facilities (see Section 8.18); - Instructions for radioactive waste management (see Section 8.28);- Steps to take, and whom to contact (e.g., RS O, local officials), when the following has occurred: (a) leaking or damaged source, (b) device malfunction and/or damage,(c) licensed material spills, (d) theft or loss of licensed material, or (e) any other incidentsinvolving licensed material (see Sections 8.25, 8.44); - Steps for source retrieval and access control of damaged sealed source(s) and/or malfunctioning devices containing sealed source(s) (see Section 8.21); - Steps to take if a therapy patient undergoes emergency surgery or dies. AND The licensee should consider the following:PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-67 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1CMake operating procedures, including emergency procedures, available to all users (e.g., post the procedures or the location of procedure storage); CMaintain a current copy of the procedures at each location of use (or, if this is notpracticable, post a notice describing the procedures and stating where they may beexamined). CWhen developing the procedures described above, the licensee is reminded that10 CFR 20.1101(b) requires that the licensee use, to the extent practical, procedures andengineering controls based on sound radiation pr otection principles to achieve occupational doses and doses to members of the public that are ALARA. CWhen receiving and using byproduct material, the licensee is reminded that it must belicensed to possess the byproduct material and that the radioactive material must be secured(or controlled) and accounted for at all times. Discussion : Sealed sources and unsealed byproduct material used for therapy can deliver significant doses in a short time. 10 CFR describe access control to high and very high radiation areas and the security oflicensed material. Unauthorized access to license d material by untrained individuals could lead to a significant radiological hazard. Many licensees achieve access control by permitting onlytrained individuals to have access to licensed material (e.g., keys, lock combinations, securitybadges). Accountability of licensed material ma y be ensured by conducting physical inventories, controlling receipt and disposal, and maintaining use records. If a therapy patient undergoes emergency surgery or dies, it is necessary to ensure the safety of others attending the patient. As long as the patient's body remains unopened, the radiationreceived by anyone near it is due almost entirely to gamma rays. The change in emphasis whenan operation or autopsy is to be performed is due to the possible exposure of the hands and faceto relatively intense beta radiation. Procedures for emergency surgery or autopsy can be foundin Section 5.3 of NCRP Report No. 37, \"Precautions In The Management of Patients Who HaveReceived Therapeutic Amounts of Radionuclides.\" Applicants should develop emergency procedures that address a spectrum of incidents (e.g., major spills, leaking source, medical events, interlock failure, stuck source, etc.). After its occurrence becomes known to the licensee, NRC must be notified when an incident involving licensed material occurs. Refer to the regulations (10 CFR 20.2201-20.2203,10 for adescription of when notifications are required.

Criteria : Applicants must develop and implement procedures to ensure that access to therapy treatment rooms, and exposure rates from therapy treatments, arelimited to maintain doses to occupational workers and members of the public within regulatorylimits. Discussion : 10 CFR 35.315, 10 CFR 35.415, and 10 CFR 35.615 require licensees to take certain safety precautions for uses of byproduct material involving radiopharmaceutical therapy, manual brachytherapy, or remote afterloader brachytherapy involving patients who cannot be released in accordance with 10 CFR 35.75. This section of the guidance does not includePROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-73 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1guidance on this subject for teletherapy or GSR outpatient treatments. The precautions described below are provided to help ensure compliance with the exposure limits in 10 CFR Part 20. 10 CFR 35.404(b) and 10 CFR 35.604(a) require licensees to perform a radiation survey of the patient (and the remote afterloader unit) immediately after removing the last temporary implantsource from the patient and prior to releasing the patient from licensee control. This is done toconfirm that all sources have been removed and accounted for. 10 CFR 35.615(e) requires thatwhen sources are placed within the patient's body, licensed activities be limited to treatmentsthat allow for expeditious removal of a decoupled or jammed source. In addition, applicants must take the following steps for patients who cannot be released under 10 CFR 35.75: CProvide a room with a private sanitary facility for patients treated with a radiopharmaceuticaltherapy dosage (Note: 10 CFR 35.315(a) allows for a room shared with anotherradiopharmaceutical therapy patient); CProvide a private room for patients implanted with brachytherapy sources ( Note: 10 CFR 35.415 allows for a another brachytherapy patient); CVisibly post a \"Radioactive Materials\" sign on the patient's room and note on the door or inthe patient's chart where and how long visitors may stay in the patient's room (10 CFR35.315 and 10 CFR 35.415); CEither monitor material and items removed from the patient's room (e.g., patient linens,surgical dressings) with a radiation detection survey instrument set on its most sensitive scalewith no interposed shielding to determine that their radioactivity cannot be distinguishedfrom the natural background radiation level or handle them as radioactive waste (10 CFR35.315 and 10 CFR 20.1501); and CNotify the RSO, or his/her designee, and AU as soon as possible if the patient has a medicalemergency or dies (10 CFR 35.315, 20.1501 requires licensees to perform adequate surveys to evaluate the extent of radiation levels. Therefore, licensees must evaluate the exposure rates around patients who arehospitalized in accordance with 10 CFR 35.75 following the dosage administration or implant(e.g., measured exposure rates, combination of measured and calculated exposure rates). 10 CFR 20.1801 requires licensees to secure licensed material in storage from unauthorized access or removal. Access control and appropriate training of authorized personnel may preventunauthorized removal of licensed material temporarily stored in the patient's room andunnecessary personnel exposures. In order to control exposures to individuals in accordance with 10 CFR Part 20, the licensee should consider briefing patients on radiation safe ty procedures for confinement to bed, visitor control, identification of potential problems, notification of medical staff in the event of problems, and other items as applicable and consistent with good medical care.PROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 8-74Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 TResponse from Applicant : No response is necessary. 8.47 TRANSPORTATION Regulations : 10 CFR 20.1101; 10 Parts 171-178. Criteria : Applicants who will prepare for shipment, ship, or transport radioactive materials, including radioactive waste, mustdevelop, implement, and maintain safety programs for thetransport of radioactive material to ensure compliance with NRCand DOT regulations. Discussion : Most packages of licensed material for medical use contain quantities of radioactive material that require use of Type A packages. Additionally, many packages shipped by medicallicensees (e.g., unused radiopharmaceutical dosages) frequently meet the \"Limited Quantity\"criteria described in 49 CFR 173.421 and are theref ore excepted from certain DOT requirements, provided certain other less restrictive requirements are met (e.g., activity in the package is lessthan the limited quantity and the radiation level on the surface of the package does not exceed0.005 mSv per hour (0.5 mrem per hour)). The in 10 CFR 71.12, \"General license: NRC-approved package,\" provides the authorization used by most licensees to transport, or to deliver to a carrier for transport, licensedmaterial in a package for which a license, certificate of compliance, or other approval has beenissued by NRC. This general license is subject to certain conditions. 10 CFR 71.5 sets forth therequirements for transportation of licensed material. 10 CFR 71.9 exempts any physicianlicensed by a state to dispense drugs in the practice of medicine, who is also licensed under10 CFR Part 35 or the equivalent Agreement Stat e regulations from the requirements in 10 CFR 71.5. This exemption applies to transport by the physician of licensed material for use in thepractice of medicine. Some medical use licensees (e.g., teletherapy or gamma stereotactic radiosurgery) may need to ship licensed material in Type B packages. 10 CFR 71.12-71.14 sets forth the Type B packagerequirements for transporting or delivering the package to a carrier for transport. These includeregistration as a user of the package and having an NRC-approved quality assurance (QA) plan. For information about these QA plans, see Revision 1 of RG 7.10, \"Establishing QualityAssurance Programs for Packaging Used in the Transport of Radioactive Material,\" datedJune 1986. For further information about registering as a user of a package or submitting a QAprogram for review, contact NRC's Spent Fu el Project Office by calling NRC toll-free at (800) 368-5642, extension 415-8500. For informati on about associated fees, contact NRC's OCFO by calling NRC toll-free at (800) 368-5642, extension 415-7544. Some medical use licensees that ship radioactive material have chosen to transfer possession of radioactive materials to a manufacturer (or service licensee) with an NRC or Agreement Statelicense, who then acts as the shipper. The manufacturer (or service licensee), who is subject toPROGRAM-RELATED GUIDANCE 8-75 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. of 10 CFR 71.12 or 10 CFR 71.14, as appropriate, then becomes responsible for proper packaging of the radioactive materials and compliance with NRC and DOT regulations. Licensees who do this must ensure that the manufacturer (or service licensee): CIs authorized to possess the licensed material (see 10 CFR 30.41). CActually takes possession of the licensed material under its license. Licensees should also ensure that the manufacturer (or service licensee) is authorized to possess the material at temporary job sites (e.g., the licensee's facilities). During an inspection, NRC uses the provisions of 10 CFR 71.5 and a Memorandum of Understanding with DOT on the Transportation of Radioactive Material (signed June 6, 1979) toexamine and enforce various DOT requirements applicable to medical use licensees. Appendix Z lists major DOT regulations that apply to medical licensees. Response from Applicant : No response is needed from applicants during the licensing phase. However, before making shipments of licensed materials on its own in a Type B package, alicensee must have registered with NRC as a user of the package and obtained NRC's approvalof its QA program. Transportation issues will be reviewed during inspection.

Licensees are responsible for applying for amendments to licenses and for keeping them up-to-date. Furthermore, tocontinue a license after its expiration date, the licensee mustsubmit an application for a license renewal at least 30 daysbefore the expiration date (10 CFR 2.109, 10 CFR 30.36(a)). 10 CFR 35.13 requires a licensee to apply for and receive a license amendment before several activities can occur, including: CReceipt or use of byproduct material for a type of use permitted by Part 35, but notauthorized on the licensee's current Part 35 license; CPermitting anyone to work as an AU, AMP, or ANP, unless the individual meets one of theexceptions listed in 10 CFR 35.13(b) (Supply information required to document training andexperience on NRC Form 313A for change or addition of AU, AMP, ANP, or RSO); CChanging the RSO; CReceiving byproduct material in excess of the amount, or receiving radionuclides or formsdifferent than currently authorized on the NRC license; CChanging an area or address of use identified in the application or on the license, except forareas of use where byproduct material is used only in accordance with either 10 CFR 35.100or 10 CFR 35.200; 35.643, and 35.645, when therevision reduces the level of radiation safety. In case of a medical emergency requiring an expedited license amendment, contact the NRC regional materials licensing staff. For both renewal and amendment requests, applicants should do the following: CUse the most recent guidance in preparing an amendment or renewal request; CSubmit in duplicate either an NRC Form 313 or a letter requesting an amendment or renewal; and CProvide the license number.10-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Part 35 Applicability 100 T 200 T 300 T 400 T 500 T 600 T 1000 T10 APPLICATIONS FOR EXEMPTIONS Regulations : 10 CFR Criteria : Licensees may request exemptions to regulations. The licensee must demonstrate that the exemption is authorized bylaw, will not endanger life or property or the common defenseand security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Discussion : Various sections of NRC's regulations address requests for exemptions (e.g., 10 CFR 19.31, 10 CFR 20.2301, 10 CFR 30.11(a)). Theseregulations state that NRC may grant an exemption, acting on its own initiative or on anapplication from an interested person. Exemptions are not intended to revise regulations, are not intended for large classes of licenses, and are generally limited to unique situations. Exemption requests should be accompanied bydescriptions of the following: CExemption and justification of why it is needed. CProposed compensatory safety measures intended to provide a level of health and safetyequivalent to the regulation for which the exemption is being requested. CAlternative methods for complying with the re gulation and why compliance with the existing regulations is not feasible. Until NRC has granted an exemption in writing, NRC expects strict compliance with all applicable regulations.

Experienced Authorized Users, Authorized Medical Physicists, Authorized Nuclear Pharmacists, or Radiation Safety Officer An applicant or licensee that is adding an experienced authorized user, authorized medical physicist, authorized nuclear pharmacist, or radiation safety officer to its medical use licenseonly needs to provide evidence that the individual is listed on a medical use license issued by theCommission or Agreement State, a permit issued by a Commission master material licensee, apermit issued by a Commission or Agreement State broad scope licensee, or a permit issued by aCommission master material broad scope permittee before October 25, 2005 provided that theindividual is authorized for the same types of use(s) requested in the application under review, and the individual meets the recentness of training criteria described in 10 CFR 35.59. Whenadding an experienced authorized nuclear pharmacist to the license, the applicant also mayprovide evidence that the individual is listed on an NRC or Agreement State commercial nuclearpharmacy license or identified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist by a commercial nuclearpharmacy authorized to identify authorized nucl ear pharmacists. For individuals who have been previously authorized by, but not listed on, the commercial nuclear pharmacy license, medicalbroad scope license, or master materials license medical broad scope permit, the applicant shouldsubmit either verification of previous authori zations granted or evidence of acceptable training and experience. II. Applicants that Include Individuals for New Authorized User, Authorized Medical Physicist, Authorized Nuclear Ph armacist or Radiation Safety Officer Recognition by NRC Applicants should complete the appropriate sections on NRC Form 313A to show that the individuals meet the appropriate training and experience criteria in 10 CFR Part 35 subparts B, D, E, F, G. H, or J (until October 24, 2005). NRC Form 313A was developed to provide a single location where six different professional gr oups (physicians, dentist, podiatrist, medical physicist, pharmacist, and radiation safety officer) and ten different medical sub-specialtiescould document completion of appropriate trai ning and experience requirements. Therefore, some of the sections will not be applicable for each group. There are two different training and experience r outes to qualify an individual as an authorized user, authorized medical physicist, authorized nuclear pharmacist, or radiation safety officer. The first is by means of certification by a board recognized by NRC as provided in October 25, 2005, a board listed in 10 CFR Part 35Subpart J. Preceptor attestations must also be submitted for individuals to qualify underSubparts B and D through H. The second route is by meeting the structured educational program, supervised work experience, and preceptor attestation requirements in 10 CFR Part 35, subparts B, D, E, F, G, and H. UntilOctober 25, 2005 this route also includes the cl assroom and laboratory training and supervised clinical or work experience requirements in 10 CFR Part 35, Subpart J.APPENDIX D NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 D-2III. Recentness of Training The required training and experience described in 10 CFR Part 35 must be obtained within the 7 years preceding the date of the application, or the individual must document having had relatedcontinuing education, retraining, and experien ce since obtaining the required training and experience. Examples of acceptable continuing education and experience include the following: CSuccessful completion of classroom and laborat ory review courses that include radiation safety practices relative to the proposed type of authorized medical use; CPractical and laboratory experience with patient procedures using radioactive material for thesame use(s) for which the applicant is requesting authorization; CPractical and laboratory experience under the supe rvision of an AU at the same or another licensed facility that is authorized for the same use(s) for which the applicant is requestingauthorization; and CFor therapy devices, experience with the therapy unit and/or comparable linear acceleratorexperience and completion of an in-service review of operating and emergency proceduresrelative to the therapy unit to be used by the applicant. IV. Instructions and Guidance for Filling Out NRC Form 313A Note: If using NRC Form 313A to document training and experience, individuals who have been certified by boards recognized by the NRC need only complete items 1, 2 and 3 of NRC Form313A. Information for all other individuals to be listed on the license as an authorized user,authorized medical physicist, authorized nuclear pharmacist or Radiation Safety Officer must be provided in subsequent sections of NRC Form 313A. Part I. Training and Experience Provide information for each individual for whom authorization is sought. Item 1. Name of individual, proposed author ization, and applicable training requirements. Provide the individual's complete name so that NRC can distinguish the training and experience received from that received by others with a sim ilar name, specify the type authorization being requested (Radiation Safety Officer, authori zed user, authorized medical physicist, and authorized nuclear pharmacist), and applicable training requirements. Note : Do not include personal or private information (e.g., date of birth, social security number) as part of your qualification documentation. Item 2. State or territory where licensed NRC requires physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and pharmacists to be licensed by a state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to prescribe drugs in the practice of medicine, practice dentistry, practice podiatry, or practicepharmacy, respectively (see definition of \"Physician\" in 10 CFR 35.2).APPENDIX D 1 The names of board certifications that have been recognized by the NRC or an Agreement State are posted on the NRC's web page <http://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/med-use-toolkit.html>. D-3 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Item 3. Certification The applicant should provide a copy of the board certification or provide the complete name of the specialty board and the category (or subspecialty) if the board recognizes more than onecertification specialty. Applicants should provide all of the information noted under Item 3,attending to the requirements for different pathways to approval. Data provided about the month and year certified is used to establish recentness of training, to confirm that NRC recognizes 1 that board's certifications, and to verify that the applicant meets the training requirements. If an individual to be listed on the license as an authorized user, authorized medical physicist, authorized nuclear pharmacist, or Radiation Safety Officer cannot meetrequirements for board certification pathway, th e applicant must fill out the appropriate remaining sections of NRC Form 313A and must submit a written attestation signed by a preceptor (see Part II of NRC Form 313A). Item 4. Individuals Identified on a License or Permit as Radiation Safety Officers (RSO), Authorized Users (AU), Authorized Medic al Physicists (AMP), or Authorized Nuclear Pharmacists (ANP) Seeking Additional Authorizations. The applicant should provide a copy of the license or broadscope permit listing his or her current authorization, and also complete the items listed under either 4.b or 4.c, depending on theauthorization sought. Item 5. Classroom and Laboratory Training or Didactic Training, 6a. Work or Practical Experience with Radiation, 6b. Supervised Clinical Case Experience, and6c. Training for Sections 35.50(e), 35.51(c), 35.590(c), or 35.690(c). Because the applicant is not required to receive the training described in Item 5 at one location or at one time, space is provided to identify each location and date of training. The clock hoursmust be indicated for those individuals that must meet a minimum number of training and work experience hours. The specific number of hours needed for each training element will dependupon the type of approval sought. While most applicants will only complete Item 6a, those who must document clinical case experiences (e.g., physicians seeking authorization for uses under 10 CFR 35.300 and strontium-90 eye applicator users) should document this in Item 6b. Item 6c. should be completed by applicants for Radiation Safety Officer, Authorized Medical Physicist, or for use of sealed sources for diagnosis, or remote afterloader units, teletherapy unitsor gamma stereotactic radiosurgery units as required in 10 CFR 35.690. Note : Classroom and Laboratory Training or Di dactic Training may be provided at medical teaching/university institutions. In some cases, a course may be provided for that particular needand taught in consecutive days; in others, the period may be a semester or quarter as part of theformal curriculum. The required \"structural educational programs\" or \"training\" may beAPPENDIX D NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 D-4obtained in any number of settings, locations, and educational situations. If the applicant is seeking authorization under the requirements of 10 CFR Part 35 subparts B, D, E, F, G, and H, applicants must submit a written attestation signed by a preceptor, indicating the individual forwhom approval is sought meets training requirements of applicable sections and has achieved alevel of competency sufficient to function indepe ndently. Preceptor statements are also required for ANPs approved under Subpart J (\u00a735.980(a)). The NRC expects that clinical laboratory hours credited toward meeting the requirements for classroom and laboratory training in Subpart s B and D through H will involve training in radiation safety aspects of the medical use of byproduct material. The NRC recognizes, forexample, that physicians in training may not dedicate all of their clinical laboratory timespecifically to the subject areas covered in these subparts and will be attending to other clinicalmatters involving the medical use of the material under the supervision of an AU (e.g., reviewingcase histories or interpreting scans). However, those hours spent on other duties, not related toradiation safety, should not be counted towa rd the minimum number of hours of required classroom and laboratory training in radiation safet y. This type of supervised work experience, even though not specifically required by the NRC, may be counted toward the supervised workexperience to obtain the required total hours of training (e.g., 700 hours for \u00a7 35.390). Similarly, the NRC recognizes that clinicians will not dedicate all of their time in training specifically tothe subject areas described in Subparts D though H and will be attending to other clinicalmatters. The NRC will broadly interpret \"classroom training\" to include various types ofinstruction received by candidates for approval, including online training, as long as the subject matter relates to radiation safety and safe handling of byproduct material. Item 7. Formal Training This item is completed for individuals qualified to be medical physicists or physicians meeting the requirements in 10 CFR 35.490, 35.690, 35.940, and 35.960. Item 8. Radiation Safety Officer - One Year Full-Time Work Experience This item is used to document that the applicant meets the regulatory requirement of one full year of full time work experience in the areas which are listed in Item 6a. Item 9. Medical Physicist - One-Year Full-Time Training and Experience This section is used to document that the Medical Physicist has received one full year of full time training and one full year of work experience. Both are required to be under the supervisionof an authorized medical physicist but they do not have to be under the same medical physicist. Item 10. Supervising Individual Item 10 need only be completed by an applicant seeking to have an individual listed on the license as an AU, RSO, or AMP under Part 35 Subparts B, D, E, F or H. If an applicant isfollowing the training and experience requirements in Subpart J, it is sufficient to identify thesupervising individual and licensed facility in Items 6a and 6b. In addition, the use of Item 10 isalso dependent on whether information on the identity, qualifications and location (licensenumber) of the supervising individual has already been provided elsewhere on NRC Form 313A(e.g., in Items 8 or 9).APPENDIX D D-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Note : If the individual had more than one supervis or, all supervising individual names must be listed in Items 6a and 6b and Item 10 filled out for each. Note : The authorized nuclear pharmacist applicant is required to have supervised practical experience in a nuclear pharmacy but the individual(s) providing the supervision are notspecified. Therefore the applicant does not need to identify a supervising individual in Item 6aor complete Item 10. Part II Preceptor Attestation The NRC defines the term \"preceptor\" in 10 CFR 35.2, \"Definitions,\" to mean \"an individual who provides, directs, or verifies training and experience required for an individual to become an authorized user, an authorized medical physic ist, an authorized nuclear pharmacist, or a Radiation Safety Officer.\" While the supervisi ng individual for the work experience may also be the preceptor, the preceptor does not have to be the supervising individual as long as thepreceptor directs or verifies the training and experience required. The preceptor must attest inwriting regarding the training and experience of a ny individual to serve as an authorized user, authorized nuclear pharmacist, authorized medical physicist or radiation safety officer (pursuant to 10 CFR Part 35, Subparts B, C, D, E, F, or H and 10 CFR 35.980) and attest that theindividual has satisfactorily completed the appropriate training and experience criteria and hasachieved a level of competency or a level of radiation safety knowledge sufficient to function independently. This preceptor also has to meet specific requirements. The NRC recognizes supervised work experience, such as that described in 10 CFR 35.290(c), conducted under the supervision of an authorized user in a licensed material use program. Asupervisor is an AU who provides frequent dir ection, instruction, and direct oversight of the student as the student completes the required work experience in the use of byproduct material. Supervision may occur at various licensed facilities, from a large teaching university hospital toa small private practice. However, work experience for sealed source therapy, as described in 10CFR 35.490(b)(1), 10 CFR 35.491(b)(2), and 10 CFR 35.690(b)(1) must have been gained at amedical institution. When the supervised work experience is complete, the applicant shouldprovide documentation of it using NRC Form 313A or equivalent, and written attestation from the preceptor using NRC Form 313A or equivalent that indicates that the applicant has obtained all required experience elements. These documents should be submitted as attachments to NRCForm 313, \"Application for Material License.\" An applicant requesting authorized nuclear pharmacist status for a pharmacist under 10 CFR 35.980(b) is required to provide a different attestation statement than for a pharmacist underSubpart B, 10 CFR 35.55. Information may be provided in Item 11a needed to meet therequirements under 10 CFR Part 35, Subpart J. Space is provided in Items C and D for thepreceptor authorized nuclear pharmacist's name and signature. Item 11 Item 11 has four components: The information in 11a. attests that the applicant has satisfactorily completed the training and supervised work experience requirements; the information in 11b.attests that the applicant meets the requirements in 35.50(e), 35.51(c), 35.390(b)(1)(ii)(G),35.690(c) for specified types of uses; the information in 11c. attests that the applicant has thecompetency to function independently; and the information in 11d. attests that the preceptor is anAPPENDIX D NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1 D-6Authorized Nuclear Pharmacist or Radiation Safe ty Officer or meets the requirements to be a preceptor AU, AMP, and requires the preceptor's signature.APPENDIX E Sample License Application.APPENDIX E E-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory information collection request, 7.4 hours.

Applicants may either adopt these model proceduresor adopt alternative procedures. Facilities and Equipment CTo reduce doses received by individuals not calibrating instruments, calibrations should be conducted in an isolated area of the facility or at times when no one else is present. CIndividuals conducting calibrations will wear assigned dosimetry, if required. Equipment Selection CLow-energy beta emitters, such as carbon-14 and sulfur-35, are difficult to detect with Geiger-Mueller (GM) probes. The detection efficiency generally is about 2% for low-energybeta emitters. The proper surveying method (e.g., speed and height above surface) is importantto perform adequate surveys. Additionally, wipes should be taken and counted on a liquidscintillation counter to verify potential contamination. CMedium- to high-energy beta emitters, such as P-32 and Ca-45, can be detected with a pancakeGM. The efficiency ranges from 15% to 40%, depending on the beta energy. CLow-energy gamma emitters, such as I-125, can be detected with a sodium iodide (NaI) probeor a thin window GM probe (pancake or thin end-window). If the sodium iodide probepossesses a thin window and thin crystal, the detection efficiency is approximately 20%. If apancake or thin end-window GM probe is used, th e detection efficiency is significantly lower and care should be taken to ensure that the GM probe is capable of detecting the trigger levels. CMedium- to high-energy gamma emitters, such as I-131, can be detected with either GM orsodium iodide probes, depending on the required sensitivity. In general, the sensitivity of GMprobes is much lower than for sodium iodide probes.

You may either adopt these model procedures or develop your own proce dures to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR 35.61. (Detailed information about survey instrument calibration may be obtained byreferring to ANSI N323A-1997, \"Radiation Protection Instrumentation Test and Calibration, Portable Survey Instruments.\" Copies may be obtained from the American National Standards Institute at 25West 43 rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10036 or by ordering electronically from <http://www.ansi.org>.APPENDIX K K-3 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Procedures for calibration of survey instruments: CRadiation survey instruments will be calibrate d with a radioactive source in accordance with 10 CFR 35.61. Electronic calibrations alone are not acceptable. Survey meters must becalibrated at least annually, before first use and after servicing or repairs which affectcalibration. (Battery changes are not considered \"servicing.\") Instruments used to monitorhigher energies are most easily calibrated in known radiation fields produced by sources ofgamma rays of approximately the same energies as those to be measured. An ideal calibrationsource would emit the applicable radiation (e.g., alpha, beta, or gamma) with an energyspectrum similar to that to be measured and have a suitably long half-life. CUse radioactive sealed source(s) that: - Approximates a point source;- Is certified, NIST-traceable, standard source that has an activity or exposure rate accurate to within 5%; if the activity or exposure rate is determined by measurement, document themethod used to make the determination and traceability to NIST; - Emit the type of radiation measured;- Approximate the same energy (e.g., Cs-137, Co-60) as the environment in which the calibrated device will be employed; and - Provide a radiation dose rate sufficient to reach the full scale (<1000 mR/hr) of the instrument calibrated. CUse the inverse square and radioactive decay laws, as appropriate, to correct for changes inexposure rate due to changes in distance or source decay. CA record must be made of each survey meter calibration and retained for 3 years after eachrecord is made (10 CFR 20.2103(a) and 10 CFR 35.2061). CBefore use, perform daily check (with a dedicated check source) and battery checks. CInstrument readings should be within \u00b1 10% of known radiation values at calibration points;however, readings within \u00b1 20% are acceptable if a calibration chart or graph is prepared andmade available with the instrument. CThe kinds of scales frequently used on radiation survey meters should be calibrated as follows: - Calibrate Linear-Readout Instruments at no fewer than two points on each scale. Calibration will be checked near the ends of each scale (at approximately 20% and 80%). - Calibrate Logarithmic-Readout Instruments at two points on each decade.- Calibrate Digital-Readout Instruments with either manual or automatic scale switching for indicating exposure rates at no fewer than two points on each scale. Check calibrationsnear the ends of each scale (at approximately 20% and 80% of each scale).APPENDIX K NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 K-4- Calibrate Digital-Readout Instruments without scale switching for indicating exposure rates at two points on each decade. - Calibrate Integrating instruments at two dose rates (at approximately 20% and 80% of the dose rate range). CReadings above 1000 mR/hr (250 microcoulomb/kilogram of air per hour) need not becalibrated; however, such scales may be checked for operation and approximately correctresponse. CInclude in survey meter calibration records the procedure used and the data obtained. Recordthe following: - A description of the instrument, including the manufacturer's name, model number, serial number, and type of detector; - A description of the NIST-traceable calibration source, including the calibration procedure, exposure rate, distance at which is was measured and date of measurement; - For each calibration point, the calculated exposure rate, the indicated exposure rate, the calculated correction factor (the calculated exposure rate divided by the indicated exposurerate), and the scale selected on the instrument; - The exposure reading indicated with the instrument in the \"battery check\" mode (if available on the instrument); - For instruments with external detectors, the angle between the radiation flux field and the detector (i.e., parallel or perpendicular); - For instruments with internal detectors, the angle between the radiation flux field and a specified surface of the instrument; - For detectors with removable shielding, an indication of whether the shielding was in place or removed during the calibration procedure; - The exposure rate from a check source, if used;- The name of the person who performed the calibration and the date it was performed. CThe following information should be attached to the instrument as a calibration sticker or tag:- The source that was used to calibrate the instrument;- The proper deflection in the battery check mode (unless this is clearly indicated on the instrument); - Special use conditions (e.g., an indication that a scale or decade was checked only for function but not calibrated);APPENDIX K 1 The absolute efficiency is dependent on the coun ting geometry. Applicants may elect to use the intrinsic efficiency, which no longer includes the solid angle subtended by the detector and has much less of a dependence on the counting geometry. K-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1- The date of calibration and the next calibration due date; - The apparent exposure rate from the check source, if used. Determining the Efficiency of NaI(Tl) Uptake Probes Sodium iodide (thallium doped) [NaI(Tl)] uptak e probes are commonly used for bioassays of personnel administering I-131 radionuclides in the fo rm of sodium iodide. Refer to Appendix B to Part 20 for the Annual Limits on Intake (ALIs) and Derived Air Concentrations (DACs) for occupational exposure to radionuclides. Convert count rates (e.g., in cpm) to units of activity (dpm, :Ci) when performing bioassays to determine thyr oid burdens of radioiodines. Use the following procedure to calibrate probe for uptake measurements: CFrequency: perform calibrations annually, before first use and after repairs that affectcalibrations; CCheck the instrument's counting efficiency using either a standard source of the sameradionuclide as the source being tested or one with similar energy characteristics. Accuracy ofstandards will be within \u00b1 5% of the stated value and traceable to a primary radiation standardsuch as those maintained by NIST. CCalculate efficiency of the instrument. For example: where: Effa efficiency1, cpm = counts per minute,std = standard, andbkg = background. Operational and calibration checks, using a dedicated check source, should be conducted on each day the instrument is used. The date of the efficiency test should be attached to the instrument as a calibration sticker or tag and the following information should be included: CThe date of the next efficiency due; CResults of efficiency calculation(s).APPENDIX K NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 K-6Calculating the Gamma Well Efficiency of Counting Equipment Gamma well counting equipment is often used for assaying the wipe testing of packages, sealed sources, and areas where unsealed byproduct material is prepared, administered, or stored. Converting cpm to dpm using smear wipes is required when dealing with radiation surveys of sealedand unsealed radioactive materials. Calculate the e fficiency of all instruments used for assaying wipe tests on an annual basis, before first use, and/or after repair, using the following procedure: CCheck the instrument's counting efficiency, using either a standard source of the sameradionuclide as the source being tested or one with similar energy characteristics. Accuracy ofstandards will be within \u00b1 5% of the stated value and traceable to a primary radiation standardsuch as those maintained by NIST. CCalculate efficiency of the instrument. For example, where: Eff = efficiency, in cpm / microcurie,cpm = counts per minute,std = standard, andbkg = background. Operational and calibration checks, using a dedicated check source, should be conducted on each day the instrument is used. The date of the efficiency test should be attached to the instrument as a calibration sticker or tag and the following information should be included: CThe date of the next efficiency due and CResults of efficiency calculation(s).

Applicants may either adopt these modelprocedures for an external occupational dose program or develop alternative procedures to meet therequirements of 10 CFR 20.1101 and Subparts C and F of 10 CFR Part 20. The model includesguidance as well as discussion of regulatory requirements that are to be reflected in the elements ofan occupational dose program. \"Dosimetry\" is a broad term commonly applied to the use of monitoring devices, bioassay, and other methods to measure or otherwise quantify radiation doses to individuals. The licensee must controloccupational doses and provide individuals with monitoring devices in accordance with therequirements of 10 CFR 20.1502(a). 10 CFR 20.1201 provides the occupational dose limits foradults. 10 CFR 20.1502 provides in part that adults likely to receive in one year a dose in excess of10 percent of those dose limits must be provided with dosimetry. Definitions of relevant terms suchas Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), deep-dose equivalent (DDE), and committed effectivedose equivalent (CEDE) can be found in 10 CFR 20.1003, \"Definitions.\" In addition, if monitoring is required pursuant to 10 CFR 20.1502, each licensee shall maintain records of doses received(see10 CFR 20.2106) and individuals must be informed on at least an annual basis of their doses (see10 CFR 19.13(b)). If an individual is likely to receive more than 10% of the annual dose limits, NRC requires the licensee to monitor the dose, to maintain records of the dose, and, on at least an annual basis, toinform the worker of his/her dose. The As Low As Reasonably Achievable \"ALARA\" Program 10 CFR 20.1101 states that \"each licensee shall develop, document, and implement a radiation protection program commensurate with the scope and extent of licensed activities \u00ff\" and, \"the licensee shall use, to the extent practical, procedures and engineering controls based upon soundradiation protection principles to achieve occupational doses and doses to members of the public thatare as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA).\" Additionally, 10 CFR 20.1101 requires thatlicensees periodically review the content of the radiation protection program and its implementation. External Exposure It is necessary to assess doses to radiation workers to demonstrate compliance with regulatory limits on radiation dose and to help demonstrate that doses are maintained at ALARA levels.Providing for the safe use of radioactive materials and radiation is a management responsibility. It isimportant that management recognize the importance of radiation monitoring in the overallrequirements for radiation protection. There are three dose limits included in 10 CFR 20.1201 that apply to external exposure: deep dose to the whole body (5 rem or 0.05 Sv), shallow dose to the skin or extremities (50 rem or 0.5 Sv), anddose to the lens of the eye (15 rem or 0.15 Sv). According to the definitions in 10 CFR 20.1003, the(DDE) to the whole body is considered to be at a tissue depth of 1 cm (1000 mg/cm 2), shallow-dose equivalent to the skin or extremities at 0.007 cm (7 mg/cm2), and eye dose equivalent at 0.3 cm (300 mg/cm2). In evaluating the eye dose equivalent, it is acceptable to take credit for the shielding provided by protective lenses.APPENDIX M NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 M-210 CFR 20.1502(a) requires the use of individual monitoring devices for the following: CAdults likely to receive, in one year, from sources external to the body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of the occupational dose limits in 10 CFR 20.1201(a). Monitoring devices areaccordingly required for adults with an annual dose in excess of - 0.5 rem (0.005 Sv) DDE - 1.5 rem (0.015 Sv) eye dose 5 rem (0.05 Sv) shallow-dose equivalent to the skin- 5 rem (0.05 Sv) shallow-dose equivalent to any extremity. CMinors who are likely to receive an annual dose in excess of - 0.1 rem (1.0 mSv) DDE - 0.15 rem (1.5 mSv) eye dose equivalent- 0.5 rem (5 mSv) shallow-dose equivalent to the skin- 0.5 rem (5 mSv) shallow-dose equivalent to any extremity. CDeclared pregnant women likely to receive an annual dose in excess of 0.1 rem (1.0 mSv) DDEduring the entire pregnancy. CIndividuals entering a high or a very high radiation area. To demonstrate that monitoring of occupational exposure is not necessary for a group of radiation workers, it must be demonstrated that doses will not exceed 10% of the applicable limits. In these cases, NRC does not require licensees to monitor radiation doses for this class of worker. The following methods may be used to demonstrate that doses are expected to be within 10% of regulatory limits: CPrior Experience: Review of radiation dose hist ories for workers in a specific work area show that they are not likely to receive a dose in excess of 10% of the limits; CArea Surveys: Demonstrate through the conduct of appropriate radiation level surveys (e.g.,using a survey meter or area thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs)) in the work area, combinedwith estimates of occupancy rates and calculations, that doses to workers are not likely toexceed 10% of the limits (exposures associated with reasonable 'accident' scenarios should alsobe evaluated); CThe licensee performs a reasonable calculation based upon source strength, distance, shielding,and time spent in the work area, that shows that workers are not likely to receive a dose inexcess of 10% of the limits. External dose is determined by using individual monitoring devices, such as film badges, optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLs), or TLDs. These devices must be evaluated by aprocessor that is National Voluntary Labor atory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)-approved, as required by 10 CFR 20.1501.APPENDIX M M-3 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1The device for monitoring the whole body dose, eye dose, skin dose, or extremity dose shall be placed near the location expected to receive the highest dose during the year (10 CFR 20.1201(c)). When the whole body is exposed fairly uniformly, the individual monitoring device is typically wornon the front of the upper torso. If the radiation dose is highly non-uniform, causing a specific part of the whole body (head, trunk, arms above the elbow, or legs above the knees) to receive a substantially higher dose than the rest ofthe whole body, the individual monitoring device shall be placed near that part of the whole bodyexpected to receive the highest dose. For example, if the dose rate to the head is expected to behigher than the dose rate to the trunk of the body, a monitoring device shall be located on or close tothe head. If, after the exposure is received, the licensee somehow learns that the maximum dose to a part of the whole body, eye, skin, or extremity was substantially higher than the dose measured by theindividual monitoring device, an evaluation shall be conducted to estimate the actual maximum dose. 10 CFR 20.2106 requires that the recording for individual monitoring be done on NRC Form 5 or equivalent. NRC Form 5 is used to record doses received for the calendar year. The monitoring yearmay be adjusted as necessary to permit a smooth transition from one monitoring year to another, aslong as the year begins and ends in the month of January, the change is made at the beginning of theyear, and no day is omitted or duplicated in consecutive years. Because evaluation of dose is an important part of the radiation protection program, it is important that users return dosimeters on time. Licensees should be vigorous in their effort to recover anymissing dosimeters. Delays in processing a dosimeter can result in the loss of the stored information. In order to demonstrate compliance with occupational dose limits of 10 CFR 20.1201, the licensee needs to perform and document an evaluation of the dose the individual received and to add it to theemployee's dose record, if an individual's dosimeter is lost. Sometimes the most reliable method forestimating an individual's dose is to use his/her recent dose history. In other cases, particularly if theindividual does non-routine types of work, it may be better to use doses of co-workers as the basisfor the dose estimate. It also may be possible to estimate doses by modeling and calculation (i.e.,reconstruction) of scenarios leading to dose. Investigational Levels - External Dose Monitoring NRC has emphasized that the investigational levels in this program are not new dose limits but, as noted in ICRP Report 26, \"Recommendations of the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection,\" investigational levels serve as check points above which the results are consideredsufficiently important to justify investigation. In cases where a worker's or a group of workers' doses need to exceed an Investigational Level, a new, higher Investigational Level may be established for that individual or group on the basis that itis consistent with good ALARA practices. Justification for new Investigational Levels should bedocumented. When the cumulative annual exposure to a radiation worker exceeds Investigational Level I in Table M.1 (i.e., 10% of the annual limit for occupational exposure), the RSO or the RSO's designee shouldinvestigate the exposure and review the actions that might be taken to reduce the probability ofAPPENDIX M NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 M-4recurrence. When the cumulative annual exposure exceeds Investigational Level II in Table M.1 (i.e., 30% of the annual limit for occupational exposure), the RSO or the RSO's designee willinvestigate the exposure and review actions to be taken to reduce the probability of recurrence, andmanagement should review the report of the actions to be taken to reduce the probability ofoccurrence. Table M.1 Investigational Levels Part of BodyInvestigational Level I (mrem per year)Investigational Level II (mrem per year) whole body; head; trunk including male gonads; arms above the elbow; the knee500 (5 knee; or skin5000 (50 mSv) 15,000 (150 mSv) lens of the eye 1500 (15 mSv) 4500 (45 mSv) Review and record on NRC Form 5, \"Current Occ upational External Radiation Exposures,\" or an equivalent form (e.g., dosimeter processor's report) results of personnel monitoring. Take the actionslisted below when the investigation levels listed in Table M.1 are reached: CPersonnel dose less than Investigational Level I. Except when deemed appropriate by the RSO or the RSO's designee, no further action will be taken if an individual's dose is less than Table M.1 values for Investigational Level I. CPersonnel dose equal to or greater than Investigational Level I but less than InvestigationalLevel II. When the dose of an individual whose dose equals or exceeds Investigational Level I, the RSO or the RSO's designee should conduct a timely investigation and review the actions that mightbe taken to reduce the probability of recurrence, following the period when the dose wasrecorded. If the dose does not equal or exceed Investigational Level II, no action relatedspecifically to the exposure is required unless deemed appropriate by the RSO or the RSO'sdesignee. Consider investigating the factors that led to the radiation exposure and the radiationdoses and work habits of other individuals engaged in similar tasks to determine ifimprovements additional safety measures are needed to reduce exposures. Evaluate in thecontext of ALARA program quality and record the results of investigations and evaluations. CPersonnel dose equal to or greater than Investigational Level II. The RSO should investigate in a timely manner the causes of all personnel doses equaling or exceeding Investigational Level II. A consideration of actions should be taken by the RSO toreduce the probability of occurrence, and a report of the actions should be reviewed by thelicensee's management at its first meeting following completion of the investigation. CRe-establishment of Investigational Level II to a level above that listed in Table M.1.APPENDIX M M-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Declared Pregnancy and Dose to Embryo/Fetus 10 CFR 20.1208 states that the licensee shall ensure that the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 0.5rem (5 mSv). The licensee shall make efforts to avoid substantial variation above a uniform monthlyexposure rate to a declared pregnant woman. If the pregnancy is declared in writing and includes theworker's estimated date of conception, the dose equivalent to an embryo/fetus shall be taken as thesum of: CThe deep-dose equivalent to the declared pregnant woman; and CThe dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus from radionuclides in the embryo/fetus andradionuclides in the declared pregnant woman. References: CMethods for calculating the radiation dose to the embryo/fetus can be found in Regulatory Guide 8.36, \"Radiation Dose To the Embryo/Fetus.\" CNUREG/CR-5631, PNL-7445, Rev. 2, \"Contribution of Maternal Radionuclide Burdens toPrenatal Radiation Doses\" (1996). Internal Exposure With respect to internal exposure, licensees are required to monitor occupational intake of radioactive material and assess the resulting dose if it appears likely that personnel will receivegreater than 10% of the annual limit on intake (ALI) from intakes in 1 year (10 CFR 20.1502). 10CFR Part 20 provides terms for radionuclide intakes by means of inhalation and ingestion, i.e.,derived air concentration (DAC) and ALI. The DAC for each class of radionuclide is the concentr ation of airborne radioactivity in \u00b5Ci/ml that, if an occupational worker were to be continuously exposed to for 2,000 hours (1 year), would resultin either a CEDE of 5 rem (0.05 Sv) to the whole body or a committed dose equivalent of 50 rem(0.5 Sv) to any individual organ or tissue, with no consideration for the contribution of external dose. The ALI and DAC for each radionuclide in a specific chemical form are listed in 10 CFR Part 20,Appendix B. For each class of each radionuclide, there are two ALIs, one for ingestion and one for inhalation. The ALI is the quantity of radioactive material that , if taken into the body of an adult worker by the corresponding route, would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv) or acommitted dose equivalent of 50 rem (0.5 Sv) to any individual organ or tissue, again, with noconsideration for the contribution of external dose. The total effective dose equivalent concept makes it possible to combine both the internal and external doses in assessing the overall risk to the health of an individual. The 10 CFR Part 20 ALIand DAC numbers reflect the doses to all principal organs that are irradiated. The ALI and DACwere derived by multiplying a unit intake by the appropriate organ weighting factors (W T), for the organs specifically targeted by the radionuclide compound, and then summing the organ-weighteddoses to obtain a whole body risk-weighted NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 M-6when an ALI is defined by the stochastic dose limit, this value alone is given. When the ALI is determined by the non-stochastic dose limit to an organ, the organ or tissue to which the limit appliesis shown, and the ALI for the stochastic limit is shown in parentheses. The types and quantities of radioactive material manipulated at most medical facilities do not provide a reasonable possibility for an internal intake by workers. However, uses such as preparingradioiodine capsules from liquid solutions, and opening and dispensing radioiodine from vials containing millicurie quantities require particular caution. To monitor internal exposures from suchoperations, a routine bioassay program to periodically monitor workers should be established. If a licensee determines that a program for performing thyroid uptake bioassay measurements is necessary, a program should be established. The program should include: i. adequate equipment to perform bioassay measurements, ii. procedures for calibrating the equipment, including factors necessary to convert counts per minute into becquerel or microcurie units, iii. the technical problems commonly associated w ith performing thyroid bioassays (e.g., statistical accuracy, attenuation by neck tissue), iv. the interval between bioassays,v. action levels, and vi. the actions to be taken at those levels.For guidance on developing bioassay programs and determination of internal occupational dose and summation of occupational dose, refer to Regulatory Guide 8.9, Revision 1, \"Acceptable Concepts,Models, Equations and Assumptions for a Bioassay Program\" dated July 1993, Regulatory Guide8.34, \"Monitoring Criteria and Methods to Calculate Occupational Radiation Doses, dated July 1992, and NUREG-1400, \"Air Sampling in the Workplace,\" dated September 1993. Recordkeeping Records of measurement data, calculations of intakes, and methods for calculating dose must be maintained as required by 10 CFR 20.2106.

Applicants may either adopt this model or develop alternative procedures to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1101. Minor Spills of Liquids and Solids 1. Notify persons in the area that a spill has occurred. 2. Prevent the spread of contamination by covering the spill with absorbent paper.3. Wearing gloves and protective clothing such as a lab coat and booties, clean up the spill using absorbent paper. Carefully fold the absorbent paper with the clean side out and place in a\"caution radioactive material\" labeled bag for transfer to a radioactive waste container. Also putcontaminated gloves and any other contaminated disposable material in the bag. 4. Survey the area with a low-range radiation det ection survey instrument sufficiently sensitive to detect the radionuclide. Check for removable contamination to ensure contamination levels arebelow trigger levels. Check the area around the spill. Also check hands, clothing, and shoes forcontamination. 5. Report the incident to the RSO. Major Spills of Liquids and Solids 1. Clear the area. Notify all persons not involved in the spill to vacate the room. 2. Prevent the spread of contamination by covering the spill with \"caution radioactive material\" labeled absorbent paper, but do not attempt to clean it up. To prevent the spread ofcontamination, clearly indicate the boundaries of the spill and limit the movement of allpersonnel who may be contaminated. 3. Shield the source if possible. Do this only if it can be done without further contamination or a significant increase in radiation exposure. 4. Close the room and lock or otherwise secure the area to prevent entry.5. Notify the RSO immediately.6. Decontaminate personnel by removing contaminated clothing and flushing contaminated skin with lukewarm water, then washing with mild soap. If contamination remains, the RSO mayconsider inducing perspiration. Then wash the affected area again to remove any contaminationthat was released by the perspiration. The decision to implement a major spill procedure instead of a minor spill procedure depends on many incident-specific variables, such as the number of individuals affected, other hazards present,APPENDIX N NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 N-2likelihood of contamination spread, types of surface s contaminated and radiotoxicity of the spilled material. For some spills of radionuclides with half-lives shorter than 24 hours and in amounts lessthan five times the lowest ALI, an alternative spill procedure may be restricted access pendingcomplete decay. Note: A report to NRC may be required pursuant to 10 CFR 30.50. Use Table P.1 as general guidance to determine whether a major spill procedure or a minor spill procedure will be implemented. Estimate the amount of radioactivity spilled. Initiate a major or minor spill procedure, based on the following information. Spills above these mCi amounts are considered major, and below these levelsare considered minor.

Emergency Surgery of Patients Who Have Received Therapeutic Amounts of Radionuclides The following procedures should be followed: 1. If emergency surgery is performed within the first 24 hours following the administration of I-131 sodium iodide, fluids (e.g., blood, urine) w ill be carefully removed and contained in a closed system. 2. Protective eye wear will be worn by the surgeon and any personnel involved in the surgical procedure for protection of the eyes from possible splashing of radioactive material andexposure from beta radiation (if applicable). 3. The Radiation Safety Staff will direct pers onnel in methods to keep doses ALARA during surgical procedures. 4. If an injury occurs during surgery that results in a cut or tear in the glove used, the individual involved will be monitored to determine if radi oactive material was introduced into the wound. The RSO will be informed of any possible radiation hazard. Autopsy of Patients Who Have Receive d Therapeutic Amounts of Radionuclides The following procedures should be followed: 1. Immediately notify the AU in charge of the patient and the RSO upon death of a therapy patient.2. An autopsy will be performed only after consultation and permission from the RSO. Radiation safety staff should evaluate the radiation hazard( s), direct personnel in safety and protection, and suggest suitable procedures in order to keep doses ALARA during the autopsy. 3. Protective eye wear should be worn by the pat hologist and assisting staff for protection from possible splashing of radioactive material. Consider the need for protection against exposurefrom high energy beta rays in cases involving therapy with P-32 and Y-90. 4. Remove tissues containing large activities early to help reduce exposure of autopsy personnel. Shield and dispose of contaminated tissues in accord with license conditions. In some cases,exposure reduction may be accomplished by removing tissues for dissection to a location wherethe exposure rate is lower. 5. If an injury occurs during the autopsy that results in a cut or tear in the glove, monitor the wound and decontaminate as appropriate to the situation; inform radiation safety staff.APPENDIX N NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 N-4References : NRCP Report No. 111, \"Developing Radiation Emergency Plans for Academic, Medical, and Industrial Facilities,\" 1991, contains helpful information.

P-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Model Procedure for Safely Open ing Packages Containing Radioactive Material This model provides acceptable procedures for opening packages containing radioactive material. Applicants may either adopt this model procedure or develop an alternative procedure to meet therequirements of 10 CFR 20.1906. Special requirements must be followed for packages containing quantities of radioactive material in excess of the Type A quantity limits specified in Table A.1 of 10 CFR Part 71 (e.g., 216 curies of Tc-99m). Such packages must be received expeditiously when the carrier offers it fordelivery or when the carrier notifies the licensee that the package has arrived at the carrier's terminal. For these and other packages for which monitoring is required, check for external radiation levelsand surface contamination within 3 hours of receip t (if received during working hours) or no later than 3 hours from the beginning of the next wo rking day (if received after working hours), in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1906(c). NRC Regional Office and the finaldelivery carrier must be notified if the following conditions apply: CRemovable radioactive surface contamination exceeds the limits of 10 CFR 71.87(i); and CExternal radiation levels exceed the limits of 10 CFR 71.47. Model Procedure 1. Put on gloves to prevent hand contamination. 2. Visually inspect the package for any sign of damage (e.g., wet or crushed). If damage is noted, stop the procedure and notify the RSO or the designee of the RSO if the RSO is not presentimmediately. 3. Monitor the external surfaces of a labeled 1 package for radioactive contamination, unless the package contains only radioactive material in the form of a gas or in special form, as defined in10 CFR 71.4. 4. Monitor the external surfaces of a labeled 1 package for radiation levels, unless the package contains quantities of radioactive material that are less than or equal to the Type A quantity, asdefined in 10 CFR 71.4 and Table A to 10 CFR Part 71. 5. Monitor all packages known to contain radioactive material for radioactive contamination and radiation levels, if there is evidence of degrada tion of package integrity, such as packages that are crushed, wet, or damaged. 6. Remove the packing slip.7. Open the outer package, following any instructions that may be provided by the supplier.APPENDIX P NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 P-28. Open the inner package and verify that the contents agree with the packing slip. 9. Check the integrity of the final source container. Notify the RSO (or the RSO's designee) of any broken seals or vials, loss of liquid, condensa tion, or discoloration of the packing material. 10. If there is any reason to suspect contamination, wipe the external surface of the final source container and remove the wipe sample to a low-background area. Assay the wipe sample todetermine if there is any removable radioactivity. An appropriate instrument with sufficientsensitivity will be used to assay the sample. For example, a NaI(T1) crystal and rate meter, aliquid scintillation counter, or a proportional flow counter may be used for these assays. Thedetection efficiency will be determined to convert wipe sample counts per minute todisintegrations per minute. Note: a dose calibrator is not sufficiently sensitive for this measurement. Take precautions against the potential spread of contamination. 11. Check the user request to ensure that the material received is the material that was ordered.12. Monitor the packing material and the empty packages for contamination with a radiation detection survey meter before discarding. If contaminated, treat this material as radioactivewaste. If not contaminated, remove or obliterate the radiation labels before discarding inin-house trash. 13. Make a record of the receipt.For packages received under the general license in 10 CFR 31.11, implement the following procedure for opening each package: 1. Visually inspect the package for any sign of damage (e.g., wet or crushed). If damage is noted, stop the procedure and notify the RSO (or the RSO's designee) immediately. 2. Check to ensure that the material received is the material that was ordered.APPENDIX Q Model Leak Test Program.APPENDIX Q Q-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Model Leak Test Program This model provides acceptable procedures for sealed source leak testing and analysis. Applicants may either adopt these model procedures or develop alternative procedures. Facilities and Equipment CTo ensure achieving the required sensitivity of measurements, leak tests should be analyzed in a low-background area. CConsider using a NaI(Tl) well counter system with a single or multichannel analyzer to analyzesamples obtained from gamma-emitting sources (e.g., Cs-137). CConsider using a liquid scintillation or gas-flow proportional counting system to analyzesamples obtained from beta-emitting sources (e.g., Sr-90). CInstrumentation used to analyze leak test samples must be capable of detecting 185 Bq(0.005 \u00b5Ci) of radioactivity. Model Procedure for Performing Leak Testing and Analysis CFor each source to be tested, list identifying information such as sealed source serial number, radionuclide, and activity. CUse a separate wipe sample (e.g., cotton swab or filter paper) for each source. CNumber each wipe to correlate identifying information for each source. CWear gloves. CObtain samples at the most accessible area where contamination would accumulate if the sealedsource were leaking. CMeasure the background count rate and record. CCheck the instrument's counting efficiency, using either a standard source of the sameradionuclide as the source being tested or one with similar energy characteristics. Accuracy ofstandards should be within \u00b1 5% of the stated value and traceable to a primary radiationstandard, such as those maintained by NIST.APPENDIX Q NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 Q-2CCalculate efficiency of the instrument. For example, where: Eff = efficiency, in cpm / microcurie,cpm = counts per minute,std = standard, andbkg = background. CAnalyze each wipe sample to determine net count rate. CFor each sample, calculate the activity in microcurie and record. CThe activity on the wipe sample is given by: CLeak test records will be retained in accordance with 10 CFR 35.2067 for 3 years. Licenseesshould include the following in records: - The model number and serial number (if assigned) of each source tested; - The identity of each source radionuclide and its estimated activity;- The measured activity of each test sample expressed in microcurie;- A description of the method used to measure each test sample;- The date of the test; and- The name of the individual who performed the test. CIf the wipe test reveals 185 Bq (0.005 \u00b5Ci) or greater: - Immediately withdraw the sealed source from use and store, dispose, or cause it to be repaired in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR Parts 20 and 30 [10 CFR 35.67]. - File a report within 5 days of the leak test in accordance with 10 CFR 35.3067.APPENDIX R Model Procedure for Area Surveys.APPENDIX R R-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Model Procedure for Area Surveys This model provides acceptable procedures for area surveys. Applicants may either adopt these model procedures or develop alternative procedures to meet the requirements of 10 CFR20.1101,10 CFR 20.1501, and 10 CFR 35.70. Guidance for developing alternate trigger levels forcontamination in restricted areas is included below. Ambient Radiation Level Surveys Procedures for ambient radiation level surveys (reference 10 CFR 20.1101, 10 CFR 20.1501, and 10 CFR 35.70): CPerform surveys of dose rates in locations where: - Workers are exposed to radiation levels that might result in radiation doses in excess of 10% of the occupational dose limits; or - An individual is working in an environment with a dose rate of 2.5 mrem/hour or more (5 rem/year divided by 2,000 hour/year). C10 CFR 20.1301 requires that the TEDE to an individual member of the public from thelicensed operation does not exceed 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in a year, and that the dose in anyunrestricted area from external sources does not exceed 0.02 mSv (0.002 rem) in any one hour. Appropriate surveys will be conducted to assure that the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1301 aremet. CPerform radiation level surveys with a survey meter sufficiently sensitive to detect 0.1milliroentgen (mR) per hour in the following areas, at the frequency specified: - Survey at the end of each day of use all radiopharmaceutical elution, preparation, assay and administration areas (except patient rooms, which will be surveyed at the end of the therapyinstead of on the day of administration) when using radiopharmaceuticals requiring awritten directive (e.g., all therapy dosages and any iodine-131 dosage exceeding 30 \u00b5Ci). - Survey monthly all laboratory areas where only small quantities of gamma-emitting radioactive material are used (< 200 \u00b5Ci at a time). - Survey weekly all radionuclide use, storage, and waste storage areas. If diagnostic administrations are occasionally made in patients' rooms (e.g., bone scan injections,Tc-99m heart agents) and special care is taken to remove all paraphernalia, those roomsneed not be surveyed. - Survey quarterly all sealed source and brachytherapy source storage areas. CIf trigger levels are exceeded, follow internal procedures for responding and investigating what caused the trigger to be tripped. Example trigger levels for restricted and unrestricted areas arepresented in Table R.1.APPENDIX R NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 R-2Table R.1 Ambient Dose Rate Trigger Levels Type of Survey Area Surveyed Trigger Level Ambient Dose Rate Unrestricted 0.1 mR/hr Ambient Dose Rate Restricted 5.0 mR/hr Contamination Surveys Facilities and equipment for contamination surveys: To ensure achieving the required sensitivity of measurements, analyze survey samples in a low-background area. Table K-1 entitled \"Stationary Instruments Used to Measure Wipe, Bioassay,and Effluent Samples\" in Appendix K provi des examples of appropriate instruments. Perform contamination surveys using instruments suitable for removable and fixed contamination to identify areas of contamination that might result in doses to workers or to the public. Removablecontamination can be detected and measured by conducting a wipe test of the surface, counted in anappropriate counting instrument, such as a liquid scintillation counter, a sodium iodide or germanium gamma counter, or a proportional alpha/beta counter. Procedures for contamination surveys: CContamination surveys are performed in areas where unsealed forms of materials are used:- To evaluate radioactive contamination that could be present on surfaces of floors, walls, laboratory furniture, and equipment; - After any spill or contamination event;- When procedures or processes have changed;- To evaluate contamination of users and the immediate work area, at the end of the day, when licensed material is used; - In unrestricted areas at frequencies consistent with the types and quantities of materials in use, but not less frequently than monthly; - In areas adjacent to restricted areas and in all areas through which licensed materials are transferred and temporarily stored before shipment. CUse methods for conducting surveys for removable contamination that are sufficiently sensitiveto detect contamination for those radionuclides in use and for which the most restrictive limitsapply, as listed in Tables R.2 for restricted areas and R.3 for unrestricted areas (e.g.,200 dpm/100 cm 2 for isotopes of iodine-131 in unrestricted areas). Removable contamination survey samples should be measured in a low-background area. The following areas andfrequencies should be followed:APPENDIX R R-3 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1- Removable contamination surveys weekly for radiopharmaceutical elution, preparation, assay, and administration areas. If diagnostic administrations are occasionally made inpatients' rooms (i.e., bone scan injections, Tc-99m heart agents, etc.), with special caretaken to remove all paraphernalia, those rooms need not be surveyed. - Removable contamination surveys monthly of laboratory areas where only small quantities of photon-emitting radioactive material are used (<200 microcuries at a time). - Removable contamination surveys weekly for radionuclide storage and radionuclide waste storage areas. CA radioactive source with a known amount of activity should be used to convert samplemeasurements (usually in cpm) to dpm. CThe area should be either decontaminated, shielded, or posted and restricted from use if itcannot be decontaminated. CIf trigger levels are exceeded, follow internal procedures for responding and investigating whatcaused the trigger to be tripped. Example trigger levels for restricted areas are presented inTable R.2. Contamination found in unrestricted areas and on personal clothing will beimmediately decontaminated to background levels. Table R.2 Surface Contamination Levels in Restricted Areas (dpm/100 cm only in restrictedareas2000 20000APPENDIX R NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 R-4Table R.3 Surface Contamination Levels in Unrestricted Areas (dpm/100 surface contamination by multiple nuclides ex ists, the limits established for each nuclide should apply independently. 2As used in this table, dpm means the rate of emission by radioactive material, as determined by correcting the counts per minute observed by an appr opriate detector for background, efficiency, and geometric factors associated with the instrumentation. 3Measurements of average contaminant should not be averaged over more than 1 square meter. For objects of less surface area, the average should be derived for each such object. 4The maximum contamination level applies to an area of not more than 100 cm2. 5The amount of removable radioactive material per 100 cm2 of surface area should be determined by wiping that area with filter or soft absorbent pa per, applying moderate pr essure, and assessing the amount of radioactive material on the wipe with an appropriate instrument of known efficiency. When removable contamination on objects of less surface ar ea is determined, the pertinent levels should be reduced proportionally and the entire surface should be wiped. 6The average and maximum radiation levels associat ed with surface contamination resulting from beta- gamma emitters should not exceed 0.2 millirad/hour at 1 centimeter and 1.0 millirad/hour at 1centimeter, respectively, measured through not more than 7 milligrams per square centimeter of total absorber. Establishing Alternate Trigger Levels for Restricted Areas The following guidance is provided for those app licants who plan to develop procedures for surveying and controlling contamination using action levels for controlling contamination that differ from those provided in Tables R.1 and R.2: Alternate action levels for cleanup of contamination restricted areas may be developed without prior NRC approval if Cacceptable unrestricted area trigger levels are implemented (e.g., Tables R.1 and R.3); Cthe action levels maintain occupation doses ALARA; Cthe action levels meet all other regulatory requirements (e.g., they should also be designed tominimize, to the extent practicable, contamination of the facility, and the environment; facilitateeventual decommissioning; and minimize, to the extent practicable, the generation of radioactivewaste).APPENDIX R R-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Alternate Survey Frequency An example alternate survey frequency is described below. The objective is to determine how often to survey the laboratory. To do this, multiply the activity range for the appropriate group underLOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH survey frequency by the appropriate Modifying Factor to construct a new set of mCi ranges for LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH survey frequency. For instance, if30 millicuries of iodine-131 is used in the hot laboratory, the survey frequency for the hot laboratorywould be daily; since the group for iodine-131 is Group 2, the survey frequency category for anactivity of greater than 10 millicuries is high, and the modifying factor is 1. Table R.4 Grouping of Radioisotope s for Alternate Survey Frequency Group 1 Group 1, excerpted from IAEA Safety Series 115, does not include radioisotopes traditionally used in medicine. Group of Laboratories for Alternate Survey Frequency Survey Frequency Category Group Low Medium High 1 <0.1 mCi 0.1 mCi to 1 mCi >1 mCi 2 <1 mCi 1 mCi to 10 mCi >10 mCi3 <100 mCi 100 mCi to 1 Ci >1 Ci4 <10 Ci 10 Ci to 100 Ci >100 Ci Survey Frequency : CLow - Not less than once a month; CMedium - Not less than once per week; CHigh - Not less than once per normal working day.

You may either adopt this model procedure or develop your own procedure to meet the requirements of10 CFR 35.40 and 10 CFR 35.41. Written Directive Procedures This model provides guidance to licensees and applicants for developing, maintaining, and implementing procedures for administrations that require written directives (WD). This model doesnot restrict your use of other guidance in developing, implementing, and maintaining writtenprocedures for administrations requiring a WD. Such procedures are to provide high confidence thatthe objectives specified in 10 CFR 35.41 will be met. The WD must be prepared for any administration of I-131 sodium iodide greater than 1.11 MBq (30 \u00b5Ci), any therapeutic dosage of a radiopharmaceutical, and any therapeutic dose of radiation frombyproduct material. The WD must contain the information described in 10 CFR 35.40 and beretained in accordance with 10 CFR 35.2040. Discussion The administration of radioactive materials can be a complex process for many types of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in nuclear medicine or radiation oncology departments. A number of individuals may be involved in the delivery process. For example, in an oncology department, whenthe authorized user (AU) prescribes a teletherapy treatment, the delivery process may involve a teamof medical professionals such as an authorized medical physicist (AMP), a dosimetrist, and aradiation therapist. Treatment planning may involve a number of measurements, calculations,computer-generated treatment plans, patient simulations, portal film verifications, and beam-modifying devices to deliver the prescribed dose. Therefore, instructions must be clearlycommunicated to the professional team members with constant attention devoted to detail during thetreatment process. Complicated processes of this nature require good planning and clear,understandable procedures. To help ensure that all personnel involved in the treatment fullyunderstand instructions in the WD or treatment plan, the licensee should instruct all workers to seekguidance if they do not understand how to carry out the WD. Specifically, workers should ask ifthey have any questions about what to do or how it should be done before administration, rather thancontinuing a procedure when there is any doubt. Li censees should also consider verification of WDs or treatment plans by at least one qualified person (e.g., an oncology physician, AMP, nuclearmedicine technologist, or radiation therapist), pref erably other than the individual who prepared the dose, the dosage, or the treatment plan. The administration of radioactive materials can involve a number of treatment modalities, e.g., radiopharmaceutical therapy, teletherapy, brachytherapy, gamma radiosurgery (GSR),and future emerging For such modality for which 10 CFR 35.40 requires, orwould require, a written directive (as define d in 10 CFR 35.2), the licensee should develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for WDs to meet the requirements and/or objectives of10 CFR 35.40, 35.41, - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 S-2CHave an authorized user date and sign a written directive prior to the administration that includes the information in 10 CFR 35.40(b), including the patient or human research subject'sname; CVerify the patient's or human research subject's identity prior to each administration; CVerify that the administration is in accordance with the treatment plan, if applicable, and thewritten directive; CCheck both manual and computer-generated dose calculations; CVerify that any computer-generated dose calculations are correctly transferred into the consolesof therapeutic medical devices; and CDetermine and record the activity of the radiopharmaceutical dosage or radiation dose beforemedical use. The following procedures are provided as assistance in meeting the above objectives. Procedures for Any Therapeutic Dose or Dosage of a Radionuclide or Any Dosage of Quantities Greater than 30 Microc urie of Sodium Iodide I-131 Develop, implement, and maintain the following procedures to meet the objectives of 10 CFR 35.40 and 10 CFR 35.41: CAn AU must date and sign a WD prior to the administration of any dose or dosage. Writtendirectives may be maintained in patients' charts. CPrior to administering a dose or dosage, the patient's or human research subject's identity willbe positively verified as the individual named in the WD. Examples of positive patient identityverification include examining the patient's ID bracelet, hospital ID card, driver's license, orsocial security card. Asking or calling the patient's name does not constitute positive patientidentity verification. CThe specific details of the administration will be verified, including the dose or dosage, inaccordance with the WD or treatment plan. All components of the WD (radionuclide, total doseor dosage, etc.) will be confirmed by the person administering the dose or dosage to verifyagreement with the WD. Appropriate verification methods include: measuring the activity inthe dose calibrator, checking the serial number of the sealed sources behind an appropriateshield, using color-coded sealed sources, or using clearly marked storage locations.APPENDIX S S-3 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Additional Procedures for Sealed Therape utic Sources and Devices Containing Sealed Therapeutic Sources Licensees are required under 10 CFR 35.40 and 10 CFR 35.41 to have written directives for certain administrations of doses and to have procedures for administrations for which a written directive isrequired. Model procedures for meeting these requirements appear below. A. To ensure that the dose is delivered in accordance with the WD, the AU (and the neurosurgeon for GSR therapy) must date and sign (indicating approval of) the treatment plan that provides sufficient information and direction to meet the objectives of the WD. B. For sealed sources inserted into the patient's body, radiographs or other comparable images (e.g., computerized tomography) will be used as the basis for verifying the position of thenon-radioactive dummy sources and calculating the administered dose before administration. However, for some brachytherapy procedures, th e use of various fixed geometry applicators (e.g., appliances or templates) may be required to establish the location of the temporary sourcesand to calculate the exposure time (or, equivalently, the total dose) required to administer theprescribed brachytherapy treatment. In these cases, radiographs or other comparable imagesmay not be necessary, provided the position of the sources is known prior to insertion of theradioactive sources and calculation of the exposure time (or, equivalently, the total dose). C. Dose calculations will be checked before administering the prescribed therapy dose. An AU or a qualified person under the supervision of an AU (e.g., an AMP, oncology physician,dosimetrist, or radiation therapist), preferably one who did not make the original calculations, will check the dose calculations. Methods for checking the calculations include the following: 1. For computer-generated dose calculations, examining the computer printout to verify that correct input data for the patient was used in the calculations (e.g., source strength andpositions). 2. For computer-generated dose calculations entered into the therapy console, verifying correct transfer of data from the computer (e.g., channel numbers, source positions, andtreatment times). 3. For manually-generated dose calculations, verifying: a. No arithmetic errors; b. Appropriate transfer of data from the WD, treatment plan, tables and graphs;c. Appropriate use of nomograms (when applicable); andd. Appropriate use of all pertinent data in the calculations. The therapy dose will be manually calculated to a single key point and the results compared to the computer-generated dose calculations. If the manual dose calculations areperformed using computer-generated outputs (or vice versa), verify the correct output from one type of calculation (e.g., computer) to be used as an input in another type of calculation(e.g., manual). Parameters such as the transmission factors for wedges and applicators andthe source strength of the sealed source used in the dose calculations will be checked.APPENDIX S NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 S-4D. After implantation but before completion of the procedure: record in the written directive the radionuclide, treatment site, number of sources, and total source strength and exposure time (orthe total dose) as required by 10 CFR 35.40(b)(6). For example, after insertion of permanentimplant brachytherapy sources, an AU should promptly record the actual number of radioactivesources implanted and the total source strength. The written directive may be maintained in thepatient's chart. E. Acceptance testing will be performed by a qualified person (e.g., an AMP) on each treatment planning or dose calculating computer program that could be used for dose calculations.Acceptance testing will be performed before the first use of a treatment planning or dosecalculating computer program for therapy dose calculations. Each treatment planning or dosecalculating computer program will be assessed based on specific needs and applications. Acheck of the acceptance testing will also be pe rformed after each source replacement or when spot check measurements indicate that the source output differs by more than 5% from theoutput obtained at the last full calibration corrected mathematically for radioactive decay. F. Independent checks on full calibration measurements will be performed. The independent check will include an output measurement for a single specified set of exposure conditions andwill be performed within 30 days following the full calibration measurements. The independentcheck will be performed by either: 1. An individual who did not perform the full calibration (the individual will meet the requirements specified in 10 CFR 35.51) using a dosimetry system other than the one thatwas used during the full calibration (the dosimetry system will meet the requirementsspecified in 10 CFR 35.630); or 2. An AMP (or an oncology physician, dosimetrist, or radiation therapist who has been properly instructed) using a thermoluminescence dosimetry service available by mail that isdesigned for confirming therapy doses and that is accurate within 5%. G. For GSR, particular emphasis will be directed on verifying that the stereoscopic frame coordinates on the patient's skull match those of the treatment plan. H. A physical measurement of the teletherapy output will be made under applicable conditions prior to administration of the first teletherapy fractional dose, if the patient's treatment planincludes: (1) field sizes or treatment distances that fall outside the range of those measured inthe most recent full calibration; or (2) transmission factors for beam-modifying devices (exceptnon-recastable and recastable blocks, bolus and compensator materials, and split-beam blockingdevices) not measured in the most recent full calibration measurement. I. A weekly chart check will be performed by a qualified person under the supervision of an AU (e.g., an AMP, dosimetrist, oncology physician, or radiation therapist) to detect mistakes (e.g.,arithmetic errors, miscalculations, or incorrect transfer of data) that may have occurred in thedaily and cumulative dose administrations from all treatment fields or in connection with anychanges in the WD or treatment plan. J. Treatment planning computer systems using removable media to store each patient's treatment parameters for direct transfer to the treatment system will have each card labeled with theAPPENDIX S 1 The commercial telephone number of NRC Operati ons Center is (301) 951-0550. The Center will accept collect calls. S-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1corresponding patient's name and identification number. Such media may be reused (and must be relabeled) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Review of Administrations Requiring a Written Directive Conduct periodic reviews of each applicable program area, e.g., radiopharmaceutical therapy, high- dose-rate brachytherapy, andemerging technologies. The number of patient cases to be sampled should be based on the principlesof statistical acceptance sampling and be representative of each treatment modality performed in theinstitution, e.g., radiopharmaceutical, teletherapy, brachytherapy and gamma stereotacticradiosurgery. If feasible, the persons conducting the review shoul d not review their own work. If this is not possible, two people should work together as a team to conduct the review of that work. Regularlyreview the findings of the periodic reviews to ensure that the procedures for administrations requiringa WD are effective. As required by 10 CFR 35.41, a determination will be made as to whether the administered radiopharmaceutical dosage or radiation dose was in accordance with the WD or treatment plan, asapplicable. When deviations from the WD are found, the cause of each deviation and the actionrequired to prevent recurrence should be identified. Reports of Medical Events Notify by telephone the NRC Operations Center 1 no later than the next calendar day after discovery of a medical event and submit a written report to the appropriate NRC Regional Office listed in 10CFR 30.6 within 15 days after the discovery of the medical event, as required by 10 CFR 35.3045. Also notify the referring physician and the patient as required by 10 CFR 35.3045..APPENDIX T Model Procedures for Safe Use of Unsealed Licensed Material.APPENDIX T T-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Model Procedures for Safe Use of Unsealed Licensed Material This model provides acceptable procedures for safe use of unsealed licensed material. You may either adopt this model procedure or develop your own procedure. (Some of the health physicspractices listed below may also apply to sealed sources.) CWear laboratory coats or other protective clothing at all times in areas where radioactivematerials are used. CWear disposable gloves at all times while handling radioactive materials. CEither after each procedure or before leaving the area, monitor your hands for contamination ina low-background area using an appropriate survey instrument. CUse syringe shields for reconstitution of radiopharmaceutical kits and administration ofradiopharmaceuticals to patients, except when their use is contraindicated (e.g., recessed veins,infants). In these and other exceptional cases, use other protective methods, such as remotedelivery of the dose (e.g., use a butterfly needle.) CDo not eat, store food, drink, smoke, or apply cosmetics in any area where licensed material isstored or used. CWear personnel monitoring devices, if required, at all times while in areas where radioactivematerials are used or stored. These devices shall be worn as prescribed by the RSO. When notbeing worn to monitor occupational exposures, personnel monitoring devices shall be stored inthe work place in a designated low-background area. CWear extremity dosimeters, if required, when handling radioactive material. CDispose of radioactive waste only in designated, labeled, and properly shielded receptacles. CNever pipette by mouth. CWipe-test unsealed byproduct material storage, preparation, and administration areas weekly forcontamination. If necessary, decontaminate the area. CSurvey with a radiation detection survey meter all areas of licensed material use, including thegenerator storage, kit preparation, and injection areas daily for contamination. If necessary,decontaminate the area. Areas used to prepare and administer therapy quantities ofradiopharmaceuticals must be surveyed daily in accordance with 10 CFR 35.70 (except whenadministering therapy dosages in patients' rooms when patients are confined). CStore radioactive solutions in shielded containers that are clearly labeled. CRadiopharmaceutical multi-dose diagnostic and therapy vials must be labeled in 10 CFR 35.69 and 10 CFR 20.1904.APPENDIX T NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 T-2CSyringes and unit dosages must be labeled in accordance with 10 CFR 35.69 and 10 CFR 20.1904. Mark the label with the radionuclide, the activity, the date for which theactivity is estimated, and the kind of materials (i.e., radiopharmaceutical). If the container isholding less than the quantities listed in Appendix C to Part 20, the syringe or vial need only belabeled to identify the radioactive drug (10 CFR 35.69). To avoid mistaking patient dosages,label the syringe with the type of study and the patient's name. CFor prepared dosages, assay each patient dosage in the dose calibrator (or instrument) beforeadministering it (10 CFR 35.63). CDo not use a dosage if it does not fall within the prescribed dosage range or if it varies morethan \u00b120% from the prescribed dosage, except as approved by an authorized user. CWhen measuring the dosage, you need not consider the radioactivity that adheres to the syringewall or remains in the needle. CCheck the patient's name and identification number and the prescribed radionuclide, chemicalform, and dosage before administering. If the prescribed dosage requires a written directive, thepatient's identity must be verified and the administration must be in accordance with the writtendirective (10 CFR 35.41). CAlways keep flood sources, syringes, waste, and other radioactive material in shieldedcontainers. CSecure all licensed material when not under the constant surveillance and immediate control ofan individual authorized under the NRC license (or such individual's designee).APPENDIX U Model Procedure for Release of Patients or Human Research Subjects Administered Radioactive Materials.APPENDIX U U-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1r) e - (1 T Q 34.6 = D(t)2T -0.693t/ P 0P Model Procedure for Release of Patients or Human Research Subjects Administered Radioactive Materials Section 35.75, \"Release of Individuals Containi ng Unsealed Byproduct Material or Containing Byproduct Material,\" 10 CFR Part 35, \"Medical Use of Byproduct Material,\" permits a licensee to \"authorize the release from its control any individual who has been administeredunsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material if the total effective doseequivalent to any other individual from exposure to the released individual is not likely to exceed 5millisieverts (0.5 rem).\" In this appendix, the individual or human research subject to whom the radioactive material has been administered is called the \"patient.\" Release Equation The activities at which patients could be released were calculated by using, as a starting point, the method discussed in the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)Report No. 37, \"Precautions in the Management of Patients Who Have Received TherapeuticAmounts of Radionuclides.\" NCRP Report No. 37 uses the following equation to calculate the exposure until time t at a distance r from the patient: Equation U.1: Where: D(t) = Accumulated exposure at time t, in roentgens 34.6 = Conversion factor of 24 hrs/day times the total integration of decay (1.44) ' = Specific gamma ray constant for a point source, R/mCi-hr at 1 cm Q0 = Initial activity of the point source in millicuries, at the time of the release Tp = Physical half-life in days r = Distance from the point source to the point of interest, in centimeterst = Exposure time in days. This appendix uses the NCRP equation (Equation U.1) in the following manner to calculate the activities at which patients may be released. CThe dose to an individual likely to receive the highest dose from exposure to the patient is takento be the dose to total decay. Therefore, (1-e -0.693t/Tp ) is set equal to 1. CIt is assumed that 1 roentgen is equal to 10 millisieverts (1 rem).APPENDIX U NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 U-2CThe exposure-rate constants and physical half-lives for radionuclides typically used in nuclear medicine and brachytherapy procedures are given in Supplement A to this appendix. CDefault activities at which patients may be released are calculated using the physical half-livesof the radionuclides and do not account for the biological half-lives of the radionuclides. CWhen release is based on biological elimination (i.e., the effective half-life) rather than just thephysical half-life of the radionuclide, Equation U.1 is modified to account for the uptake and retention of the radionuclide by the patient, as discussed in Supplement B.2. CFor radionuclides with a physical half-life greater than 1 day and no consideration of biologicalelimination, it is assumed that the individual likely to receive the highest dose from exposure tothe patient would receive a dose of 25% of the dose to total decay (0.25 in Equation U.2), at adistance of 1 meter. Selection of 25% of the dose to total decay at 1 meter for estimating thedose is based on measurements discussed in the supporting regulatory analysis that indicate thedose calculated using an occupancy factor, E, of 25% at 1 meter is conservative in most normal situations. CFor radionuclides with a physical half-life less than or equal to 1 day, it is difficult to justify an occupancy factor of 0.25, because relatively long-term averaging of behavior cannot beassumed. Under this situation, occupancy factors from 0.75 to 1.0 may be more appropriate. Thus, for radionuclides with a physical half-life greater than 1 day: Equation U.2: For radionuclides with a physical half-life less than or equal to 1 day, and if an occupancy factor of 1.0 is used: Equation U.3: Equations U.2 and U.3 calculate the dose from external exposure to gamma radiation. These equations do not include the dose from internal intake by household members and members of thepublic, because the dose from intake by other individuals is expected to be small for mostradiopharmaceuticals (less than a few percent), relative to the external gamma dose (see \"InternalDose,\"of Supplement B). Further, the equations above do not apply to the dose to breast-feedinginfants or children who continue to breast-feed. Patients who are breast-feeding an infant or child must be considered separately, as discussed in Item U.1.1, \"Release of Patients Based onAdministered Activity.\"APPENDIX U U-3 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1U.1 Release Criteria Licensees should use one of the following options to release a patient to whom unsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material have been administered in accordance withregulatory requirements. U.1.1 Release of Patients Based on Administered Activity In compliance with the dose limit in 10 CFR 35.75(a), licensees may release patients from licensee control if the activity administered is no greater than the activity in Column 1 of Table U.1. The activities in Table U.1 are based on a total effective dose equivalent of 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem) to anindividual using the following conservative assumptions: CAdministered activity; CPhysical half-life; COccupancy factor of 0.25 at 1 meter for physical half-lives greater than 1 day and, to beconservative, an occupancy factor of 1 at 1 meter for physical half-lives less than or equal to1 day; and CNo shielding by tissue. The total effective dose equivalent is approximately equal to the external dose because the internal dose is a small fraction of the external dose (see Section B.3, \"Internal Dose,\" of Supplement B). Inthis case, no record of the release of the patient is required unless the patient is breast-feeding aninfant or child, as discussed in Item U.3.2, \"Records of Instructions for Breast-Feeding Patients.\" Thelicensee may demonstrate compliance by using the records of activity that are already required by 10CFR 35.40 and 35.63. If the activity administered exceeds the activity in Column 1 of Table U.1, the licensee may release the patient when the activity has decayed to the activ ity in Column 1 of Table U.1. In this case, 10 CFR 35.75(c) requires a record because the patient's release is based on the retained activity ratherthan the administered activity. The activities in Column 1 of Table U.1 were calculated using eitherEquation U.2 or U.3, depending on the physical half-life of the radionuclide. If a radionuclide that is not listed in Table U.1 is administered, the licensee can demonstrate compliance with the regulation by maintaining, for NRC inspection, calculation of the releaseactivity that corresponds to the dose limit of 5 millisievert (0.5 rem). Equation U.2 or U.3 may beused, as appropriate, to calculate the activity Q corresponding to 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem). The release activities in Column 1 of Table U.1 do not include consideration of the dose to a breast-feeding infant or child from ingestion of radiopharmaceuticals contained in the patient's breast milk. When the patient is breast-feeding an infant or child, the activities in Column 1 of Table U.1are not applicable to the infant or child. In this case, it may be necessary to give instructions asdescribed in Items U.2.2 and U.2.3 as a condition for release. If failure to interrupt or discontinuecould result in a dose to the breast-feeding infant or child in excess of 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem), arecord that instructions were provided is required by 10 CFR 35.75(d).APPENDIX U NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 U-4U.1.2 Release of Patients Based on Measured Dose Rate Licensees may release patients to whom radionuclides have been administered in amounts greater than the activities listed in Column 1 of Table U.1, provided the measured dose rate at 1 meter (fromthe surface of the patient) is no greater than the valu e in Column 2 of Table U.1 for that radionuclide. In this case, however, 10 CFR 35.75(c) requires a record because the release is based on consideringshielding by tissue. If a radionuclide not listed in Table U.1 is administered and the licensee chooses to release a patient based on the measured dose rate, the licensee should first calculate a dose rate that corresponds to the5 millisieverts (0.5 rem) dose limit. If the measured dose rate at 1 meter is no greater than thecalculated dose rate, the patient may be released. A record of the release is required by 10 CFR35.75(c). The dose rate at 1 meter may be calculated from Equation U.2 or U.3, as appropriate,because the dose rate at 1 meter is equal to ' Q / 10,000 cm2. U.1.3 Release of Patients Based on Pa tient-Specific Dose Calculations Licensees may release patients based on dose calculations using patient-specific parameters. With this method, based on 10 CFR 35.75(a), the licensee must calculate the maximum likely dose to anindividual exposed to the patient on a case-by-case basis. If the calculated maximum likely dose toan individual is no greater than 5 millisievert (0.5 rem), the patient may be released. Using thismethod, licensees may be able to release patients with activities greater than those listed in Column 1of Table U.1 by taking into account the effective half- life of the radioactive material and other factors that may be relevant to the particular case. In this case, a record of the release is required by 10 CFR35.75(c). If the dose calculation considered retained activity, an occupancy factor less than 0.25 at 1meter, effective half-life, or shielding by tissue, a record of the basis for the release is required by 10CFR 35.75(c). Supplement B contains procedures for performing patient-specific dose calculations, and it describes how various factors may be considered in the calculations.APPENDIX U U-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Table U.1 Activities and Dose Ra tes for Authorizing Patient Release RadionuclideCOLUMN 1 Activity at or Below Which Patients May Be ReleasedCOLUMN 2 Dose Rate at 1 Meter, at or Below Which Patients May Be Released* (GBq) (mCi) (mSv/hr) (mrem/hr) 4.8 130 0.02 2Cu-64 8.4 230 0.27 27Cu-67 14 390 0.22 22Ga-67 8.7 240 0.18 18I-123 6 160 0.26 26I-125 0.25 7 0.01 1I-125 implant 0.33 9 0.01 1I-131 1.2 33 0.07 7In-111 2.4 64 0.2 20Ir-192 implant 0.074 2 0.008 0.8P-32 ** ** ** **Pd-103 implant 1.5 40 0.03 3Re-186 28 770 0.15 15Re-188 29 790 0.2 20Sc-47 11 310 0.17 17Se-75 0.089 2 0.005 0.5Sm-153 26 700 0.3 30Sn-117m 1.1 29 0.04 4S r - 8 9 * ** ** ** *Tc-99m 28 760 0.58 58Tl-201 16 430 0.19 19Y-90 ** ** ** **Yb-169 0.37 10 0.02 2 Footnotes for Table U-1 The activity values were computed based on 5 millisie verts (0.5 rem) total effective dose equivalent. * If the release is based on the dose rate at 1 meter in Column 2, the licensee must maintain a record as required by 10 CFR 35.75(c), because the measurement includes shielding by tissue.

U.2 Instructions This Section provides acceptable instructions for release of patients administered radioactive materials. You may either adopt these model instructions or develop your own instructions to meetthe requirements of 10 CFR 35.75. U.2.1 Activities and Dose Ra tes Requiring Instructions Based on 10 CFR 35.75(b), for some administrations the released patients must be given instructions, including written instructions, on how to maintain doses to other individuals ALARAafter the patients are released. 1 Column 1 of Table U.2 provides the activity above which instructions must be given to patients. Column 2 provides corresponding dose rates at 1 meter, basedon the activities in Column 1. The activities or dose rates in Table U.2 may be used for determiningwhen instructions must be given. If the patient is breast-feeding an infant or child, additionalinstructions may be necessary (see Item U.2.2, \"Additional Instructions for Release of Patients WhoCould be Breast-Feeding After Release\"). When patient-specific calculations (as described in Supplement B) are used, instructions must be provided if the calculation indicates a dose greater than 1 millisievert (0.1 rem). If a radionuclide not listed in Table U.2 is administered, the licensee may calculate the activity or dose rate that corresponds to 1 millisievert (0.1 rem). Equation U.2 or U.3, as appropriate, may beused. U.2.2 Additional Instructions for Release of Patients Who Could Be Breast-Feeding After Release The requirement in 10 CFR 35.75(b) that a licensee pr ovide instructions on the discontinuation or the interruption period of breast-feeding, and the consequences of failing to follow the recommendation,presumes that the licensee will inquire, as appropriate, regarding the breast-feeding status of thepatient. 1 The purpose of the instructions (e.g., on interruption or discontinuation) is to permit licensees to release a patient who could be breast-feeding an infant or child when the dose to theinfant or child could exceed 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem) if there is no interruption of breast-feeding.APPENDIX U U-7 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1If the patient could be breast-feeding an infant or child after release, and if a radiopharmaceutical with an activity above the value stated in Column 1 of Table U.3 was administered to the patient, the licensee must give the patient instructions on the discontinuation or interruption period forbreast-feeding and the consequences of failing to follow the recommendation. The patient shouldalso be informed if there would be no consequences to the breast-feeding infant or child. Table U.3 also provides recommendations for interrupting or discontinuing breast-feeding to minimize the doseto below 1 millisievert (0.1 rem) if the patient has received certain radiopharmaceutical doses. Theradiopharmaceuticals listed in Table U.3 are commonly used in medical diagnosis and treatment. If a radiopharmaceutical not listed in Table U.3 is administered to a patient who could be breast-feeding, the licensee should evaluate whether instructions or records (or both) are required. Ifinformation on the excretion of the radiopharmaceutical is not available, an acceptable method is toassume that 50% of the administered activity is excreted in the breast milk. The dose to the infant orchild can be calculated by using the dose conversion factors given for a newborn infant by Stabin. U.2.3 Content of Instructions The instructions should be specific to the type of treatment given, such as permanent implants or radioiodine for hyperthyroidism or thyroid carcinom a, and they may include additional information for individual situations; however, the instructions should not interfere with or contradict the bestmedical judgment of physicians. The instructions may include the name of a knowledgeable contactperson and that person's telephone number, in case the patient has any questions.

Regardi ng Radiopharmaceutical Administrations For procedures involving radiopharmaceuticals, additional instructions may include the following: CMaintaining distance from other persons, including separate sleeping arrangements. CMinimizing time in public places (e.g., public transportation, grocery stores, shopping centers, theaters, restaurants, sporting events). CPrecautions to reduce the spread of radioactive contamination. CThe length of time each of the precautions should be in effect. The Society of Nuclear Medicine published a pamphl et in 1987 that provides information for patients receiving treatment with radioiodine. This pamphlet was prepared jointly by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and NRC. The pamphlet contains blanks for the physician to fill in the length of time thateach instruction should be followed. Although this pamphlet was written for the release of patientsto whom less than 1,110 megabecquerels (30 millicuries) of iodine-131 had been administered, NRCstill considers the instructions in this pamphlet to be an acceptable method for meeting therequirements of 10 CFR 35.75(b), provided the times filled in the blanks are appropriate for theactivity and the medical condition. If additional instructions are required because the patient is breast-feeding, the instructions should include appropriate recommendations on whether to interrupt breast-feeding, the length of time tointerrupt breast-feeding, or, if necessary, the di scontinuation of breast-feeding. The instructions should include information on the consequences of failure to follow the recommendation to interruptor discontinue breast-feeding. The consequences should be explained so that the patient willunderstand that, in some cases, breast-feeding after an administration of certain radionuclides shouldbe avoided. For example, a consequence of pr ocedures involving iodine-131 is that continued breast-feeding could harm the infant's or child 's thyroid. Most diagnostic procedures involve radionuclides other than radioiodine and there would be no consequences; guidance should simplyaddress avoiding any unnecessary radiation exposure to the infant or child from breast-feeding. Ifthe Society of Nuclear Medicine's pamphlet is given at release to a patient who is breast-feeding aninfant or child, the pamphlet should be supplemented with information specified in 10 CFR35.75(b)(1) and (2). The requirement of 10 CFR 35.75(b) regarding wr itten instructions to patients who could be breast-feeding an infant or child is not in any way intended to interfere with the discretion andjudgment of the physician in specifying the detailed instructions and recommendations.APPENDIX U NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 U-12U.2.3.2 Instructions Regarding Implants For patients who have received implants, additional instructions may include the following: A small radioactive source has been placed (implanted) inside your body. The source is actually many small metallic pellets or seeds, which are each about 1/3 to 1/4 of an inch long, similar in sizeand shape to a grain of rice. To minimize exposure to radiation to others from the source insideyour body, you should do the following for days. CStay at a distance of feet from . CMaintain separate sleeping arrangements. CMinimize time with children and pregnant women. CDo not hold or cuddle children. CAvoid public transportation. CExamine any bandages or linens that come into contact with the implant site for any pellets orseeds that may have come out of the implant site. CIf you find a seed or pellet that falls out:- Do not handle it with your fingers. Use something like a spoon or tweezers to place it in a jar or other container that you can close with a lid. - Place the container with the seed or pellet in a location away from people.- Notify at telephone number . U.3 Records U.3.1 Records of Release There is no requirement for recordkeeping on the release of patients who were released in accordance with Column 1 of Table U.1; however, if the releas e of the patient is based on a dose calculation that considered retained activity, an occupancy factor less than 0.25 at 1 meter, effective half-life, orshielding by tissue, a record of the basis for the release is required by 10 CFR 35.75(c). This recordshould include the patient identifier (in a way that ensures that confidential patient information is nottraceable or attributable to a specific patient), the radioactive material administered, the administeredactivity, and the date of the administration. In addition, depending on the basis for release, recordsshould include the following information: CFor Immediate Release of a Patient Based on a Patient-Specific Calculation : The equation used, including the patient-specific factors and their bases that were used in calculating the doseto the person exposed to the patient, and the calculated dose. The patient-specific factors (seeSupplement B of this appendix) include the effective half-life and uptake fraction for eachcomponent of the biokinetic model, the time that the physical half-life was assumed to apply toretention, and the occupancy factor. The basis for selecting each of these values should beincluded in the record. CFor Immediate Release of a Patient Based on Measured Dose Rate : The results of the measurement, the specific survey instrument used, and the name of the individual performingthe survey.APPENDIX U U-13 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1CFor Delayed Release of a Patient Based on Radioactive Decay Calculation : The time of the administration, date and time of release, and the results of the decay calculation. CFor Delayed Release of a Patient Based on Measured Dose Rate : The results of the survey meter measurement, the specific survey instrument used, and the name of the individualperforming the survey. In some situations, a calculation may be case-specific for a class of patients who all have the same patient-specific factors. In this case, the record for a particular patient's release may reference thecalculation for the class of patients. Records, as required by 10 CFR 35.75(c), should be kept in a manner that ensures the patient's confidentiality, that is, the records should not contain the patient's name or any other information thatcould lead to identification of the patient. These recordkeeping requirements may also be used toverify that licensees have proper procedures in place for assessing potential third-party exposureassociated with and arising from exposure to patients who were administered radioactive material. U.3.2 Records of Instructions for Breast-Feeding Patients If failure to interrupt or discontinue breast-feeding could result in a dose to the infant or child in excess of 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem), a record that instructions were provided is required by10 CFR 35.75(d). Column 2 of Table U.3 states, for the radiopharmaceuticals commonly used inmedical diagnosis and treatment, the activities that would require such records when administered topatients who are breast-feeding. The record should include the patient's identifier (in a way that ensures that confidential patient information is not traceable or attributable to a specific patient), the radiopharmaceuticaladministered, the administered activity, the date of the administration, and whether instructions wereprovided to the patient who could be breast-feeding an infant or child.

If the release of a patient is based on a patient-specific calculation that considered retained activity, an occupancy factor less than 0.25 at 1 meter, biologi cal or effective half-life, or shielding by tissue, a record of the basis of the release is required by 10 CFR 35.75(c). The following equation can beused to calculate doses: Equation B-1: Where: D(t) = Accumulated dose to time t, in rem; 34.6 = Conversion factor of 24 hrs/day times the total integration of decay (1.44); ' = Exposure rate constant for a point source, R/mCi x hr at 1 cm; Q0 = Initial activity at the start of the time interval; Tp = Physical half-life, in days; E = Occupancy factor that accounts for different occupancy times and distances when an individual is around a patient; r = Distance in centimeters. This value is typically 100 cm; andt = Exposure time in days. B.1 Occupancy Factor B.1.1 Rationale for Occupancy Fa ctors Used to Derive Table U.1 In Table U.1 in this appendix, the activities at which patients could be released were calculated using the physical half-life of the radionuclide and an o ccupancy factor at 1 meter of either 0.25 (if the radionuclide has a half-life longer than 1 day) or 1.0 (if the radionuclide has a half-life less than or equal to 1 day). The basis for the occupancy factor of 0.25 at 1 meter is that measurements of dosesto family members, as well as considerations of normal human behavior (as discussed in thesupporting regulatory analysis (Ref. B-1)), suggest th at an occupancy factor of 0.25 at 1 meter, when used in combination with the physical half-life, will produce a generally conservative estimate of the dose to family members when instructions on minimizing doses to others are given.APPENDIX U U-19 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1An occupancy factor of 0.25 at 1 meter may not be appropriate when the physical half-life is less than or equal to 1 day, and hence, the dose is delivered over a short time. Specifically, theassumptions regarding patient behavior that led to an occupancy factor of 0.25 at 1 meter include theassumption that the patient will not be in close proximity to other individuals for several days;however, when the dose is from a short-lived radionuclide, the time that individuals spend in closeproximity to the patient immediately following release will be most significant because the dose toother individuals could be a large fraction of the total dose from the short-lived radionuclide. Thus,to be conservative when providing generally applicable release quantities that may be used with littleconsideration of the specific details of a particular patient's release, the values calculated in TableU.1 were based on an occupancy factor of 1 at 1 me ter when the half-life is less than or equal to 1 day. If information about a particular patient implies the assumptions were too conservative,licensees may consider case-specific conditions. Conversely, if young children are present in thehousehold of the patient who is to be discharged, conservative assumptions about occupancy may beappropriate. B.1.2 Occupancy Factors to Consider for Patient-Specific Calculations The selection of an occupancy factor for patient-specific calculations will depend on whether the physical or effective half-life of the radionuclide is used and whether instructions are provided to the patient before release. The following occupancy factors, E, at 1 meter, may be useful for patient-specific calculations: CE = 0.75 when a physical half-life, an effectiv e half-life, or a specific time period under consideration (e.g., bladder holding time) is less than or equal to 1 day. CE = 0.25 when an effective half-life is greater than 1 day, if the patient has been giveninstructions, such as: - Maintain a prudent distance from others for at least the first 2 days; - Sleep alone in a room for at least the first night;- Do not travel by airplane or mass transportation for at least the first day;- Do not travel on a prolonged automobile trip with others for at least the first 2 days;- Have sole use of a bathroom for at least the first 2 days; and- Drink plenty of fluids for at least the first 2 days. CE = 0.125 when an effective half-life is greater than 1 day if the patient has been giveninstructions, such as: - Follow the instructions for E = 0.25 above; - Live alone for at least the first 2 days; and- Have few visits by family or friends for at least the first 2 days. CIn a two-component model (e.g., uptake of i odine-131 using thyroidal and extrathyroidal components), if the effective half-life associated with one component is less than or equal to one day but is greater than one day for the other component, it is more justifiable to use theoccupancy factor associated with the dominant component for both components.APPENDIX U NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 U-20Example 1 : Calculate the maximum likely dose to an individual exposed to a patient who has received 2,220 megabecquerels (60 millicuries) of iodine-131. The patient received instructions tomaintain a prudent distance from others for at least 2 days, lives alone, drives home alone, and staysat home for several days without visitors. Solution : The dose to total decay (t = 4) is calculated based on the physical half-life using Equation B-1. (This calculation illustrates the use of physical half-life. To account for biological elimination,calculations described in the next section should be used.) Because the patient has received instructions for reducing exposure as recommended for an occupancy factor of E = 0.125, the occupancy factor of 0.125 at 1 meter may be used. D ( 4) = 4.59 millisieverts (0.459 rem) Since the dose is less than 5 millisievert (0.5 rem), the patient may be released, but 10 CFR 35.75(b) requires that instructions be given to the patient on maintaining doses to others as low as isreasonably achievable. A record of the calculation must be maintained, pursuant to 10 CFR35.75(c), because an occupancy factor of less than 0.25 at 1 meter was used. B.2 Effective Half-Life A licensee may take into account the effective half-life of the radioactive material to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits for individuals exposed to the patient that are stated in10 CFR 35.75. The effective half-life and Physical half-life of the radionuclide. The behavior of iodine-131 can be modeled using two components: extrathyroidal iodide (i.e., existing outside of the thyroid) and thyr oidal iodide following uptake by the thyroid. The effective half-lives for the extrathyroidal and thyroidal fractions (i.e., F1 and F2, respectively) can be calculated with the following equations.APPENDIX U U-21 NUREG - 1556, Vol. thyroid; and Tp= Physical half-life of iodine-131. However, simple exponential excretion models do not account for: (a) the time for the iodine-131 to be absorbed from the stomach to the blood; and (b) the holdup of iodine in the urine while in thebladder. Failure to account for these factors could result in an underestimate of the dose to anotherindividual. Therefore, this supplement makes a conservative approximation to account for thesefactors by assuming that, during the first 8 hours af ter the administration, about 80% of the iodine administered is removed from the body at a rate determined only by the physical half-life ofiodine-131. Thus, an equation to calculate the dose from a patient administered iodine-131 may have three components. First is the dose for the first 8 hours (0.33 day) after administration. This componentcomes directly from Equation B-1, using the physical half-life and a factor of 80%. Second is the dose from the extrathyroidal component from 8 hours to total decay. In this component, the firstexponential factor represents the activity at t = 8 hours based on the physical half-life of iodine-131. The second exponential factor represents the activity from t = 8 hours to total decay based on theeffective half-life of the extrathyroidal component. The third component, the dose from the thyroidal component for 8 hours to total decay, is calculated in the same manner as the second component. The full equation is shown as Equation B-5. Equation B-5: () { }DQ cmET e eE TpT effT effp pp= ++ 03 3 06 9 3 03 3 21 106 9 03 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 U-22E1= Occupancy factor for the first 8 hours; and E2= Occupancy factor from 8 hours to total decay. All the other parameters are as defined in Equations B-1, B-3, and B-4. Acceptable values for F1, T1 eff, F2, and T2eff are shown in Table U.6 for thyroid ablation and treatment of thyroid remnants after surgical removal of the thyroid for thyroid cancer. If these values have been measured for a specificindividual, the measured values may be used. The record of the patient's release required by 10 CFR 35.75(c) is described in Item U.3.1 of this appendix. Example 2, Thyroid Cancer : Calculate the maximum likely dose to an individual exposed to a patient to whom 5550 megabecquerel (150 millicurie) of iodine-131 have been administered for thetreatment of thyroid remnants and metastasis. Solution : In this example, we will calculate the dose by using Equation B-5 to account for the elimination of iodine-131 from the body, based on th e effective half-lives appropriate for thyroid cancer. The physical half-life and the exposure rate constant are from Table U.5. The uptakefractions and effective half-lives are from Table U.6. An occupancy factor, E, of 0.75 at 1 meter, will be used for the first component because the time period under consideration is less than 1 day;however, for the second and third components, an occupancy factor of 0.25 will be used, because: (1)the effective half-life associated with the domin ant component is greater than 1 day; and (2) patient-specific questions were provided to the patient to justify the occupancy factor (see SectionB.1.2, \"Occupancy Factors to Consider for Patient-S pecific Calculations,\" of this Supplement). Table U.6 Uptake Fractions Effecti ve Half-Lives for Iodine-131 Treatments Extrathyroidal Component et al., \"Radiation Dosimetry for the Adult Female and Fetus from Iodine-131 Administration in Hyperthyroidism,\" Journal of Nuclear Medicine , Volume 32, Number 5, May 1991. The thyroid uptake fraction of 0.80 was selected as one that is seldom exceeded by the da ta shown in Figure 1 in this referenced document. The effective half-life of 5.2 days for the thyroidal component was derived from a biological half-life of 15 days, which was obtained from a straight-line fit that accounts for a bout 75% of the data points shown in Figure 1 of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine document. 2International Commission on Radiological Protecti on (ICRP), \"Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals,\" ICRP Publication No. 53, March 1987. (Available for sale from Pergamon Press, Inc., Elmsford, NY 10523.) The data in that document suggest th at the extrathyroidal component effective half-life in normal subjects is about 0.32 days. Lacking other data, this value is applied to hyperthyroid and thyroid cancerAPPENDIX U U-23 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1patients. For thyroid cancer, the thyroidal component effectiv e half-life of 7.3 days is based on a biological half-life of 80 days (adult thyroid), as suggested in the ICRP document. 3The thyroidal uptake fraction of 0.05 was recommended by Dr . M. Pollycove, M.D., NRC medical visiting fellow, as an upper-limit post-thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. Substituting the appropriate values into Equation B-5, the dose to total decay is: D(4) = 3.40 mSv (0.340 rem) Therefore, thyroid cancer patients to whom 5550 megabecquerel (150 millicurie) of iodine-131 or less has been administered would not have to remain under licensee control and could be releasedunder 10 CFR 35.75, assuming that the foregoing assumptions can be justified for the individualpatient's case and that the patient is given instructions. Patients administered somewhat largeractivities could also be released immediately if the dose is not greater than 5 millisieverts (0.5 rem). In the example above, the thyroidal fraction, F 2 = 0.05, is a conservative assumption for persons who have had surgery to remove thyroidal tissue. If F2 has been measured for a specific patient, the measured value may be used. Example 3, Hyperthyroidism : Calculate the maximum likely dose to an individual exposed to a patient to whom 2035 megabecquerels (55 millicuries) of iodine-131 has been administered for thetreatment of hyperthyroidism (i.e., thyroid ablation). Solution : In this example, we will again calculate the dose using Equation B-5, Table U.5, and Table U.6, to account for the elimination of iodine-131 from the body by using the effectivehalf-lives appropriate for hyperthyroidism. An occupancy factor, E, of 0.25 at 1 meter will be used for the second and third components of the equation because patient-specific instructions wereprovided to justify the occupancy factor (see Section B.1.2, \"Occupancy Factors to Consider for Patient-Specific Calculations\"). Substituting the appropriate values into Equation B-5, the dose to total decay is: D( 4) = 4.86 mSv (0.486 rem)APPENDIX 1556, hyperthyroid patients to whom 2035 mega becquerels (55 millicuries) of iodine-131 has been administered would not have to remain under licensee control and could be released under10 CFR 35.75 when the occupancy factor of 0.25 in the second and third components of the equationis justified. In the example above, the thyroidal fraction F 2 = 0.8 is a conservative assumption for persons who have this treatment for hyperthyroidism. If F2 has been measured for a specific patient, the measured value may be used. B.3 Internal Dose For some radionuclides, such as iodine-131, there may be concerns that the internal dose of an individual from exposure to a released patient could be significant. A rough estimate of the maximum likely committed effective dose equivalent from internal exposure can be calculated fromEquation B-6. Equation B-6: D i = Q (10-5)(DCF) Where: Di= Maximum likely internal committed effective dose equivalent to the individual exposed to the patient in rem; Q = Activity administered to the patient in millicuries;10 -5= Assumed fractional intake; and DCF = Dose conversion factor to convert an intake in millicurie to an internal committed effective dose equivalent (such as tabulated inReference B-2). Equation B-6 uses a value of 10 -5 as the fraction of the activity administered to the patient that would be taken in by the individual exposed to the patient. A common rule of thumb is to assume that nomore than 1 millionth of the activity being handled will become an intake to an individual workingwith the material. This rule of thumb was developed in reference B-3 for cases of worker intakesduring normal workplace operations, worker intakes from accidental exposures, and public intakesfrom accidental airborne releases from a facility, but it does not specifically apply to cases of intake by an individual exposed to a patient. However, two studies (Refs. B-4 and B-5) regarding the intakes of individuals exposed to patients admi nistered iodine-131, indicated that intakes were generally of the order of 1 millionth of the activity administered to the patient and that internal doseswere far below external doses. To account for the most highly exposed individual and to add adegree of conservatism to the calculations, a fractional transfer of 10 -5 has been assumed. Example 4, Internal Dose : Using the ingestion pathway, calculate the maximum internal dose to a person exposed to a patient to whom 1221 megabecquerels (33 millicuries) of iodine-131 has beenadministered. The ingestion pathway was selected because it is likely that most of the intake wouldbe through the mouth or through the skin, which is most closely approximated by the ingestionpathway.APPENDIX U U-25 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Solution : This is an example of the use of Equation B-6. The dose conversion factor DCF for the ingestion pathway is 53 rem/millicurie from Table 2.2 of Reference B-2. Substituting the appropriate values into Equation B-6, the maximum internal dose to the person is: Di = (33 mCi)(10-5)(53 rem/mCi) Di = 0.17 mSv (0.017 rem) Using Equation B-1 and assuming the patient has received instructions for reducing exposure as recommended for an occupancy factor of 0.25, the external dose is approximately 5 mSv (0.5 rem). Thus, the internal dose is about 3% of the external dose due to gamma rays. Internal doses may beignored in calculations of total dose if they are likely to be less than 10% of the external dose because the internal dose due to this source is small in comparison to the magnitude of uncertainty inthe external dose. The conclusion that internal contamination is relatively unimportant in the case of patient release was also reached by the NCRP. The NCRP addressed th e risk of intake of radionuclides from patients' secretions and excreta in NCRP Commentary N o. 11, \"Dose Limits for Individuals Who Receive Exposure from Radionuclide Therapy Patients\" (Ref. B-6). The NCRP concluded, \"Thus, a contamination incident that could lead to a significant intake of radioactive material is very unlikely.\" For additional discussion on the subject, see Reference B-1. Example 5, Internal Dose : Calculate the maximum internal dose to a person exposed to a patient to whom 5550 megabecquerels (150 millicuries) of iodine-131 has been administered for the treatmentof thyroid remnants and metastasis. Solution : In this example, we will again calculate the dose using Equation B-6 and selecting the ingestion pathway. Substituting the appropriate values into Equation B-6, the maximum internaldose to the person is: D i = (150 mCi)(10-5)(53 rem/mCi) Di = 0.80 mSv (0.08 rem) In this case, the external dose to the other person from Example 2, Thyroid Cancer, was approximately 3.4 millisieverts (0.34 rem), while the internal dose would be about 0.80 millisievert(0.08 rem). Thus, the internal dose is about 24% of the external gamma dose. Therefore, the internaland external doses must be summed to determine the total dose; 4.2 millisieverts (0.42 rem).

For example, mobile medicalservice providers offering remote afterloaders must comply with Subpart H of 10 CFR Part 35. Type and Location of Use In general, there are two types of mobile medical service. One type is transportation and use of byproduct material within a transport vehicle (e.g., in-van use). A second type is transportation ofbyproduct material to a client's facility for use w ithin a client's facility by the mobile medical service's employees (i.e., transport and use). For the first and second types, which include use by the service provider, the service provider should apply for full service authorization. Service provi ders who only transport and store a therapy device need only apply for authorization for possession and transport of the byproduct material. In this case,when the service provider is only transporting the therapy device for use, the client must possess alicense for medical use of the byproduct material. Additionally, in this case, the client is authorizedto provide the patient treatments and is responsible for all aspects of the byproduct material use andpatient treatments upon transfer of the byproduct material to their possession. For all types, licensed activities must be conducted in accordance with the regulations for compliance with 10 CFR 35.80(a), which states that the licensee will obtain a letter signed by the management ofeach of its clients for which services are rendered. The letter will permit the use of byproductmaterial at the client's address and will clearly delineate the authority and responsibility of eachentity. This agreement must be applicable for the entire period of time over which the service is tobe provided. The letter will be retained for 3 years after the last provision of service, as required by10 CFR 35.80(c) and 10 CFR 35.2080. Additionally, as required by 10 CFR 35.80(a)(4), thelicensee must survey to ensure compliance with the requirements in 10 CFR Part 20 (e.g., ensure thatall byproduct material, including radiopharmaceuticals, sealed sources, and all associated wasteshave been removed) before leaving a client's address. The location of use for mobile medical services are of two basic types. One type of location is the base location where licensed material is received, stored, and sometimes used. The other type oflocation is the temporary job site at client facilities. The following two sections describe the type ofinformation necessary for base locations and temporary job sites. Base Location The base location (e.g., central radiopharmaceutical laboratory or storage location for the remote afterloader) for the mobile medical service must be specified. The base facility may be located in amedical institution, non-institutional medical practice, commercial facility, or mobile van. Youshould specify in what type of facility the proposed base facility is located. A mobile licensee cannotprovide a service to a private practice (non-licensee) located within a licensed medical institution(e.g., hospital). As required by 10 CFR 30.33 and 10 CFR 35.12, you must submit a description anddiagram(s) of the proposed base facility and a ssociated equipment in accordance with Items 8.14 through 8.19 of this report. The description and diagram of the proposed facility should demonstrateAPPENDIX V NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 V-2that the building (or van) is of adequate construction and design to protect its contents from the elements (e.g., high winds, rain), ensures security of licensed material to prevent unauthorized access(e.g., control of keys), and ensures that radiation levels in unrestricted areas are in compliance with10 CFR 20.1301. Include a diagram showing the location of the licensed material, receipt, and useareas, and identify all areas adjacent to restricted areas, including areas above and below therestricted areas. For storage locations within a van, the description of the van should addressradiation levels in the van driver's compartment to demonstrate compliance with 10 CFR 20.1201,\"Occupational dose limits for adults.\" CYou may request multiple base locations. Radioactive material must be delivered only to afacility licensed to receive the type of radioactive material ordered. CBase locations can include the use of a mobile van. When the base facility is in the van, andthere is no permanent structure for the byproduct material storage, provide for the following: - Secured off-street parking under licensee control. Public rights-of-way are not considered part of the address of the client; - Secured storage facilities available for storage of byproduct material and radioactive waste if the van is disabled; and - Byproduct material delivered (if necessary) directly to the van only if the van is occupied by licensee personnel at the time of delivery. CIf a base facility is located in a residential area, provide the following information: - Justification of the need for a private residence location rather than for a commercial location. - Documentation of the agreement between the residence owner and the licensee. It is essential that the mobile medical service have access to the facility in the event ofcontamination. Provisions for decontamination of the mobile medical service van, etc., onthe client property (if necessary) will be included. Documentation from both parties willillustrate the agreement between the client and the mobile medical service. - A description of the program demonstrating compliance with 10 CFR 20.1301, \"Dose limits for individual members of the public.\" - Verification that restricted areas do not contain residential quarters. CPerform surveys necessary to show that exposure rates do not exceed 2 mrem in any one hour nor 100 mrem per year. Client Site This section applies only to therapeutic uses of byproduct material. For all types of therapy uses, the medical institutions, hospitals, or clinics and their addresses that comprise the client sites for mobilemedical services must be listed.APPENDIX V V-3 NUREG - 1556, 9, Rev. 1For self-contained byproduct material services (e.g., in-van) you should provide the following additional facility information: CFor therapy treatments with byproduct material (e.g., high dose-rate remote afterloader), aseparate drawing for each client site showing the location of the treatment device/vehicle inrelation to all nearby roads, sidewalks, structures, and any other locations accessible bymembers of the public; CA signed agreement, as delineated in the letter required by 10 CFR 35.80(a), that location of thedevice/vehicle will be on client-owned or controlled property; CThe protection from vehicular traffic that could a dversely affect patient treatment(s), that could be accomplished either by locating the facility away from all vehicular traffic or by usingbarriers. Any protective measures must be shown on the facility/site drawings provided. CA description of the emergency lighting system that automatically activates on detection of theloss of primary power during patient remote afterloader treatments. The system must providesufficient light to perform any possible emer gency procedures, including the removal of a detached or stuck source that remains within the patient. If you will provide transportable services to the client 's site for use within the client's facility by the mobile medical service's employees, you should provide the following client facility information andcommitment: CA detailed description and diagram(s) of the proposed use facility (e.g., client site) andassociated equipment in accordance with Items 8.14 through 8.19 of this report. Thedescription and diagram of the proposed use facility must demonstrate that the facility is ofadequate construction and design to protect its contents from the elements (e.g., high winds,rain), ensure security of licensed material to prevent unauthorized access, and ensure thatradiation levels in unrestricted areas are in compliance with 10 CFR 20.1301. You shouldinclude a diagram showing the location of the equipment, receipt, and use areas, and identify allareas adjacent to restricted areas. CA commitment, as delineated in the letter required by 10 CFR 35.80(a), that the mobile medicalservice licensee has full control of the treatment room during byproduct material use for eachclient. CThe initial installation records and function checks of a remote afterloader device for each site ofuse, as required by 10 CFR 35.633, 10 CFR 35.643, and 10 CFR 35.647. For a transport-only mobile medical service for therapy devices that are transported to the client's facility, used by the client's staff (under their own license), and removed by the service provider, youmust ensure the following: CEach client is properly licensed for medical use of byproduct material. If applicable, you shouldensure that each client has received the necessary initial and, if appropriate, recurrent trainingfor the specific make and model of the remote afterloader device being provided. If the aboveAPPENDIX V NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 V-4applicable conditions are not met, the mobile medical service licensee must not transfer the remote afterloader device to the client. CNo signed agreement with a client may state or imply any assumption of responsibility on thepart of the mobile medical service for the use of byproduct material for patient treatments. Thisincludes such activities as dosage measurements, source calibrations, and remote afterloaderdevice operational checks. Although these and other services may be provided to the client bythe mobile medical service if the mobile medical service is specifically licensed to provide suchservices, the client (licensee) retains all of the responsibilities related to the use of the byproductmaterial for patient treatments. The responsibilities for supervising individuals who use thebyproduct material, set forth in 10 CFR 35.27, transfer to the client's AUs upon transfer of thedevice to the client by the mobile medical service provider. CThe initial installation of a remote afterloader device at the client site may be performed byeither the mobile medical service provider or the client, but all device function checks are theresponsibility of the client (i.e., the licensee authorized to provide patient treatments at the clientsite). CAs required by 10 CFR 30.51, a formal record of the transfer of control of the byproductmaterial from the mobile medical service provider to the client, and from the client back to themobile medical service provider, must be made for each transfer of byproduct material. Asigned receipt of each transfer must be made and retained for inspection for 3 years. Supervision In addition to the requirements in 10 CFR 19.12, 10 CFR 35.27 requires that you will instruct supervised individuals in your written radiation pr otection procedures, written directive procedures, regulations, and license conditions with respect to the use of byproduct material. Additionally, asrequired by 10 CFR 35.27, you will require the supervised individual to: CFollow the instructions of the supervising authorized user for medical uses of byproductmaterial; CFollow the instructions of the supervising authorized nuclear pharmacists or supervisingauthorized user for preparation of byproduct material for medical uses; CFollow the written radiation protection procedures and written directive procedures establishedby the licensee; and CComply with the provisions of 10 CFR Part [e.g., 10 CFR 35.80 and 10 CFR 35.647 (ifapplicable)], and the license conditions with respect to the mobile medical use of byproduct material. Training for Individuals Working in or Frequenting Restricted Areas Drivers and technologists (or therapists) will be properly trained in applicable transportation regulations and emergency procedures in add ition to the training requirements of 10 CFR training V V-5 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1these individuals will include, at a minimum, DOT regulations, shielding, ALARA, and basic radiation protection. Survey Instrument and Dose Measurement Instrument Checks As required by 10 CFR 35.80, you will check instruments for proper operation before use at each address of use. You will check dosage measurement instruments before medical use at each addressof use or on each day of use, whichever is more frequent. Additionally, all other transportedequipment (e.g., cameras) should be checked for proper function before medical use at each addressof use. Order and Receipt of Byproduct Material Byproduct material will be delivered by a supplier to the base location or to the client's address if the client is licensed to receive the type of byproduct material ordered. Delivery of byproduct material toa van that is not occupied by the mobile medical service personnel will not be permitted. Alternatively, you may pick up the byproduct material (e.g., radiopharmaceuticals) from the supplier (e.g., nuclear pharmacy) en route to client facilities. Emergency Procedures Develop, implement, and maintain emergency procedures, in accordance with your radiation protection program required by 10 CFR 20.1101. You s hould indicate typical response times of the RSO and AU in the event of an incident and develop and implement procedures that includeemergency response regarding an accident scenario. An accident is defined as a vehicle collision or other event, such as, wind, water, or fire that results in damage to exterior or interior portions of thevehicle or the byproduct material used in the mobile medical service. The transportation emergencyresponse plan should cover both the actions to be taken by the mobile medical service provider'sheadquarters emergency response personnel and the \"on-scene\" hazardous material-trainedpersonnel, and it will be readily available to both transport vehicle personnel and headquartersemergency-response contacts. The plan should include the following: CA 24-hour emergency contact telephone number for the mobile medical service provider'semergency response personnel; CThe emergency contact numbers for NRC's Operation Center and all appropriate stateradiological protection agencies; CProcedures for restricting access to the transport vehicle until surveys have been made todetermine if any radiological hazards exist; CProcedures for retrieving and securing any byproduct material, including a sealed source thatmay become detached and/or dislodged to the extent that a radiological hazard is created, whichmay require one or more emergency shielded source containers;APPENDIX V NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 V-6CPredetermined (calculated) exposure rates for an unshielded therapy source (if applicable) as a function of distance for use in controlling the exposures of emergency response personnel to themaximum extent possible under various emergency response scenarios; CPreplanned decontamination procedures, including ready access to all necessary materials; CA calibrated, operational survey meter maintained in the cab of the transporting vehicle, whichmay be used at an accident scene for conducting surveys; CSecurity of the transport vehicle against unauthorized access, including the driver'scompartment; and CProcedures to ensure that following any accident, no patient treatments with remote afterloaderswill occur until all systems pertaining to radiation safety have been tested and confirmed to beoperational by the RSO or AMP. If any problem is found, including remote afterloader deviceinterlocks and operation, the remote afterloader device or facility will be repaired and re-certified by the device vendor prior to return to service. In addition, a copy of the report,generated in accordance with 10 CFR 30.50, will be provided to clients following any accidentin which there is actual or possible damage to the client's facility or the device. Note: The type of response should be consistent with the level of the incident. The response may range from phone contact for minor spills to prompt on-site response (less than 3 hours) to eventssuch as a medical event or lost radioactive material. Transportation Develop, document, and implement procedures to assure that the following takes place: CRadioactive material is transported in accordance with 49 CFR Parts 170-189. Procedures will include: - Use of approved packages; - Use of approved labeling;- Conduct of proper surveys;- Complete and accurate shipping papers;- Bracing of packages;- Security provisions; and- Written emergency instructions. CManagement (or management's designee) will perform audits, at least annually, oftransportation documentation (e.g., shipping papers and survey reports) and activities at clientfacilities. CLicensed material is secured during transport and use at the client's facilities. CRadioactive waste is handled properly during transport. You will describe the method ofstorage and final disposal.APPENDIX V V-7 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1CThe transport vehicle, including the driver's compartment, if separate, will be secured at all times from any unauthorized access when the vehicle is unattended. Note: The necessary DOT Type 7A package certification for remote afterloader devices is established by prior approval of the appropriate sealed source and device sheets; however, if theremote afterloader device is damaged in any way during use or transport, then the integrity of theDOT Type 7A packaging may be compromised, and the device must not be used or transported untilchecked by the vendor and certified as retaining its integrity as a Type 7A package. Radioactive Waste Management If waste will be stored in vans, the vans will be properly secured and posted as byproduct material storage locations. You will ensure that the van will be secured against unauthorized access and thatthe waste storage location will be posted as a byproduct material storage area. Develop, document, and implement final waste disposal procedures in accordance with Section 8.28 of this report. Excreta from individuals undergoing medical diagnosis or therapy with radioactive material may be disposed of without regard to radioactivity if it is discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, in accordance with 10 CFR 20.2003. However, collecting excreta from patients in a van restroom witha holding tank is not considered direct disposal into the sanitary sewerage system. If restroomfacilities are provided in the van for patient use, submit the following information for NRC review: CA description of the structure of the tank holding facility and the location of the tank in relationto members of the public, workers in the van, and the driver of the van; a description ofprocedures to assess the tank for possible leakage; and a description of any restroom ventilationif any I-131 will be held in the tank. CA description of procedures to ensure doses to occupational workers and members of the publicwill not exceed the exposure limits in 10 CFR 20.1201 and 20.1301, that the external surfaces ofthe van do not exceed 2 mrem/hour, and that doses to members of the public and workers aremaintained ALARA, including considerations of external dose rates in the restroom caused bythe proximity of the holding tank to the toilet. CA description of procedures for emptying and disposing of the contents of the holding tank, including the frequency of disposal, who empties the tank into the sanitary sewer system, andthe location of disposal into the sanitary sewer, including precautions taken to minimizecontamination in this process. Mobile Medical Services With Remote Afterloader Devices Because the movement of the remote afterloader device from one location to another increases the risk of electro-mechanical component failures or misalignments, it is important that the properoperation of the device be fully checked after eac h such relocation. Therefore, you will develop, document, and implement the following procedures to determine if a device is operating properlybefore the commencement of patient treatments:APPENDIX V NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 V-8CSafety checks conducted on a remote afterloader device and facility. The procedure will include the periodic spot checks required by 10 CFR 35.643 and the additional spot checks required by10 CFR 35.647 before use at each address of use. Additionally, the procedure should includeprovisions for prompt repair of any system not operating properly. CThe pretreatment operational function checks after each device move should include a review ofany device alarm or error message and, if necessary, a resolution of problems indicated by suchmessages. CSuch tests should be performed in accordance with written procedures. CYou must maintain records, as described in 10 CFR 35.2647 and 10 CFR 35.2643, showing theresults of the above safety checks for NRC inspection and review for a period of 3 years. CPerform surveys of the source housing and areas adjacent to the treatment room following relocation of a HDR unit. These surveys should include the source housing with the source inthe shielded position and all areas adjacent to the treatment room with the source in thetreatment position. APPENDIX W Model Procedure for Waste Disposal by Decay-In-Storage, Generator Return, and Licensed Material Return.APPENDIX W W-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Model Procedure for Waste Disposal by Decay-In-Storage, Generator Return, and Licensed Material Return This model provides acceptable procedures for waste disposal. Applicants may either adopt these model procedures or develop alterative procedures to meet the requirements of Subpart K to 10 CFRPart 20, 10 CFR 20.1101, and CFR 35.92. Model Procedure for CFR 35.92 describes the requirements for decay-in-st orage. Storage should be designed to allow for segregation of wastes with different half-liv es (e.g., multiple shielded containers). Containers should have shielded covers to maintain occupational exposure at ALARA levels. Storage areasmust be in a secure location. CIf possible, use separate containers for different types of waste, e.g., needles and syringes in one container, other injection paraphernalia such as swabs and gauze in another, and unused dosagesin a third container. Because the waste will be surveyed with all shielding removed, the containers in which the waste will be disposed of must not provide any radiation shielding forthe material. CWhen the container is full, seal it and attach an identification tag that includes the date sealedand the longest-lived radionuclide in the container. The container may then be transferred to thedecay-in-storage area. CPrior to disposal as in-house waste, monitor and record the results of monitoring of eachcontainer as follows: - Use a survey instrument that is appropriate for the type and energy of the radiation being measured; - Check the radiation detection survey meter for proper operation and current calibration status; - Monitor in a low-level radiation (<0.05 millirem per hour) area away from all sources of radioactive material, if possible; - Remove any shielding from around the container or generator column;- Monitor, at contact, all surfaces of each individual container;- Remove or deface any radioactive material labels (unless the containers will be managed as biomedical waste after they have been released from the licensee as described in10 CFR 35.92); - Discard as in-house waste only those containers that cannot be distinguished from background radiation. Containers may include trash bags full of waste, generator columns,and biohazard (needle) boxes. Record the disposal date, the survey instrument used, theAPPENDIX W NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev 1 W-2background dose rate, the dose rate measured at the surface of each waste container, and the name of the individual who performed the disposal; - Containers that can be distinguished from background radiation levels must be returned to the storage area for further decay or transferred to an authorized byproduct materialrecipient. Model Procedure for Returning Generators to the Manufacturer Used Mo/Tc-99m generators may be returned to the manufacturer. This permission does not relieve licensees from the requirement to comply with 10 CFR Part 71 and DOT regulations. Perform thefollowing actions when returning generators: CRetain the records needed to demonstrate that the package qualifies as a DOT Specification 7Acontainer; CAssemble the package in accordance w ith the manufacturer's instructions; CPerform the dose rate and removable contamination measurements; CLabel the package and complete the shipping papers in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; CRetain records of receipts and transfers in accordance with 10 CFR 30.51. Model Procedure for Return of Licensed Material to Authorized Recipients Perform the following steps when returning licensed material to authorized recipients: CIn accordance with 10 CFR 30.41(a)(5), confirm that persons are authorized to receive byproduct material prior to transfer (e.g., obtain a copy of the transferee's NRC license orAgreement State license that authorizes the byproduct material); CRetain the records needed to demonstrate that the package qualifies as a DOT Specification 7Acontainer; CAssemble the package in accordance w ith the manufacturer's instructions; CPerform the dose rate and removable contamination measurements; CLabel the package and complete the shipping papers in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; CRetain records of receipts and transfers in accordance with 10 CFR 30.51.APPENDICES X-BB RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS DOT RULES FOR SHIPPING REFERENCES PUBLIC COMMENTS ON DRAFTS AND NRC RESPONSES.APPENDIX X Recordkeeping Requirements.APPENDIX X X-1 NUREG - 1556, Vol. 9, Rev. 1Recordkeeping Requirements Table X.1 Typical Records and Retention Times RecordSurvey RequirementRecordkeeping RequirementRetention Period Results of surveys and calibrations20.1501;
