Having a weak immune system puts you at higher risk of serious illness if you get COVID-19. Getting vaccinated will give you some protection against this. Booster doses needed People with a weak immune system aged 5 and older should follow the recommended vaccination below: - 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, 4 weeks apart, as your first round of COVID-19 vaccination - an additional dose 8 weeks after this - a first booster 4 months after this - 2 seasonal boosters per year, in spring and autumn - wait 6 months since your previous dose or COVID-19 infection How to get your vaccine Vaccines will be given in hospital if you're an inpatient. You can also: - go to a [participating pharmacy](https://www2.hse.ie/services/pharmacies-covid-19/) - go to your GP if they are offering COVID-19 vaccination Additional dose COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective for you than other people. If you had a weak immune system at the time of your first round of COVID-19 vaccination, you should have had an additional dose to give you better protection. Talk to your hospital team or GP if you have not had your additional dose yet and you need one because of a weak immune system. When you should get an additional dose You should get an additional dose 8 weeks after your second dose. But you can get it 4 weeks after your second dose if you need to be protected urgently. If you had COVID-19 after your second dose If your COVID-19 infection was more than 7 days after the second vaccine dose, you do not need to get an additional dose. You should get your first booster dose 4 months after your COVID-19 infection. If you get a COVID-19 infection within 7 days of your second dose, you should get an additional dose 4 to 8 weeks after your COVID-19 infection.
