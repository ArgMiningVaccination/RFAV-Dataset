I'm a 20-something male living in Canada. My mom is a doula (like a midwife) and my dad is a farm-raised Austrian immigrant. I got vaccinated for measles, mumps, pertussis and diphtheria when I was really young but refused all the other vaccines offered through my youth, at my parents' behest (haven't been vaccinated since). We kept a stock of herbal and aromatherapy heath products for various ailments: Peppermint oil for headaches, skullcap and velarian as a sedative, echinacea for colds, St. John's wort for my dad's depression, etc. Beside all that and never having cable TV, I had a \"normal\" childhood.
