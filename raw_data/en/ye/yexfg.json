Mission Statement The mission of the California State Parks is to provide for the health, inspiration, and education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most valued natural and cultural resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation. Like To Hike? The inland portion of Crystal Cove State Park is a hidden gem of the Orange County region, from the wooded Moro Canyon, up to the spectacular coastal views of Moro Ridge. It is a perfect way for visitors to feel they are \"away from it all,\" despite being near one of the greatest population centers in the United States. Our backcountry consists of 2,400 undeveloped acres of land, and over 15 total miles of trails. Trails are open to hiking, biking, and equestrian use, with a variety of difficulties from quick and easy to long and strenuous. Our coastal portion also features a 2.5 mile paved trail that runs along the bluff tops, perfect for easy walks and bike riding. This is also the only trail in our park in which leashed dogs are allowed. - Docent and staff-led activities are scheduled throughout the year in our park, such as full-moon hikes and bird walks. Dates for these events can be found on our calendar. - A diversity of wildlife can be found at our park, including coyotes, bobcats, wood rats, gopher snakes, rattlesnakes, and numerous species of birds. - Parking for Back Country Hiking Trails at Ranger Station or Lower Moro Day Use Lot.
