What the medical and scientific communities are discovering now is that exercise has benefits for near - ly every body system and is increasing - ly being touted as a way to prevent the occurrence of a wide variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. I am thrilled that our talented researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center are leading the way in investigating how physical activi - ty can help prevent disease. You can read more in our excellent cover story. In this issue of Kansas Medicine + Sci - ence, we also profile KU School of Med - icine alumnus Michael Machen, who has been practicing family medicine for more than 30 years in tiny Quinter, Kan - sas. Training health care professionals for rural and underserved areas is a point of pride at KU Medical Center. Mike was named the 2018 Kansas Family Physi - cian of the Year by the Kansas Academy of Family Physicians, and we couldn't be more proud of the work he is doing to provide much-needed health care in western Kansas. We also take a look at the work being done to head off an opioid crisis in Kan - sas and the efforts being made to increase the HPV vaccination rate in our state to help reduce the incidence of some head and neck cancers. We hope you enjoy this issue of Kansas Medicine + Science, and as always, we appreciate any feedback. Just drop us an email at kmands@kumc.edu. We look for - ward to hearing from you. Robert D.

The Nov. 1 meeting was hosted by the University of Kansas Medical Center. The meeting provided a rare opportunity for sci - entists to hear directly from those charged with funding the work in their field. During the one-day event organized with its Office of Special Populations, NIA senior staff and extramural division di - rectors shared information on NIA research and training resources, technical assistance on grant writing and advice on the design of new research proposals. Robert J. Hodes., M.D., director of the NIA, told the attendees that for fiscal year 2019, the NIH had increased the NIA's budget for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research by $425 million. He said the increase is a reflection of the magnitude of this public health emergency. ROY JENSEN NAMED PRESIDENT OF ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN CANCER INSTITUTES Roy Jensen, M.D., director of The University of Kansas Cancer Center, has been named president of the Association of American Cancer Institutes (AACI), an organization of 98 leading academic cancer centers in North America, which includes the 70 Nation - al Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated centers. As president Jensen plans to spearhead the development of a comprehensive clearing - house of cancer-specific model legislation for AACI cancer centers to share with their state legislators. Jensen has been the director of The University of Kansas Cancer Center since 2004. He also is the William R. Jewell, M.D. Distinguished Kansas Masonic Professor, the director of the Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute, pro - fessor of pathology and laboratory medicine, and professor of anat - omy and cell biology at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Under his leadership, KU Cancer Center first earned designation as a National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer center in 2012 and had its designation renewed in 2017.FOUR KU DOCTORAL-LEVEL NURSING STUDENTS NAMED JONAS SCHOLARS Four University of Kansas School of Nursing doctoral students were named Jonas Scholars for 2018 by Jonas Philanthropies, a leading national philanthropic funder of graduate nursing educa - tion. The award provides the scholars with financial assistance, net - working and leadership development, thus helping to expand the pipeline of future nursing faculty, researchers and advanced prac - tice nurses. The four KU nursing students named Jonas Scholars were Megan Campbell, Amenda Fisher, Marcy Holford and Amanda Huerta. The four nurse leaders are part of the new 2018- 2020 cohort of more than 200 Jonas Scholars pursuing doctoral de - grees at 92 universities across the country and focusing on such criti - cal priorities as chronic health, environmental health and preventive health. They join more than 1,000 Jonas Scholar alumni representing 157 universities across all 50 states. Since 2012, 11 students from the KU School of Nursing have been named Jonas Scholars. HEATHER GIBBS RECEIVES 2018 STATA NORTON DISTINGUISHED TEACHING AWARD Heather Gibbs, Ph.D., RD, was named the winner of the 2018 Stata Norton Distinguished Teaching Award. Gibbs, an assistant professor in the Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, was honored during the School of Health Professions' Student Recognition Ceremony in May. The recipient of the award, which has been given out for the last 32 years, is selected through a vote of faculty and students in the School of Health Professions. The award recognizes excellence in teaching as well as outstanding contributions by the recipient in his or her field. Gibbs has been a practicing registered dietitian since 2000. She earned a master's degree in dietetics and nutrition in 2003 from KU and earned her doctorate in food science and human nu - trition in 2012 from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. The annual award honors Norton, who was dean of the School of Allied Health (now Health Professions) from 1980 to 1984 and was professor emeritus of pharmacology, toxicology and therapeutics in the KU School of Medicine.PULSE 5 Spring/Summer 2019TWO KU MEDICAL CENTER EDUCATORS HONORED WITH CHANCELLORS CLUB PROFESSORSHIPS Two professors from the University of Kansas Medical Center, both well-known as scientists, researchers and educators, now share an ad - ditional distinction of being recognized as Chancellors Club Teaching Professors for 2018. The honorees are V. Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D., and Joseph Fontes, Ph.D. Each will receive an annual $10,000 hon - orarium for each of the next five years. Blanco has been a faculty member in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Phys - iology since 2001, where he currently serves as professor and the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair. During his tenure at KU Medical Center, Blanco has repeatedly been recognized for his teaching accomplish - ments. He won the Student Voice Award for Excellence in Teaching after only one year at KU. He has since won the Student Voice award every year from 2003 to 2018, and in 2006, he received what is described as the \"triple crown of teaching\" at KU Medical Center: the William T. Kemper Fellowship, the Ruth Bohan Teaching Award and the Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching Award. Joseph Fontes joined the KU Medical Center faculty in 2007. During his tenure, Fontes has consistently demonstrated a commitment to teaching and service. He presently serves as the block director for Molecular and Cellular Medicine, the second course taken by first-year medi - cal students. In addition, he is the director of Foundational Sciences, helping to ensure the integration and delivery of basic scientific con - tent in the Phase I curriculum. KU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE RANKS AMONG THE NATION'S LEADERS IN EDUCATING PRIMARY CARE, RURAL CARE AND FAMILY PHYSICIANS While there is no perfect metric to judge how well a medical school is in meeting the needs of its constituency, the University of Kansas School of Medicine, which includes campuses in Kansas City, Salina and Wichita, fares among the nation's finest in the areas of primary care (95th percentile); producing doctors who are working in rural settings 10 to 15 years after graduation (96th percentile); and family medicine physicians (98th percentile) as determined by the Amer - ican Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Producing primary care doctors has become a hallmark of KU's three medical school campuses. On average during the past 10 years, roughly 46 percent of the graduates have matched in primary care residencies. Each year, the AAMC uses its Missions Management Tool to provide an evaluation of each of its member medical schools so they can assess how schools are meeting the institution's specific goals based on the history, location, faculty and governing body, among other factors. Because of the varying nature and missions of its members, the AAMC forgoes a single overall ranking and looks at 48 data mea - sures in six mission categories.KU MEDICAL CENTER PROGRAM HELPS TEACHERS ENGAGE STUDENTS FROM URBAN SCHOOLS After a 2004 report showed only 9 percent of nurses and 6 percent of doctors are from racially and ethnically diverse populations, ed - ucators from the University of Kansas Medical Center developed a program to reach underserved populations. The program is known as Teachers and Students for Community Oriented Research and Education, or T-SCORE. For years, the KU Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Juntos and the KU Area Health Education Center had success sponsoring programs that attracted students from diverse backgrounds to learn about health science, but those opportunities were limited. So representatives of the three groups collaborated to organize T-SCORE. The program, which is funded through a five- year Science Education Partnership Award grant from the Nation - al Institutes of Health, launched three summers ago with its first Summer Institute. Five teachers from three of the five high schools in the Kansas City, Kansas Public School district made up the first class, and in 2018 the program included three teachers each from F.L. Schlagle and Washington, and one each from Wyandotte and J.C. Harmon. Four teachers from Wichita were also part of the program. T-SCORE helps classroom teachers develop health science projects that are relevant to their students' everyday lives. As a result, stu - dents become a part of the educational process, coming up with questions about real-world problems that affect their communities. Teachers challenge them to shape hands-on experiments and field studies that promote critical thinking about health care disparities in areas where they live and go to school. BURNS NAMED TO GOVERNOR'S ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WORKING GROUP Jeffrey Burns, M.D., co-director of the University of Kansas Alz - heimer's Disease Center (KU ADC), in 2018 was named by Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer to the Alzheimer's Disease Plan Working Group. This group will create a plan to prepare for a rising num - ber of Kansans with Alzheimer's disease, a debilitating form of dementia that affects 5.4 million Americans and for which there is currently no known cure. Burns oversees numerous clinical trials at the KU ADC, which is one of only 31 nationally designated Alz - heimer's disease centers by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, and according to the Alzheimer's Association, the disease and other dementias will cost the nation $277 billion this year. Many of the trials at the KU ADC focus on prevention, and the participation of healthy older adults with no signs of dementia is critical to their success. The KU ADC research is showing that lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise may offer the most hope.KU MEDICAL CENTER RESEARCHERS BATTLING HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA While great advances have been made in treatments for HIV and AIDS, the stark reality remains that the virus is still among the lead - ing killers in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya alone, roughly 6,000 ba - bies each year become infected with the virus. Sarah Finocchario Kessler, Ph.D., MPH, an associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center, has spent nearly a decade traveling to Kenya looking for ways to slow the trend by reducing the number of infants infect - ed with HIV during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. Although the mother-to-child infection rates have been dropping steadily during this time, the findings in Kessler's recently complet - ed R01 grant may be a game-changer for HIV-positive mothers and their children living in countries with limited resources. By using a web-based tracking system created by a nonprofit organi- zation to monitor time-sensitive medical interventions, researchers were able to show a marked improvement in the delivery of HIV ser - vices to their study participants, thus raising the chances of survival. These results open the door for this tracking system to improve HIV care throughout Africa and beyond. Gaps in daily communications have proven to be a major challenge in providing ongoing health care in underserved countries such as Kenya, so Kessler's team looked to find ways technology could solve the problem. This approach could prevent people from falling through the cracks in the system and ultimately save lives. The team's solution for improving accountability of service delivery and consistency in communication between patients, health care providers and testing labs turned out to be the HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem) - a web-based program created by Brad Gautney, Kessler's former graduate school classmate at Johns Hopkins. To test the system, Kessler's team conducted a study at six hospi - tals in Kenya. The program automatically prioritizes infants testing HIV-positive, so treatments are started immediately, maximizing the chances of survival. Normally, alerts on the program's dash - board allow health care providers to quickly identify infants who are overdue for time-sensitive testing or follow-up services. The alerts automatically trigger text messages and additional outreach as needed, ensuring connections are made. These communications help keep infants in the system until they are 18 months old an age when they typically can be declared HIV-free. In the study, the HITSystem group showed significant improve - ment in the proportion of infants completing the early infant diag - nosis (EID) cascade (an array of HIV tests and possible treatments) through 18 months (85 vs. 61 percent). In addition, the study found that 100 percent of the HIV-positive infants in the HITSystem group were started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to 72 percent in the control group. The system is currently in use in more than 40 hospitals in Kenya and nearly 250 facilities in Africa, including Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria.STUDENTS VOLUNTEER NEARLY 1,300 HOURS ON COMMUNITY SERVICE DAYS Just days before the start of the 2018-19 academic year, students from the three schools at the University of Kansas Medical Center gave their time and energy as part of Community Service Days a medical center tradition. Two days each summer are designated by KU Medical Center for students in the schools of Health Professions, Medicine and Nursing to give a few hours of energy and elbow grease to the communities where they will be living, learning and working during the next few years. On July 25, just two days before their White Coat Ceremony mark - ing their official entry into medical school, 176 first-year medical students volunteered for 704 hours at 10 agencies across Wyandotte County a financial equivalent of more than $17,000. Their jobs ranged from pulling weeds and harvesting vegetables to painting houses, packing toiletries and cleaning up clutter to getting rid of unwanted items coated with dust from years of neglect. Just weeks later, 143 students from the schools of Health Professions and Nurs - ing fanned out across Wyandotte County for their day of service. Volunteers tallied a total of 572 volunteer hours, working for 10 agen - cies across the Kansas City, Kansas area. This is the financial equiv - alent of more than $14,000 donated to the community. All told, 319 KU Medical Center students volunteered nearly 1,300 hours during the two community service days, or roughly $31,500 worth of labor donated to agencies in Wyandotte County. KU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HONORS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO EARN A MEDICAL DEGREE FROM KU In 1958, the late Marjorie Cates became the first black woman to graduate from the University of Kansas School of Medicine. Some 60 years later she was honored by the university with an academic society dedicated in her name. The Cates Society was officially un - veiled during a ceremony in August 2018. The new society replaces the Wahl Society, which was retired by the university. In 1954, the year the landmark Brown v. the Topeka Board of Education decision was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court, Cates became only the second black woman to be admitted to the KU School of Medicine (the first student had been allowed to complete her first two years of medical school on the Lawrence campus, and then as was the custom at KU at the time for black students in the KU School of Medicine she transferred elsewhere to complete her degree.) After earning her M.D. degree from KU, Cates went on to have a dis - tinguished career in both public and private practice. She is remem - bered as much for her abilities as a physician as her compassion for her patients. She taught hematology at Howard University, where she also served as associate director of its Sickle Cell Center. She later became director of health services for the United States Depart - ment of the Interior. In 1974, Cates became the chief medical officer at the D.C. Health Department North Area Health Center and a year later published \"Sickle cell disease, a bibliography.\" She also spent time doing interviews to promote awareness nationwide about the dangers of sickle cell disease. 6Kansas Medicine+Science 7 Spring/Summer 2019A COMINGTSUNAMIHPV-RELATED HEAD AND NECK CANCER IS BOTH FRIGHTENING AND PREVENTABLE. BY KAY HAWES ILLUSTRATION BY DANTE TERZIGNI It's called a thermoplastic immobilization device, and it is both a savior and a curse for those enduring radiation treatments for head and neck cancer. It comes after the surgeon removes as much of the tumor as possible from your tongue, your tonsil or your throat. Technicians heat a special plastic to 162 degrees and mold it to your head, over your face and down your neck. The device will hold you completely still as you lie inside the linear accelerator for radiation treatments that may be up to twice a day for seven weeks. It is crucial to protecting the critical functions - speaking, swallowing, breathing - that survived your surgery. It's also claustrophobic, anxiety-producing - and for many, it is completely avoidable. For some time, there has been a vaccine to prevent vi - ral infections that become cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of those viruses, and it is quickly replacing tobacco as a primary concern of oncologists who treat head and neck cancers. HPV is the source of nearly 43,000 new cancer cases in the United States each year, with more than 18,000 of those cases head and neck cancers. \"Many have referred to this as an epidemic,\" said Andres Bur, M.D., assistant professor of head and neck surgery and microvascular reconstruction at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. \"HPV-associated oro -pharyngeal cancers recently surpassed cervical cancer as the most common virally- induced cancer.\" Bur notes that these cancers are three times more common in men, and they affect pa - tients who are typically younger than those with tobacco-related head and neck cancers. Seventy percent of oropharyngeal (head and neck) cancers in the United States are caused by HPV. And while many women are familiar with the pap smear, which is an effective screening tool for cervical cancer, there isn't yet an effective screening tool for head and neck cancer. Terance Tsue, M.D., physician-in-chief at the KU Cancer Center and professor of head and neck surgical oncology at the KU School of Medicine, has described the prevalence of HPV-related head and neck cancer as a \"coming tsunami,\" noting that its recent prevalence among men means many patients are surprised when that lump on their neck is cancer. \"My waiting room is now filled with men from ages 20 to 55 - attorneys, politicians and engineers who are really surprised to end up with stage 4 cancer from a prevent - able virus,\" Tsue said. Treatment for head and neck cancers can be particularly complex as so many critical elements to life - and quality of life - are in the head and neck. \"Morbidity from treatment of these cancers is significant,\" Bur said. \"Standard treatment is both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which has common long-term side effects of dry mouth, loss of taste and difficulty swal - lowing, which can become so severe that pa - tients need a feeding tube.\" Tina Hillhouse was one of those patients who had severe complications, including is - sues with swallowing and a bone infection in her jaw. Hillhouse was first diagnosed with tonsillitis, but when doctors found can - cer, she came to The University of Kansas Cancer Center. She had multiple surgeries to remove cancer in her tonsils and polyps in her throat and nostrils. She then had radiation therapy, followed by hyperbaric oxygen treatment and consultations with a nutritionist to manage mouth sensitivi - ties and difficulty eating. Most importantly though, she has had no cancer recurring now for five years. Not wanting others to travel the difficult road she has, Hillhouse has become an advocate for the HPV vaccine. \"When there is an immunization that will prevent cancer, I think it's only sensible to take it,\" Hillhouse said. \"Young people should get it so they don't end up with can - cer like me.\" 9 Spring/Summer 2019Hillhouse, who is a medical aesthetician, also thinks there needs to be more education about HPV. As a skin care expert, Hillhouse performs a variety of treatments on skin, including laser ablations. She attributes her HPV to her work on others' skin. \"A lot of people believe it's only spread through sexual contact. But I can tell you that it's transmitted in other ways, too.\" she said. STIGMA AND FEAR As the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, HPV most often is associated with sexual activity but other types of skin-to-skin contact can trans - mit it, as can French kissing. For Hillhouse, working on people's skin seemed to in - crease her risk of acquiring HPV. There are at least 200 different types of HPV known, with at least 13 types that produce cancer. Hillhouse was ultimately diagnosed with 14 different types of HPV in her system, four of which are linked to cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports approximately 79 million people in the United States are infected with HPV and 14 million new in - fections occur each year. In addition to the recent uptick in head and neck cancers, HPV also causes cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagi - na, penis and anus. \"HPV is really common, and most people don't even realize they are infected,\" said Roy Jensen, M.D., director of the KU Cancer Center. \"It can take years for cancer to devel- op from an HPV virus, and there is no way to know which HIV-infected people will devel - op cancer. It's a public health crisis now that's only going to get bigger in the coming years.\" However, that crisis has not translated into more people receiving Gardasil 9, the HPV vaccine. According to a 2016 CDC report, only 41.9 percent of girls and 28.1 percent of boys in the United States had completed the recommended vaccine series. While vaccina - tion rates have improved over the past few years, they remain far short of the goal of 80 percent by the end of this decade, set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Healthy People 2020 objective.\"In our region, we don't have a good up - take of the vaccine,\" said Kevin Ault, M.D., professor and division director of gen - eral obstetrics and gynecology at the Uni-versity of Kansas Medical Center and clinician with the KU Cancer Center. \"In Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri, we have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.\" The vaccine that has been in use since 2006 was designed for people ages 9 to 26, most recently with two doses for those under 15 and three doses for those over 15. Most pe - diatricians recommend age 11 or 12 as the optimal time, in part because that's before most people would be exposed to HPV. That has led some parents to decline the vaccine because they have a perception that giving their children the vaccine would somehow lead them to be more sexually active. \"One problem is people think the HPV vac - cine is about sex because sex is a common method of transmission, but it's far from the only method,\" Jensen said. \"The HPV vaccine is not about sex it's about prevent - ing cancer. Studies clearly show the vaccine does not make kids more likely to have sex or to have sex at a younger age.\" Andres Bur, M.D., Roy Jensen, M.D., and Kevin Ault, M.D. Ault notes that pediatricians may not be ad - vocating for the vaccine strongly enough. \"One of the hard things about this for pedi - atricians is they don't generally deal with HPV-related cancers,\" Ault said. \"It's some - thing you get infected with in your late teens and early 20s, but you don't get cancer until you're 30, 40 or 50. We don't have a lot of vaccines that work like that, and so that makes it a hard thing to think about with this particular vaccine.\" Another challenge is that Gardasil has had its skeptics when it comes to safety. Critics were quick to point out that Merck (the maker of Gardasil, the only HPV vaccine available in the United States) was accused of overly aggressive and at times heavy-handed marketing and lobbying campaigns after the drug received fast- track FDA approval in 2006. There have been Internet reports and even entire web - sites devoted to stories of autoimmune disorders striking teenagers who had received the vaccine, leading some parents to avoid vaccinating their children out of fear that it could lead to a different debil - itating health issue. Ault thinks the issue here may be one of timing.\"I think one of the potential problems is that if you look at some of the autoimmune and neurological diseases, they are fairly com- mon in (all) adolescents,\" Ault said. \"Just by coincidence some adolescents will devel - op a problem around the time they get an HPV vaccination.\" The CDC says there is no evidence to sug - gest a causal link between Gardasil and any reported deaths. And of the 29 million doses of Gardasil 9 given out in the United States between 2014 and 2017, there are only four confirmed reports of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The CDC reports the most common side effects are swelling where the shot was given, fever, headache, tired feeling, muscle and joint pain, and on rare occasions, fainting. At the end of 2017, a study that should be reassuring to parents was published in The Lancet, among the world's oldest and most prestigious peer-reviewed journals. Ault was an investigator on the multi-year study that examined more than 14,000 women, ages 16 to 26, at 105 study sites in 18 countries who used Gardasil 9. Ault notes that the study found the vaccine was both safe and effective against several different strains of HPV. \"We have more than a decade of experience with this vaccine, and there are studies that have literally a million people in them that show the vaccine has a good safety profile,\" Ault said. JOINING FORCES WITH NEW WEAPONS As a National Cancer Institute (NCI)- designated cancer center, the KU Cancer Center has as its charge to prevent and eliminate cancer in its region, which includes Kansas and Eastern Missouri. Jensen's team has advocated for the vac - cine across the state, including conversa - tions with pediatricians and family medi - cine providers. It has been an uphill battle, but new developments with the vaccine might help. In October, the Food and Drug Admin- istration expanded the use of Gardasil 9 to adults up to age 45.\"The FDA expansion is great news,\" Jensen said. \"Since many adults have not been vac - cinated, this may encourage more people to get vaccinated, though we still encourage parents to get the vaccine for their children. Studies have shown that the best time to get the vaccine is before being exposed to HPV.\" Hope Krebill, MSW, BSN, RN, executive di - rector of the Midwest Cancer Alliance, the outreach arm of the KU Cancer Center, em - phasizes that it's important for pediatricians and family medicine practitioners to con- tinue to recommend the vaccine, just as they would any other vaccine. \"Often providers underestimate the power a strong provider recommendation holds for parents and patients,\" she said, noting that the change to the dosing schedule and the age expansion might ultimately increase the number of people who get the vaccine. We have more than a decade of experience with this vaccine, and there are studies that have literally a million people in them that show the vaccine has a good safety prole. This summer, the KU Cancer Center part - nered with the other 69 NCI-designated can - cer centers across the country to issue a Call to Action urging for increased vaccination and screening for HPV-related cancers. The message specifically targeted health care pro - viders in the nation, including pediatricians and family care doctors. The call to action was followed later in the summer by a na - tional conference that included HPV experts from the nation's top cancer centers, along with partners from the American Cancer Society, the CDC and the NCI. \"It's critical that we continue to advocate for the vaccine,\" Jensen said. \"HPV-related cancer rates aren't going to decrease unless many more people get vaccinated.\" It also means you could avoid a date in the linear accelerator with that thermoplastic immobilization device. Kevin Ault, M.D. 10 Kansas Medicine+Science 11 Spring/Summer 2019KU School of Medicine alumnus Michael Machen has been practicing family medicine for more than 30 years in Quinter, Kansas.BY KRISTI BIRCH PHOTOS BY ELISSA MONROE JUST AN AVERAGE GUY LIVESSAVING On a late September morning at Bluestem Medical in Quinter, Kansas, Michael Machen, M.D., stood at the end of an exam table and pressed his stethoscope against the back of Tom Zelfer, a ruddy-faced truck driver with a silver horseshoe mustache. Zelfer had just made it back home from a haul to Nebraska a few hours before his appointment. \"You sound good,\" said Machen. little.\" Machen then turned his attention to Zelfer's thigh, looking for swelling around where Zelfer had surgery to repair a quadricep that was severed when a calf he was unloading kicked him. \"So when's the wedding?\" asked Machen, referring to Zelfer's granddaughter, Andrea. \"Next weekend, the twenty-eighth.\"\"Party, party, party... they still live in Colby, don't they?\"the epitome of flyover country: vast fields of corn, wheat, soybeans, hay and milo interrupted only by the occasional water tower. Even for newly minted physicians who appreciate the stark beauty of am - ber fields bowing to an indigo sky, urban areas can offer more money and resources well as jobs for spouses and partners. For many doc - tors, practicing medicine this far from a major city 180 miles away, Wichita is the closest seems like too much to give up. But not for Mike Machen. Last year, when the Kansas Academy of Family Physicians named him the 2018 Kansas Family Physician of the Year, it was recognizing Machen's more than three decades of treating people in Gove County and the surrounding area. Machen doesn't talk about his 33 years in northwest Kansas in terms of what he's had to sacrifice and compromise. On the contrary. A wiry guy with a quick smile in his sixties, this is a man who seems to be doing exactly what he wants to do, in the place he wants to be. \"I love the rural attitude when it comes to neighbors helping neigh - bors. I know people who would literally give the shirt off their back to a stranger if it's the right thing to do, and it happens all the time out here,\" he said. \"It really is a joy to take care of people like this.\" It also helps to be an outdoorsman at heart. Machen loves camping, goose hunting and fishing in the local lakes. He drives to work in a Ford F-150 pick-up. He hates sitting in traffic on Interstate 35 when Mike Machen, M.D., and Doug Gruenbacher, M.D. It's easy for Machen to shift between clini - cal questions and neighborly chit-chat in a place like Quinter, a farm town of 960 souls in Gove County about 100 miles from the Colorado border. Not only did he know Zelfer's granddaughter, he also remem- bers delivering her. Just like he remembers Bub Corwin, the long-gone father of his next patient, Richard, the head custodian at Quinter High School who brings him a sack of fresh asparagus every spring from his family's century-old asparagus patch. Just like he knows and treats the grandchil - dren of the first patient he saw that morning, Betsy Johnson, the widow who punctured her leg on a stick when she was weeding her chicken yard. What is not easy is attracting physicians, even native Kansans such as Machen, to re - mote rural areas like Gove County. Truman Capote wrote that western Kansas was a place \"that other Kansans call 'out there.'\" To many people on the coasts, this pancake of land between Kansas City and Denver is Mike Machen, M.D., and Betsy JohnsonSo did Victor Nemechek, another KU School of Medicine graduate. As recipients of the Kansas Medical Scholarship, Machen and Nemechek were required after graduation to practice medicine for four years in a med - ically underserved part of the state. They decided to interview for jobs together, as a package deal, reasoning that if they were hired at the same place, they would at least have each other to alternate week - ends of being on-call. When they were interviewing in Osborne, Nemechek's mother telephoned to tell them that some - one from Quinter had called to see if they wanted to interview there. They had time to drive to Quinter, where they talked to Herman Hiesterman, M.D., and saw the hospital and its new addition. After they got back to Tulsa, Hiesterman's partner, Carl Gunter, M.D., drove down to Okla- homa and took them out to dinner. After discussing it, in July 1986, Machen and Nemechek decided to make the commit - ment and give four years in Quinter a try. he comes to Kansas City, preferring the convenience of Quinter. He lives six blocks from the grocery store, seven blocks from the bank and two blocks from the clinic and the hospital to which it is at - tached, Gove County Medical Center. \"I can be out of bed and in the ER in two minutes,\" he observed. \"I've delivered babies in flip-flops and shorts.\" A PACKAGE DEAL Attending high school in Concordia, Machen knew he liked science, especially biology. After taking classes for a year at Cloud County Community College, he transferred to the University of Kansas. He credits sacking groceries part-time at Rusty's IGA supermarket in Lawrence with introducing him to another KU student his wife, Susan. (\"She was higher-up, a checker.\") When he failed the Civil Service exam to become a fish biologist, he turned his ambitions to - ward medical school. During his last year at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Kansas City, Machen was torn between which specialty to pur - sue orthopedics or obstetrics. He finally settled on family medicine, figuring it would let him practice some of each specialty. In 1986, he completed a residency in family medicine at the University of Oklahoma, Tulsa Medical College. 15 Spring/Summer 2019BIG SHOES TO FILL Hiesterman and Gunter, also graduates of the KU School of Medicine, would prove in - valuable role models and teachers. \"When we first got there, they were at the end of their careers, and I figured they were out of touch,\" said Machen. \"I could not have been more wrong. They were up on the latest technology and drugs, and they had the knowledge of 30 years in the trenches.\" With few specialists nearby to whom to refer patients, Gunter and Hiesterman had learned to perform a number of procedures that many primary care doctors often don't even consider today: appendectomies, ton - sillectomies, hysterectomies, colon resec - tions. When a little girl fell on a slide and broke her nose and Nemechek thought she needed to see an ENT but the family had no insurance, Hiesterman pulled him aside, said, \"We can fix this,\" and then showed him how to straighten it. When a man came in with a dislocated shoulder, Hiesterman took off his shoe, planted his foot in the man's armpit and maneuvered the arm until it relocated like nothing they had ever seen in a textbook. \"We learned so much from those guys,\" Machen said. That included learning their work ethic. After they'd been in Quinter about a year, Machen and Nemechek were commiserat - ing about having been up late every night that week, delivering babies and so forth, when Gunter asked, \"How much sleep are you boys getting anyway?\" When Machen said they were averaging four to five hours a night, Gunter responded, \"If Herm and I had gotten that much when we first started, we'd have had bedsores.\" In 1989, three years after Machen and Nemechek arrived in Quinter, Hiesterman and Gunter decided it was time to pass the torch. They sold Machen and Nemechek the practice for one dollar and told them to take care of the community. CAN-DO, REDUX In the early days of building their prac - tice, Machen and Nemechek continued in their mentors' footsteps, working six days a week and splitting on-call duty year-round. The only time one of them wasn't available at the clinic was the time they attended a gastroenterology conference in Colorado. Even then, they found themselves on duty: During one of the lec - tures, a man in the front row stood up and said he had chest pain, but nobody responded. \"Mike and I looked at each other, and then went up and talked to him,\" said Nemechek. \"I had nitroglycerin in my bag so we stayed with him until the helicopter arrived. The room was full of special - ists, but it was Mike and I who took care of the guy.\" Today, Bluestem Medical see patients from six counties and up to 100 miles away, practicing what Machen calls \"cradle-to-the-grave family medicine.\" Machen estimates that he has delivered or helped deliver 500 babies. He loves to listen to the stories of Herbert Steinike, the 92-year-old retired Union Pacific railroad engineer who brings the staff homemade kettle corn whenever he has an appointment. Machen skin biopsies and other minor procedures. He is also the deputy district coroner and has been the medical director for the Quinter Ambulance Service since 1990. \"When I get up in the morning, I have no idea what I'm going to take care of,\" said Machen. \"It could be runny noses and sore throats, it could be delivering babies, it could be strokes, it could be broken bones or chest trauma. I cannot remember the last time I was bored.\" And of course, he's taking care of his own community: neighbors, friends, people he's known for many years. \"Continuity with patients is more profound in a rural area,\" he said. \"In a metro area, you see patients in the clinic and that's it. I see mine in the Dairy Queen and at the ballgame and the drugstore.\" His daughter, Samantha Alsop, a vascular surgeon in Kansas City, remembers how often she and her sister and two brothers saw their father talking to patients outside of the office. \"We couldn't get out of church without someone pulling him aside and saying, 'Hey, I have this rash' ,\" Alsop said. That closer connection with patients and their families offers more than small town charm. It improves clinical care. One reason Machen monitors Richard Corwin's blood pressure and cholesterol so closely is that he remembers when Corwin's brother had heart issues at a fairly young age. \"Knowing a person's social situation and extended family history can be a big plus in the office when you're trying to figure out com - plicated problems.\" A person's social situation is something Machen is able to consider, in part because Bluestem Medical is not owned by anyone but the partners in the practice. This is probably best for Machen, who says he doesn't deal well with authority. \"If I see a patient, and I know that they are struggling financially or there's some other stuff going on, I can no-charge them, and I feel free to do that,\" he said, then added, \"Once, I traded a C-section for a cow.\" PAYING IT FORWARD Machen says if he has any regrets, it's miss - ing the first few years of his four children's lives while he was working around the clock in the early years of his practice. Alsop re - members the long hours and her mother bringing her and her siblings to see their dad when he'd been at work an extended time. What she doesn't remember is an ab - sentee father. She remembers the guy who served on the school board, coached basket - ball and T-ball, and was a troop assistant to the Boy Scouts. \"He never missed anything. He was at every important event in my life,\" she said. \"Every concert, every basketball game, even in col - lege, he came.\" His son, Edward, who began medical school at KU in 2018, admires his dad for his hands- off parenting approach, even maintaining a poker face when Edward was considering medical school so as not to influence him. He also admires his father's intellect, which he says Machen does not recognize: \"Often when he would leave for the clinic, he would say, 'Just an average guy, saving lives.'\" \"I know people who would literally give the shirt o their back to a stranger if it's the right thing to do, and it happens all the time out here. It really is a joy to take care of people like this.\" Michael Machen, M.D. 17 Spring/Summer 2019In addition to being named the 2018 Kansas Family Physician of the Year, the Average Guy has been appointed to the Governor's Advisory Committee on Trauma, was medi - cal director of the Kansas Heart and Stroke Collaborative and has served as president of the Kansas Medical Society. He also serves as a medical advisor to the Kansas State High School Activities Association. His list of accolades includes the 2014 Ad Astra Outstanding Volunteer award, the 2015 Physician of the Year award from the Kansas Emergency Medical Services Association and a 2005 American Academy of Family Physicians Exemplary Teaching Award\u2014a national honor. If it were appropriate to do so, he'd add to his CV. The fact that both his boys earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a desig- nation he calls \"a big deal.\" In the halls of Bluestem Medical hang three enormous pieces of corkboard full of pho - tos of more than 250 medical students who have rotated through Quinter in the last 30 years. As the northwest Kansas site director for medical education for the KU School of Medicine, Machen helps organize rural programs for medical students, including the third-year family medicine rotation, the fourth-year rural preceptorships and the second-year summer training option in rural medicine (STORM) program. Doug Gruenbacher, M.D., a graduate of the KU School of Medicine in Wichita, was matched with Machen when he participated in the STORM program. When he came back for his fourth-year preceptorship, he brought his wife, Shelly, also a KU medical school graduate from the Wichita campus. After the Gruenbachers completed their residencies in Salina, Machen called them and offered them jobs. They've been partners in the practice since 2002. Another married couple, Anna and Scott Rempel, 2016 graduates of the KU School of Medicine in Salina, will also become partners at Bluestem in 2019. In 2016, Nemechek left Bluestem Medical to work at a satellite clinic he and Machen helped established in Hoxie, about 30 miles northwest of Quinter, but they remain neighbors and friends. Jon Sides, a family medicine physician in Burlington, Kansas, who did his fourth-year rural rotation in Quinter in 2001, says that what makes Machen a good doctor, other than his technical skill, is his empathy for all his patients. \"You go to school to gain knowledge,\" said Sides. \"But you learn the human side of medicine from him.\" Zelfer, who has been Machen's patient ever since Machen arrived in Quinter, calls him both a good friend and a good doctor. \"He just treats you like family,\" said Zelfer. \"When he retires, we're going to miss him.\" Machen said he learned how to treat patients from Gunter, who warned him early in his career that even though he might get called in the ER at 3 a.m. to treat someone with what Machen might consid - er a trivial problem, he needed to remember that the patient might have driven 50 miles in the middle of the night on country roads just to get there. They might be hurt or sick and scared, and whatever they are experiencing isn't trivial to them. \"He said, 'you need to comfort them; that's why you're here,'\" remem - bered Machen. \"And he was right. That's what it's all about.\" Mike Machen, M.D., and long-time patients Deloris (age 81) and Herb (age 92) Steinike.Health care professionals at KU Medical Center are taking a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the growing opioid addiction problem in Kansas. At noon on a Friday in the fall of 2018, near - ly 100 health care professionals across Kansas logged on to their computers, tab - lets or smartphones so they could spend their lunch hour participating in the first of an eight-part teleconference series on opioid addiction delivered through Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes), a live tele-mentoring program offered by the University of Kansas Medical Center. Project ECHO helps health profes - sionals learn from experts about managing complex medical conditions and discuss is - sues they are having with individual cases. The attendees came from many medical professions and all corners of the state. A nurse practitioner in Junction City. A be - havioral health case manager in Garden City. A hospital administrator in Kearny County in southwest Kansas. An internal medicine physician in Pittsburg. The expert at this first session was Daniel Warren, M.D., BY KRISTI BIRCHON PILLS AND NEED NEED LES LESa board-certified addiction medicine physi - cian in the Department of Family Medicine at the KU School of MedicineWichita. Warren delivered a presentation on how primary care providers can better identify patients with opioid use disorders through question-based screening, toxicology screenings such as urine tests and increas- ing their use of Kansas' prescription drug monitoring system, K-TRACS. He also emphasized that none of these methods is enough to diagnose an opioid problem without also having a conversation with the patient, and that connecting with the pa - tient as a human being is also important to connecting them to treatment. \"A substance use disorder is an interaction between a drug and a person,\" Warren told the participants. \"If you find an abnormality on a screening, instead of identifying it as a time for judgment, identify it as a time to ask somebody what's going on in their world.\"Funding a Project ECHO series about opioid addiction is just one of many recommenda - tions made in the Kansas Prescription Drug and Opioid Misuse and Overdose Strategic Plan, issued in July 2018, to set goals to battle opioid addiction in the state. \"Opioids are a growing and emerging threat in Kansas, and it's going to take being pre - pared on a multi-faceted, multidisciplinary level to address the problem,\" said Krista Machado, chair of the Kansas Prescription Drug and Opioid Advisory Committee, which drafted the recommendations. KANSAS VERSUS THE NATION The opioid abuse epidemic is the worst drug crisis in American history. In 2016, more Americans died from drug overdoses than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. Two-thirds of those nearly 64,000 deaths involved opioids: prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, her - oin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. The death toll from opioids in 2017 looks to be even higher, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kansas is actually ahead of the game, at least in terms of mortality. The state has one of the lowest opioid death rates in the country: 5.1 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 13.3 deaths per 100,000 for the United States as a whole in 2016, accord - ing to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. But that doesn't mean that Kansas can breathe a sigh of relief. The state's opioid overdose rate might be relatively low, but it's higher than that of methamphetamines, and it has quadrupled since the opioid crisis be - gan at the end of the 1990s. At the same time, the state's rate of prescribing opioids one of the major risk factors for people develop -on PILLS and NEEDLES 20 Kansas Medicine+Science 21 Spring/Summer 2019\"A substance use disorder is an interaction between a drug and a person. If you find an abnormality on a screening, instead of identifying it as a time for judgment, identify it as a time to ask somebody what's going on in their world.\" DANIEL WARREN, M.D.ing an opioid-use disorder remains slight - ly higher than the national average. Kansas also has a large rural population, and opioid addiction tends to hit harder in rural areas where many older people live and seek more treatment for chronic pain, noted Kimberly Nelson, the SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) re - gional administrator for Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska. \"It's not like the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s crack was a metro area drug,\" she said. \"This is different.\" Meanwhile, many private insurers have begun to require time-consuming prior authorizations in order to pay for long- term opioid prescriptions. By summer 2019, Kansas Medicaid patients who had been getting opioid prescriptions for chronic pain will also have to get prior authoriza - tions. Adding these administrative layers to obtaining prescription painkillers might sound like a common-sense way to fight addiction, but the result often backfires be - cause of the potential delays in getting the prescription filled. Even a delay of one or two days can cause opioid withdrawal. \"People's opioid dependence doesn't just go away when they can't get a prescription,\" said Warren. \"They go into withdrawal, some of them for the first time, and then they find another way to get the drug, often using illicit opioids such as heroin.\" That shift to illicit drugs is an important dynamic in the history of the epidemic, which began 20 years ago when, on the ad - vice of drug companies, physicians began to prescribe opioids at record numbers to treat acute and chronic pain, unaware that a person can start to become physically de - pendent on a drug like oxycodone in under two weeks. The shift to illicit drugs was the second phase of the epidemic; people who'd become addicted to those painkillers and could no longer find a willing prescrib - er started using heroin. The third phase was the arrival of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid originally manufactured for surgical pa - tients but now also made on the street. Lethal at tiny doses, fentanyl is now often mixed with heroin, sometimes unbeknownst to the user, and is involved in nearly half of all U.S. drug deaths. So far, Kansas appears to be in the first stage. Like fashion trends, drug trends tend to start on the coasts and work their way inland. And while it's driving the overdose death rate nationally, fentanyl use remains low, at least for now, in Kansas. The goal for Kansas is to keep it that way, and to get people who already have developed an opioid use disorder into treatment. FIGHTING STIGMA, SUPPORTING PROVIDERS Until a decade ago, the only fellowship training available to specialize in addiction treatment was in addiction psychiatry, such as the fellowship offered through the ad - diction psychiatry training program at KU Medical Center. As a family medicine doctor certified in addiction medicine, Warren is a rarity. A native of Wichita who graduated from the KU School of MedicineWichita in 2009, he did a residency in family medi - cine at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bremerton, Washington, and then completed a fellow - ship in addiction medicine at Oregon Health and Science University. In 2017, he decided to come home to Kansas, in part because he knew there were no fellowship-trained addiction medicine physicians (including psychiatrists) in his hometown. In addition to his position at the KU School of Medicine, Warren also treats patients for opioid addic - tion at two clinics in Wichita. Many public health experts agree that get- ting a handle on the opioid problem will require the participation of primary care physicians like Warren, although they don't necessarily need to be board-certified in ad - diction. Primary care is where most people get their preventive care, and it's the referral hub for specialty treatment. More primary care providers need to screen for opioid use disorders so that they can refer patients else - where for treatment, if not treat it themselves.But many physicians hesitate to treat sub - stance abuse. Addiction is often regarded as a moral failing rather than a brain disease, and that attitude can spill over onto those who treat patients with addictions, especial - ly if they are the only provider in the area doing so. \"Some might fear becoming the local addic- tion treatment person, and others might not want other patients to see 'those' kinds of patients in their waiting rooms,\" said Nelson. \"Plus they don't feel confident in treating it if they also don't feel like they don't have enough education and support in the community.\" Providing support and education is the rea - son SAMHSA worked with the KU Medical Center to support the Project ECHO series on opioid use disorder, which also featured ses - sions on treatment options, pregnancy and opioid use disorder, how to set up a treat - ment clinic, behavioral health aspects and psychosocial resources that can help provide a continuum of care. Warren is also part of the state's technical assistance center funded by SAMHSA that providers can access to get help with preventing addiction and provid - ing treatment in their communities. Doctors also need to learn more about managing the chronic pain conditions for which opioids were overprescribed in the first place. The provid - er education chair of the Kansas Prescription Drug and Opioid Advisory Committee and chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at the KU School of Medicine, Talal Khan, M.D., MBA, is part of a team of specialists who teach primary care physicians about managing pain through non-pharmaceutical means such as physical therapy, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy. They also provide information about best practices for prescribing pain medications in light of a patient's condition, genetic makeup and previous pain experience. \"Curing pain is very difficult once it occurs. You can manage it through difficult modalities, you can try to put a lid on it for extend periods of time, but curing it is very hard,\" Khan said. \"That's why preventing chronic pain is very important.\" Moreover, women and men are different in terms of pain and perception of pain and in their re - sponse to opioids, according to Kim Templeton, M.D., professor of orthopedic surgery at the KU Medical Center. Templeton writes and speaks about the need for providers to understand these gender differences, including delivering the keynote lecture at the 2018 Kansas Opioid Conference in Topeka. \"For hormonal, anatomical and physiological reasons, women tend to experience pain more intensely than men,\" Templeton said. \"It also takes longer for opi - oids to take effect in women, and the effect tends to be shorter, all of which can result in women taking more opioids and being at a higher risk for addiction and overdose.\" INCREASING ACCESS TO MEDICATION- ASSISTED TREATMENT Treating addiction to opioids is different than treating addictions to other drugs such as methamphetamines. For one thing, tackling opioid addiction often involves using medication, as well as behavioral therapy. The most effective medications for opioid addiction are methadone, in use since the early 1970s, and bu - prenorphine, first approved to treat opioid abuse disorder in 2002. At appropriate doses, these med - ications help prevent withdrawal symptoms and cravings while not producing a high. Unlike metha - done, which for most patients must be taken daily at a treatment clinic, buprenorphine can be prescribed so that people can take it at home. A third drug, in - jectable naltrexone, is also effective, but it is expen - sive, and patients must stop using opioids for 7 to 10 days before their first injection. The challenge with buprenorphine is that it's un - der-prescribed. Physicians are required to take an eight-hour course to obtain a special certification to prescribe it, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners are required to have 24 hours of train - ing. Nationally, the data are abysmal; only 5 percent of physicians are certified, and only one in four peo - ple with an opioid-use disorder receives any kind of medication-assisted treatment. In December of 2017, Warren completed a survey showing that there were more than 50 counties in Kansas with no buprenor - phine prescriber. That means about 220,000 Kansans would have to cross two county lines to access either a methadone clinic or a buprenorphine provider. Starting in academic year 2018-2019, all family medi - cine residents at the KU School of Medicine in Kansas City will become certified to prescribe buprenorphine during their intern year and then have oversight pre - scribing the medication throughout the rest of their training. For physicians already practicing, Warren and Tim Scanlan, M.D., education professor in the KU School of MedicineWichita, have offered the one-day buprenorphine certification course twice in Wichita, once in Salina and have plans to offer the course in spring 2019 in western Kansas. The course is free for any provider in the state. In 2017, the addiction psychiatry program in the KU Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences began offering an elective rotation in addiction psy - chiatry for KU medical students, through which stu - dents learn and gain experience about methadone, buprenorphine, naloxone and the management of addiction disorders. In addition, Warren has added a two- to four-week elective on drug and alcohol use disorders open to fourth-year medical students that will also soon be offered for residents. His long-range plans include creating an addiction medicine fellow - ship in Kansas. Currently, the closest one is in Tulsa. A BROADER ISSUE Learning to treat opioid addiction in Kansas is good not just for tackling the opioid epidemic, but for deal - ing with Kansas' many other addiction problems. \"Opioid use has gained attention because of rising death rates, but addictions to other substances such as methamphetamines and alcohol have not gone away and, in fact, are rampant,\" noted Bruce Liese, Ph.D., clinical director of the new Cofrin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Addressing this epidemic might be complicated, but it can also be rewarding on a professional level. \"When you have a conversation with someone about their addiction, and then they make a change, some - times you can see them a year later and see that it was a life-saving conversation,\" said Warren. \"It's a great gift to be able to give somebody.\" addiction disorders.

ZIEL is an innovative venture forged by KU Medical Center and The University of Kansas Health System which utilizes 45,000-square-feet of new simulation space to optimize education and training for current and future health care professionals. Kansas Medicine + Science spoke to Diederich about the growing role of interprofessional simulation training at KU.BY DONNA PECK10 QUESTIONS WITH EMILY DIEDERICH, M.D.10 Tell us a little about where you grew up and why you became a doctor? I grew up in Roeland Park, Kansas and was the oldest of six kids. I have quite a few health care professionals in my family. My dad is a primary care physician, and my mom is a nurse, so I was surrounded by a love of learning and teaching. Why did you decide to go into pul- monary and critical care? In medical school, I fell in love with physiol - ogy, and there's no better place to apply this than the intensive care unit. I am fortunate to work with patients and families dealing with serious illness and wrestling with end- of-life issues. In 2016, you were named the di- rector at the Zamierowski Institute for Experiential Learning. Why were you interested in taking this on? I experienced the transformational impact of simulation firsthand as a medical stu - dent and resident, and it soon became my passion. When KU Medical Center and the health system decided to make it a priority, I was eager to play a role. How is simulation training with man- ikins dierent than learning medi- cine in the anatomy lab with cadavers? Manikins and cadavers are tools to learn the science of health care. They're different tools, but they are both important.1 2 3 4Do you approach simulation training dierently when you're working with students as opposed to health care professionals? There are some differences, but the core skills are the same for students and profes - sionals. One of the most powerful aspects of the partnership between the medical center and health system is the development of training programs that spans students to post-graduate trainees to faculty and staff. Can you tell us about the ZIEL Simulation Research Collaboratory? The third leading cause of death in the United States is medical errors. Simulation is a fantastic laboratory for the study of hu - man performance. Matthew Lineberry, our director of simulation research and assess - ment, is leading the collaboratory in creating assessments that contribute to the learning process, research and advance patient safety. What advances do you see on the horizon for simulation training? Although it's not my area of expertise, I know that the horizon is bright for advanced tech - nologies such as virtual reality, which is al - ready being used at the KU School of Medicine. What do you like to do in your spare time? Well, I have a six, a five and a two-year-old at home...so that pretty much takes up all my spare time!8 97 10 How has the use of simulation train- ing changed at KU Medical Center over the past 10 years? When I came to the KU School of Medicine, there were small pockets of simulation education. But real change started in 2014 when the medical center and the health system began to discuss collaborating on a state-of-the-art simulation center for students, faculty and health care providers. The leadership of both institutions knew we needed to respond to the changing educational culture in health care. We were also fortunate in finding such great bene- factors in David and Mary Zamierowski, whose financial support and vision have been critical throughout the journey. We made it happen in record time, with the ZIEL center in Sudler opening in early 2016. And with KU Medical Center's Health Education Building open - ing in 2017, ZIEL added an additional 40,000-square-feet of simulation ed- ucation space. What has that meant to the growth of simulation training at KU? With the addition of three floors of simula - tion space in the Health Education Building, we have been able to realize so many more possibilities. We have a simulation hospital that includes not only patient rooms, but also a nurse's station, medication room, clin - ical lab and pharmacy. This, along with the outpatient exam rooms, home environment and practice laboratory, has allowed us to go from providing 4,000 simulation learn - er-hours in 2016-2017 to more than 21,000 in this past academic year.65 25 Spring/Summer 2019Simulation training using manikins is arguably the most prominent innovation in medical education for both students and health care professionals over the past two decades. Today's computer-con - trolled full-body patient simula - tors allow students to practice new skills and make mistakes without any risk to actual patients. Numerous studies have estab - lished the effectiveness of simu - lation training in building clinical decision-making and communi - cation skills. But the anatomy laboratory, where students dissect cadavers, remains a fixture in medical train - ing. All medical school students are required to take basic human anatomy courses in their first year. It is almost considered a rite of passage for every medical stu - dent to thoroughly and respect - fully dissect a cadaver to gain a real understanding of the way the human body functions. Most health care educators believe both approaches are valuable, and they complement each other.CAN MANIKINS M edical manikins are realistic-looking, life-size replicas of a human body, equipped with a large number of electronic, pneumatic and mechanical devices, controlled from a host computer. Manikins can provide a range of convincingly accurate responses to medical interventions. M anikins breathe, with breath sounds, heart tones and palpable pulses. A m anikin has a monitor that can display EKG, pulse oximeter, blood pressure, arterial wave forms, pulmonary artery wave forms, anesthetic gases and more. P rocedures can be performed on the simulators such as bag- mask ventilation, intubation, defibrillation, chest tube placement, cricothyrotomy and others. U sing manikins in clinical simulations allows future and current doctors, nurses and other health care professionals to learn to work together as a health care team. M anikin-based simulations allow for virtual feedback using computers that regulate the manikin's compressors, mimicking pulses and chest raising.SIMULATIONREPLACE THE CADAVERS H uman anatomy is the foundation for the language of medicine, the language health care professionals use for communicating about patients. N othing can replace dissection, which is not easily replicated on a computer screen. Patients are three-dimensional beings, changing as they age. It is in the dissection labo- ratory where students form their ideas and mental images of the structure of the human body at different levels over time. T he only way to truly know the body is to get up close and personal with it to feel the tendons and nerves, the fascia and the vessels. T he dissection laboratory provides an introduction to the variability of the human body and the uniqueness of each cadaver. T he routine performance of dissection provides students with training in spatial appreci- ation and orientation and in the use of instruments. Most of these are directly related to surgery, but the acquired skill in eye-hand coordination and manual dexterity is relevant in a variety of clinical settings.CADAVER LAB? The University of Kansas Medical Center has invested millions of dollars in state-of-the-art simulation training spaces in the past five years. But it is also in the process of renovating the university's anatomy labs, so students will have the opportunity to dissect cadavers in a more modern lab environment. 26 Kansas Medicine+Science 27 Spring/Summer 2019KU Medical Center researchers are exploring ways exercise may help prevent disease before it happens. BY GREG PETERS ILLUSTRATION BY MICHAEL WARAKSAEXERCISEAN IPTION FOR LIFEPRESC 29 Spring/Summer 2019The late Waldo McBurney was a medical marvel. At age 100, he stood atop the victory stand at the World Athletics Championships in Carolina, Puerto Rico, three gold medals dangling from his neck. At a time in life when most of us are just thankful to be alive, this full-time beekeeper from western Kansas was not only still competing on a world stage, he was churning out records. How was it that McBurney could be so physically active at such an advanced age? Was this centenarian some kind of super human being? Or was he simply the product of a healthy diet and clean living? \"The discussion of whether exercise is good or not is over,\" said Paige Geiger, Ph.D., a professor of molecular and integrative bi - ology and the principal investigator for the Muscle Physiology Laboratory at KU Medical Center. \"The discussion now is how much and how often? Who responds to exercise and who doesn't? And when do the benefits of exercise begin? That's been the big shift.\" A TRUE BELIEVER IN EXERCISE When it comes to extolling the many benefits of exercise on general health and longevity, John Thyfault, Ph.D., a profes - sor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at KU Medical Center, is a true believer. Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes and heart dis - ease are on the growing list of chronic con - ditions linked to a sedentary lifestyle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates heart disease and stroke alone account for 810,000 deaths annually in the United States. Obesity puts one in five children at risk for chronic diseases. The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease es - timates more than 59 percent of Americans will suffer from at least one chronic dis- ease in the next 12 years at a cost of more than $42 trillion. \"For most of the two million years humans have roamed the Earth, we have had to be very active to procure food and stay safe, warm and dry,\" Thyfault said. \"It's only been in the last 100 years or so that our phys - ical activity levels significantly declined. So, it's not so much that metabolic diseases have developed because of changes in our genetic makeup. It's because of a change in our environment, and our genes are not happy in this new sedentary lifestyle.\"For years, the health care community has debated the importance of exercise and its influence on health and longevity. Experts now agree that some form of physical activ - ity on a regular basis - whether it's garden - ing or marathoning - is beneficial to main - taining good health. Now many researchers and clinicians are taking the next step and are investigating how exercise may actually help prevent disease and chronic conditions before they happen. In December 2010, the International Journal of Clinical Practice published a research re - view that found that people who participate in regular exercise could reduce or prevent their risk of developing around two dozen physical and mental health conditions in - cluding some cancers and dementia and slow down how quickly their body deteri - orates as they age. The review found that apart from not smoking, being physically ac - tive is the most powerful lifestyle choice any individual can make to improve their health. While science may never find all the an - swers for how McBurney's athletic prow - ess lasted into his second century of life, it won't be due to a lack of trying. At the University of Kansas Medical Center, re - searchers across the spectrum are injecting a healthy dose of outside-the-box thinking into solving what makes exercise do so many good things for humans.When Thyfault was at the University of Missouri, he worked with a senior investi - gator studying how sudden transitions to inactivity led quickly to metabolic changes in lab animals. They took animals who were exercising daily and made them stop so they could examine how quickly the transition to inactivity led to metabolic deficits. The animal studies proved so promising they led to human studies where research - ers would take active individuals and limit their activity for three to seven days. The result: the participants' glycemic controls were altered dramatically as were their vascular functions. Thyfault next moved to studying fatty liv - er disease or the storing of excess fat in the liver. In earlier times, a person with a fatty liver was almost always an alcoholic or had hepatitis. But with today's sedentary life - styles and high-fat, high-sugar diets, more liver transplants are done due to obesity than any other cause. In his research into fatty liver disease, Thyfault studied test animals that were sed - entary and overate, much like the lifestyle of many average Americans. It didn't take long for the animals to become obese, more insu - lin-resistant and, as a result, began storing ex - cess fat in their livers. Eventually, they started showing signs of diabetes, which is a similar path for sedentary and overweight humans. \"If we gave the animals running wheels and let them voluntarily run in their cages, it prevented every single metabolic condition,\" said Thyfault. \"We found that daily activity really improved the ability of the mitochon - dria in the liver to metabolize lipids and then to store less lipids in the liver. And we found exercise actually treats fatty liver as well as preventing it.\" John Thyfault, Ph.D. 30 Kansas Medicine+Science healthy people respond more quickly and have a higher amplitude than older adults, where the brain's response is more blunted. \"I believe our methodology and experimen - tal protocol will provide unique evidence around cerebrovascular health and what we need to do to maintain brain health,\" Billinger said. \"I think that knowledge will be valuable to the scientific and medical communities.\" Transcranial doppler ultrasound is already part of another large exercise-related study headed up by the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center. The Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease (rrAD) trial, which involves 640 participants across six sites across the coun - try, is examining how aerobic exercise and intensive medical management of blood pressure and cholesterol could prevent Alzheimer's disease in people with a family history of hypertension and dementia. FITNESS AND CANCER Cancer is another area where exercise and physical activity have been shown promise for prevention and limiting of side effects. Two KU Medical Center researchers are investigating how keeping the body active can help with weight, which is key in re - ducing the risk of certain cancers and less - ening the side effects. Carol Fabian, M.D., director of the Breast Cancer Prevention Center at The University of Kansas Cancer Center and the Morris Family Endowed Chair in Cancer Prevention, has led a team exploring how weight loss and exercise can prevent breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence in women who are obese. \"We hope to find that exercise could positive - ly impact the brain in the form of improve - ments in memory and cognition and healthy changes in the brain's structure,\" said Burns. MEASURING HOW EXERCISE AFFECTS THE BRAIN A potentially game-changing addition to the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center's IGNITE trial will be the implementation of a novel brain blood flow testing proce - dure created by Sandra Billinger, PT, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, and her team in the Research in Exercise and Cardiovascular Health Laboratory at KU Medical Center. By using transcranial doppler radar, researchers are able to mon - itor vascular blood flow inside the brain throughout a given exercise. \"We are working hard to try to unlock some of the questions and provide new insights into how vascular risk may play a role in brain aging,\" said Billinger. \"A cardiac stress test examines how the heart responds to exercise, so we may have the beginning of an exercise stress test for the brain.\" For the test, subjects are fitted with an adjust - able headband containing ultrasonic probes that are placed over the cranial temporal bone window while the individual exercises on a recumbent stepping machine. Participants sit on the machine and are instructed to start exercising until they reach a predetermined workload, and their heart rates level out. Billinger said what they have discovered is that while exercising, the brains of younger affect cognitive performance,\" Burns said. \"But we're also looking at the biomarkers that are linked to Alzheimer's. Can we ob - serve less decline in memory center atrophy and hippocampal atrophy? And do we see less accumulation of amyloid in the brain of those who are exercising?\" IGNITE participants undergo pre- and post- study health assessments including MRIs looking at brain structure; functional imag - ing to show the parts of the brain engaged during cognitive tasks; pulse wave velocity tests monitoring blood flow; cognitive test - ing through pen and paper tests; hair sam - pling to measure cortisol levels; and PET scans to measure the build-up of the amyloid protein. Participants will be divided into groups doing 150 minutes of stretching and toning weekly, another doing 150 minutes of aerobic exercise and the final group doing 225 minutes of aerobic exercise. Exercises include treadmill walking, pedaling station - ary bikes or using elliptical machines three times a week at specified intensities. \"We are approaching this as though exercise is a drug, and we are controlling it like we would a drug being tested in a clinical tri - al,\" said Burns. \"We are really trying to get a handle on how much physical activity peo - ple need, so we want to make sure people follow our specific protocols.\" Burns said age is obviously the current primary risk factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. But he is hoping that there will soon be definitive proof through the IGNITE study that exercise may have the potential to hold off cognitive decline in millions of people worldwide.JEFFREY BURNS, M.D.\"We are approaching this as though exercise is a drug, and we are controlling it like we would a drug being tested in a clinical trial.\" CAN EXERCISE PREVENT ALZHEIMER'S Jeffrey Burns, M.D., and his colleagues at the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center are chasing the elusive ties that may link exer - cise to preventing or slowing this debilitat - ing, deadly disease. Fueling this intensity is the harsh reality that 5.7 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's, and that number is projected to reach 14 million by the year 2050, at an annual cost as high as $1.1 trillion. Burns said previous research on the role of exercise and brain health has proved in - conclusive, largely because of inconsisten - cy among how the studies were conducted. For example, some studies had fewer than 50 participants, while others did not ensure that participants consistently stuck to the prescribed exercise regimen or closely mon - itor the exercise intensity. That is why researchers at the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center have launched the largest, most comprehensive study ever on the role exercise plays in brain health and cognitive decline in older people. The study is attempting to enroll 640 participants between the ages of 65 and 80 with under - active or sedentary lifestyles and normal brain function into a five-year, $21.8 million study funded by a grant from the National Institute on Aging, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Researchers at the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center are team - ing up with scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and Northeastern University to conduct the study known as IGNITE: Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise. \"The purpose of the IGNITE study is to focus on how specifically prescribed exercise can Jerey Burns, M.D., and Sandra Billinger, PT, Ph.D. 33 Spring/Summer 2019Research has shown a link between sed - entary behavior and obesity and between obesity and breast cancer risk as well as risk of recurrence. Women who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing breast cancer and a better outcome if can - cer is diagnosed. Most of breast cancers are fueled by estrogen and other hormones, and scientists note that inflammation also can stimulate some forms of breast cancer. Earlier studies by Fabian have shown that by losing at least 10 percent of their body weight, obese and overweight high-risk women and breast cancer survivors have a reduction in blood levels of hormones and inflammatory markers. Fabian and her colleagues have just finished a pilot study in older sedentary breast cancer survivors who are also obese. They used multiple support measures including activity trackers, group and individual diet counseling and person - al trainers to help women achieve both a high weekly exercise level and substantial loss of visceral fat, which scientists believe is responsible for much of the inflamma - tion associated with obesity. \"For general health in cancer patients, 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exer - cise equivalent to walking at a rate of 3 to 3.3 mph and at least two sessions per week of resistance training are recommended each week,\" Fabian said. \"The 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or al - ternatively 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, is really a minimum for reduction of cancer risk or risk of cancer recurrence once an individual has been diagnosed.\" Fabian said since achieving this level of intensity means significantly increasing the heart rate, most people seriously over - estimate the amount of moderate- to vigor - ous-intensity level exercise they are doing unless they are tracking it with a wearable accelerometer with heart rate monitor. She added that 200-250 minutes/week of aerobic exercise is a better goal both for keeping off lost weight and reducing fat and inflamma - tion, but the research into the ideal amount of exercise continues. Meanwhile, Sally Maliski, Ph.D., RN, FAAN, dean of the KU School of Nursing, is lead - ing a multidisciplinary research team inves -tigating whether exercise can prevent the development of serious side effects in some cancer patients. Maliski and her team are conducting research into how an individualized pro - gram of exercise might help minimize the cardiovascular and bone effects of andro - gen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with prostate cancer. In 2015, an estimated 220,800 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and an estimated 27,900 men died from the disease. ADT is used to treat ad - vanced prostate cancer cases, biochemical recurrence and as a complement to radia - tion therapy. While ADT improves survival for men with prostate cancer, the treatment has multiple side effects, including cardiovascular dis - ease, metabolic syndrome, decreased bone density, weight gain, increased visceral fat mass distribution and a diminished health-related quality of life. Studies show ADT patients have a 20 percent higher risk of cardiovascular heart attack. Risk of dia - betes and depression are also elevated after prolonged ADT use. Julie Christianson, Ph.D. In Maliski's study, men using ADT are part of either an intervention group participating in aerobic and strength exercises or a control group with no formal exercise plan. Over the course of a year, their biological base - lines will be tested before and after the in - tervention so researchers can make general recommendations regarding the optimum duration, frequency and intensity of work - outs for best results. This is combined with support and education on prostate cancer, nutrition and ADT. \"Ultimately, the goal is to come up with gen - eral guidelines, a prescription if you will, that physicians and other health care pro - fessionals can recommend to their patients that will result in the best outcomes for their prostate cancer patients who are receiving ADT,\" Maliski said. EXERCISE AND PREVENTING STRESS AND CHRONIC PAIN DISORDERS In Julie Christianson's laboratory, research - ers are looking closely at how exercise in - terventions early in a person's life may hold sway over how serious the effects of stress can be when they are exposed at a young age and possibly how they ultimately deal with pain in later life. \"One of the biggest observations we have made is that early exercise interventions have a much larger effect on reducing the outcomes of early life stress exposure,\" said Christianson, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology. \"It turns out, a history of early life out that it might not be the science that stands in the way of improving the health of Americans. \"Seventy percent of Americans are over - weight, 30 percent are obese and only a very small fraction exercise for the 150 minutes per week recommended by the American Heart Association,\" Thyfault said. \"What can we do to motivate them to use this inex - pensive and very effective means of staving off disease and chronic health conditions?\" Thyfault said a big step will be educating physicians and insurance companies on how exercise can be the prescription to good health. \"Our health care system isn't set up for pre - ventive care or to use exercise as a form of treatment, nor is insurance set up for reim - bursement,\" he said. \"I don't think our lim - itations are knowledge in terms of the science. Our limitations are applying the knowledge and implementing it in our current system.\"stress is associated with nearly all function - al pain disorders, including irritable bowel disorder and urological chronic pain syn - dromes. This suggests interventions need to be made in childhood and adolescence to have the greatest impact.\" Christianson focuses on understanding cen - tralized pain disorders that arise due to a mis - match between the perception of pain in the brain and the amount of information com - ing from the affected body part. Migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia and urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes are among these commonly diagnosed pain disorders. Patients with these disorders can present with pain in one body area, pain in a region or widespread pain with fatigue cou - pled with mood and sleep disorders. Most pain drugs don't work for these patients and often make symptoms worse. \"Exercise has been shown to be very effec - tive in improving symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, migraine and depres - sion,\" Christianson said. \"For example, if we allow mice to have unlimited access to a running wheel beginning at four weeks of age, we don't see any of these negative outcomes.\" THE FUTURE IS OUTSIDE THE BOX Thyfault is optimistic that after years of examining variables such as aerobic capac- ity and physical activity, researchers are on the cusp of delivering a precise exercise prescription for preventing some common medical conditions. But he is quick to point \"I don't think our limitations are knowledge in terms of the science. Our limitations are applying the knowledge and implementing it in our current system.\" JOHN THYFAULT, PH.D. out that it might not be the science that stands in the way of improving the health - weight, 30 percent are obese and only a very small fraction exercise for the 150 minutes per week recommended by the American Heart Association,\" Thyfault said. \"What Heart Association,\" Thyfault said. \"What - pensive and very effective means of staving Thyfault said a big step will be educating physicians and insurance companies on how exercise can be the prescription to - ventive care or to use exercise as a form of - - itations are knowledge in terms of the science. Our limitations are applying the knowledge 34 Kansas Medicine+Science 35 Spring/Summer 2019 ficult problem in many populations where poor health can lead to health maladies such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Without a common methodology from which to establish a baseline of nutrition knowledge, there was no way to uniformly examine the cause and effect poor nutrition literacy can have across targeted study groups used for research or in the general population. As a re - sult, data could vary greatly from study team to study team, leaving researchers with little from which to draw meaningful conclusions. \"The immediate goal of nutrition education is to improve diets,\" said Gibbs. \"That's pretty hard to do if people don't have the knowledge and the skills to do so.\" Gibbs' NLit tool looks at six subscales or focus areas: nutrition and health; energy sources in food; food label and numeracy; household food measurement; food groups; and consumer skills. She found that scores on the NLit were strongly and positively re - lated to diet quality. As a way to validate the When an assistant professor in the Department of Dietetics and Nutrition Education at the University of Kansas Medical Center discovered years ago that there was no standardized research tool available to determine her clients' abilities to make healthy food choices, she decided to come up with a solution that is now becom - ing an industry standard. Sparked by the absence of any sort of prop - er tool that could reliably tell if a person was able to obtain, process and understand di - etary information, Heather Gibbs, Ph.D., set about the process of developing the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLit). \"I realized much of my time and energy were being spent educating and counseling pa - tients about the role diet could play in their disease therapy,\" Gibbs said. Gibbs understood that there was a dire need for a standard methodology or device to track nutrition literacy, which can be a dif -A KU MEDICAL CENTER DIETETICS AND NUTRITION PROFESSOR HAS DEVELOPED A SMART PHONE APPLICATION TO ASSESS NUTRITION LITERACY BY GREG PETERSHEALTHY FOOD CHOICES? A P PTHERE'S AN FOR THAT! reliability of NLit, Gibbs worked with her department chair, Debra Sullivan, Ph.D., RD, and fellow KU Medical Center faculty members Edward Ellerbeck, M.D., Byron Gajewski, Ph.D., and Chuanwu Zhang, MS, on a study published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior that ex - amined nutrition literacy among 402 adults with chronic diseases. NLIT IN ESPA\u00d1 OL Gibbs has also adapted NLit into Spanish to work with Kansas City's immigrant popula - tion. Gibbs said this is critical because sta - tistics show that in the United States, Latino immigrants face a greater number of bar - riers to living a healthy lifestyle compared to the general population. This is especially true when it comes to eating a nutritious diet. Poverty, food insecurity, a lack of formal ed - ucation, a limited access to general health care and the assimilation of bad eating habits common in the U.S. population are among the difficulties they must overcome.Heather Gibbs, Ph.D. Gibbs partnered with members of Juntos: Center for Advancing Latino Health at KU Medical Center to help the organization improve health and participation in health research for Spanish-speaking Latinos liv - ing in the Midwest. Gibbs was the principal investigator for a study published in Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health that used NLit-Spanish (NLit-S), a form of NLit with language and cultural modifications made to address the specific barriers faced by Spanish-speaking Latino immigrants. The results of the 51-person study showed that NLit-S is a reliable tool to measure the six domains of nutrition literacy, and it correlates well to the Short Assessment of Health Literacy Spanish (SAHL-S), which is a validated measure of health literacy in Spanish. NLIT ON YOUR PHONE Now Gibbs has taken NLit a step further by creating a smart phone application. Gibbs said researchers and study participants are the initial target audience for the app. The app allows study participants to answer a battery of assessment questions on their smart phones and submit them electroni - cally. The app then alerts the researchers so they can begin assessing the results. In addition to its clinical uses, the app has the potential to provide more data to nutrition researchers like Gibbs so they can amass more information to help people make healthy food choices. \"By navigating to the app dashboard, clinicians can see the subject's results and also access all the completed assess- ments,\" Gibbs said. \"In other words, they are both able to individualize care using the app as well as evaluate results from their entire sample.\" The app was developed by Life Sciences Technologies, headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and hit the market in October 2018. Project manager Jody Lloyd said they worked closely with the KU Medical Center Information Technology team, and they were able to leverage their existing technol - ogy platform to publish Gibbs' survey and track participants' responses. \"I'm excited about the potential for Dr. Gibbs' app,\" said Sullivan, who serves as chair of KU's Department of Dietetics and Nutrition and Midwest Dairy Council Professor in Clinical Nutrition. \"It is allowing so many more people to use the NLit tool and help us to better understand the role nutrition litera - cy plays in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.\" \"Good nutrition is important for absolutely everyone, so I'm envisioning many applica - tions of this work,\" Gibbs said. \"My hope is that NLit will be a valuable tool for other re - searchers to study nutrition literacy in their specific populations of interest.\" And now, thanks to Gibbs, there is an app for that.\"THE IMMEDIATE GOAL OF NUTRITION EDUCATION IS TO IMPROVE DIETS. THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILLS TO DO SO.\" HEATHER GIBBS, PH.D. 36 Kansas Medicine+Science 37 Spring/Summer 2019Louanne Hudgins, M.D., who earned her medical degree from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 1984, is consid - ered one of the country's foremost experts in medical genetics and genomics. Hudgins is the medical director of the clinical genom - ics service and director of perinatal genet - ics at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University. Hudgins was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, and grew up in Haysville, near Wichita, Kansas. She studied microbiology in un - dergraduate school and was thrilled when she was accepted to attend the KU School of Medicine in 1980. She said, first and fore - most, the KU School of Medicine taught her how to be a good physician. \"The faculty at KU didn't pamper us,\" Hudgins said. \"They taught you how to manage your time, which is such a critical skill to being an effective doctor.\" Hudgins said she was drawn almost imme - diately to the field of pediatrics. \"The chair of pediatrics at KU while I was at medical school was Mike Bailey,\" she said. \"He was such a mentor that when he moved \"We need to start developing evidence-based guidelines to convince insurance companies to pay for genetics testing for children with multiple anomalies.\" Hudgins has also been outspoken about the easy availability of genetic testing avail - able to the public. She is not a big fan of di - rect-to-consumer genetic testing. \"I understand that many people are curious about their genetic makeup and want to buy whole-genome tests for themselves and their children,\" Hudgins said. \"But these test results are sent back without any med - ical evaluation or counseling to help people understand the limitations of the testing and without any context. This ends up caus - ing a lot of anxiety for many people. Genetic counseling before getting results is essential so people will know what to expect.\" When she's not working to advance the field of genetics, Hudgins enjoys reading, and has recently taken up painting with watercolors. \"I find the process of painting very sooth - ing,\" Hudgins said. \"I love to watch how the colors blend into each other. I admire the unpredictability.\"Louanne Hudgins, M.D. Professor of Pediatrics Chief, Division of Medical GeneticsStanford University to the University of Connecticut, I followed him and did my residency there.\" While she served her residency in Connecticut, Hudgins began developing an interest in genetics, and she completed a fel - lowship in human genetics at the University of Connecticut Health Center. She has been able to combine her passion for pediatrics and genetics throughout her career, which has included stops at the University of Arizona and the University of Washington before landing at Stanford University. Hudgins is considered one of the world's experts on Kabuki Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting about one in 32,000 births and causes a number of unusual facial fea - tures and body abnormalities. In 2017, Hudgins was elected president of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), a national professional or - ganization for clinical and laboratory genetics professionals. Hudgins said as president, she has a number of goals for the organization. \"We are making tremendous strides in the field of genetics, but our health care system isn't necessarily keeping up,\" Hudgins said.
