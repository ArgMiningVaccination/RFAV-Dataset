This systematic review w as conducted as part of t he Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months (P/B -24) Project by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team . The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been published2 and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific - overview -pb-24-0. NESR, formerly known as the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food- and nutrition- related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B-24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7- 8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and priorit izing systematic r eview questions , searching for and s elect ing s tudies , extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study , synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been published3 and is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/pb- 24-project - methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 13, this document includes details about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest , is found on page 13. In addition, the literature search plan that was used to identify studies included in this systematic review is found on page 13 . 2 Stoody EE, Spahn JM, Casavale KO.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human mi lk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma? What is the answer to the question? There is in sufficient evidence to determine the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma throughout the lifespan. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified and prioritized as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. How was this question answered? A team of Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review staff conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collaborative. What is the population of interest? The population of interest was generally healthy infants and toddlers (ages 0-24 months ) who were in studies examining food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis throughout the lifespan a nd asthma from childhood through adulthood (ages 2 years and up). What evidence was found? This review includes 1 article, which was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or asthma. How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literature from 01/1980 to 03/2016. 7 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This systematic review was conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhi nitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma? This systematic review examines comparisons of infants who were fed human milk exclusively for shorter durations with infants who were fed human milk exclusively for longer durations prior to being introduced to infant formula. The question examines exclusive human milk feeding preceding the introduction of infant formula, only, to avoid overlap with another systematic review that examined the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages and its relat ionship with food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. Exclusive h uman milk feeding was defined as feeding human milk alone and not in combination with infant formula and/or complementary foods or beverages such as cow's milk. This definition is inclusive of the World Health Organization definitions of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding, which permit limited quantities of (a) drops or syrups containing vitamins, minerals, or medicines, (b) water and water -based drinks such as sweetened water and teas, (c) fruit juice, (d) oral rehydration salts solution, and (e) ritual fluids4. Human milk was defined as mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Do nor milk (e.g., banked milk) was not examined in this review. This systematic review examines available evidence related to food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis from birth through adulthood and asthma from childhood through adulthood ( outcomes prior to childhood may represent transient recurrent wheeze5). Conclusion statement and grade There is in sufficient evidence to determine the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma throughout the lifespan. Grade: Grade Not Assignable Methods The systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. A single literature search was conducted to identify literature for several related systematic reviews that examined infant milk -feeding practices and different outcomes . The search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed, and used a search date 4 World Health Organization.

A manual search was done to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened independently by 2 NESR analysts to determine which articles met predetermined criteria for inclusion. Data from the included article were extracted, risks of bias were assessed, and both were checked for accuracy. A conclusion statement was developed, and the strength of the evidence (grade) was assessed using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the internal validity/risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability of available evidence. Summary of evidence This review includes 1 article, whic h provided insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or asthma. There may be a large degree of overlap between current literature examining the duration of exclusive human milk feeding (which may terminate with complementary feeding) and the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages (which may immediately f ollow a period of exclusive human milk feeding) . Yet, the degree of overlap is difficult to ascertain; infant -feeding research does not often specify whether exclusive human milk feeding is followed by complementary feeding or formula feeding or both, and complementary feeding research does not often specify whether complementary foods and beverages are introduced to infants fed human milk exclusively or fed infant formula in some amount. It would be beneficial for future researchers to be mindful about thi s potential ambiguity when designing and conducting research about the duration of exclusive human milk feeding or the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages, and strive to help clarify any unique contributions of each of the two f eeding practices on atopic disease and other outcomes. 9 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, a nd asthma?

Yet, the degree of overlap is difficult to ascertain; infant -feeding research does not often specify whether exclusive human milk feeding is followed by complementary feeding or formula feeding or both, and complementary feeding research does not often specify whether complementary foods and beverages are introduced to infants fed human milk exclusively or fed infant formula in some amount. It would be beneficial for future researchers to be mindful abo ut this potential ambiguity when designing and conducting research about the duration of exclusive human milk feeding or the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages, and strive to help clarify any unique contributions of each of the two feeding practices on atopic disease and other outcomes. Description of the evidence One article met the inclusion for this systematic review question (Table 1). It pre sented evidence from an Italian case- control study. Participants were between the ages of 3 and 24 months at the time of the study (time of the first diagnosis of atopic dermatitis in cases). Race/ethnicity was unreported. The sample was mostly male (67%). Data about infant feeding were collected retrospectively by parent report . Exclusive human milk feeding at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 months was compared to the introduction of milk formulas (but not solid food) by the same time point. The outcomes were atopic dermatitis symptoms by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 months. The outcome was based on parent interview and an exam performed by the study dermatologist. Evidence synthesis The available evidence is not sufficient to determine the relationship between shorter v ersus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to the introduction of infant formula and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis throughout the lifespan. The body of evidence has just 1 article that examines atopic dermatitis . It found no significant associations between being introduced to infant formula versus being fed human milk exclusively at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months of age and atopic dermatitis symptoms by the same age. No articles were identified that examined atopic der matitis at other ages or that examined food allergies, allergic rhinitis, or asthma. Table 1.

Yet, the degree of overlap is difficult to ascertain; infant -feeding research does not often specify whether exclusive human milk feeding is followed by complementary feeding or formula feeding or both, and complementary feeding research does not often specify whether complementary foods and beverages are introduced to infants fed human milk exclusively or fed infant formula in some amount. It would be beneficial for future researchers to be mindful about this potential ambiguity when designing and conducting research about the duration of exclusive human milk feeding or the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages, and strive to help clarify any unique contributions of each of the two feeding practices on atopic disease and other outcomes. 12 Figure 1. The end of the exclusive human milk feeding duration can be the same as the introduction of complementary foods and beverages Infant -feeding research wil l continue to rely on observational designs , because of ethical issues related to randomizing infants to be fed less or no human milk ; however, researchers should endeavor to minimize bias through sound research design and conduct. In general, i nfant -feedi ng researchers should: Move toward collecting data consistently using valid and reliable methods Increase the precision with which they define infant -feeding variables Incorporate effect modification into their study design whenever possible i n case differ ent biological or environmental characteristics modify the impact of infant feeding on the outcomes Assess baseline differences in critical confounding variables between comparison groups, and make statistical adjustments as necessary Address temporality and reverse causality when outcomes are measured from birth to 24 months Included article 1.
