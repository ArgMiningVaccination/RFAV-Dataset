For example [Considering the safety and interactions of turmeric](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/considering-the-safety-and-interactions-of-turmeric/) and [Cannabidiol oil - potential adverse effects](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/cannabidiol-oil-potential-adverse-effects-and-drug-interactions/) We also have guides to herbal medicine use in [pregnancy](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/handling-questions-about-herbal-medicines-or-dietary-supplements-and-conventional-medicines/) and [breastfeeding](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/is-it-safe-for-breastfeeding-women-to-take-herbal-medicines/) If you cannot find the information you need in the resources listed, or your clinical scenario is complex, primary care health professionals can seek further advice from our [Medicines Advice Service](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/home/about-sps/get-in-touch/medicines-information-services-contact-details/) Other primary resources In addition to our own resources, we particularly recommend the following resources that are free to access: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - About Herbs [MSKCC-About herbs ](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/search)is a US website with evidence-based monographs on herbal medicines. Monographs provide referenced information on uses (not just in cancer), mechanism of action, contraindications, adverse effects and interactions. For each monograph, information is presented in two sections: one for patients and caregivers, one for healthcare professionals. SPCs/SmPCs and PILs Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs/SmPCs) and Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) available via [electronic Medicines Compendium](https://www.medicines.org.uk/) and [MHRA](https://products.mhra.gov.uk/). Some herbal preparations are classified as \"traditional herbal medicinal products\" and have MHRA-approved SmPCs and PILs. For example some brands of St Johns' Wort tablets, agnus castus capsules, echinacia tablets and tea tree oil. NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) Some [CKS topics](https://cks.nice.org.uk/) include advice on complementary medicines, for example [menopause,](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/menopause/management/management-of-menopause-perimenopause-or-premature-ovarian-insufficiency/) [premenstrual syndrome](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/management/management/) and [osteoarthritis](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/osteoarthritis/management/management/). This information is often included in 'Basis for recommendation' boxes within the text. Training resources If you would like more information on how to approach answering questions on complementary medicines we recommend: SPS Our guide to [Handling questions about herbal medicines (or dietary supplements) and conventional medicines](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/handling-questions-about-herbal-medicines-or-dietary-supplements-and-conventional-medicines/) advises healthcare professionals how to tackle questions about interactions between complementary and conventional medicines.
