Contact the Journal: editor@cjournal.ca 403-440-6991 Ice fishing a messy sportTake i T off ! ice fishing is a great way to enjoy the outdoors during Alberta's harsh winters. But, when the spring thaw comes around, some fishermen are leaving their huts on the melting lake, creating a mess for summer users. Currently, there is no way of easily identifying hut owners, allowing fines to be levied against those responsible for abandoning them. But that's something Susan Samson, the mayor of Sylvan Lake, wants to change. She has seen the consequences of that mess first hand. Debris from the abandoned huts includes, \"wood, gasoline, furniture, plastic and metal, \" Sam - son explains in a PowerPoint on the issue. The debris sinks to the bottom or remains float - ing after the ice melts, washing up on the shore and causing boating and swimming hazards. If left to sit through the spring, the huts can also pose a threat to the local environment, contaminat - ing fish and waterfowl habitat. A GOOD EXAMPLE In Ontario, ice fishers are required to register their huts by law, while fishers whose huts sink face a $200 fine. That kind of registration system is something Samson wants to see in Alberta. As a result, her municipality drafted resolutions urging the associations representing rural and ur - ban municipalities to support that position. The Alberta Urban Municipalities Association passed that resolution, but it was denied by the Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties. The AAMDC \"didn't feel that a provincial registry of huts was the way to go, \" said Gerald Rhodes, the organization's executive director. \"The membership generally supported an anti- regulation position regarding a recreational activity and felt there should simply be more enforcement and education with the rules that are already in place. \" In any case, Nikki Booth, the acting issues man- ager for Alberta's Environment and Sustainable Re - sources Development Communications, said the government is \"not looking at this time to change our legislation. \" Under that legislation, no one can leave waste on, in or under the ice. \"We can issue a ticket for $175, or we can pros - ecute people and then the fines go up dramatically to $100,000. We are focused primarily on education and prevention rather than fines and enforcement, \" Booth said. Indeed, if the huts are not registered there is no contact information of the user, and therefore no way to enforce anything if the hut is left on the ice. Until that changes, Samson and the town of Syl - van Lake have been pushing a voluntary registra - tion system called Take it off! PUSHING A SOLUTION The Take it off! program, as expressed in Samson's PowerPoint, acts as \"a complement to the Respect our Lakes program that (the province) currently runs. \" Fishermen can register in person or online, and, as a bonus, they get front door delivery service when Samson goes out onto the lake to visit and educate users of the program. \"There has been really positive feedback, \" Sam - son said about all of the ice fishers who have signed up so far. Samson made the observation that the people who have registered take a leadership role for those who haven't, resulting in a \"self policing force. \" Since the start of Take it off! Sylvan Lake has seen the number of abandoned ice fishing huts drop sig - nificantly, with only five huts remaining last spring, down from 25 in 2011. \"Sylvan Lake belongs to everyone, \" Samson said. \"It's our community's job to act as good stewards. \" And until there is registration legislation in place, Mayor Samson will trek out onto the frozen lake and try to speak with all lake users and encourage them to register. Huts and other debris can cause problems for wildlife and summer recreation CaiTL i N CL o W cclow@cjournal.ca Officials from Sylvan Lake face danger in order to pull out the semi-submerged shelters that were left behind.

RiverWalk, a bike and walking path, graces the southern bank of the Bow River, east of the Centre Street bridge. EnMax's new District Energy Centre is heating nearby offices. Two blocks south-west, construction for a National Music Centre is underway. With these developments, revitalization intended to profoundly change the inner city area is taking shape. Since 2007, the City of Calgary has invested ap - proximately $108-million to improve infrastructure in the Rivers District. The district is bounded on the north by the Bow River, on the east and south by the Elbow River, and on the west, generally by First Street S.E., but also includes the 58-storey Bow building. What makes this redevelopment story unique is the funding mechanism. Calgary was the first city in Canada to implement a Community Revitaliza - tion Levy, or CRL, which sees the portion of taxpayers' property taxes that results from increasing property assessments funneled back into community up - grades. The levy will remain in place for 20 years, at which point all property taxes from the Rivers District will once again flow back to the city and province. FUNDING LACKS KEY TEST The CRL resembles Tax Increment Financing, which has been used for financing community revitaliza - tion projects in the United States. In the American models, however, the \"but for\" test must be met. In Tax Increment Financing, redevelopment of a district would not occur \"but for\" the tax scheme. In other words, private investors would never get involved in development without help from the special tax scheme. The \"but for\" test is absent in the Alberta and newer Manitoba versions of this enabling legislation. Without such a test and stringent criteria to make such a determination, critics, such as the Canadian Centre of Policy Alternatives, argue that the private sector may be best poised to profit from such public infrastructure investments. However, supporters of CRL funding in the Rivers District suggest commercial development of the area was hampered by the fact that The Rivers lies within the flood plain of the Bow River. The special levy was needed to encourage development, according to Sheryl McMullen, who leads Strategy and Social Projects for the Calgary Municipal Land Corpora - tion, the subsidiary corporation of the City of Calgary. CRITICS SPEAK OUT Scott Hennig of The Canadian Tax Federation is on record opposing the use of a CRL to fund arena in - frastructure in Edmonton, and has written previously that the CRL leads to \"a loss in revenue for the city that means property taxes across the city would have to go up to cover the shortfall for core services. \" Despite opposition, some point to the implemen- tation in Edmonton of two separate CRL zones. The Belvedere CRL Area was created on Jan. 30, 2012. It is used to fund, according to the Belvedere CRL Area Plan, a \"significant face lift to the Belvedere com - munity in northeast Edmonton, an area originally developed with a strong focus on the meat packing industry which declined significantly through the 1990s. \" A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS Initial sales of large-scale residential developments proposed for the area have met pre-sale targets, ac - cording to McMullen. Cathy Davis, a City of Calgary communications ad- visor, provided information highlighting the increase in assessed property values since the original 2007 property assessments. A recent assessment roll of the Rivers District re - ported that total property values increased from five to six billion dollars between 2008 and 2012. A review of the enabling bylaws showed that the Community Revitalization Levy amounted to roughly $5.1-million in 2008, and in 2011 it had grown to just over $16-million in tax revenue. Transportation consulting firm Steer Davies and Gleave says detractors argue that such tax levies \"sim - ply redirect investment from one location to another, and promote competition for investment between neighbours. \" HAS IT BEEN SUCCESSFUL? Calgary writer and business analyst Richard White notes that the city took a \"calculated strategic risk\" with the Rivers District re-development, and the idea of the CRL was \"innovative. \" Although it will be at least 20-25 years before it is possible to judge the success of the redevelopment, the city is currently executing its original plan, and \"doing a good job. \" Only time will tell if the area will attract the diverse population, which he considers vital to a true urban village. Funds brought in through the Community Revitalization Levy have shot from five million to 16 million dollars in three years. Photo by Katherine Camarta/C aLGary J o U rna LOur City Cal garyj O urnal. Ca ma r 2013 4The hundreds of tar-stained ciga - rette butts scattered just outside Cal - gary's Foothills Medical Centre is a sig n the hospital's smoking ban isn't being enforced. But, on the other side of the Rockies, Vancouver Coastal Health Authority is making a big push to ensure a similar ban in British Columbia has teeth. In Alberta, such a ban has been in place since 2008 when the province introduced the Tobacco Reduction Act. The Act states that it is illegal to smoke within five metres of hospital doors, and under Alberta Health Services policy smoking is prohibited from all property. However, the butts at Foothills Medical Centre aren't the only indication that the ban isn't working. A 2011 academic study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that enforce - ment of the AHS no smoking policy appeared to be lacking at the University of Alberta hospital. In fact, according to AHS senior media relations advi - sor Bruce Conway, there is no significant history of ban violators being ticketed and fined under the province's Tobacco Reduction Act. \"Well, they certainly don't take a heavy handed ap - proach, \" he said. \"It's mostly a conversational approach as opposed to confrontational, and they ask peoples' coop - eration in respect for others. \" The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority's chief medi - cal officer, Dr. Patricia Daly, did a survey in 2012 at Vancouver General Hospital which found around one third of smokers on the facility's grounds were staff. As a result, management now patrol the hospital to discipline staff who violate the no smoking policy. Dr. Daly says every hospital in the region screens patients when they enter, asking if they are smokers. Those who do are offered nicotine replacement thera - pies as part of a provincial initiative to reduce smoking. The authority is also one of the first to pioneer the use of a new technology in Canada to warn smokers that they are not welcome. \"We've installed very sensitive smoke detectors in some of the outdoor areas. \" Dr. Daly said. \"These are very unique, they give off a verbal message that says 'you can't smoke in this area, please move off hospital grounds' repeatedly. \" She says the alarms, which have been installed at Vancouver General Hospital, are very effective and not expensive. Other hospitals have asked if they can have ac - cess to these smoke detectors. The consequences of not adopting such an ap - proach can have big downsides. Dr. Richard Stanwick, chief medical health offi - cer for Vancouver Island Health Authority, is con - cerned about patients and visitors having to run a \"gauntlet\" of second-hand smoke when entering hospitals. \"If you were a person with even mild or moder -ate asthma, \" he says, \"that amount of smoke could actually trigger an event that would require hos - pitalization. \" Dr. Stanwick thinks the issue is whether or not hospitals are willing to enforce no smoking policies with the same rigor as they would other policies. \"A visitor standing in front of one of our hospi - tal doors swigging from a bottle of vodka would probably not be deemed particularly acceptable, \" he says. \"And yet for some reason there is that tol- erance of tobacco, even though it is the number one preventable cause of death in this country still. \" The approach Alberta Health is taking currently doesn't include plans for stiff penalties for staff or incorporating technologies such as smoke detec - tors. However, Conway did say nicotine replacement therapies are being provided to patients in Alberta.

Ca MA R 2013 5Most people never have to think about which public washroom to use \u2014 or feel unsafe when they walk through the washroom doors \u2014 but for transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, using a public washroom can be a daunting experience. Some university campuses across Canada have responded to this social issue by installing gender-neutral washrooms as places that ev - eryone can feel safe using, such as the University of Victoria in British Columbia. However, there are no such washrooms in the core building of Mount Royal University campus. Local queer activist Joshua Cadegan-Syms thinks that's a problem. \"There are many people out there who don't fit into the gender binary, and forcing them to choose between the two is a form of oppression, \" he says. DEFINING GENDER NEUTRAL Three of the newer buildings at Mount Royal University have single-stall washrooms intended for people with limited physical mobility of both genders. Positive Space, an organization on campus that promotes understanding and respect for gender diversity and sexual orientation, played a role in lobbying for these washrooms. But Scharie Tavcer, an advocate for the organi - zation, points out, \"They're not labelled as gen - der-neutral, they're labelled as male or female and wheelchair accessible. \" In a pinch, transgendered students and gen - derqueer \u2014 those who don't define themselves as male or female \u2014 could use those facilities. Cadegan-Syms doesn't think that's good enough. \"Now just to say 'why don't we use these as multipurpose and we can have genderqueer people use them' to me totally negates the whole issue. \"That's saying we just want to shove you aside, and not recognize what the real issue is. And the real issue is we have a problem with gender and a problem with people that fall outside what our idea of gender is. \" Brian Fleming, the Mount Royal University vice-president of student affairs, who also played a role in the installation of these washrooms, says those facilities are called \"accessible\" rather than \"gender-neutral\" because accessible is a \"broader terminology. \" GENDER-NEUTRAL LABELS ELSEWHERE Other universities have taken a different ap - proach to the installation of gender-neutral washrooms on campus. The University of Victo - ria has renovated two multi-stall washrooms in the students' union building to make it clear that students of any gender identity are welcome. \"What they are basically is two highly visible washrooms in the main hallway, \" says Lux West, one of the collective coordinators at UVic Pride. \"The markings on the door that designate gen - ders have been taken down and there's a sign that says 'gender inclusive washroom. \" He says that the washrooms initially \"faced a bit of a backlash from some students who said that to use these multi-stall gender-neutral washrooms would be against their beliefs, and that these washrooms would be inaccessible to them. \" But overall reception has been positive and the University of Victoria is now leading a national coalition for gender-neutral washrooms to be included on all Canadian campuses. Another approach to gender-neutral wash - rooms is to indicate their openness to people of all genders through a public sign. Those signs have a symbol that combines the male and fe - male symbols into one body. They are meant to indicate openness to people who identify as male, female, transgender and genderqueer, and acknowledge that not every - body fits into the male or female gender identity. FUTURE OF NEUTRAL WASHROOMS In regard to the future of gender-neutral wash- rooms at Mount Royal University, Fleming says, \"We haven't made a kind of rule or regulation on this, but certainly when we're doing renovations or expansions, we're making note that that's something that should be in new buildings. \" He states that renovations to older buildings on campus could present an opportunity to make the washrooms in the core building on campus more accessible. Inclusion of the gender-neutral symbol on ex - isting washrooms could also be approved in the future after a review. Cadegan-Syms hopes for positive changes to accessibility for gender non-conforming stu - dents in the future. \"By having a gender-neutral washroom on campus, not only does it do a service but it sends a message to these people that they are valued and we are trying to better understand how they identify, \" says Cadegan-Syms.Washrooms for everyone?Toile T T rouble The gender-neutral signs acknowledge that not everybody fits into a male or female gender identity.

Despite Calgary's intricate cultural mosaic, the multi-faith room in Foothills Hospital appears to have been designed to best accommodate Christian faiths rather than those of different cultures. Alberta Health Services representative Bruce Conway contends the space is welcoming to all religions \u2014 stressing non-Christian chaplaincy services are available to patients. However, with a portrait of a saint and verses from the Bible framed and nailed to the hallway leading up to spiritual centre, it seems like not all who attend Foothills Hospital would feel comfort - able using the space. When asked about the apparent lack of neutral- ity in the space, Conway said the Foothills Hospi - tal accommodates all religions, and their volunteer support program is able to meet the demand for religious diversity. \"Should (the patients) have wanted support in their faith, than we would have a trained volunteer go and visit them and bring materials from that tradition, \" said Conway. \"So if they're not seeing it (in the Spiritual Centre), it doesn't mean that support is not available. \" Rosemarie Elaine Fitton, a senior lecturer at De Montfort University in the United Kingdom who spe - cializes in the design of spiritual environments, said, \"Biblical scripts along the walls would, in my mind, be sending out a strong message that the space was Christian, and not in fact a space for all faiths. \"There are doors to cover the portrait of the saint at Foothills Hospital's spiritual centre. However, Fit - ton said it's not always the best option. \"The research I have conducted has brought to light instances where 'neutralising' a room\" \u2014 in this case closing the doors \u2014 \"for the next potential users can be forgotten or ignored, creating a space that is foremost Christian. \" Moreover, when the Calgary Journal visited the multi-faith room and asked for a copy of the Koran, a staff member said they did not have one on hand. Neena Obhrai, the vice president of resources for the Calgary Hindu Society, personally experienced the stress of not having the proper resources to practice her faith within the Foothills Hospital in 2004, when she almost lost her husband who fell into a coma. \"There was nothing for the Hindus, \" Obhrai recalled. \"Some people just need to meditate, and I was so des- perate I just brought (reli - gious items) from home. \" \"When people are desper - ate they need something to hang onto, \" Obhrai said. \"Some books for prayers would be good; (the Hindu Society of Calgary) would be willing to donate them to the hospital for free. \" Conway said four chaplains representing other religions, such as Buddhism, are available. There are also health care and religious beliefs pamphlets available to anyone inquiring about other religions. \"We can't be all things to everybody but we do try, \" Conway said, adding patients who have con- cerns should talk to staff. If that doesn't resolve the issue, he said the next step is to contact the office of patient relations to discuss the concern or complaint.Taking a closer look at spiritual spaces JORDAN KROSCHINSKY jkroschinsky@cjournal.ca The multi-faith room in Foothills Hospital has the potential to feel uninviting for other religious faiths.

Iverson, a resident of Lake Bonavista and mother of one, says when dropping off her daughter at school, it's not speeders that pose the most immediate threat. \"The traffic in the morning is the real issue, \" she says. \"I'm surprised there aren't more accidents (in front of the school) with four lanes of traffic pushed into a two-lane road. \" Buses are constantly pulling in and out on one side, while parents are trying to find a spot to drop off their kids. After months of this, the roadway has turned to sheet ice thanks to exhaust fumes and spurts of activity. The two issues impeding safety around schools \u2014 speeding and congestion \u2014 pose a dangerous threat to children and community members. After six years, Ward 3 Alderman Jim Stevenson believes he has a solution. Stevenson put up a notice of motion in mid-January arguing the speed limit signs that bookend school and playground zones don't always catch the attention of drivers, even himself at times. \"I have found myself looking at a sign that says you're leaving a zone and didn't even know I was in one, \" Stevenson says. \"I feel ashamed that I've been speeding. \" To combat this popular mistake, Stevenson sug -gests installing rumble strips similar to the ones used at stop signs in rural areas. \"Out in the country you feel these rumble strips on the road that tell you to slow down, \" Stevenson says. \"If you stray off the road on the highway you feel the vibration and it sends you a signal. \" Constable Jim Lebedeff, a traffic education officer in the city, says that installing rumble strips at both ends of a school or playground zone could be a good idea to increase safety for children. But Stevenson admits the rumble strips only deal with the problem of speeders, not the second issue of congestion, which is caused by vehicles and buses all competing for the same roadspace. Stevenson says he recognizes that this safety initiative will cost the city money, but not having pullout areas for buses and drop-off zones for par - ents are real issues that need a solution.School zone speeding troubles Alderman Ald. Stevenson champions rumble strips for schools and playgroundssuburb saf Ety JODI EG aN CaLG N a L.Ca MA R 2013 8Driving up the steep wind - ing road to the top of the bobsled track at Canada Olympic Park, I had no idea what to expect. Images of Georgian Nodar Kumari- tashvili's fatal luge crash on the open - ing day of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics were passing through my mind, but I quickly shut them out. This was a bobsled, much safer and more secure than a luge, and piloted by a professional driver with experi- ence on the national team. \"It's going to be fine, \" I told myself \u2014 just a free rush of adrenaline on a nice winter's day. The tension in the starting tent was electric with the chatter of dozens of first time bobsledders filling the air as they eagerly awaited their shots of adrenaline. I was tingling with excite - ment and anticipation, as if I had a nine-volt battery stuck to my tongue, getting jolts each time I saw another sled disappear down the track. THE RUNDOWN When I met my two sled mates, we immediately had to decide who was going to sit where \u2014 the difference between front and back is vast. Riders in the back seat can feel forces as high as five Gs \u2014 stronger than an astro - naut experiences during liftoff, and as they fly down the track at breakneck speeds, there is nothing but a breezy opening behind them. I soon found that this would be my seat. I began to clear my mind, mentally preparing for the ride that would momentarily make my body feel five times it's actual weight \u2014 a hefty 378.75 kg. That's the weight of an average-sized bull. I was to be taken down by sea - soned bobsled pilot Richard Chris - tensen, who reassured me \"it's a safe track with lots of drivers who have been doing lots of runs, \" and that he hadn't crashed in eight years. He holds the sled steady down the track every time despite people peeing, throwing up or clinging to him for dear life in his five years as a public bobsled pilot. Once we were all in the sled, he got in last. With a casual \"ready to go?\" from Christensen and a resounding \"yes\" from the inside of what I was increasingly starting to consider a casket with running blades, the point of no return had arrived. I was com - mitted to going down. THE RIDE With one final push from our launch- men, we were on our own with noth - ing but the sound of blades on ice, frantically approaching the first turn of the 1,475 metre-long track. Navigating through the first three curves of the track was comparable to a nice Sunday afternoon drive, but as the ominous 90-degree fourth turn came into sight it turned into a full- on police chase. The turn launched us like a hammer throw, increasing our speed from 60 to 80 km/h, in what seemed like a fraction of a second. Coming out of the turn I began to realize this wouldn't be a simple cakewalk. There was no time to be scared, to scream or even to think. I had to focus my entire consciousness on holding on to the narrow lengths of rubber tubing along the inside of the sled that only barely resembled handles. The G-forces towed the sweat down my face as we rocketed to - wards the Omega turn, which is named after the Greek symbol that shares its shape. The quick succes - sion of lefts and rights had my head feeling like dice in a Yahtzee cup, leav - ing me utterly disoriented and com- pletely oblivious as to where I was on the track. Once we came into the straight - away, at highway speeds, I suddenly knew where I was \u2014 the 270-degree Kreisel curve. I was about to weigh 378.75 kg. As the force of five Gs compressed my neck and back, the scraping sound of the steel running blades engulfed the inside of the sled at an astounding volume. Meanwhile it climbed so high onto the bank that we were completely sideways on the same turn that caused the Jamaican bobsled team to crash 25 years prior. THE FINISH Coming out of the intense curve we hit at our top speed of 117 km/h heading into the labyrinth \u2014 named for a series of alternating curves with no straightaways. Between the break - neck speeds, powerful G-forces and the unbearable noise inside the sled as it careened down the track, the last third of the ride seemed eerily similar to those last moments on the Zipper at the Stampede. Before I had time to even think, the finish banner flashed above my head and the pilot was in full braking mode as we approached the upward incline at the end of the track. All-in-all my ride had lasted a meager 64 seconds. But as I was going down the track, I thought it would never end. I was just happy to make it out alive. Christensen says COP offers thrill -seekers public bobsled rides every weekend between 2:45 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. for a $169 charge for individual riders. The public bobsled offers one of the most adrenaline filled experi - ences to be found in Calgary. Editor's note: Travis Borstmayer's ride was provided free-of-charge, courtesy of WinSport.

The sterile smell /f_illed my nostrils as I grabbed the clip - board from the front desk. I sat down on one of the lavender-coloured chairs and began to /f_i ll out the medical forms. Feeling well? Yes. Taking any medication? No. Re - cent AIDS test? Yes. Any travel? No. When I was done with the forms, a small, grey-haired nurse escorted me through the waiting room and to the rear of the clinic. Her orange crocs squeaked with every step on the linoleum. \"What inspired you to donate blood?\" She asked. I explained to her that a few months earlier my closest friend had received a trans - fusion that allowed her to walk af- ter becoming paralyzed. I was so grateful for her recovery that I felt that I could face my fear and do - nate in her honour. The nurse explained that there were 14 more questions that need - ed answering and requested that I answer them honestly, despite their embarrassing nature. \"Now Mr. Kingsmith, have you tested positive for AIDS?\" She asked unapologetically. \"I've been tested and I don't have AIDS, \" I replied. \"Have you used any illegal drugs in the last 12 months?\" \"Nope. \" \"Have you ever taken money or drugs in ex - change for sex?\" \"Uh, no. \" \"Have you had sex with a man, even one time, since 1977?\" \"Um, yes. I'm gay. \" \"Alright Mr. Kingsmith, \" she said getting up from her chair. \"We cannot accept your donation at this time. \" I was informed that Canadian Blood Services does not accept donations from men who have sex with men, which I was not aware of. \"I can't donate blood because I'm gay?\" I asked the nurse, trying to keep my cool. \"No, we cannot accept donations from any men who have sex with men, \" she said. \"As per our guide - lines, you are prevented from ever donating blood. \" I left the clinic feeling discriminated against and when I got home I started to look into the archaic rule. It didn't surprise me to discover that it was implemented in 1983 because, as the Canadian Blood Services website suggests, \"men who have had sex with other men are at greater risk for HIV/AIDS infection than other people. \" Despite the fact that I recently had an AIDS test and it came back negative, I was still refused the right to donate. Canadian Blood Services quickly discarded me, a monogamous gay man, into an outdated stereotype. \"The rule was set in place in response to the HIV/AIDS outbreak in the 1980s, \" said Deb Steele- Kretschmer from Canadian Blood Services. \"At the time they did not know much about the disease and there was not good testing available. \" In my view, this means that they are prohibit - ing a large population of Canadian men from do - nating in the face of a growing blood shortage. THE SCREENING PROCESS Canadian Blood Services manages Canada's blood supply and all donations are screened for any num - ber of diseases and de /f_iciencies including syphi - lis, hepatitis B and C, HIV-1 and HIV-2 (the viruses that causes AIDS) and the West Nile virus among others. If any abnormalities are found, the blood is discarded and the donor is noti/f_i ed. There is a small window of time in which the HIV/ AIDS virus cannot be detected by the blood tests said Steele-Kretschmer. Canadian Blood Services' primary commitment is to the safety and security of the recipients, who bear all the risk. I understand that the recipient of the blood is the one that assumes all of the consequences of an infected donation, but there are no regulations in place to protect those recipients from heterosexual people who might be infected with the virus. In a response to an outbreak of West Nile vi - rus in 2003, Canadian Blood Services said that all blood donors should continue donating as per usual and that the greatest risk to the Canadian blood supply is in a shortage of blood donations. HIV AND AIDS IN CANADA Unlike the creators of this regulation, infectious dis - eases do not follow stereotypes. HIV/AIDS does not exist only in the gay community, nor does it exist only in men. According to our national statistics, 25 per cent of all HIV cases in Canada are found in women \u2014 about 8,500 women in just 10 years. However, there are no measures in place to prevent women from donating blood. In fact, only 46.7 percent of all HIV cases in Cana - da are from men who have sex with men according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Although this number is relatively high, it accounts for fewer than half the cases in Canada. If gay men were allowed to donate, it could /f_i ll a large demand for blood donations. Considering the /f_ire aroused in online forums, there are many gay and bisexual men who are willing to donate. Canadian Blood Services has submitted a policy change to Health Canada to amend the lifetime ban to /f_i ve years, Steele-Kretschmer said. Although this change is not anticipated to greatly increase the donor base, she said the /f_i ve- year ruling will allow abstinent gay men, men who had a sexual experience in their teens and are currently heterosexual, and men who were raped as boys and are currently deferred to be able to donate blood.!\"#\"$%\"#&'())$&*+,-%.+/&.)#0%#1+/&0)&,+21/+&$)#\"0%)#/&2,)3&/+41\"((5&\".0%-+&6\"5&3+# SCOTT KINGSMITH skingsmith@cjournal.ca URNAL.CA MAR 2013 10\"Oh come please, just one more story before bed?\" This all-too-familiar phrase rings oh-so-clearly in my head as I think of the times that I stayed up begging my mom or dad before I went to sleep. How I longed to hear about the princesses, drag - ons, far away lands and great adventures that were in my books, so that I could relive the stories in my dreams. But I can't imagine that it would have been the same if it wasn't my parents actually reading to me. I loved curling up on the sofa and listening to their voices telling me each detail. It was our time together and it was what sparked my interest in reading as I grew older \u2014 I can't picture what it would be like if all of those memories were taken away. However, in our increasingly technology-depen - dent society, I wonder how the next generation of children will manage as they think back to the times when they had... a computer reading them their bedtime story. Will they recall that defined robotic voice with the same fondness as I recall my parents' voices? Will they reminisce of their LeapPad teaching them to read each time they pick up a novel? Or will they feel deprived that they missed out on these experi - ences because of our so-called advanced technol-ogy? Constantly changing advancements encourage parents to shower their children with these tech - nology-driven toys, but do the benefits outweigh the cons? What is really being lost when people switch to screens? PARENTAL BONDING TIME \"The more interactions you have with a device, the fewer interactions you have with people to learn all those life skills that you need, \" says Joanne Baxter, co-ordinator of the bachelor of applied child stud - ies degree at Mount Royal University. Baxter says it's important for parents to interact with their children, talking, pointing things out and labeling things. This human interaction builds healthy brains as well as valuable social, emotional and cognitive skills that you are not getting with a reading device. \"You have to learn how to make eye contact and how to take turns \u2014 you don't have to do that in a game, \" Baxter says. \"The game dictates when you can respond and how it responds back to you in very set ways, which is very different in the dynamic for humans. \" In addition, time spent cuddling with parents while reading a good book doesn't just contribute to a stronger attachment, but it also is the basis for building a strong sense of security as children grow older. Karin Schlegel, a parent educator with Calgary Reads, says, \"Continuing to read to (your children), holding them and carrying them through those stories with your physical presence and focused attention can go such a long way to having a child feel that all is secure. \" With constant demands on parents to keep up with work, social media and various other items on their to-do lists, it's understandable that reading devices could be considered a perfect substitute \u2014 serving as an educational babysitter. But while good in theory, this plan can often backfire. \"They're giving away the best thing they could give their children \u2014 that one-to one-time with them \u2014 they don't see that's important, \" Baxter says. Meanwhile, ads for the electronic reading pro - grams highlight or promote that children can sit and read by themselves, gaining the indepen - dence that is so highly valued in our society. However, when too much time is spent being independent, children can fall behind in social de - velopment \u2014 creating a society that will later fail to recognize the importance of face-to-face interac - tion when there is a digital alternative. IS THERE HOPE? Books offer the opportunity to delve deeper into stories and to think about things from many differ - ent points of view. Encouraging this engagement with children builds individuals who are not afraid to ask ques - tions when they don't understand something, rather than complacently accepting everything for what it is. Yet, it's reassuring to know that not all parents have disregarded the value of reading time spent with their children. Eimer Niilo consciously sets aside time to read to her five-year-old twins at least twice a day, as she really enjoys this bonding time. Niilo particularly enjoys the dialogue that takes place when reading a story. \"I like to just sit and chat about the pictures and it actually triggers memories in their minds, \" she says. \"I love to have those conversations with them. \"They don't see us off doing computer stuff and putting them in front of a computer. \" Looking at the bigger picture, it's important to remember that just because the technology is available, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right choice. Reading devices, like any other children's toy, have a time and a place but they should be lim - ited \u2014 we cannot rely on them to take on the role of a parent, a teacher or a babysitter. The memories that can be created when you share a book with your children cannot be bought at the store. Kids benefit from real booksTechn OlO gy Backlash Parent-child interaction can't be replaced with technology Eimer Niilo and daughters Jessica (left) and Sarah (right) love to sit down together and enjoy a good book each evening.

Calgary comedian Lori Gibbs remembers how it felt before she stepped up in front of a crowd for the first time. \"I don't remember being that scared about any - thing in my life, \" she says. \"I likened it to a huge mountain in front of me but when I finally took the first step and did it, it turned out the mountain had been a mirage the whole time. \" It took Gibbs 20 years to overcome her fear of stepping on stage, but, with some expert help, con - quering your own mountain can be made easier. So, if you've ever thought that it's time for you to stand-up, here are some tips to help get started. FIND A STAGE Stand-up comedian Iliza Shlesinger recently per - formed at Yuk Yuk's Calgary while on tour and says the most important tip for any budding performer is to \"just go do it. \" \"Find an open mic. Find a group. You just have to do it, that's all there is to it. The rest will fall into place. \" The workings of stand-up comedy were com - pletely foreign to Shlesinger when she moved to Los Angeles in 2004. \"I didn't know anything about it, \" she says. \"All I wanted was stage time. \" However, it's not always getting to the big stage that's most important says Shlesinger, who started out performing at coffee houses and other smaller venues before she could get into any comedy clubs. \"People don't get it, it's not about getting into a club. Comics are always like, 'What do I do to get started?' Go get some stage time, go make your own stage, go trade with another comic, you really have to hustle for it. \" But while Shlesinger's grassroots effort soon grew into a Cinderella story after she won Last Comic Standing at age 25 in 2008, she explains it isn't just about making it to the biggest stage. \"Small shows are great because it's like weight training, you start with little weights and you build. \" BE HONEST Chris Gordon, a local comedian with prior experi - ence teaching the basics of stand-up, says stepping out on the stage can be difficult, but having a well-practiced, original set makes it much easier. \"Never look to other comedians or jokes you've heard because they aren't your jokes, \" he says. Social observation is a key tool that many comics use to generate new material, and Gordon says keeping a book of thoughts is the best way to begin writing your own material. Looking for the humour in everyday matters is something Shelsinger finds to be very effec - tive. \"I really like connecting with an audience on basic social things. There's something very sat - isfying about sharing something very personal and honest and having them laugh with you and at you. \"As long as they're laughing, you're connecting with them. \" Shlesinger explains that making sure you can connect to your material is key, as the audience will see through any pretend personas. The material you choose is completely up to you, but Shelsinger says if you're talking about your real experiences in a funny way and you can make it personal, it won't matter what you talk about. \"If you want to get up there and tell airline food jokes, and talk about your in-laws, and talk about sex, and being stoned \u2014 as tacky as those topics are, if you're funny people will love you. \" HOW TO RECOVER While no one likes the thought of a bad night Gor - don explains that in stand-up \"everybody bombs. \" But what happens if they don't laugh at your jokes? What if all you hear are crickets? \"There's nothing wrong with silence, \" says Shel - singer. \"Sometimes it can be a beautiful thing. You shouldn't be afraid of it. \"You're going to have jokes that don't work, so don't be afraid of them not laughing, just be like, 'okay, moving on. '\" It's understandable that if you're getting up on stage for the first time you're probably going to feel nervous, but Shelsinger explains repetition helps. Gibbs emphasizes just how im- portant it is to remember to prac - tice: \"Have it prepared, don't try to wing it. Even if you see a seasoned comedian and you think they're winging it, they're probably not, they're just very good actors. \" DON'T GIVE UP The reality is that there will be days when things go wrong, but the most important thing to remember is to get back on the horse, says Shlesinger. \"I firmly believe there is something to be learned from every show and you leave every show a better comic than when you came in. \" Shlesinger adds that often the need to make people laugh is what draws many people back to the stage, even after a bad night. \"The laughter is like a drug, it's like this surge that goes through you, it's like their way of saying, we like you, we got you. \" So if taking the plunge to step on stage is still on your mind but fear is holding you back, Gordon says you have to ask yourself, \"Do you want to be the person who regretted taking that risk in life or do you want to step up to the challenge and realize that you're trying something new and no matter how it goes it's a great thing to put out there. \"It's just another thing that you can tell yourself that no matter how this goes at least you did some - thing that you were interested in trying. \" Time to stand-up? Conquer your fear to try open mic night Rachel Kane rkane@cjournal.cacOMI c c URIOSITY Iliza Shlesinger loves the feeling of standing on stage and connecting with the audience on a really basic level.

By comparison, Canada's history has been gen - erally ignored by video game companies. The Calgary Journal asked a number of developers and history researchers what parts of Canadian history they would like to see made into a game. Jerremie Clyde, University of Calgary librarian who specializes in history studiesClyde, who has his own game studies research program, said any good computer game re - quires obstacles to overcome. That's why he thinks \"initial homesteading and prairie settlement\" in Canada would make a great subject for a game developer. Clyde said that challenges in the game could include \"how do you find food? How do you grow food? How do you learn and adapt with the weather? \"Such a game would allow players the free - dom to make decisions that could possibly end in horrible, possibly life-ending consequences. Because conflict always helps. \" m i C hael ma gee, PhD in learning and video games, researcher of educational technology A real-time simulation game involving the ex - pansion and growth of the west is at the top of Magee's list for a Canadian history game. \"It would be interesting because it would be the evolution of a brand new country that didn't exist before, \" Magee said \"There is also a lot of interest on economic simulations where you have to grow a country, (Sid Meier's) Civilization being a prime example for that. Understanding the decisions you make and the sacrifices you make to build the west is something I think people would be interested in. \" Ben isitt, specializes in Canadian history, currently doing legal history research in Victoria Isitt's idea for a game involves the \"immigrant ex -perience. \" Within the game, players would follow a \"family of peasants or farmers\" as they travel from a place such as China or Russia to Canada. Isitt feels this would be an effective story choice because of the many hurdles \u2014 from the economy to discouraging immigration laws \u2014 that would challenge the player. In addition, the families would have to \"establish themselves in ethnic ghettos located in cities like Vancouver or Montreal. \" \"It would be interesting be - cause there is movement, an el- ement of adventure and there's challenges, \" Isitt said. \"So, the challenges aren't just happening in one place. It is about getting from point A to point B, which is a common theme in a lot of adventure games. \" Byron n oriega, CEO of Calgary game development studio, Brink 3D Canada's ice age is one of the events Noriega thinks would make for a good game plot. Noriega said in an email interview that he would tell the story from the \"point of view of a primitive man\" during the historical era, with a place like Drumheller serving as the location. \"This game should be a third person style of game since it will allow the user to be placed in a perspective where he can experience and interact with primitive animals and locations, \" Noriega said. \"Due to the lack of technology available at the time, it will challenge the player to find a way to survive with primitive tools. \" Another event that Noriega suggested as a po - tential idea was a game based around the War of 1812. \"There are video games about the American Revolution, but there has never been a game about the war between the US and Canada, \" Noriega said. \"The appeal of this game is the very large stra - tegic area to fight over. \" Bruno s teppuhn, CEO of Zensoft Studios, a local interactive software development company Steppuhn said he would like to see a game that incorporates Canadian history without the use of violence or first person shooters that are so popular today. \"Canadian historyiwise, there are plenty of in - stances that could be used in something like a trivia game or a neat little adventure game, \" Steppuhn said. \"It doesn't necessarily have to be about action or a lot of the main stigmas that are attached to video games nowadays. \" The signing of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, presented in the form of a trivia-style game, is another idea Steppuhn thinks could work.

Probing science with CBC host Bob McDonald TRaV i S B o RSTM aY e R tborstmayer@cjournal.caCanadian science journalist Bob McDon - ald has investigated everything from the smallest atoms to the biggest galaxies, sharing his findings with nearly 500,000 weekly listeners on CBC Radio's science show Quirks and Quarks. McDonald recently spoke at Mount Royal Univer - sity for the Iniskim Centre's aboriginal science and technology education program. His speech, \"Being There: Science As I've Seen It, \" invited people to share in his excitement about science. McDonald sat down with Calgary Journal report - er Travis Borstmayer to talk about his travels, dark matter and why a university degree isn't necessary. You've been decorated with numerous awards, most recently the Order of Canada. How did your career as a science journalist begin? I didn't start as a science journalist, I didn't go to journalism school, I don't have a science degree. I'm a dropout. I didn't know what I wanted to do with myself. I was always interested in science though, because I grew up in the space age. Then some opportunities came along, thanks to friends and mentors. The first one was at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto. They wanted people who had an interest in science and the ability to communicate. I seemed to have the gift of the gab, and they liked that, so they hired me and I just started working really hard. Every now and then the media would call and ask for someone from the science centre to come on the news. So I just started appearing on Canada AM ,CBC, Global and all these programs. Before you hosted Quirks and Quarks you hosted Wonderstuck, an educa-tional program for children. Why is it important to educate young people about science? Because they're the future. I've spent a good part of my career working with young people because they're the ones who are going to inherit the world we've created. If we're going to solve some of the issues that we have right now \u2014 how we use en - ergy, how we use our water, how we use food, how we deal with climate change, they're the ones that have to do that. You can't teach science to an adult. They already know it, and they'll say 'okay, I've al - ready made my career decision. ' But the young people haven't decided yet. Your book, Measuring the Earth With a Stick, seems like a more personal take on your curiosity towards science. What can we expect to find inside the book? I've done a lot of travelling and been all over the world, and I wanted to take my adventures and use that as a framework to talk about different aspects of science. I talked about an experience I had in Africa: while lying on a hillside in the great African rift valley in Tanzania at night, I realized that I was on the side of the earth. I started getting this sense of vertigo, that the sky was no longer above me. It was in front of me, and the earth was behind me. And I thought 'boy if I let go of this hill I'm going to be left out in space. ' So that's how the book goes, I'll take an experience of my own, and then take a piece of science. Why do you think it is important for mankind to continue attempting to explain the unexplained? I think it's hilarious that we are in the 21st century and we think we're so smart. We thought we had the universe all figured out: yep, there's how old it is, and it started with a Big Bang, and it's been expanding. Then all of a sudden, we find out there are two fundamental things: dark energy and dark matter. Together, they make up more than 95% of the universe. So most of the universe is missing. I find that hilarious, but also humbling. That's the way science works. It has always been the case that what we don't know exceeds what we do know. What about science has the potential to be of great importance to us in our future lives? There are always two sides of science, there's the practical side \u2014 applied science, where you get a better widget. So we're trying to make cars more efficient or change the technology to electric. That's applied science. Then there's the basic science which is 'why is the sky blue' stuff where you don't know what you're going to get out of it. The basic stuff is being left behind, which I think is wrong, because in historical context if you look back, all of the big leaps in thought have come out of basic science.

Ca MAr 2013 15Dea D l ast Recycling decades behind Waste management in YYC late to get going Calgary lags behind several other major Canadian cities in instituting programs and building infrastructure to divert waste from landfills. With the \"Green Cart\" organic waste pilot program concluding this month and a processing facility for a city-wide organic waste program in the works, Calgary is taking steps to catch up. But, an analysis by the Calgary Journal shows Calgary is 13 years behind Edmonton in multi- family recycling collection, 14 years behind To - ronto in an organic waste program, and 19 years behind Vancouver in single-family recycling col - lection. Bernice Clark, longtime member and volun - teer for the Calgary chapter of the Sierra Club, called the lag \"appalling, \" adding, \"though we're delighted (the city) is finally making progress, it's still not optimal from our perspective. \" However, Paula Magdich, head of Waste Man- agement Development in Calgary, said, \"Every city is a bit different, so I think on the recycling end we're doing really well. \" She added, \"Some cities have different programs with their own unique twist. But we are trying to base ours on what will work for our city and our customers. \" There are four main programs to divert waste from landfills: organic waste collection and composting, single family recycling collection, multi-family recycling collection and community recycling depots. Of these methods, Calgary has been dead last to institute programs amongst Canadian coun - terparts surveyed by the Journal. Although Calgary conducted blue box pilot programs in 1991, the depot system was adopted because it was the best way to balance cost with the volume of material collected, according to the City of Calgary website. Around that time, according to a Calgary Her - ald article from 1990, it only cost Calgary $9/ tonne to dump waste in a landfill, while to gather, sort, process, store and re-sell recycled material cost nearly $800/tonne. Since then, the price gap has narrowed with landfill waste costing $42 per tonne and recy - cling costing around $400 per tonne according to the city's budget plan for 2012. If plans for the organic waste and multi-family recycling programs continue as scheduled, Cal- gary could divert up to 30 per cent more waste from landfills according to a report delivered to Council. This would be critical to reach the city's goal of diverting 80 per cent of waste from land - fills by 2020. MICH ael COles mc oles@cjournal.ca INFOGRAPHIC BY MICHAEL COLES/CALGARY JOURNALenv urnal. Ca MA R 2013 16This old house 65 years in one home and still no desire to move SHANNON GALLEY sgalley@cjournal.caFor 88-year-old Doreen Orman, her home is much more than a house \u2014 it's part of deep roots that connect her family to the community. \"Yeah, it's home, \" she says with a smile. \"I have no desire to move, \" Orman says with laughter. \"The street has become very busy, they have done so much to enhance Memorial Drive. It's a wonderful place being near the river. \" She pours two cups of tea and sits down at the table in her kitchen. There are large windows that overlook the tiny backyard. The backyard is decorated with plants and shrubs that sur - round a small brick patio. \"I love the trees, I love to gar - den, \" she says. \"I have no desire to go into a condominium. \" A HOUSE WITH HISTORY Orman has lived in the 102-year-old home on Memo - rial Drive since 1948. She and her husband Jack first rented it from his grandmother for $75 per month. The couple bought the house in 1960 for $11,500. \"It's built so well, you cannot hear the traffic outside, \" Orman says. \"Someone once said it's like a whole other world out there, \" she says, referring to the noise of the street when you step outside. Orman says she can remem - ber a time when milk was de - livered to the front door; there was no Safeway, but there was a North Star Grocery and a butcher shop down the street. When the house turned 100 in 2011, Orman and her family had a big party. This past summer she displayed a sign on the lawn explaining the history of her home as part of the annual Century Homes Calgary project during Historic Homes Week. A STRO ng f A m I lY The house and the community were full of Or - mans. Doreen's husband was raised in Sunnyside, her mother-in-law lived down the street and Jack's grandparents lived on the corner. Doreen and Jack raised two children \u2014 Rick, who would become Alberta's energy minister (1989- 1992) and Maureen, a qualified proofreader and editor now living in Vancouver. The children attended Sunnyside School, as did their dad Jack. Now, grandchildren and great -grandchildren routinely visit the matriarch, with grandson Riley living at her home in 2012. \"As long as we had a strong family, we would remain in Sunnyside, \" she says. \"Everyone in Sun - nyside felt like family. \" Orman credits Sunday dinners as a tradition that kept the clan together. Even now, they still get together for Sunday dinners when everyone is available. \"Now with the great-grandchildren, when they all come for dinner, they just head right upstairs to the bedroom with the toys that my kids had and my grandkids had and they go and they play with them, \" she says. Jack Orman died in 2006 and Orman has been liv - ing in the home by herself, with the occasional live- in family member. She still feels safe in the com - munity, though she wouldn't go out at night alone. SERv I ng THE cO mm U n ITY Always a very active member of the community, Orman has maintained a passion for making a dif-ference. She was part of the planning committee with the Hillhurst-Sunnyside Community Association. \"It was a big plus. I felt like I had some input in how I wanted this area to be. I became very in - volved in the '60s, \" she says. In the '70s and '80s she helped fight high-rise, high-density developments and the widening of Memorial Drive. She notes that there are mostly low-rise apart - ments in Sunnyside and this was very important to her and the community at the time. She helped to get the developers to come to the community association with building requests be - fore going to the city, allowing residents of to have first say with what was going on in the community. Orman, the former president of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), received the Governor General's Award in 1992 for her work for women's rights. All of this volunteer work caught the attention of Premier Peter Lougheed, who asked her to run for MLA in the riding of Calgary Mountain View in 1979. \"When I ran for the nomination for the Progres- sive Conservative Party, this (the house) was my head - quarters. \"Premier Lougheed had asked me to run and it took me a long time to decide because I didn't think I was conservative, I wasn't any - thing. I was very apolitical at the time, \" she says. Lougheed gave Orman the summer to make a de - cision and she decided to go for it. She says she had a really good manager and they all met in the kitchen of her Sunnyside home. \"It was fun, I really en - joyed it and I got great sup - port, \" she says. \"Lougheed was a great guy and I wouldn't have considered running with anyone else. \" Orman lost, but looking back she says it may have been for the best. \"I don't know if I could have handled it, \" she says. \"Politicians go in very idealistic, thinking they're go - ing to change things. It doesn't always happen that way. It would have been tough. \" K EE p I ng THE HIST ORY With all these memories, accomplishments and community connections, Orman says the old house would be a hard place to leave. Preserving the history of the home is paramount for Orman. Looking ahead, she says she wants to get the 102-year-old home on a protected list that would ensure nothing on the outside could be changed and that the home could never be de - molished. Looking back, she concludes, \"It's been a busy life, but I've been very blessed. \" Sunnyside has been home to Doreen Orman for 65 years. She loves her 102-year-old home and has no desire to move.

CAMERON PERRIER cperrier@cjournal.caWith repeated news accounts of crimes committed by those with mental health issues, many attri - bute media coverage as a source for stigma surrounding those bat - tling depression or bipolar disorder. Even media advocates such as Jeffrey Dvor - kin say that current reporting on mental health by the Canadian media could be improved to reduce stigmatizing and derogatory reporting. Most journalists don't have the \"knowledge or understanding\" when it comes to reporting on mental health, said Dvorkin, program director for the University of Toronto journalism program. \"The issue for me is that journalists need to be more careful when they start describing mental illness, \" he said. IN THE NUMBERS Dvorkin's thoughts echo a recently published study in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry that examines the media's relationship with mental health. The study reviewed major Canadian newspa- per articles over a six-year period from 2005 to 2010, to determine if newspaper content con - cerning mental health was changing over time. \"The thing that needs to be addressed is the inaccurate reporting, \" said Robert Whitley, one of the lead researchers for the study from the Douglas Mental Health Institute. The study found that 40 per cent of the articles reviewed related mental health to violence and crime. The study also noted that 83 per cent of articles during the study period failed to include a quote from someone with a mental health issue \u2014 which the study voiced as \"most concerning\" \u2014 and 75 per cent did not have a quote from any sort of psychiatrist, social worker or other mental health worker. The more actual quotes from a person, the more it humanizes them, \" Whitley said, adding that a voice would aid in people's understanding. THE EFFECTS Despite Dvorkin's contention that Canadian me - dia is overall \"pretty careful, \" the numbers seem to indicate otherwise.Whitley's study suggests that the media has a powerful effect on public views towards mental health, arguing that if the media continually as- sociates mental health with danger and crimi - nality, media consumers would begin to take on these views. On the other hand, if the media were to as - sociate recovery with mental health, the study suggests positive effects would likewise occur. The study also noted that only 19 per cent of articles reviewed mentioned recovery or avail - able therapies, which, as quoted by the study, could \"leave readers with the impression that a mental illness is an untreatable and incurable disorder. \" A 2009 Canadian Mental Health Association publication highlighted the challenges for peo - ple with mental health issues that the media can cause. \"Stigma due to negative media coverage im -pedes recovery, triggers discrimination and prej - udice, and creates barriers to seeking and finding decent housing, employment, and education, \" said the publication, entitled \"Stigma Matters: The Media's Impact on Public Perceptions of Mental Illness. \" The publication also referred to a 2000 Brit - ish report that indicated the direct relationship between negative mental health coverage and the effects on people living with a mental health issue. That study found that more than half of re - spondants said poor mental health coverage had contributed negatively to their own mental health, with 34 per cent of respondents contend - ing that the news coverage actually worsened their depression or anxiety. WHAT CAN BE DONE? Micheal Pietrus, director of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, works as a resource for the media encouraging them to deal more with success stories. He suggested that in doing so, the story is brought much closer to home for readers and stresses that balanced reporting is key to accu - rate reporting. \"Such reporting entails talking to experts, and talking to people, as well, who have had a mental illness and can talk about their perspective, \" he said. CTV reporter Karen Owen, who deals with many stories surrounding mental health, is calling for more respectful reporting from the media. \"We just want to cover the realities of it. Mental illness is very common in society, \" she said. \"It is not a personality trait. It's not a weakness. It is an illness, and as such should be covered respectfully. \"It's the person first, then the illness. \" Owen's view is similar to that of Dvorkin, who acknowledged that language is also an improve - ment to be made. \"Part of it is that the language in our society is still fairly loose. We refer to situations as 'schizo - phrenic' without understanding the clinical mean - ing of the term, \" he said. Despite the implications of Whitley's study, Dvorkin maintains a positive outlook on Cana - dian media. \"I think there's more awareness of mental health issues, \" he said. \"So I think people are taking more care in mak - ing sure that we're not demonizing a whole group of people. \" Infograph Ic by cameron perr Ier/calgary journal \"It's not a weakness.

Working in one of the world's most popular industries, she learns a lot about the things that come with flying all day in, as she describes it, \"a tin can at 36,000 feet. \" Yasinski says there is slow turnaround and close to 5,000 applicants per airline per year, as the free travel benefits attract many to the job. However, she admits that the job of a fight attendant isn't so glamorous at times. NOT YOUR TYPICAL JOB \"The typical schedule for a full-time flight attendant would be spent flying for two weeks of the month, \" Yasinski says. During those two weeks, she says working up to 14 hours a day with constant travelling requires commitment and special attention to health and nutrition. \"We are exposed to a lot of radiation around the waist level because of the windows, which could risk skin cancer, \" she says of the dangers of being at elevated heights closer to the sun. \"There are also the more obvious setbacks, like the lack of oxygen and chance of dehydration. \" Yasinski has also learned that \"over an extended period of time, usually over 10 years, the dehydra- tion can eliminate a flight attendants' ability to donate organs. \" \"We can't come to work with even the slightest cold because we would infect everyone on crew and probably pop our eardrums, \" she adds. Yasinski says full-time flight attendants average about ten sick days during their already shortened work year. WHAT CAN THEY DO? However, flight attendants can do a few things to stay healthy in such germ-ridden environments. Calgary nurse Reilly Campbell, who has recently dealt with many flu patients, says there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to immunity and overall health. \"If there's ever an outbreak of anything \u2014 like the recent flu \u2014 flight attendants are at high risks, along with nurses, \" she says. \"Like us, they work in an area where people are very contagious. \" She suggests taking extra precautions and main - taining a good daily routine. \"Eating healthy and exercising regularly makes all the difference. These things strengthen bodies against infection, \" Campbell says. However, Yasinski says that while airlines encour - age and advertise healthy living, the services avail - able to airline employees and frequent flyers tend to cater to those who are already sick, as opposed to warding off future ailments. BRIGHT IDEAS \"With always being on the go and staying in differ - ent places, it's hard to stay motivated. Nobody is making it easy to be healthy, \" Yasinski says. Due to these challenges, Yasinski is hoping to fill that void with a program aimed at making life a little easier for those on the go. Yasinski plans to tackle the fitness side. With a personal training business in the works, she is currently in the process of achieving her personal trainer certification. \"I have been in fitness competitions and always been healthy myself, \" she says. \"But I need that extra training to learn how to ap - ply my knowledge to each specific client and their body type. Everyone will have different needs and goals. \" Her business will first be available to attendants from WestJet, as her exercise plans will cater to the equipment available at each hotel on their routes. She plans to let the company \"grow on its own and see what happens. \" She still has a few things to do before her launch, like taking pictures of each facility to place on her website. Yasinski's business should be available by April. A fellow flight attendant, personal caterer Mandy Crawford, has also started a business for this mar - ket. She has been running her lunch bag catering business for the past year and a half. Crawford says that Paper-Bag-Princess Catering is intended for life on the go because the whole ordering service is available online, adding, \"from the click of a button, a client can have food ready for the week. \" The Calgary business has been crafted for flight attendants, or any shift-work jobs requiring con - stant travel, and has spread to corporate customers. \"Flight attendants face a lot of hassle \u2014 travelling through customs and always having fast, processed food available. \"It's easier to eat unhealthy, for sure, \" she says, adding that any busy lifestyle can be an obstacle for healthy eating. Also a member of the fitness world, Crawford has to watch her eating. \"I love to cook and healthy eating has always been important to me. I take that extra time to pack my lunch but the average person is unaware of what to pack. \" And that's exactly what Crawford aims to pro - vide \u2014 packed lunches available to those who either don't have the time or don't know what to pack. \"If people do not choose to use my ser - vice, but it has inspired them to go off and do the same thing \u2014 pack a healthy lunch \u2014 then I'm still happy, \" she says.AIRLINER ILLNESS Mandy Crawford (left) and Maggie Yasinski believe fitness and nutrition are key components to staying healthy while travelling.

But for Lita McDonald, direc - tor of business development for Localize Your Food, coffee could be just that. The ingredients may not be local, but roasting the coffee beans in Calgary scores some local \"points.\" Localize Your Food attempts to identify local food products in grocery stores to provide con- sumers with easy access to information about the product. The program rates certain local products on a scale from one to 10, with 10 being considered the most local. Consumers will be able to scan a QR code to get more information about the product and the rating. The program will be implemented in all Calgary Co-op stores by the end of February. Criteria for the rating includes: Location of food production Business ownership Ingredient origins Method of food production McDonald says Localize Your Food was born out of an idea and frustration \u2014 frustration based on going into a grocery store and not be - ing able to find these local foods. WHY BUY LOCAL? \"The benefit of buying local is that the money that is generated by the business stays within the community, \" McDonald says. \"Because of the climate, it is challenging to think of local in terms of the food miles. So we really need to talk about what is local and how local is it, especially in the context of an environ - ment where we don't grow our own fruit. \" As McDonald walks around the Midtown Mar - ket Calgary Co-op on 11th Avenue S.W., she zeros in on a package of tomatoes shipped from Israel. \"Why are we shipping these from overseas, when we could be getting tomatoes from Mexico or even California? Seasonality is a big issue, but check the label, \" she says. SPOTTING LOCAL MADE FASTER AND EASIER Cindy Drummond, spokesperson for Calgary Co- op, says that trying to find local food products can be time consuming. \"(Consumers) have to be prepared to pick up a handful of products, compare them and make an informed choice that is going to take some time and energy, \" she says. \"Young families don't have time to be looking at every label to find out if it was grown here, or if it was grown somewhere else. So we think a simple, easily identifiable bright orange sticker will make it super fast. \" DISTRUST WITH CONSUMERS McDonald continues on to the salad dressing. She picks up a bottle with the words \"Proudly Canadian\" on the back, but as McDonald points out, even some labels can be misleading when trying to identify local food. \"What does that really mean? It could just mean it was bottled in Canada, \" she says. McDonald says there is a general distrust among consumers when a company identifies something as local. \"Wal-Mart for example, they have a picture of their produce section and overtop of the entire same produce section is this banner that says local, and there are some apples on it. As a con- sumer, many might question what this means, \" McDonald says. REMAINING INDEPENDENT One of the biggest challenges for Localize Your Food has been remaining independent from their association with Calgary Co-op. \"They are paying for our service, but they haven't influenced us in our mission of transpar - ency, \" McDonald says. She adds that they try to maintain this by hav - ing their own voice, including activities outside of Calgary Co-op. Localize Your Food hopes to expand to other grocery stores, allowing their start-up business to generate money. \"As much as I'd like to believe in philanthropy, and making this a not-for-profit, I really think that in order to make people value something there needs to be skin in the game, \" McDonald says, referring to other grocers that she hopes will pay for the program as well. WHAT TO SEARCH FOR In the meantime, McDonald suggests a few tips and tricks on how to identify local foods at your own grocery store: Always check the label Just because some ingredients aren't grown in Calgary, doesn't mean there are no local aspects to the product Consider ownership and location of food pro - duction. Local doesn't always mean more expensive Checking the Localize Your Food data base for information on a product Lita McDonald from Localize Your Food walks around the Midtown Market Calgary Co-op on 11th Avenue S.W., pointing out ways to identify local food.

It's a food and exercise combination that has become almost a mantra for some people on Internet fitness forums. The chant has taken the form of ev - erything from advice on how to make the tastiest oats, to goofy pictures of people squatting their preferred brand of oats. But is the combination actually healthy? THE SQUATS Jordan Thornley, a strength and conditioning coach at Mount Royal University, says there is some truth behind the squat support. \"Sometimes I think it's advocated without any real thought being put behind it, though, \" says Thornley. He did add \"squats are a great exer - cise if they are done properly. \" More specifically, Kellen Antoniek, a student athletic therapist at MRU, says they're for the lower body\u2014the hamstrings, quads and glutes \u2014but they also have benefits for the whole body. In fact, according to a 2005 academic study published by Sports Medicine, the researchers found performing lower-body exercises be - fore doing upper-body exercises (like squats) greatly elevated testosterone levels and led to an increase in overall muscle strength for those who participated in the study. But Thornley says squats aren't the be-all-to- end-all excercise. \"It's a good exercise for many reasons, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. \" THE OATS As for the importance of oats, Lynne Lafave, a physical education professor at Mount Royal who specializes in nutritional sciences, says that oats offer a number of benefits. They helps reduce blood cholesterol, man - age blood glucose and prevent heart disease. During resistance training, the carbohy -drates in the oats provide the energy needed to accomplish the heavy lifts. Lafave says oats also provide some protein. When combined with legumes, they even form a com - plete protein that builds muscle THE COMBINATION But is there anything special about the pairing of oats with squats? Lafave sees the pairing as a gimmick. However, she says, \"There's nothing wrong with oats. Nobody would say that's not a good idea because oats are g re a t .\" Indeed, all those who were interviewed agreed it is never one thing or the other that leads to fitness success. It is instead, a combination of a healthy diet and a targeted workout plan that will produce the best results. So while squats and oats isn't necessarily a magi - cal combination, it can complement a good work - out and diet plan. ev an m anconi emanconi@cjournal.ca Melissa White demonstrates a back squat.

That's how many news reports have described Alexis Wineman, the 18-year- old trailblazer who competed in Janu - ary's Miss America 2013 pageant. Wineman is using her newfound fame to raise awareness about autism, which recently included an op-ed piece for CNN's website. Locally, seven-year-old autistic Liberity Brunet's participation in confidence, says Alissia Brunet, Liberity's mother. Liberity competed in her first competition \u2014 Calgary's Winter Snowflake pageant \u2014 in Novem - ber and is now signed up to compete in several more. \"She was able to take her crown and trophy and sashes to school and show the other kids, which made her proud, \" Liberity's mother says. That all happened after Brunet came across a Kijiji ad looking for participants for the \"natural\" pageant, one of several Miss All Canadian events that take place across the country. At these pageants contestants may wear dress - es and make-up, but \"the end result should be you looking your age and you looking natural, \" accord - ing to the Miss All Canadian Pageants website. \"I thought 'let's try it out. Let's give it a chance, \"' Brunet says, and when she approached Liberity with the idea, the young girl agreed to try it out. Brunet was a bit surprised at the enjoyment Liberity took in the pageant, and again by her request to participate in more. In fact, Brunet says, \"Libby is actually a tomboy. \" Yet, she seems to be in her element when on the pageant stage. At the Winter Snowflake competition, she proudly took to the mic, shouting her favourite colour and age with au-thority, while waving excitedly at her mother. The result was Liberity being cov - ered in prize sashes by the end of the event. PUBLIC SPEAKING EXPERIENCE VALUED Brunet says the experience of speaking to an audi- ence has been especially valuable for Liberity. \"She loves speaking on the mic. She loves to be center of attention, \" says Brunet. \"She likes to speak her mind and say what she wants to say and when people look at her, she likes it. She talked for weeks about it. \" That's a big change from when Brunet adopted Liberity. At that time, three-year-old Liberity did not have the ability to speak. Brunet explains lack of language was one of the biggest challenges Liberity faced with the disorder. \"If she was in pain or needing something, we had to look for cues. Then overnight words started pop - ping out and she just got more and more talkative and things are happening easier. \" Brunet thinks that change happened for a num - ber of reasons: Liberity's enrollment in Quest, a school for children with special challenges, Brunet's own one-on-one work with Liberity, and the fact Liberity was surrounded by Brunet's foster children. But Liberity's future participation in beauty pag-eants could also help her development. PAGEANT PATTERNS ARE POSITIVE Dr. David Worling is a registered psychologist and clinical director at Westcoast Child Development Group in Vancouver. Worling acknowledged he's not famil - iar with the beauty pageant system, but added the patterns and formulas associ - ated with pageants \u2014 including certain techniques and speech writing \u2014 could be positive for those with autism spec - trum disorder. \"I know a lot of kids on the autism spectrum deal pretty well with formulas, so it would really be a good way to motivate a child, \" says Worling, com - menting on the articulation and speech patterns required by pageants. Th E AUTIS m A DVANTAGE In fact, Worling says Liberity's autism could possibly give her an advantage over other contestants. \"Generally speaking, most kids I know that are on the autism spectrum don't actually have a problem speaking in front of people, \" he says. \"Most of us are aware of our audience and are aware of our shortcomings, we feel concern and a bit embar - rassed, but often the kids I work with on the autism spectrum don't necessarily share those traits. \" Worling also says such beauty pageants could be a positive social experience for autistic children. \"It's not that they're not nice to other kids. But of - ten kids on the spectrum don't necessarily have the same drive to be social as other kids, \" says Worling. \"So this might be a good way to put it into a for - mula that would allow some kids to really do that. \" That's something Brunet has seen for herself.\"She sees the other kids being polite to her and hopefully when she's out there, and hopefully at the new school, she will have the poise that she needs and the confidence in herself, \" says Brunet. The president of the Autism Society of Canada, Michael Lewis, cautions such participation isn't a therapy for autism \u2014 a medical condition that re - quires attention from medical professionals. But, like other activities such as Guides or even a swimming club, he says pageants could be a venue for autistic children who can speak to \"utilize these newly developed skills and perhaps enhance them. \" For Miss America contestant Wineman, it has become much more than that. In Wineman's op-ed piece for CNN, she said, \"I've been given this opportunity to use my voice for those who don't have one or have yet to find theirs. \" But Brunet is just as happy about what beauty pageants have brought to her daughter. \"I'm just hoping this actually does good for her, \" says Brunet. \"We will just keep going until she doesn't want to do it anymore. \"ALLISON DRINNAN adrinnan@cjournal.ca According to her mother, seven-year-old Liberity Brunet's participation in pageants has given her a new found confidence.

Renowned both in Canada and abroad for his work on political and economic thought, Saul has also written widely on issues such as bilingualism, poverty and public education. A long-time champion of freedom of expression, Saul was elected the president of International PEN \u2014 a world-wide association of writers that promotes literature and freedom of expression. Saul says he became interested in PEN after spending extended periods in Africa and Asia in the 1980s and witnessing writers suffering from government suppression of freedom of expression. While best known for his philosophical work, Saul has also authored five novels including Dark Diversions: A Traveller's Tale, published in 2012. Based on a novel that had previously been published exclusively in French, this is Saul's first novel written in English in 18 years. A black comedy, Dark Diversions is told from the perspective of a morally-suspect journalist who loses himself during a series of jet-setting misadventures among dictators and socialites. Many readers may not associate you with novels. Where did the idea for Dark Diversions come from?The novels are sort of in a different world, because they were put out by separate publishers. So that may be why they are not as familiar. And this itself is a very strange book. It really is a picaresque novel. A lot of people will ask what a picaresque novel is. It's an idea that takes you back to the roots of the novel, to oral storytelling. It is kind of interesting to go back to those roots because that is what life is really like \u2014 as you wander along, things happen to you. You go down a street, and then you go down another street. I always think of myself as a novelist. I have always said Voltaire's Bastards is a novel, and The Doubter's Companion is one too. They are written like novels. Often things happen to me, and I feel what I have done isn't allowing me to say what I want to say. So instead of continuing, I sort of go off to the side. As part of this life and wandering about in the '80s and '90s, I was seeing things. I was seeing all this money and what it was like and what was happening. I was seeing these dictators and wondering what that all meant. I just had this need to talk about the things that I was seeing and sensing. I wasn't quite sure how it was all fitting together or what the nature of it was. Then I realized what I was doing at the time was thinking a lot about the shape of the novel. All my novels have an organic beginning to them. What power do novels have as agents of social change and commentary?I will give you the president of PEN answer. PEN includes poets, essayists and novelists. People always ask me why PEN matters \u2014 especially the novels. I tell them that it's really strange \u2014 as a writer's organization, we don't have any guns or tanks or an army. We don't control any banks or TV and radio stations. We have no element of recognizable power. We are nothing and we have nothing. Given that, why is it that there are currently about 850 writers in jail? Why are they in jail if the word is not so powerful? The word, obviously, frightens some people. The novel is the successor to storytellers. The storytelling tradition, which we happen to call the novelist at the moment, has a very particular power. I think that the novel on paper, or perhaps on a machine, has a power that nothing else has. A good novel is like a world into which the reader can go and is totally free to do with what they want. But you don't tell the reader what to think \u2014 they are thinking for themselves. They are totally in control of their lives when they are reading. I think the novel still has that power. What is it about black comedy that makes it so difficult to translate into writing?I think it's because black comedy is not slapstick or baroque. It's deadly serious \u2014 which is what makes it so funny. There is a kind of meanness and un-forgivingness. There is no moral redemption. Things are what they are. The past 30 years has been much more about slapstick and romantic comedy. Film has done better in some ways at black comedy. But it's not allowed to have the Hollywood ending.

I was always dancing, singing and being a fool, \" Julian says. \"There are videos of me singing at four years old, singing Janet Jackson and dancing around my front lawn. \" \"You could tell he always wanted to be a star, \" Julian's older sister Salena Perrotte says. But to get on the path to stardom, Julian knew he needed to leave the private school he attended as a child, a place where he felt very sheltered. It was when he switched over to Crescent Heights High School that Julian was able to join after-school dance programs to practice dance. \"If I didn't get to go to public school I wouldn't having started dancing, \" says Julian. \"Everybody was so narrow-minded, but I guess it was because they didn't know any better. \" Julian's dance teacher Michelle Bee-Williams says, \"Marcus would come to the dance studio at lunch and after school and work at ballet to improve his flexibility and technique and repeat movement sequences to perfection. \"It was evident how musical Marcus was in his dancing, \" Bee-Williams says. \"He began to create his own movement phrases and develop his ideas and feelings through movement. \" Julian went on to attend a dance program in Vancouver. That's where he got the opportunity to train with a Los Angeles-based choreographer, something that eventually pushed him to move to the City of Angels just after he graduated high school in 2010. Knowing that the entertainment business was huge in Los Angeles, Julian went there really want - ing to know what it was all about. He started work - ing on his music in July 2012. \"I never imagined that it would happen so fast, I've always been a very determined, creative person but I didn't know it was going to happen so fast because there is so much rejection in the music industry, \" Julian says. As a backup dancer, Julian says being on set in Los Angeles with a lot of artists made him even more motivated. \"I can dance every day of my life but I want to be the centre of attention, \" Julian says. \"I didn't want to be the person dancing for some - body. I wanted people dancing for me. \" Even though Julian was not signed to any record - ing label he was determined to get his music out for the world to hear, finding his own producer and video director to put together Here I Am. Julian wanted his single \"to be able to be played in a club, but at the same time played on the ra - dio. There are so many good club hits that can't be played on the radio because it's not a song you can sing to, \" he says. \"I'm not aiming my music towards a certain kind of person, \" Julian says. \"From dancers to a punk to a rocker, I want everyone to connect to my music. \" Julian says Here I Am is about him being unable to complete his goals after getting out of a rela - tionship. Julian started writing this song near the end of the relationship and finished it after breaking up. \"It was basically my release to let go of the rela- tionship, \" Julian says. Singer and dancer Marcus Julian will soon be coming to a television screen near you. His first music video is scheduled to be aired on MuchMusic.

'LITERALLY' Conan the literary bacterium Poet Christian B\u00f6k attempts to turn most 'unkillable' organism on the planet into space's first poet laureate It's hard to imagine the world five billion years from now. Will the human race evolve into extraterrestrials and escape into cyber space after the Sun vaporizes the Earth? Or will things be as they are now, only with flying cars and clones? Any outcome is impossible to accurately predict. But there is one sure thing: Christian B\u00f6k, poet and professor at the University of Calgary, has found a way - with the help of 'Conan the Bacterium' - to preserve his writing, even if the Earth is to face an eventual apocalypse. B\u00f6k has spent a tiring 12 years in and out of laboratories putting the finishing touches on the Xenotext Experiment. It's a project that will see him compose a poem, translate it into a gene sequence and implant it into a target organism. Simply put, B\u00f6k said the end goal of his project is to \"engineer a bacterium so it becomes a du- rable archive for storing a poem. \" MiCrobe Marathon With a PhD in English literature, B\u00f6k has entered an \"intellectual marathon\" to acquire enough scientific knowledge to put his Spielberg-esque project to prac - tice. \"I had to teach myself a suf - ficient amount of biochemistry, proteomics and genetics so I could acquire the re - sources necessary to fulfill this project, \" B\u00f6k said. \"It turned out to be a lot more challenging than I'd ever anticipated. \" B\u00f6k has also had to buddy up with Deinococ - cus Radiodurans, the organism he hopes to be the receiver of his poem. Also known as 'Conan the Bacterium, ' this par - ticular organism is only 0.0035 mm in size and is classified as an \"extremophile. \" Able to withstand the most extreme conditions, it goes shirtless in intense cold, dances in scorching heat and swims freely in the open vacuum of outer space. \"It's a surreal organism, \" B\u00f6k said. \"Widely re - garded as one of the most un-killable things on the planet, it can even survive a thousand times the dosage of gamma radiation that would instantly kill a human being. \" Deinococcus Radiodurans, which under a micro - scope looks like four pomegranate seeds stuck to -gether in a tetrad fashion, was first noticed in 1956 by Oregon State University microbiology professor Arthur W. Anderson \u2014 according to a web page maintained by Cornell University's microbiology department. Discovering its resistance to radiation, scientists have hypothesized where this indestructible spec - imen came from: in a 2011 article published in the academic journal Astrobiology, researchers went as far as suggesting the source was \"interplanetary transfer of viable micro-organisms. \" In other words, organisms like Deinococcus Ra - diodurans could have arrived on Earth from hy - pothesized homes such as Mars or Jupiter's moon Europa. Because of its Conan-like strength, in 1999 re - search biologists at NASA speculated it could be a sustainable search tool for other life forms on Mars. This bacterium \"lives everywhere and nowhere, \" having been found in uncommon environments ranging from elephant feces to dry Antarctica val - leys. A more earthy application idea put forth by the Biomimicry Institute, was to use it to \"rapidly decompose undesirable environmental contami - nants\" \u2014 possibly a new form of cancer treatment. Or as B\u00f6k hopes, Deinococcus Radiodurans might just be an or - ganic time capsule to blast away into the future. Message in a b ottle While these theories have not yet been put into practice, B\u00f6k is one of the few experiment - ers who has followed his own endeavor through to the end. Pak Wong \u2014 who successful - ly stored the lyrics of It's a Small World in a strand of 'Conan the Bacterium's' DNA \u2014 and multime - dia artist Eduardo Kac who once said \"biological processes are now writerly, \" are two of the many inspirations for B\u00f6k's own formidable project. B\u00f6k's goal is to take his project one step further by implanting his poem into an organism, then attempting to \"get the organism to respond to the actual presence of the poem. \" \"I would write the poem in such a way that the organism would actually be able to read it, and interpret the gene as a set of instructions for building a protein, \" B\u00f6k explained. \"According to my original chemical alphabet, the resulting protein would itself encipher a to - tally different, but meaningful poem. \" Twelve years and $120,000 in grants later, B\u00f6k is nearing the end stages of the Xenotext proj - ect, currently collaborating with the University of Wyoming in his final attempts to write a poem \"that lasts forever. \"By putting my poem in this bacterium, I would effectively be writing a book that could conceiv - ably outlast terrestrial civilization, \" B\u00f6k said with some well-articulated enthusiasm. \"It might even be on the Earth when the Sun explodes. If thrown into space, it will be like a 'secret message in a bottle. ' \"If all goes well, I should have a draft sample of this organism, I hope, by the end of the spring, \" B\u00f6k said. \"But if not, then I'm in trouble. \" B\u00f6k says his poem \"will last forever,\" potentially surviving a worldwide apoca-lypse.

If I roll my ankle once during a perfor - mance, it will be bad. \" Haggis, as a lingerie-clad Frank-N-Furter, will be one of the actors in The Rocky Horror Show running at Mount Royal University from March 28 to April 6. With a cast of 29, the show will be the largest performance staged at Mount Royal since 1999. S H ow c H o S en to gene Ra te inte R e S t Doug Rathbun, an MRU faculty member and the coordinator of the university's theatre program, says Rocky Horror was chosen to help move the program's production company \u2014 Theatre MRU \u2014 more into the public eye. \"We decided to do something that would have some real audience appeal to it, \" Rathbun, who is also the show's production manager, says. \"We want to make people aware of what our theatre students are capable of. Rathbun says Rocky Horror was also chosen to in - volve the company's students in a large, multi-fac - eted production. The shows will involve live music performed by students enrolled in the university's music performance diploma program. \"This will be an opportunity to get the jazz pro - gram involved in the theatre company, which we have been trying to do for a number of years, \" Rath - bun says. Fi RS t-yea R a cting S t U dent S S tep U p Twenty-year-old Haggis is one of only three first- year students selected to play a main character. He says that he is both \"honoured and excited\" to play the part of the mad scientist Frank-N-Furter \u2014 a role played by Tim Curry in the 1975 cult classic movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show. \"I have always leaned more towards the over-the- top villain, jazzy-type characters. They are more fun to play, \" Haggis says. \"Frank-N-Furter is very over- the-top. But he has insecurities and is very lonely inside. It's a crazy role, but I am very excited to find out more about him through the process. \" Second-year acting student Nathan Illes, mean- while, says he is looking forward to the opportunity to take part in the largest production of his career. \"We do so much smaller scale studio work, with minimal to no props and costumes. So it's nice to have the contrasts of doing a full-scale production, \" Illes says. \"It's a nice change. \" ac to RS S t R ive to Make Role S t H ei R o wn As actors in a show that has built up a cult following and attracts fans who have memorized every line of the movie (see Rocky Horror rituals p. 33), both actors are working to make the roles their own. Haggis says that while he wants to do \"justice\" to the role of Frank-N-Further, he also doesn't want to simply mold it to Curry's famous adaptation. \"I want to let the character be authentic, real and to let him be the one whom everybody knows, \" Haggis says. \"But at the same time, I want bring myself into it and put my own twist on it too. \" Illes faces a similar challenge playing Eddie, a role played in the movie by singer Meat Loaf. Illes says he believes the tendency for Rocky Horror au- diences to become highly involved with the show will play a part in how he frames the character. \"A live show is very different from what the movie is. I have never had the experience before where an audience is throwing stuff at me as I am trying to perform, \" Illes says. \"I think that I will feed off that energy and it will empower my own performance. \" Rocky newbie S enc o URa ged to attend Illes says Rocky Horror is \"a very non-elitist\" show that welcomes all. \"There is going to be a very posi- tive environment and vibe around the show. So we hope that people want share in that, \" he says. Haggis says those who haven't seen Rocky Horror before shouldn't be discouraged or intimidated. \"Just come out and have a good time. If you like rock and roll music from the '70s and jazz music and horror films, you should come and see it, \" he says. \"Its such a huge, over-the-top and out there story. The audience can get lost in that and give themselves over to absolute pleasure. \" The show's run will include two midnight per - formances (March 30 and April 6). Tickets can be reserved by calling 403-440-8889. Tickets are held to be paid for at the box office. All tickets must be picked up at least 15 minutes prior to a show's opening.

Add that he's eagerly awaiting a chance to throw toast in the air, and it's a pretty good recipe for confusion. When Mount Royal University's live production of The Rocky Horror Show opens March 28 it will provide not only this, but a plethora of other tradi - tions practiced in lipstick and lingerie. Film and T H eaTR e Rocky Horror traditions are quite elaborate. Things are thrown, shouted, and without the timely use of a newspaper, can get a little wet. Since its 1975 debut, The Rocky Horror fan base has grown immensely. Whether on screen or per - formed live, attendees often dress as Rocky char - acters and in certain scenes, throw rice, confetti or toast. Limiting some participation elements, though, is the fact they won't bounce off an actor like they would a movie screen. Understanding what crowd interaction means to fans, Mount Royal is developing participation kits with guides on props and vocal cues. \"We know any time you do a stage presenta - tion, there's going to be some kind of interaction, \" says Doug Rathbun, theatre program co-ordinator at Mount Royal. \"So we're providing the audience with rice, confetti, newspapers, foam rubber toast and things like that. \" Rathbun says that some of the more profane callbacks \u2014 referring to common phrases audi - ences shout \u2014 won't be permitted. But he says that the production is still not for children due to the show's adult themes. T H e Ri T uals Leah Nicholson, a University of Calgary graduate with a B.A. in film studies, has seen Rocky Horror on stage and screen more than 25 times \u2014 in - cluding a performance in Scotland's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. \"How people participate can change from lo - cation to location, \" says Nicholson. \"Sometimes, every time Janet (played in film by Susan Saran- don) comes up on screen, people will yell 'slut' without fail. Other times, people are only into the really popular moments. \" Nicholson points to the callback, \"Say it, say it, \" as common in the Rocky Horror community, referring to Frank-N-Furter's (played in film by Tim Curry) suspenseful pause in the delivery of the word \"anticipation. \" Frank-N-Furter: \"I see you shiver \" ...pation\" Vi Rgin Hazing \"Virgin, \" a term coined by Rocky Horror diehards, de - scribes first-time audience members. Virgin rituals are meant to integrate newcomers into the Rocky Horror community. However, Nicholson says virgin hazing is not meant to embarrass or turn anyone off of the ex - citement. \"It's really a good thing for everyone. If you don't know what's happening, people will be telling you, 'This is the part where we do this!' It's a way for you to be welcomed into a really inviting community. \"Aedan Tomney, a film and video production stu- dent at SAIT, plans to attend the show. Tomney saw the film for the first time in late January and says he's open to participating. \"If you're going, you're sort of already into the show. At that point, you should know what to expect be - cause it has such a cult following, \" Tomney says. Rice and a wedding After the movie's opening credits, audiences gen - erally celebrate with on-screen wedding guests by throwing rice as newlyweds Betty and Ralph exit the church. This scene introduces audiences to Janet and Brad, each of whom can trigger risqu\u00e9 vocal cues from Rocky fans. Whether these particular cues are appropriate, or not, will be in Mount Royal's guide. T H e n ewspape R In another scene, as Janet uses a newspaper to shield herself from a downpour, audiences often do likewise. In some theatres, patrons recreate the rain with water guns. This early scene may allow newcomers to par - ticipate in a simpler way, as some interactive ele - ments - like the infamous \"Time Warp\" scene - can seem daunting. Not all virgins keep it simple, however. The year she graduated from high school, Nicholson con- vinced former members of the St. Francis football team to attend a screening at Kensington's Plaza Theatre. \"They went all out, \" Nicholson says of the ath - letes. \"They put on the fishnet pantyhose, corsets, and wigs. It was awesome and they were totally into it. \" 'w i TH a swi Tc H blade kni F e' In a scene involving party hats and cannibalism, audiences throw toast in the air at the line \"A toast to absent friends\" \u2014 a nod to Eddie, a character who becomes the evening's main course. \"Rocky Horror fans generally understand why throwing toast is sometimes taken out of a live performance, \" Nicholson says, referring to how it can put actors at physical risk.However, Mount Royal has opted to keep this in the show by mak - ing the toast out of foam rubber. wH aT TH e TRadi T ions mean Nicholson says the audience traditions invite people to feel like part of a community. \"The saying goes 'Tonight, somewhere in the world, there will be a midnight showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, '\" she says. \"People are curious if they've never been, and super into it if they have. No matter where you are, there's going to be this thing you have and can share with people. \" Leah Nicholson has seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show more than 25 times on two continents. photo by Justin Wilson/calgary Journal \"We know any time you do a stage presentation, there's going to be some kind of interaction.\" Doug rathbu N, theatre program co-ordinator Cal gary J ournal. Ca M ar 2013 29Cal gary artsgame changer Calgary Roller Derby Association moves up League seeks tougher competition and higher skill The Calgary Roller Derby Association was accepted into the Women's Flat Track Derby Association's apprentice program at the end of January, making them the only WFTDA league in Alberta. \"The teams at the WFTDA tournaments are the super high-level teams that we aspire to be, \" said Tania Martinez-Hepburn, who has skated with the CRDA for six years. \"Those are the top-level players, they're amazing. \" WFTDA is the international governing body for women's flat track roller derby. It serves to bring member leagues together for tournaments and standardizes the rules and guidelines for the sport. Joining the association is a big step for the CRDA because it legitimizes their league and gives them the opportunity to increase their skill and raise their profile on an international level. Be Coming full mem B e R s The apprentice program is a stepping-stone to full membership that allows WFTDA to mentor leagues through the requirements to become full mem - bers. The requirements include rules such as being 51 per cent owned by league skaters, governing with democratic principles and having at least 14 skaters who are skating twice or more per week, according to WFTDA's official website. Martinez-Hepburn, who skates under the derby name of Mamasita Muerte, said that because the CRDA has been an established league for six years, they have already met almost all of the require - ments. The only thing currently standing between them and full WFTDA membership is that they must host two games with member leagues. \"Our goal is to do it within six months but it might take a year, it really depends on other member leagues and who we can get to come out to play, \" Martinez-Hepburn said. She added that the nearest Canadian full-member league is the Terminal City Rollergirls in Vancouver, but also said that coordinating matches can be dif- ficult due to the distance. \"We've experienced that from the beginning, \" Martinez-Hepburn said. \"We were one of the first leagues around in western Canada, so we didn't have that many leagues to play against. Now we have a lot of leagues to play against, but only a few apprentice or full member leagues. So we're kind of in the same boat again. \" RA ising the B AR Christianne Aussant, who is known as Sin-E-Star on the track, joined the CRDA in September when she moved to Calgary from the Kitchener-Waterloo area in Ontario. She used to skate for the Tri-City Roller Girls, who have been full WFTDA members for three years now. \"In terms of just skill level per skater, I would say that the CRDA is on par with other WFTDA leagues, \" Aussant said, adding that one area where the league was lacking was their cohesion and team - work, but they have greatly improved over the last several months. \"When you start to play against much more competitive teams, you very quickly realize that you need all of your players on the track doing the same thing and you can no longer rely on the 'rock stars, '\" Aussant said. i t's A R e A l spo R t The slogan on WFTDA's website reads, \"Real. Strong. Athletic. Revolutionary. \" It directly addresses some of the many misconceptions people still have about roller derby, primarily that it is not a real sport. Martinez-Hepburn said that back in the '70s and '80s a lot of roller derby was scripted and staged, and it was more entertainment than anything else. But, since the current revival began, things have changed. \"The new roller derby is absolutely 100 per cent a sport, \" Martinez-Hepburn said. \"It's not scripted, everything's real, we train three to four times per week, and we pay to play. \"The girls who do this are 150 per cent commit - ted to getting stronger, faster, hitting harder and learning the game, because it's not an easy game to learn, \" she said. \"There's a lot of strategy and skill involved in playing roller derby. \" Aussant noted that roller derby is also an ex - tremely physically demanding sport, and it is im - portant to the CRDA to make sure everyone gets proper training in the fundamentals so they don't get injured. \"People join and they just want to play games and hit girls and have fun, but very quickly they realize the level of fitness you need to do that, and to do it safely, \" Aussant said. Despite the tremendous effort required to stay safe and build skill, roller derby is still a lot of fun. Martinez-Hepburn said there are two leagues in Calgary, one women's and one co-ed, and every - one should check them out because it is \"such an amazing sport. \" \"I love it, \" she said. \"It has consumed my life, but in a good way. \"ra chae L F reY r frey@cjournal.ca The CRDA All Stars faced off against the Kootenay Kannibelles in August.

She is a four-time Olympic medalist, three of those coming from gold medal victories. She has also captured 11 medals playing in the IIHF World Women's Hockey Championships. Sports Illustrated named her one of the \"toughest\" athletes in the world in 2006. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2011, and has even played in a men's professional hockey league in Finland. Hayley Wickenheiser has put together a long list of accomplishments. Now 34, she's adding dominating the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) league to her resume. As a member of the University of Calgary Di - nos, Wickenheiser has put up 43 points in 22 games played. This places her third overall in the league, having racked up 16 goals and 27 assists. She also has a plus 46 rating to lead CIS wom- en's hockey players. This shows that she plays great defensively, and doesn't just put up points. But it begs the question: should a player with so much hockey experience and career success be playing in a university league? WHY SHE BELONGS \"Those who say I should be in a different league show more about the lack of respect people have for CIS, \" says Wickenheiser, who has been playing in the league for three years. \"Me playing here should say to people that I have enough respect to play in this league and it's a good level of com - petition. \" Current CIS eligibility rules allow a student to play a school sport for five years \u2014 there is no age limit. Wickenheiser adds: \"The challenge for me in this league is to figure out how to make my team - mates better and try to make the team success-ful. It's the hardest hockey I have ever played. \" Wickenheiser and her Dinos teammates placed second overall in the CIS league, finishing the season with a 23-4-1 record. Dinos head coach Danielle Goyette says having a player like Wickenheiser helps to develop CIS women's hockey \u2014 and attracts more high-end players to the league. Every time you are at the top of your sport, your job is to develop and make those players and teams around you better, \" says Goyette, a former Olympic teammate of Wickenheiser. Stephanie Zvonkovic, a 19-year-old current teammate of Wickenheiser's, says she sees no harm in the hockey star playing at the univer - sity level. \"She is an amazing teammate and we obvi - ously learn a lot from her, \" Zvonkovic says. \"She pushes us to be better, and we push back. \" Chrissy Hodgson of the Mount Royal Univer - sity Cougars says she believes all is fair for the veteran hockey player.\"Good for her for staying competitive for so long, \" Hodgson says. \"Ultimately, she is the face of women's hockey. Most girls are excited to get the chance to compete against her. \" \"Sure it gives them an advantage, but every - one in the league knows U of C is beatable even when Wick is on the ice, \" Hodgson says. \"We just have to compete harder against a player like her. \" LIKE EVERYONE ELSE Wickenheiser is currently a kinesiology student at the U of C, and she says that she doesn't see her age or experience as an issue when it comes to playing hockey while being a student. \"My life is no different than any other student athlete, \" she says. \"I have to take courses and handle the load just like everyone else. \" Zvonkovic says she agrees that Wickenheiser is just like every other student athlete, and adds that it's not like she has the luxury of just play - ing hockey. \"She needs somewhere to play, \" Zvonkovic says. \"I think anyone who is going to school and can play for a CIS team should, no matter what age. \" The next step for the Dinos star and her team - mates will be the 2012-2013 playoffs to defend last year's championship. Playoffs begin Feb. 22.At the age of 34, Wickenheiser (number 22) says she still has a huge love for hockey and still tries to get better as a player every game.

All ath- letes bruise. All athletes break eventually. But not all athletes are paid the same. While players in the four major North American leagues make mil- lions, those in smaller leagues, such as the Canadian Football League and the National Lacrosse League, get paid significantly less. According to experts, there's very little they will be able to do about it \u2014 although it seems some players are willing to accept it. An analysis conducted by the Calgary Journal reveals NLL players earned an average salary that was 120 times ($19,672/year) smaller than an NHL player ($2.4 million/year) in 2012. However, the NHL players play over five times more games than NLL players. As a result, most professional la - crosse players work a second job. In the CFL, some players do as well. While the league doesn't dis - close salary information, a Global News report in 2012 estimated the average CFL salary is somewhere around $80,000/year. In most industries, that is a re -spectable income. But in the world of professional sports, it's peanuts. NFL players averaged 23 times more ($1.9 million/year.) To illustrate the gap, the Mon - treal Gazette reported that the $40 million that New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees made in 2012 was more than all CFL players combined. Part of the reason why the wage discrepancies won't change is sim - ply because leagues such as the CFL and NLL just aren't popular enough. \"You can compare it to Holly - wood, \" Robert Baker, the director of the Center for Sport Management at George Mason University, said. \"The actors whose movies get more people in the seats make more than those actors who don't, \" Baker continued, \"the same thing is happening with athletes. \" According to ESPN, the aver - age NHL attendance in 2012 was 17,456. The NLL's average was 9,469, according to Sports Business Daily. The same can be said when com- paring the CFL with the NFL. Ac - cording to an independent CFL da- tabase, CFLDB, Canadian stadiums brought in an average of 28,192 fans per game, whereas the NFL draw an average crowd of 67,578 to its stadiums, according to ESPN. And while getting people in the seats, sponsorship and mer - chandising revenue are important, Baker contends that sport revenue \"begins and ends with television generated revenue. \" That's why Calgary Roughneck's Geoff Snider encourages players to treat the game more seriously. \"We need people to get out and see how entertaining our sport is, \" Snider said, \"and conversely the players need to treat it more pro - fessionally. \" Snider, whose second income is generated from Elev8 Lacrosse, the lacrosse development program he founded, believes that will eventu-ally help lacrosse salaries to go up. But there's a risk that players may push for pay increases too soon. If too much pressure is put on the owners to raise salaries before rev- enues go up, they run the risk of the league shutting down all together. \"You need a progressive owner who is dedicated to the sport and very willing to increase their mar - kets and increase their popularity, \" Baker said. \"Then more revenue will be generated with sponsorships, with exposure on local television \u2014 then eventually with a television contract, both on a regional and national level. That's when you'll see salaries start to go up. \" But some players don't see any problem with the way things are. \"I don't think anyone's being exploited because there's always the oppor tunity to do something else, \" said Mike Abou-Mechrek, a CFL player. \"If you're a 23 year-old that has the opportunity to make $45,000 in five months playing football, or making x amount of dollars doing something else in an office, that's your decision to make. No one forces you to play football. \" Abou-Mechrek, who won a Grey Cup now works as a financial plan- ner for Investors Group in Regina. He sees the wage gap from a more objective point of view. \"If you play in the NFL, you de - serve to make every cent that you're making, because that's big busi - ness\" he said. \"If the owners were making billions up in the CFL, you'd see the players adding at least a zero to the end of their salary, but it's not there yet. \" For Geo FF Snider, lacro SS e iS n't hi S 9-to-5 job. From the moment he wakes up in the morning until the moment he goes to bed, it's all lacrosse \u2014 all the time. If Snider isn't playing or practicing, he is likely coaching and mentoring youth through his own lacrosse program Elev8 Lacrosse. \"I don't get a lot of free time, but it's fun and I'm fortunate enough to get to work in the sport that I love, \" Snider said, who estimates he can work up to 60 hours a week. But Snider hasn't always been able to make a fulltime commitment to lacrosse. Before starting Elev8 Lacrosse in 2007, Snider was playing in Philadelphia and held a job in real estate. \"Playing on the weekends, while working a full time job was incredibly tough. \" After negotiating a new contract with the Philadelphia Wings, his pay was enough that he was able to leave real estate to pursue la-crosse full time. But shortly after signing, Snider felt that he had too much free time and wanted to put his expertise to good use. With the help of his brother, Elev8 Lacrosse was born. Snider's goal is to not only make kids better lacrosse players, but to also make them better citizens. \"I got a little tired of the 'lax bro' mentality, where players would chew tobacco and cut their hair into mullets. \" At 31, Snider recognizes that his NLL career won't last forever \u2014 but Elev8 is here to stay. \"I'll address retirement when my body decides to quit on me. But you're going to have to drag me kicking and screaming from the game. \" \u2014 MAX SHILLETOGeoFF Snider, lacrosse entrepreneur INCOME INEQUALITY Discrepancy in wages between some professional sports leagues is enormous, but is it fair?

In 23-year-old transition player Travis Cornwall's case, he plans on using his re - cently earned mathematics degree from Simon Fraser University to become a math teacher. \"I'm going to take the next year or year- and-a-half off and go back to school for teacher's college, \" Cornwall said. \"And then once I'm done that year, I'll start teaching. I'll probably substitute teach, but as soon as I'm done playing I'd like to be a full-time teacher. \" Cornwall also works with teammate An - drew McBride teaching kids about lacrosse, nutrition and staying active. McBride, who has played the past two years with Cornwall, said he believes Corn-wall will make a good teacher. \"He's great with the kids\" McBride said. \"He not only talks about lacrosse but he talks about other areas of their life, like school and things they like. To be able to engage the kids and get the best out of the kids is what you want. Whenever you can do that, the kids can open up to you and enjoy the process. \" Cornwall, who moved to Calgary in Janu - ary, said he plans to focus on lacrosse and get more involved in the community. McBride is excited that Cornwall, like oth- er Roughneck players, has made the move to Calgary for the season. \"It shows a lot of his commitment to the organization and city by moving to Calgary, and we're lucky to have him here\" McBride said. \u2014 NEIL HILTSlIke other members of the Calgary Roughnecks, all-star forward Jeff Shattler doesn't just have to balance his work on the team with his family life. He also has to balance his work on the team with his work off-the-field as a glass installer. The key, Shattler says, is having people who support him and understand lacrosse is his biggest passion. During the week, he tries to spend as much of his time as possible with his little girl. The rest of the time, Shattler works for Ferguson Glass performing mostly outside glass installations on buildings in downtown Calgary. The company is flexible with Shattler's schedule, allowing him the time he needs to keep up with his lacrosse obligations.Having a boss who understands his com- mitments to lacrosse is a help, especially af- ter some of those more physical games on the weekends where the sport can take a toll. \"I think it's really key for guys to get good bosses that understand our commitment to our sport, and the travel, and how our bod-ies feel. \"He's done that, he's really taken good care of me over the years, \" Shattler says. That care has allowed him to continue to train and play with his teammates, whom he considers a second family. In fact, the word family is emblazoned on the shirts Roughnecks players wear during shoot-a-rounds. \"Obviously your family comes first, but in the back of your mind you know that you have to put lacrosse at the top on weekends. \" \u2014 GEOFF CRANEmost profess Ional athletes are focused on their opponents. But because he doesn't make enough money playing lacrosse, Scott Carnegie divides his focus between his opponents and public safety. Carnegie, who plays defence for the Cal- gary Roughnecks, is also a paid on-call fire - fighter for Rocky View County Fire Services. \"The National Lacrosse League is kind of a part-time league. Obviously the salaries aren't enough to maintain a living and sup - port your family, \" Carnegie said. He explained that while players in the NLL are high-level athletes, most have their own full-time job or school elsewhere and consider lacrosse to be more of their part- time job. Carnegie said, \"Generally in a week, I'll work two 24-hour shifts with the fire de - partment, \" where he can work up to 120 hours a month \u2014 almost a full-time job. Despite that heavy workload, being a firefighter is something Carnegie enjoys as much as lacrosse. \"There is also a lot of fulfillment involved in the job because you get to help people. \" When asked which job takes more out of him physically, Carnegie said, \"We can be pretty banged up after games and it will take a day or two to recover. But working a 24-hour shift can be pretty demanding on a person as well. \" But, despite having a life that would make the average person exhausted, Carnegie still loves every minute of suiting up along - side his Roughneck teammates. \"I love Lacrosse and that's why I do it. It's not for the money, obviously. I can't think of a time when I didn't want to play. \" \u2014 I AN E S p LEN traVIs CornWall, MATH TEACHER-IN-TRAINING J eff shattler, FAMILY MAN AND GLASS INSTALLERs C ott C arneg I e , ON-CALL FIREFIGHTER pHOTO BY MATT LAURIN/CALGARY pHOTO BY IAN ESpLEN/CALGARY JOURNALpHOTO BY IAN ESpLEN/CALGARY JOURNALpopularity contest Cross-border competition Canadian and American football coaches cite funding, attendance and youth growth as reasons why U.S. trumps neil Hilts nhilts@cjournal .caWatching a college football game in the United States is a much differ - ent experience than watching one in Canada. Americans flock to the stadium or the TV to watch games. It's like the whole town stops, says Simon Fraser University's head football coach Dave Johnson. \"Football is a religion, \" Johnson said. His school competes in the NCAA Division II, play - ing American schools in smaller towns, and he says that while \"It's not as crazy as what you would find in Alabama where they get 100,000 fans, when we go into a town to play, the entire city shuts down. \" ATTENDANCE Blaine Bennett, head coach of the Central Wash - ington University Wildcats, said that students see watching football games as part of the overall col- lege experience. \"Our campus has about 10,000 students, \" Bennett said. \"It's a small campus with 10,000 kids in a town of 20,000. Being on campus and watching the foot - ball game is something they do look forward to. \" But what could be causing lower interest and at - tendance up north? Canada's cold temperatures might be keeping the fans away, suggested Blake Nill, University of Calgary's head football coach. GROWTH IN CANADA But Nill said the advancement of football in Canada is improving, especially the standard of competi - tion. \"Over the last 20 years, the level of football played in Canada has grown substantially, \" Nill said. \"While the U.S. programs are marketed like no other team in Canada is, the athletes here play very good football. \" Brandon Bridge, quarterback for the University of South Alabama who hails from Mississauga, Ont., said he has seen the rise of football in Canada, but believes the sport will always be overshadowed by hockey.STARTING YOUNG Football is a sport common for kids to join at a young age in the United States, while most Cana- dian players don't start playing until junior high. Arne Ferguson, head coach of the Western Or -egon Wolves, said starting kids in football early leads to better skills. Central Washington's Bennett agreed the grass- roots aspect of the game of football is what really helps put football ahead in the United States. \"I really believe that the whole reason American football talent is so much better is because the tal - ented players get involved in football at an early age and continue to stay strong all the way through high school, \" Bennett said. MONEY Nill pointed out that the American NCAA Division I has a massive amount of money coming in. \"Whenever you go to a U.S. football game or camp, you always see cranes around the football field, \" Nill said. \"That's because they have to keep building infrastructure and buildings to attract recruits. If they attract recruits then they'll get 100,000 at the games, which means lots of money. \" \"The big difference between the U.S. and Canada is in the U.S., college football is a billion dollar in - dustry. A lot of times, when you look at the smaller Division II programs or Division III programs, they're a lot like what you see in Canada. \" SFU's coach Johnson said he believes fans need to watch games more often, but the marketability is not big enough in Canada. \"At the end of the day, people need to buy tickets and put butts in seats. The game is one compo - nent, \" Johnson said. \"The tailgating and being able to buy a T-shirts of your favourite team in Walmart doesn't exist. \" SKILLED PLAYERS Ferguson noted that Canada produces top re - cruits every year for the NCAA, which could lead to growth in the game up north. Nonetheless, the United States has more high- talent players than Canada has schools that play football, according to Johnson. \"There are about 58 high schools in B.C. that play football, \" Johnson said. \"In the state of Wash - ington, there are around 360. \" Bridge, who played his first two years of college football at Alcorn State University in Mississippi, said he believes the talent level is dropping off in Canada. \"Before, there used to be a handful of guys with good talent. Now it's just a certain player here or there, \" Bridge said. However, Calgary's Tyler Winchester, currently a Grade 12 student at Bishop McNally High School, says he'd like to play football in the United States and dispel that notion. \"I've been approached by a couple of Ameri - can schools, but I haven't gotten any offers, \" Win-chester said. \"I do understand the differences between the two countries' games. You can still get offers to go play in the U.S. after playing in Canada, like during the college years here. \" McMahon Stadium, home of the Uof C Dinos and Calgary Stampeders football teams, often attracts small crowds during Canadian Interuniversity Sport games.

But Hartley isn't just a star in four different sports \u2014 he's also one of the school's top academic students. At 5'10\" , 167 pounds, Hartley uses his combination of speed, strength and skill to be a superior competitor in football, basketball, track and field and swimming. Despite the time commitment of playing four sports, he is also an excellent student and a part of the school community. School principal Tom Sullivan has high praise for Hartley. \"Everything that he does, he does well. He takes it seriously. He's humble. He's a hard worker and he's an outstanding role model for our students at Bishop Grandin High School, \" Sullivan said. \"Austen is the type of student who I would call a model student. \" Hartley has taken home a number of awards throughout his time at Bishop Grandin, including male athlete of the year in both grades 10 and 11. However, one of his greatest accomplishments came following this year's football season. The Harry Hood award is given to the student athlete that best combines football ability, com - munity involvement, school participation and academic achievement. After each of Calgary's top high school football teams nominated one player, the award was ultimately given to Hartley. \"It was a pretty big experience, \" Hartley said. \"I think I'm one of three athletes to ever win the award at Bishop Grandin over the years. It was a pretty big honour. \" He's served as captain of his ju - nior basketball and football teams in Grade 10, and is currently captain of the senior boys basketball team. Hartley was also captain of Grandin's senior boys football team this sea - son. Along with being a part of the school's football and basketball programs, Hartley also competes in high school swimming and track and field events. Holowaychuk has served as Hartley's football coach his whole high school career, and has seen Hartley grow and evolve as an athlete, and as a person. \"He would be your high end, this is the kid you want to aspire to be like in high school, \" Holo - waychuk said. \"Athletically for sure, he's a smart kid and he's always involved in the school com - munity. \" No N -athletic iN volveme N t But despite those achievements, academics come before athletics for Hartley. That commitment has given him an academic average of 87 per cent, and 86 per cent in his first two years at Grandin. His academic average is cur - rently 87 per cent while being enrolled in chemis-try, physics and math. On top of all of that, Hartley is an active partici- pant in the school community. He's part of student council, the marketing program and the a water project. The water project's goal is to pro - mote awareness about the lack of clean water in third world countries.
