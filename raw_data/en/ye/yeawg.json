RISK Executive Summary 1 This report represents estimates from the 2011 Arizona BRFSS, a state -wide landline and cellular telephone survey. The data below has been weighted using raking methodology. This summary also provides data on health status indicators, quality of life, health risk behaviors and awareness, clinical preventive practices and health conditions and limitations as reported by Arizonans. Core questions provide information on high -risk behaviors and chronic diseases that are surveyed each year. The optional modules provide information on high -risk behaviors and chro nic diseases that may or may not be surveyed each year. State -added questions supply information on high -risk behaviors. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) program is a rich source of state -level public health data. These data have become integral to health promotion, disease prevention, and intervention planning throughout Arizona .

The Department operates numerous programs, dedicated to the improvement of public health outcomes for all of Arizon a. ADHS Mission To promote, protect , and improve the health and wellness of individuals and communities in Arizona ADHS Vision Health and Wellness for all Arizonans The Arizona Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) provides Arizona with a too l to monitor health status as well as assess public health interventions and programs. To realize the vision of health and wellness for all Arizonans, ADHS utilizes a strategic map (see page 6 ) with five strategic priorities: Impact Arizona's Winnable B attles (Section A) Integration of Physical and Behavioral Health Services (Section B) Promot e and Protect Public Health and Safety (Section C) Strengthen Statewide Public Health System (Section D) Maximize ADHS Effectiveness (Section E) Within these broad strategic priorities, there are key focus elements that accentuate winnable public health battles. The 2011 annual BRFSS report utilizes the ADHS Strate gic Map as one tool to link the data collected to the Department's Strategic direction.1 Backgroun d The BRFSS is a collaborative project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the U. S. and territories. The BRFSS was initiated in 198 2, with 15 states collecting surveillance data on risk behaviors through monthly telephone interviews . Over time, the number of states participating in the survey increased so that by 2001, 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands were participating in the BRFSS. In this document, the term state is used to refer to all areas participating in the surveillance system, including the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. BRFSS field operations are managed by state health departments that follow guidelines provided by the CDC. These health departments participate in developing the survey instrument and conduct the interviews using a random sample telephone survey. The Arizona BRFSS survey is a random digit dialing survey that utilizes a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system and is based on disproportionate sampling strategy.2 BRFSS respondents are identified through telephone -based methods. Telephone coverage varies across states and subgroups. Overall, an estimated 96.3% of U.S. households had telephone service in 2010. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (in a survey conducted between July 2009 and June 2010) 70.6% of Arizona adults older than 18 years use a landline as their primary telephone. These findings indicate that 29.4 % of Arizona households do not have a landline and utilize cell -phones as their primary telephone. The increasing percentage of households that are abandoning their landline telephones for cell -phones has significantly eroded the population coverage provi ded by landline -based surveys to pre -1970s levels. For the first half of 2011, the percentage of cell -phone -only households was 31.6 percent. This is an increase of two percent ( 2%) over the preceding 6 -month period. Introduction 4 Furthermore, i n households where bo th landline and wireless phone service is available, there is a trend toward increased use of wireless communication.3 Due to the increasing utilization of cell -phone communication, Arizona's BRFSS marked 2011 as the first calendar year in which the sur vey collected data for both landline and cell -phone respondents. BRFSS respondents who received 100 percent of their calls on cell -phones were eligible for participation in the cell -phone survey . No direct method of compensating for non - telephone coverag e is employed by the BRFSS. According to the CDC, individuals who participate in cell -phone interviews are more likely to be: younger , renters rather than home - owners, Hispanic and single. The findings also showed differences in attitude and behaviors between cell -phone -only users and those with landline phones. Additionally, telephone surveys have had to make adjustments in weighting to account for declining response rates. The data collected in Arizona are transmitted to the CDC's Office of Surveilla nce, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services . An edited and weighted data file is provided to each participating health department f or each year of data collection, and summary reports of state - specific data are prepared by CDC. In 2011, a new weighting meth odology, iterative proportional fitting (or raking), replaced the post strat ification weighting methodology . Therefore, it is not possible to compare 2011 data with prior's years. Health departments use the data for a variety of purposes, including ident ifying demographic variations in health - related behaviors, targeting services, addressing emergent and critical health issues, proposing legislation for health initiatives and measuring progress toward state and national health objectives.2 BRFSS Question naire The questionnaire consists of three sections: 1. Core component: a standard set of questions asked by all states. It includes queries about current health -related perceptions, conditions and behaviors (e.g., health status, health insurance, diabete s, tobacco use, disability and obesity), as well as demographic questions. 2. Optional CDC modules: these are sets of questions on specific topics (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arthritis, women's health) that states may elect to use on their questionnai res. In 2011, 34 optional modules were supported by CDC. The module questions are generally submitted by CDC programs and have been selected for inclusion in the editing and evaluation process by CDC. The health characteristics estimated from the BRFSS p ertain to the adult population, aged 18 years or older who live in households. In 2011, additional questions were included as optional modules to provide a measure for several childhood indicators , including asthma prevalence and influenza immunization fo r people aged 17 years or younger. For more information, see http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSSModules/ModByState.asp?Yr=2011 . 3. State -added questions: These are questions develop ed or acquired by individual participating states and added to their questionnaires. State -added questions are not edited or evaluated by CDC. Each year, the states and CDC agree on the content of the core component and optional modules. Arizona Departme nt of Health Services programs meet annually with the BRFSS Coordinator and other representatives of interested stakeholders to vote on the optional and state -added questions for the following year. Many questions are taken from established national surve ys, such as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) or the Introduction 5 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) . This practice allows the BRFSS to take advantage of questions that may have previously been tested and allows states to compare the ir data with those from other surveys. Any new questions proposed as additions to the BRFSS must go through cognitive testing and field testing by an Independent Review Board (IRB) , also known as an independent ethics committee or ethical review board , to monitor and review the questions to assure the human subject research poses no risk of physical or psychological harm prior to their inclusion on the survey. In short, BRFSS guidelines specify that all states ask the core component questions without modif ication; they may choose to add any, all or none of the optional modules , and they may add questions of their choosing at the end of the questionnaire. Although CDC supported 34 modules in 2011, it is not feasible for a state to use them all. States are selective about which modules and state -specific questions they add, to ensure the questionnaire is kept at a reasonable length , but there is wide variation across states in the total number of questions in a given year. New questionnaires are implemented in January and usually remain unchanged throughout the year. However, the flexibility of state -added questions does permit additions, changes and deletions at any time during the year. The 2011 list of optional modules used on both the landline and cell -phone surveys is available at http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSSModules/ModByState.asp?Yr=2011 .

Introduction 6 7 HEALTH STATUS INDICATORS 8 General Health 9 Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) questions relating to percei ved physical and mental health and function have developed into an important part of health surveillance and are generally considered valid indicators of service needs and intervention outcomes. Self -assessed health status has proved a more dominant predi ctor of mortality and morbidity than many objective measures of health.6 HRQOL measures make it feasible to scientifically demonstrate the effect quality of life has on health, going well beyond the old paradigm that was restricted to what can be viewed un der a microscope.7 Survey Question: Would you say that in general your health is? Figure 1A . Arizona and National 2011 BRFSS respondents' self -reported physical health status Arizona has a slightly higher reported value in the excellent and good cat egories when compared to the nation as a whole ( Figure 1A ).

General Health 12 General Health 13 General Health 14 General Health 15 16 Quality of L ife 17 Quality of l ife has been established as a key component in medical and public health research.8 This is especially true with chronic diseases, where a cure is unavailable and/or when available places an extra -ordinary cost burden on the individual and the system . Although, research has embraced the use of quality of life as an endpoint, it is difficult to ascertain an individual's quality of life. Quality of life is complex and can encompass a large number of different top ics, variables and situations. Quality of life typically covers three different domains \u2014physical health, mental health and social functioning.9 The 2011 BRFSS asked respondents three questions encompass - ing physical health, mental health and social functioning. Survey Question: Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not goo d? Figure 2A.

However, upon stratification by gender, Arizona men were less likely to report poor health when compared to the nation ( Figur e 2A ). Table 2A indicates that 18.1 % of respondents reported that they had 30 days of poor physical health each month. Some of the highlights of this table include: Men were less likely than women to report 30 days of poor physical health in the past month (17.5%). Adult respondents who were separated or married had the lowest percentage reporting 30 days of poor physical health, at 13.2% and 15.6% respectively.

(See page 6) About one in three adults in the United States has high blood pressure . High blood pressure is called the \"silent killer\" because it often has no warning signs or symptoms, and many p eople don't realize they have it. High blood pressure significantly increases the risk for heart disease and stroke , which are among the top three leading causes of death in the United States.11 The exact causes of h igh blood pressure are unknown.

The reduction of obesity is one of Arizona 's Winnable Battles as o utlined in A1 of the ADHS Strategic M ap. (See page 6) Current estimates show that more than 25 million Americans have type II diabetes, 27 million have a form of chronic heart disease, and 68 million have hyper - tension. Additionally, it is estimated that nearly 800,000 people suffer from a stroke each year. These conditions have one thing in common: obesity is a risk factor. Furthermore, one in three cancer -related deaths can also be attributed to obesity.13 Obesity has attained epidemic magnitude in the United States, where it has more than doubled in the past two decades. People who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis -related disabilities and some cancers.14 Using data from 2011 as a baseline to achieve the Health y People 2020 goal , Arizona needs to see a reduction of 10%, setting a goal of reducing obesity levels to 22.6%.15 The body mass index (BMI) is the relationship between weight and height and is used to determine obesity and assess health risk. BMI is calculated u sing the following formula: (pounds * 0.454) \u00f7 (inches * 0.0254)\u00b2 or (Kg/M\u00b2). 2011 Arizona Obesity Burden (HCUP) Number of Discharges Aggregate Cost Diabetes Burden 7,065 $167,815,464 Hypertension Burden 2,429 About how much do you weigh without shoes?

Obesity 53 Obesity 54 Obesity 55 Obesity 56 Diabetes 57 Currently, more than 17 million Americans have diabet es, and over 200,000 people die each year of related complications. Diabetes can cause heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, leg and foot amputations, pregnancy comp - lications , and death s related to flu and pneumonia. Particularly at risk are the 5.9 million Americans who are unaware that they have the disease.16 Early detection, improved delivery of care and better self -management are key strategies for preventing much of the burden of diabetes. Type II diabetes, formerly considered adult onset diabetes, is now being diagnosed more frequently among children and adolescents. This type of diabetes is linked to two modifiable risk factors: obesity and physical inactivity.17 The hormones which appear during pregnancy can cause glucose into lerance. This is known as Gestational Diabetes. It typically goes away after childbirth.18 Therefore, individuals who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes are not categorized as diabetics in the following analysis. 2011 Arizona Diabetes Burden (HCU P) Number of Discharges Aggregate Cost Individuals with multiple chronic conditions 1,040 $43,898,957 Individuals with a chronic condition 3,774 $85,730,739 Individuals without another chronic condition 2,251 $38,185,768 Total 7,065 $167,815,464 Survey Question: Have you EVER been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?

It m ay feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in the chest. The pain may also occur in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back, and it may feel like indigestion. Angina is a sym ptom of coronary heart disease. Angina may be stable or un - stable. Stable angina i s chest pain that occurs on physical exertion or under mental or emotional stress. Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs even while at rest, without apparent reason. Acute Coronary Syndrome is a term that is sometimes used to describe people who eith er have an acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina.22 2011 Arizona Arteriosclerosis Burden (HCUP) Number of Discharges Aggregate Cost Individuals with multiple chronic conditions 141 $3,747,164 Individuals without another chronic condition 1,204 $21,482,451 Total 1,345 $25,229,615 2011 Arizona By Pass Burden Number of Discharges Aggregate Cost Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty chronic conditions 91 $21,621,840 Percutaneous transluminal coronary angio plasty without multiple chronic conditions 70 $12,896,696 Cardiac catheterization with multiple chronic conditions 792 $168,317,120 Cardiac catheterization without multiple chronic conditions 972 $150,996,815 Without cardiac catheterization with multipl e chronic conditions 456 $74,729,555 Without cardiac catheterization without multiple chronic conditions 976 $109,970,082 Total 3,357 $538,532,108 Survey Question: Has a doctor, nurse, or other Health Professional ever told you that you had angina or c oronary heart disease?

Cardiovascular Disease -Stroke 89 Cardiovascular Disease -Stroke 90 Cardiovascular Disease -Stroke 91 Cardiovascular Disease -Stroke 92 Asthma 93 Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by episodes or attacks of impaired breathing. Symptoms are caused by inflammation and narrowing of small airways and may include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest pain. Disease se verity ranges from mild with occasional symptoms to severe with persistent symptoms that impact quality of life. However, even people with mild disease may suffer severe attacks. Common attack triggers include airway irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke and air pollution), allergens, respiratory infect - ions, stress and exercise. 24 According to CDC latest findings, in 2009, 25 million persons in the United States reported having asthma during their lifetimes. The number of people diagnosed with asthma grew by 4.3 million from 2001 to 2009. Asthma costs in the U .S. grew from about $53 billion in 2002 to about $56 billion in 2007, about a 6% increase. Greater access to medical care is needed for the growing number of people with asthma.25 Asthma was linked to 3 ,447 deaths ( about 9 deaths per day) in 2007. Asthma is a complicated disease that requires long -term and multifaceted study and treatment. This includes educating, treating and providing continuing medical care and monitoring for people with asthma, as well as changing behaviors that lead to asthma or exacerbate it (such as smoking) , and eliminating or avoiding triggers.26 The CDC Vital Signs 2011 report shows one in 12 people have asthma and the number is growing. Asthma costs the United States $56 bi llion yearly in medical costs, lost school and work days , and early deaths.27 Survey Question: Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had asthma?

Asthma 95 Asthma 96 Asthma 97 Asthma 98 Chronic Obtrusive P ulmonary Disease (COPD) 99 Chronic Obtrusive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not one disease; it is an umbrella term that describes chronic lung conditions that cause pathological changes in the lungs. These changes occur in the large (central) airways, the peripheral bronchiol es and the lung parenchyma. These changes essentially block airflow as the individual exhales, making it increasi ngly difficult to breathe. T hese changes are progressive, they are not fully reversible , and cannot be treated with inhaled steroids/ corticos teroids (used to treat asthma). The primary treatment is the use of a bronchodilator; however, steroid inhalers can reduce COPD exacerbations and increase quality of life.28 COPD is predominately associated with smoking.29 According to the Confronting C OPD survey 44% of COPD patients were below retirement age, with 24% reporting it completely prevented them for working. An additional 9% stated that they missed work due to the disease.30 2011 Arizona COPD Disease burden (HCUP) Number of Discharges Average Cost Average Length of Stay Aggregate Cost Individuals with multiple chronic conditions 4,672 $32,834 4.7 $153,441,213 Individuals a chronic condition 4,715 $28,128 3.9 $132,622,124 Individuals without another chronic condition 3,536 $20,893 3.0 $73,878,104 Total 12,923 - - $359,941,441 To understand COPD one must understand a few spirometric measurements; specifically forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) and forced vital capacity ( FVC). FEV 1 is the amount of air that can be forc ibly blown out within one second. FVC is full amount of air that can be blown out after a full inhalation. These two values make up the ratio to determine whether a person has COPD (FEV 1/FVC < 70%). It is important to note that after the FEV 1/FVC r atio naturally decreases as people age (See figure 1 3A). Therefore, as an individual ages the likelihood of developing COPD increases. Due to Chronic Obtrusive Pulmonary Disease being predominately associated with smoking status, the data collected by the BRFSS is providing Arizona with a tool to measure the effects of programs and interventions on reducing tobacco use . The reduction o f tobacco use is one of Arizona 's Winnable Battles; as o utlined in A2 of the ADHS Strategic M ap. (See page 6) Figure 13 A.

The promotion of Physical Activity is one of Arizona 's Winnable Battles as o utlined in A1 of the ADHS Strategic Map. (See page 6) Starting in 2011 the BRFSS has adopted a different method for assessing physical activity. In the past, the BRFSS physical activity questions focused upon the amount of time a pers on participated in moderate or vigorous activities. The new physical activity questions remove ambiguity in these categories; the new questions ask if the interviewee participates in specific activities. It is due to this change (in addition to the new w eighting methodology) that physical activity responses from the 2011 BRFSS cannot be compared with previous data. According to the American College of Sports Medicine's Fitness Advisory B oard , Arizona (data is based upon Maricopa a nd Pinal Counties) is r anked 32nd in the nation in terms of promoting physical fitness. Some areas that Arizona did well included: having a high percent of state land designated as parkland, higher park related expenditure per capita, and having lower smoking and heart disease mortality.32 To further improve the health of Arizonans it is ADHS ' goal to increase physical activity throughout the state. Physical activity decreases the risk of heart attack, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure, and may decrease the risk o f stroke. It also helps with weight control, contributes to healthy bones, muscles and joints; reduces the incidence of falls among the elderly; helps to relieve the pain of arthritis; decreases symptoms of anxiety and depression; and can decrease the need for hospitalizations, physician visits and medications. Moreover, physical activity does not need to be strenuous to be beneficial .33 Regular exercise also can contribute to the functional independence of the elderly and improves the quality of life for p eople of all ages.34 Survey Questions: During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise? What type of physical activity or exercise did you spend the (first & second) most time doing during the past month? How many times per week or per month did you take part in this activity during the past mo nth? And when you took part in this activity, for how many minutes or hours d id you usually keep at it? During the past month, how many times per week or per month did you do physical activities or exercises to STRENGTHEN your muscles? Figure 1 4.

(See page 6) Starting in 2011 the BRFSS has adopted a different method for assessing fruit and ve getable consumption. Because of these changes (in addition to the new weighting methodology), fruit and vegetable consumption responses from the 2011 BRFSS cannot be compared to previous data. Good nutrition, including a diet low in saturated fats and a t least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day, plays a key role in maintaining good health. Improving diet could extend the productive life span and reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancers, diabetes and osteoporosis.35 Survey Questions: How often do you drink 100% fruit juices such as orange, grapefruit, or tomato? How often do you eat fruit, green salad, beans and orange vegetables? Excluding the aforementioned fruits and vegetables, how many servings of vegetables do you usually eat? Figure 15. Percentage of Arizona BRFSS respondents reported consuming five servings of fruits and vegetables per day in 2002 -2011.

Analysis of the 2011 Arizona BRFSS showed a larger percentage of Arizonans reporting that they ate five or more servings of fruit and vegetables when compared to the nation as a whole ( Figure 15). Table 15 below indicates that 20.9% percen t of respondents reported that they consume five servings of fruits and vegetables per day . Adults aged 35 -44 were more likely to consume five or more servings per day, at 26%. Adults with higher household income , $50,000 and above, were mo re likely to consume the five recommended servings (between 25.8 % and 26.2 %). The likelihood of consuming five or more fruits and vegetables increased with education.

Prenatal nutrition and best practices are part of A rizona's Winnable Battles. Outlin ed as A1 and F in the ADHS Strategic Map. (See page 6) Each year in the United States, approximately 3,000 pregnancies are affected by neural tube defects (NTDs). Studies have shown that up to 70 percent of NTDs such as spina bifida and anencephaly may be preventable through adequate intake of folic acid.36 In 2011, there were 86 newborns diagnosed with an NTD in Arizona.37 Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps form red blood cells and has been found to reduce the risks of certain types of birth defects, cancer and cardio -vascular disease. While folic acid is important for everyone's health, it is especially vital for women of childbearin g age. The United States Public Health Service recommends that all women of childbearing age in the United States who are capa ble of becoming pregnant should consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day for the purpose of reducing their risk of having a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect.38 Folic acid occurs naturally (as folate) in beans, leafy green vegetables, and in orange juice. Furthermore, in 1996 the FDA authorized the fortification of grains with folic acid; in 1998 , fortification with folic acid became mandatory.39 Survey Question: Some health experts recommend that wom en take 400 micrograms of the B -vitamin folic acid every day . They recommend this for which one of the following reasons? Figure 16.

Table 16A below describes some of the characteristics about women who understand that folic acid prevents birth defects. Some highlights include: Women who are married had the highest percentage of recognizing that folic acid prevents birth defects, 65.3%. Knowledge of folic acid preventing birth defects increased wit h education . Similarly, women with higher household incomes ($75,000+) were more likely to recognize that folic acid prevents birth defects, 70.3%.

The results from the 2011 BRFSS report showed that 40.5% of women between the ages (18 -44) take folic acid in some way or form . Arizona 's goal is 26.2%, so using 2011 level as a baseline, we should aim to achieve a 10% increase in folic acid supplementation in women of child - bearing age. Table 16B below describes a few characteristics of women w ho take folic acid. Some highlights of the table include: Women who are divorced or widowed had the highest percentage of folic acid supplementation, at 65.3% and 60.7% respectively.

Decreasing cigarette smoking among adolescents and adults is a major public health objective for the Nation. Preventing smoking among teenagers and young adults is critical because smoking usually begins in adolescence. Smoking during pregnancy contributes to elevated risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and having a low birth weight infant.40 Direct medical expenditures attributed to smoking total more than $ 96 billion per year. In addition, smoking costs an estimated $ 97 billion per year in lost productivity.41 The lung cancer disease burden alone cost Arizonans close to $150 million; this number is looking solely at malignant neo plasms as a primary diagnosis. 2011 Arizona Lung Cancer Disease Burd en (HCUP) Number of Discharges Average Cost Average Length of Stay Aggregate Cost Malignant neoplasm of the m ain bronchus 109 64,363 7.0 $7,015,522 Malignant neoplasm 851 the bronchus or lung 80 69,341 the l ower or lung 443 74,969 6.7 $33,211,240 Malignant neoplasm of the other parts of bronchus or lung 115 68,540 6.7 $7,882,151 Malignant neoplasm of the bronchus and lung, unspecified 569 51,811 5.9 $29,480,743 Total 2,167 - - $149,822,486 Survey Questions: Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?

Elderly persons with chronic diseases are at high risk for influenza morbidity and mortality.42 Influenza A and B are t he two types of influenza viruses that cause epidemic human disease.43 Since treatment of influenza can only minimize its symptoms, epidemics are most preventable through vaccination against current strains of disease. Since new strains of influenza peri odically emerge, annual vaccinations are necessary to provide constant protection against infection. Vaccination against influenza is recommended as a part of routine health care for all people six months of age and older. Health care professionals should continue to advise or recommend to their high risk populations that they be vaccinated against current influenza strains. 2011 Arizona Influenza Disease Burden (HCUP) Number of Discharges Average Length of Stay Average Charges Aggregate Cost Influe nza with pneumonia (after Oct 1, 2009) 370 5.4 42,602 $15,762,605 Influenza with other respiratory manifestations (after Oct 1, 2009) 517 2.7 16,683 $8,625,214 Influenza with other respiratory manifestations (after Oct 1, 2011) 27 3.3 28,826 $778,290 Influenza with other manifestations (after Oct 1, 2009) 38 3.2 19,705 $748,795 Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus with pneumonia 19 7.4 60,171 $1,143,255 Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus with other respiratory manifestations 49 3.4 21,818 $1,069,072 Total 1,020 - - $28,127,231 Survey Question: During the past 12 months, have you had either a seasonal flu shot or a seasonal flu vaccine that was sprayed in your nose?

More than 2.3 million adult drivers and passengers were treat ed in emergency departments as the result of being injured in motor vehicle crashes in 2009.49 The economic impact is also notable: the lifetime costs of crash -related deaths and injuries amon g drivers and passe ngers were $70 billion in 2005.50 According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as seat belt usage increased the percent of unrestrained passenger fatalities has decreased (See figure 21A below). It is important to note that teenagers and young adults (16 -24) are the least likely to wear seat belts (in 2008 the estimate was only 80% wore seat belts). Additionally, 56% of crash fatalities involving young adults were due to an unbuckled seat belt. 51 Figure 21A.

Uninsured children and adults under 65 years of age are substantially less likely to have a usual source of health care or a recent health ca re visit than their insured counterparts. Uninsured people are more likely to forego needed health care due to cost concerns.52 The recent analysis of the Commonwealth Fund 2010 Biennial Health Insurance Survey indicates that having health insurance can drastically reduce health and healthcare disparities. Their analysis confirms that insurance coverage is a critical component in improving the quality of care in low - income populations.53 2011 Hospital Stays by Payee (HCUP) Number of Discharges Averag e Length of Stay Average Cost Aggregate Cost Medicare 281,925 4.7 47,345 13,351,500,792 Medicaid 2.5 28,715 315,860 Survey Question: Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as Medicare?

(See page 6) Health Care Coverage 167 According to the 2011 BRFSS, Arizonans are more likely to be insured when compared to the nation as a whole (Figure 22) . Table 22 below indicates that 18.8% of respondents reported that they did not have health insurance. Some o f the highlights of this table include: When looking at marital status subgroups, widows were least likely to be uninsured, at 10.3%. As education increased so did the likelihood of being insured. Adults who reported their employment status as Unable to work were least likely to be uninsured, at 4.1%. Hispanics are approximately 2.6 times less likely to be insured when comp ared to white non-Hispanic category.

Even among privately -insured persons, a substantial number lacked a usual source of care or reported difficulty in accessing needed care due to financial constraints or insurance problems.54 Strong predictors of access to quality health care include having hea lth insurance, a higher income level, and a regular primary care provider or other source of ongoing health care. Use of clinical preventive services such as early prenatal care can also serve as indicators of access to quality health care services.55 Survey Question: Do you have one person you think of as your personal doctor or health care provider?

Central to the periodic health examination is the effectiveness of prevention for improving health outcomes. The US Preventive Services Task Force developed recommendatio ns for components of a periodic health examination based upon age, sex, and risk factors.56 Figure 24 below contains information on the health care needs of Arizona population, based upon data about the respondents ' last visit or talks with a doctor.

Time Since Last Checkup 180 Time Since Last Checkup 181 Time Since Last Checkup 182 Time Since Last Checkup 183 Could not Afford Needed Healthcare 184 According to the CDC, There has been important progress made in many areas of health such as increased life expectancy and decreases in deaths from leading killers such as heart disease and cancer. 57 However, the 2011 BRFSS reported those who could not afford need ed health care were not likely to find affordable health care. Either a lack of health care insurance or inadequate coverage prevents many from getting required care because they are unable to pay for services without the help of insurance. People with h ealth insurance are normally more likely to have a primary care provider and to receive necessary preventive care, such as immunizations, health screening tests, prenatal care and immunizations. In 2011 alone Arizona had over 35,000 hospitals stays by uni nsured individuals; incurring costs of over 1.2 billion dollars. On average an uninsured family can only afford approximately 12 percent of hospital stays that they may experience; this figure inclu des higher income families. The United States Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated, One of the most enduring myths in American health care is that people without health insurance can get care with little or no problem. Nothing could be farther from the truth... The res ult is families going without care - or facing health care bills they can't hope to pay.58 Survey Question: Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost?

The pattern, severity and location of symptoms can vary. http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/general.htm Alcohol Consumption According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans ,1 moderate alcohol consumption is defined as having up to one drink per day for wo men and up to two drinks per day for men. This definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days. http://www.cdc.gov/alco hol/faqs.htm#whatAlcohol Asthma The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute defines asthma as ...a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role, in particular, mast cells, eosinophil, T lymphocytes, airway macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usu ally associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causes an associated increase in the existing bronchial hyper -responsiveness to a variety of stimuli (NHLBI 2003). http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=18&po=4 Binge Drinking Respondents who reported having five or more drinks on an occasion, one or more times in the past month.

In addition, Cancer survivors reported on the type of cancer they had and if they were in clinical trials. For more than 30 years, excess weight, lack of physical activity, and an unhealthy diet have been considered second only to tobacco use as preventable causes of disease and death in the United States. Since the 1960s, tobacco use has decreased by a third while obesity rates have d oubled. http://www.cdc.gov/Features/dsCancerAnnualReport/ Appendix - Risk Factors/Chronic Disease Glossary of Terms 193 Cancer The special feature section explains how being overweight and not getting enough physical activity increase cancer risk.

Coronary artery disease can cause a heart attack. If you have a heart attack, you are more likely to surv ive if you know the signs and symptoms , call 9 -1-1 right away, and get to a hospital quickly. People who have had a heart attack can also reduce the risk of future heart attacks or strokes by making lifestyle changes and taking medication. http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/ Cholesterol Awareness Cholesterol is a waxy substance that is found in the fats (lipids) in your blood. While your body ne eds cholesterol to continue building healthy cells, having high cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high -blood -cholesterol/DS 00178 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents who had had their blood cholesterol checked were asked about high blood cholesterol: Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse or other health professional that your blood cholesterol is high ?

Some complications you can get because of diabetes are kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, eye disease, and having to have a leg or foot amputated. If you already have diabetes, you can still do a lot to keep from getting complications from diabetes. http://www.cdc.gov/Features/LivingWithDiabetes/ Disability Disability is called secondary conditions, can include pain, depression, and a greater risk for certain illnesses. To be healthy, people with disabilities require health care that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability. http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/healthyliving.html Influenza Vaccination Respondents 65 years or older who reported not receiving a flu shot in the past 12 months. Influenza illness can include any or all of these symptoms: fever, muscle aches, headache, lack of energy, dry cough, sore throat, and possibly runny nose. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/labrolesprocedures.htm Immunization Immunizations work by stimulating the immune system, the natural disease -fighting system of the body. Folic Acid Awareness Female respondents 18 to 44 years of age who reported a reason other than preventing birth defects as the reason experts recommend that women take folic acid. Folic acid is a B vitamin. If a woman has enough folic acid in her body before and during pregnancy, it can help prevent major birth defects of the baby's brain and spine. Women need 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day Fruits/Vegetables Respondents who reported that they consumed fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. To increase fruit and vegetable consumption of community members, it is important to improve access to these venues, and to increase th e availability of high quality, affordable fruits and vegetables sold at these locations. A diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk for many leading causes of death and can play an impor tant role in weight management. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5935a1.htm Appendix - Risk Factors/Chronic Disease Glossary of Terms 195 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/HCUPnet.jsp?Id=6A4B1124FA223267&Form=Sel QUERYTYPE&JS=Y&Action=%3E%3ENext%3E%3E&_ QUERYTYPE =DxPr Heart Attack The death of heart muscle due to the loss of blood supply. The loss of blood supply is usuall y caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery, one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle. Death of the heart muscle, in turn, causes chest pain and electrical instability of the heart muscle tissue. http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3669 Health Care Coverage Respondents who reported that they did not have health care coverage. Hypertension Awareness Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, affects one out of every three American adults. But more than half don't have their blood pressure under control. Left untreated, high blood pressure raises your risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other conditions. Preventi on is your best defense, but lifestyle changes and medications can help get your bloo d pressure numbers to a healthy level. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6040a1.htm Heavy Drinking Adult men having more than two drinks per day and adult women having more than one drink per day . Excessive drin king both in the form of heavy drinking or binge drinking, is associated with numerous health problems, including \u2014Chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis (damage to liver cells); pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); various cancers, including live r, mouth, throat, larynx (the voice box), and esophagus; high blood pressure; and psychological disorders. Unintentional injuries, such as motor -vehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns and firearm injuries. Violence, such as child maltreatment, hom icide, and suicide. Harm to a developing fetus if a woman drinks while pregnant, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol abuse or dependence. HIV/AID S HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS . http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/basic/index.htm Limited Activities Respondents who reported they were limited in any activities due to any impairment or health problems. Appendix - Risk Factors/Chronic Disease Glossary of Terms 196 No Leisure -Time Activity Respondents who reported that they did not participate in physical activity in the past month outside of normal work - related ac tivities. Pre-Diabetes The condition of having a hereditary tendency or high probability for developing diabetes mellitus, although neither symptoms nor test results confirms the presence of the disease. HTTP://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prediabetes?s=t Pre-conception Health Preconception care and interventions are designed to reduce perinatal risk factors and, for optimal effectiveness, must be successfully implemented before the start of pregnancy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592248/ Respondent Arizona residents 18 years of age or older. In some cases various subset(s) of this group may b e used. Seatbelt Use Respondents who reported that they \"sometimes\", \"seldom\", or \"never\" wear seat belts when driving or riding in a car . Special Equipment Respondents reported having a health problem or impairment that required special equipment. Stroke Stroke is the stoppage of blood flow to brain: a sudden blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain resulting in, e.g. loss of consciousness, partial loss of movement, or loss of speech. http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/search?q=define+stroke&qpvt=DEFINE+ STROKE&FORM=DTPDIA Tobacco Use Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung diseases (including emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic air way obstruction).1 For every person who dies from a smoking - related disease, 20 more people suffer with at least one serious illness from smoking.2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cigarette Smoking - Attributable Morbidity \u2014United States, 2000 . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2003;52(35):842 -4 [accessed 2012 Jun 7]. Appendix - Methods 197 SAMPLE DESIGN The Arizona BRFSS is a random digit dialing and a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system of gathering Health Statistics. Landline sample size of 6,503 and cell -phone sample size of (20 percent of the total number of completes) of whom will be cell-phone only households, interviews over a 12 -month period was selected to achieve an acceptable 95 percent This means that the estimated prevalence of a given risk factor can be reliably projected across the total population of Arizona residents. Prevalence estimates of individual demographic variables, especially those that yield smaller sample sizes, do not achieve the same level of accuracy as the total sample. The CDC has stated that County level analysis will not produce reliable values as the sample size may be too small. The CDC has emphasized the use of Regions. Arizona consists of 7 regions; regions are combinations of contiguous counties. See Appendix: Traditionally, BRFSS relied solely on calling landlines. However, with the progressive increase in cell -phone only households , the BRFSS would be unable to fully capture dise ase and prevalence trends by solely relying upon landlines. Current estimates show that cell - phone only households have increased by 700 percent from 2003 -2009; 3 out of 10 households in the US only have cell -phones. Cell -phone only households are especi ally prevalent among younger families and among certain racial and ethnic groups. Therefore, to capture data that is representative of the U.S. population BRFSS will include cell -phones sample of 20% starting in 2011. A demographic profile of the Arizona population surveyed is reported in Appendix: 2011 Arizona Respondent Profile. NEW METHODOLOGY - RAKING Sampling weights are needed to correct for imperfections in the sample that might lead to bias. It can include the selection of units with unequal pr obabilities, non -coverage of the population, and non -response. Data weights incorporate characteristics of the population and the sample. In the past the CDC has used post stratification to weight BRFSS data; post stratification is based on the known dem ographics of the population. Essentially, post stratification forces the sum of the weighted frequencies to be equal to the known population estimates. In 2011, a new weighting methodology, iterative proportional fitting (or raking), replaced the post stratification weighting methodology. Raking adjusts the data so that groups which are underrepresented in the sample can be more accurately represented in the final dataset. Raking incorporates additional demographic characteristics and more accurately matches sample distributions to known population demographics. Furthermore, the use of raking reduces non -response bias and has been shown to reduce within -error estimates. BRFSS raking integrates a multitude of categories such as: age by gender, detaile d race and ethnicity groups, education levels, marital status, regions within states, gender by race and ethnicity, telephone source, renter/owner status, and age groups by race and ethnicity. In 2011, 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico collected samples of both landline and cell - phone interviews ; the Virgin Islands only collected data via landlines . Appendix - Methods 198 ANNUAL QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT The State BRFSS Coordinators Working Group meets three times a year with the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Branch Management. The questionnaire for landlines and cell - phones is the same except for when the respondent is screened for the asthma follow -up question. The asthma follow -up questions are only asked on the land -line. One task of this group is to develop a 5 -year, long -term plan for the BRFSS core instrument. The 2011 BRFSS questionnaire was the first year of a 5 -year plan. Before the beginning of the calendar year, CDC provides states with the text of the core component and the optional modules that will be supported for the coming year. States select their optional modules and choose any state -added questions. Each state then constructs its questionnaire. The order of the questioning is always the same: the core component is asked fi rst, optional modules are asked next, and state -added questions last. This ordering ensures comparability across states and follows CDC guidelines. Generally, the only changes allowed are limited insertions of state -added questions on topics related to core questions. Such exceptions are to be agreed upon in consultation with CDC . Once the questionnaire content (core, modules, and state -added questions) is determined by a state, a hard -copy or electronic version of the instrument is constructed and sent to CDC. For states with Computer -Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) systems, this document is used for CATI programming and general reference. The questionnaire is used without changes for one calendar year. The questionnaire is available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/questionnaires.htm . If a significant portion of the state population does not speak English, states have the option of translating the questionnaire into other languages. At the present time, CDC also provides a Spanish version of the core questionnaire and optional modules. ADMINISTRATION OF TH E QUESTIONNAIRE The ADHS has contracted with a private survey research firm since August , 2000 to con tact randomly selected Arizona residences from 9 A.M. until 9 P.M. weekdays, from 11 A.M. until 7 P.M. on weekends . All telephone numbers released in each month's sample received at least 15 attempts over a minimum 14 day period, including at least three atte mpts during weekends, and at least three attempts during a weekday. Furthermore , selected respondents who were not able to complete the interview at the time of selection received a minimum of 10 call -backs during the interview period. A pre -notification letter was mailed out to alert potential participants that their household was randomly selected from all adults residing in the household to be inter -viewed. Appendix - Methods 199 DATA ANALYSIS All analyses presented are based upon cell size counts of at least eight cases. The demographic information that was collected and presented in these results includes sex, age, education, household income, race, and ethnicity. Comparisons between responses within demographic categories were analyzed for statistical significance at the alpha = .05 level. Throughout the report, statistical difference is noted when analysis provides 95 percent confidence that the categories described are different. Disclaimer for 2011 Due to significant changes in the BRFSS methodology as describ ed above, Arizona's BRFSS estimates for 2011 data SHOULD NOT be compared to estimates provided herein from previous years. Thus, Arizona's 2011 data is the new BRFSS baseline provided herein. The new methodology changes will cause breaks in the BRFSS tre nds, but going forward, will also greatly improve the accuracy, coverage, validity and repetitiveness of the Arizona BRFSS.
