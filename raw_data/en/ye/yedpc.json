This document is published annually under the authority of the RMIT University Council. All fees in this schedule and appendices are subject to alteration by Council without prior notice. All approved changes will be recorded in the addendum of this document and posted on www.rmit.edu.au/fs/fees/schedules . Only fees that have been approved by the Vice-Chancellor (or delegate) can be charged to students or persons; fees not approved are illegal and cannot be either charged or collected . Only approved fees listed in this document (or its subsequent revisions) and appendices are configured in the University's student administration database. All student fees must be charged through the University's student administration database unle ss otherwise approved by Financial Services. All fees and charges listed in this sc hedule and appendices have been approved by the Vice- Chancellor, and endorsed by Financial Services. Any questions about this document should be referred to the Deputy Director, Business Advisory or Manager, Student Financials in Financial Services. In broad terms, there are four categories of fees charged by RMIT: 1. Tuition fees for Higher Education, TAFE and preparatory students, studying in a Commonwealth or State Government supported place, or as a full fee-paying domestic or international student. This includes student contributions or tuition contributions. 2. Student services and amenities fees for services and amenities of a non-academic nature, such as sporting and recreational activities, employment and career advice, childcare, financial advice and food services. 3. Material fees and charges associated with courses and subjects offered by the University. These include fees or charges associated with fiel d trips, goods or services which are used to produce items that become the physical property of students, lecture notes and reading material. In most instances, these charges are not compulsory and are optional at the student's discretion. 4. Administrative fees and charges include fees for parking, library fines, penalties for late payment or late enrolment, graduation ceremonies, etc. The following sections provide a list of the fees and conditions that may apply to fees charged to students or persons for enrolment or other engagement with RMIT during 2012. Fee information is also provided on the RMIT website www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges date: 22/12/2011 Page 2 of 161 2 Application of 2012 Approved Schedule of Fees and Charges All students or persons who enrol at RMIT for studies in the 2012 calendar year, or who otherwise engage with RMIT in 2012 (e.g. graduation, car parking, apply for admission, etc) are subject to the fees and charges detailed in this document. All students who undertake their studies at RMIT in the 2012 calendar year are required to complete an enrolment form or enrol online. Completion of an enrolment form or online enrolment is a declaration that binds a student to the rules and obligations of this approved schedule of fees and charges (inclusive of amendment s subsequently approved by Council). A student or person is liable for the resulting financia l obligation from the application of their enrolment or other action pursuant to this approved schedule of fees and charges. The financial obligation to pay tuition fees will remain unless withdrawal of enrolment is made via the approved process prior to the semester financial deadlines advised. 2.1 Creation of financial liability Financial liability for all Tuition and Administrative fees and charges are created at the point of enrolment. Students become liable for Material fees upon signed agreement and/or upon receipt of the corresponding goods or service. 2.2 Cessation of financial liability Financial liability only ceases upon payment or wit hdrawal from a course or program by the appropriate date. The only mechanisms to withdraw from a course are via Enrolment Online, an approved Enrolment Variation or Leave of Absence form. The only mechanism to withdraw from a program is lodgement of a Cancellation of Enrolment form with RMIT University or RMIT Training 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 3 of 161 3 Tuition fees 3.1 Annual fees Program and course tuition fees for non-Commonwealth and non-State Government supported students who commence their program in 2012 are held constant only for the 2012 year. RMIT University reserves the right to annually adjust program tuition fees. Changes to program tuition fees will be applied at the beginning of each calendar year. In 2012, the annual tuition price increase is capped at 7.5%. For Higher Education fees, tuition fees are rounded up to the nearest $10.00 per credit point increment, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%. Similarly, for VET/TAFE students the program annual fees are rounded to the nearest $250, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%. This cap does not apply to domestic full fee paying TAFE students. Students who commenced their program in semester 2, 2003 or earlier (term 0350 or prior) will continue to be charged according to the terms and conditions existing at the time of their initial enrolment in that program. In other words, these student fees will continue to be \"pipelined\" for the duration of their continuous enrolment in the program they commenced in semester 2, 2003 or earlier. 3.1.1 Cohort pricing Where the tuition fee for a given program exceeds the cap on annual tuition price increases, students who are currently enrolled will be entitled to complete their tuition at their current fee rate (subject to annual indexing), whilst newly enrolling students will be charged at the new fee rate. The list of the average annual 2012 tuition fees for all local and international undergraduate and postgraduate full-fee paying programs in appendices 1 and 2 may therefore include two or more price streams for a single program. Where this occurs the \"program description\" field will indicate the cohort by calendar year that corresponds to the annual fee price listed. Students are allocated to a cohort based upon their program admit date. 3.2 Standard or average load Annual tuition fees are based upon standard or average load (total program load program duration) and normal progression, with pro-rata fees applying to non-standard loads. The standard measure of a full-time student load in Higher Education is 48 credit points per semester. TAFE programs do not conform to a standard load per semester; the annual fees for TAFE programs are therefore based on a calculation of total program fees (at current year prices) divided by program duration. TAFE tuition fees are configured at the level of nominal hours and students are therefore invoiced according to their enrolled load at the program price set for the corresponding calendar year. To illustrate, a program requiring 1,500 nominal hours over two (2) years may require students to undertake 700 nominal hours in the first year and the balance of 800 nominal hours in the second year. Assuming full time enrolment, the student will therefore be invoiced for 700 nominal hours in the first year at the fee set for that calendar year and 800 nominal hours for the second year at the new calendar year rate. The fee invoiced for each semester may also vary between semesters as the enrolment requirements in TAFE Programs varies between semesters. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 4 of 161 Over the full duration of the program, the total program tuition fee will be the fee quoted (subject to annual adjustments). TAFE fees may be in excess of the total program tuition fees (including annual adjustments) if the student chooses non-standard electives or if a student enrols in subjects in addition to the normal program load. 3.3 Higher Education - Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) A Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) is a Higher Education place for which the Commonwealth Government makes a partial financial contribution. In addition to this Government contribution CSP students are required to pay a student contribution according to the units of study (courses) undertaken. Some CSP students may be eligible for HECS-HELP assistance to help them pay their student contribution amounts (see 3.4). A student is a CSP student only if they have receiv ed confirmation from RMIT that they have been offered a Commonwealth Supported Place, and the student accepts that place. Only students who meet citizenship requirements may be eligible for a CSP. That is, they are an Australian citizen; a New Zealand citizen who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study; the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study; or the holder of a permanent visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study. The amount of student contribution a student is liable fo r per course (subject) is based on the load of study and the discipline of each course (subject). Each discipline falls within one of five student contribution bands (detailed below). Student contribution amounts are charged on a semesterly basis. Each semester all CSP students are issued a Commonwealth Assistance Notice (CAN) after the published semester census date that details the student contribution amounts and any payments made for each enrolled course. CSP students, if eligible for HELP (Higher Education Loan Programme), have the following payment options: Make a full up-front payment of 90% of the student contribution amount for all of their units or courses and receive a 10% discount; Pay part of their student contribution amounts up-front, receive a 10% HECS-HELP discount for any payments totalling $500 or more, and obtain a loan for the remainder; or Obtain a loan for the full amount of their student contribution amount. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Page 5 of 161 3.3.1 Student Learning Entitlement (SLE) The SLE system will be abolished from 1 January 2012. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011 was passed by the Parliament on 14 September 2011. Under the provisions of the Bill, eligible students will no longer have a limit placed on how much study they can undertake as a Commonwealth supported student. Students who have used up their allocation of SLE will now be able to re-enrol from 1 January 2012 to complete their studies as a Commonwealth supported student (or undertake further study in a Commonwealth supported place). Those students who used up their SLE and have paid tuition fees for a fee paying place and/or received a FEE-HELP loan are not able to receive a remittance of those fees or a reduction in their FEE-HELP debt. 3.3.2 Calculating the student contribution CSP students are required to pay a student contribution amount that, depending upon eligibility, may be paid upfront or deferred through the HECS-HELP scheme . The student contribution amount for a course is based on the student contribution band that the course falls within (see Table 1 below) and the (Equivalent Full-Time Student Load) EFTSL weight of the course as a proportion of a full-time study load (i.e. student contribution band x EFTSL course weight). The weight of courses is measured as a proportion of a full-time student load (1 EFTSL) and can also be measured in credit points. A full time load for Higher Education students at RMIT is equivalent to 96 credit points. Some programs, such as double degrees, may require the student to enrol in more than 96 credit points in some or all years of the program. It is important to note that the student contribution bands are determined by the individual unit of study (which RMIT defines as a course), not the program or degree. That is, if a student enrols in a nursing course and an accounting course as part of a Bachelor of Nursing program, the nursing course will be charged in Band 1 and the accounting course will be charged in Band 3. More detailed information regarding calculation of student contribution amounts is provided on the RMIT website www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees . Table 1: Maximum student contribution amount by student contribution band - 2012 Student Contribution Band Maximum student contribution amount for a place in 2012 (1 EFTSL or 96 credit points) National Priorities \u2014Mathematics , Statistics, Science $4,520 Band 1: (humanities, behavioural science, social studies, clinical psychology, foreign languages, visual and performing arts, nursing, education) $5,648 Band 2: (computing, built environment, health, engineering surveying, agriculture) $8,050 Band 3: (accounting, administrati on, economics, commerce, law, dentistry, medicine, veterinary sciences) $9,425 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 6 of 161 Notes on Table 1: National Priorities : The maximum annual student contribution amount for Mathematics, Statistics and Science units of study applies to students who commenced their program of study on or after 1 January 2009. The national priority maximum student contribution amount also applies to continuing students who transfer to a Na tural and Physical Sciences program of study from a non Natural and Physical Sciences program of study. The reduced maximum student contribution amount is set at the national priority level of $4,520 (2012 rate). Pre-2008 students: For pre 2008 students, the maximum annual student contribution amount that may be charged for Accounting, Administration, Economics and Commerce units is $8,050 . This amount applies to Commonwealth supported students who commenced a course of study before 1 January 2008 and are covered by the savings provision in Schedul e 7 of the Higher Educat ion Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Act 2007. Pre-2009 students: For pre 2009 students, the maximum annual student contribution amount that may be charged for Mathematics, Statistics and Sci ence units is $8,050 (Band 2). Pre-2010 students: From 1 January 2010, the maximum annual student contribu tion amount for Commonwealth supported students undertaking Education and Nursing uni ts of study increased from the 'nationa l priority' rate to the Band 1 rate. For pre-2010 students, the maximum annual student contribution amount that may be charged for Education and Nursing units in 2012 is $4,520. 3.3.3 Pre-2010 students Effective 1 January 2010 the maximum annual student contribution amount for education and nursing units of study increased from the National Priority Band rate to the Band 1 rate. This applies to students who commenced their program of study from 1 January 2010. Continuing students will continue to be subject to the National Priority Band rate that applied in 2009, indexed for subsequent years ($4,520 in 2012). A person is a pre-2010 student for a unit of study if: the person commenced a course of study with a provider before 1 January 2010 and was a Commonwealth supported student in relation to a unit of study in that course; and the person did not complete the course by 31 December 2009, or if they completed the course, it was: - an enabling course undertaken in 2009; or - a related course for an honours course of study and they are undertaking the honours course of study; and the unit of study that would have been included in Education in the funding cluster Mathematics, Statistics, Behavioural Science, Education, Computing, Built Environment, Other Health or the funding cluster Nursing repealed by of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Act 2009. To be a pre-2010 student there is no requirement that the course a student was undertaking as a Commonwealth supported student prior to 2010 was a course in education or nursing or related 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 7 of 161 disciplines or that the student has undertaken units of study in education and nursing or related disciplines prior to 2010. The pre-2010 arrangements apply to students who transfer from one course of study to another (including where one course of study is postgraduate and the other undergraduate), or who transfer between providers, as long as t hey meet the above requirements. Where a student was enrolled in a course of study as a Commonwealth supported student before 2010, has not completed the course of study by the end of 2009, but then ceases to be enrolled, the student will be a pre-2010 student if they subsequently enrol in a course of study as a Commonwealth supported student in 2010. There is no requirement for particular circumstances to apply to a person's discontinuance from a course of study (for example, there is no need for a student to have deferred or taken approved leave from the course). There is no sunset clause for the grandfathering arrangements for pre-2010 students. Pre-2010 students enrolled in double or combined degrees A student who is enrolled in a double or combined degree program is a pre-2010 student if they completed the requirements of only one of the awards on or before 31 December 2009. A pre-2010 student enrolled in a single degree program and who transfers subsequently to a combined or double degree program remains a pre-2010 student even if they complete the requirements of one of the awards. 3.3.4 Pre-2009 students From 1 January 2009, providers must set the annual student contribution amounts for units of study in mathematics (including statistics) and science with in the National Priority Band amount. The reduced maximum student contribution amount for these units applies to all students who commence their course of study on or after 1 January 2009, regardless of their course of study. It also applies to continuing students, who commenced before 2009 in a non-Natural and Physical Sciences course of study, did not complete that course of study and, on or after 1 January 2009, transfer to a Natural and Physical Sciences (NPS) course of study. The reduced maximum student contribution amount is the 'national priority' band amount of $4,520 (2012 amount, indexed for future years). Continuing 'pre-2009' students (with the above limited ex ception) will remain subject to the current higher maximum student contribution amount for units in mathematics, statistics and science at the band 2 amount of $8,050 (2012 amount, indexed for future years). 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 8 of 161 When is a person a pre-2009 student A person is a pre-2009 student if: they enrol on or after 1 January 2009 in a mathematics, statistics or science unit that forms part of a course of study that the student: - commenced prior to 1 January 2009; or - transfers into on or after 1 January 2009 from a course that they commenced prior to 1 January 2009, and the exception for non-NPS to NPS transferring students does not apply. HESA defines a combined or double degree program as a single course of study. A student is a continuing student until they complete the entire course of study. 3.3.5 Pre-2008 students As outlined in section 5.2 of the Administrative Information for Higher Education Providers (effective from 14 March January 2011) , for students who commenced from 1 January 2008 the contribution amounts for units of study in accounting, administration, economics and commerce are changed to the same maximum as applies under HESA for law, medicine, dentistry and veterinary science (or Band 3). Students who commenced prior to 2008 will continue to pay the previous maximum student contribution amount ($8,050 in 2012,) until the end of 2012. All students in these disciplines will be covered by the same maximum student contribution amounts in HESA from 1 January 2013. Some pre-2005 HECS students (see section 3.3.5) who did not complete their course when the pre- 2005 transitional arrangements finished at the end of 2008 may be eligible to continue under the pre-2008 provisions. However, a pre-2005 HECS student who did not undertake any CSP study between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2007 is not a pre-2008 student. A person is a pre-2008 student for a unit of study if: the person commenced a course of study with a provider before 1 January 2008 and was a Commonwealth supported student in relation to a unit of study in that course; and the person did not complete the course by 31 December 2007, or if they completed the course, it was: - an enabling course undertaken in 2007; or - the related course for an honours course of study and they are undertaking the honours course of study; and the period over which the person is undertaking the unit of study ends on or before 31 December 2012; and the person is not a pre-2005 HECS student in 2008; and 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 9 of 161 the unit of study would have been in the account ing, administration, economics or commerce funding cluster repealed by Schedule 2 of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Act 2007. To be a pre-2008 student there is no requirement that the course a student was undertaking as a Commonwealth supported student prior to 2008 was a course in accounting or related disciplines or that the student has undertaken units of study in accounting or related disciplines prior to 2008. If a person meets the pre-2008 requirements for study undertaken after 1 January 2008 and then completes their course before the end of 2012, the pre-2008 arrangements still apply to that person for subsequent courses of study if they continue to meet the other pre-2008 requirements. 3.3.5.1 Pre-2008 students enrolled in double or combined degrees A student who is enrolled in a double or combined degree program is a pre-2008 student if they completed the requirements of only one of the awards on or before 31 December 2007. A pre-2008 student enrolled in a single degree programme and who transfers subsequently to a combined or double degree programme remains a pre-2008 student even if they complete the requirements of one of the awards. 3.3.6 End of pre-2005 HE CS Arrangem ents As outlined in section 5.1 Administrative Information for Higher Education Providers (effective from 14 March 2011) all pre-2005 student arrangements expired on 31 December 2008 regardless of whether a student has completed their program. Please note, students who began their course of study prior to 1 January 1997 and have not discontinued their study are included in the pre-2005 arrangements. Therefore, all pre-2005 students who have not completed their program as of 31 December 2008 will: no longer have access to the pre-2005 student contribution ranges. They will be subject to the student contribution ranges as those student who commenced their study on or after 1 January 2005, and; will not be eligible for a HELP loan unless they are an Australian citizen or the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa. Students who are not eligible for HECS or FEE-HELP must pay their student contribution amount up-front in full by the advised financial deadline. 3.4 Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) Through the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP), the Commonwealth government lends eligible students money to pay for their Higher Education fees. HELP is administered under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA). While some information about HELP is provided in this document to assist students, a student's official reference for HELP is the Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) Going to Uni website at: www.goingtouni.gov.au and publications such as the FEE-HELP information 2012 booklet and the Information for Commonwealth supported students 2012 booklet. Changes may be made by the Government to the legislation for HELP at any time. The Australian Government's Going to uni website www.goingtouni.gov.au contains links to the Australian Government's myUniAssist website. The myUniAssist website is designed to help students monitor their FEE-HELP balances, Commonwealth scholarships and OS-HELP records. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 10 of 161 Should any inconsistencies between this document and the official Australian Government website arise, then the information contained on the Australian Government website prevails. HELP loans provide eligible students with assistance to pay all or part of their tuition fees. The HELP loans available are as follows: HECS-HELP \u2014 for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places (CSP). HECS- HELP loans cover all or part of your student contribution. FEE-HELP \u2014 for eligible full-fee paying students. FEE-HELP is a loan that covers up to the full amount of your tuition fees. It is available to full-fee paying undergraduate and postgraduate coursework and research students. Undergraduate students (including Associate Degree students) are charged a 25% loan fee,. OS-HELP \u2014 for eligible Commonwealth supported students who wish to study overseas. This loan is to assist with expenses such as accommodation and travel. VET FEE-HELP \u2014for eligible TAFE students. VET FEE-HELP loans are provided to meet all, or some, of the costs of tuition incurred by: 1. Eligible full-fee paying TAFE students, who enr oll in a diploma, advanced diploma, vocational graduate certificate or vocational graduate diploma program; and 2. Eligible TAFE students subsidised by the Victorian State Government, who enroll in a diploma or advanced diploma program. A loan fee of 20 per cent applies to TAFE full fee paying places. TAFE students in Government subsidised places are not charged a loan fee. 3.4.1 Lifetime limits to HELP loans Over a student's lifetime a FEE-HELP limit applies for access to a FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP loan. The FEE-HELP limit is indexed annually. In 2012 the FEE-HELP limit is $112,134 for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science students and $89,706 for all other students. The FEE-HELP limit applies even if a person has partially or fully repaid their FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP debt. HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, OS-HELP and VET FEE-HELP debts are treated as a single debt, which is known as the accumulated HELP debt. The options available for paying tuition fees or student contributions depend on the student's eligibility for a HELP loan. If the student has an approved loan you have the option to: pay the full tuition fee or student contribution up-front (Eligible Commonwealth supported students who make full up-front payments of 90% of the student contribution amount for all of their courses will receive a 10% discount. ) pay some of the tuition fee or student contribution up-front and request a loan for the remainder of their tuition fees (Eligible Commonwealth supported students who pay part of their student contribution amounts up-front will receive a 10% discount for any payments totalling $500 or more, and obtain a loan for the remainder.) request a HELP loan for the full tuition fee or student contribution amount. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: of 161 3.4.2 HELP loan repayments: HELP debts are indexed on 1 June each year and repayments occur on one of two ways: Compulsory payments through the Australian taxation system: Students start repaying their HELP debt to the Federal Government through the Australian Taxation system once they reach the minimum income threshold level for repayment. The repayment thresholds are adjusted each year to reflect any changes in average weekly earnings. Voluntary repayments to the Australian Taxation Office: Students can make voluntary repayments to the Australian Taxation Office at any time and for any amount. Those who make a voluntary payment of $500 or more receive a bonus of 5% and their account is credited with an additional 5% of the payment. The bonus is 5% of the payment made not 5% of the outstanding debt. 3.4.3 Provision of a Tax File Number If a student is applying for any kind of HELP loan for study at RMIT, they will need to supply a valid Tax File Number. If a Tax File Number is not su pplied on of before the census date, the student will need to pay the student contribution or tuition fee in full on or before the census date. If a CSP student does not pay the entire student contribution amount up-front and has not provided a valid Tax File Number on or before the census date, RMIT is required by federal government legislation to cancel the student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. If a CSP student who is not eligible for HECS-HELP assistance fails to pay their Student Contribution amount in full by the census date, RMIT is required by federal government legislation to cancel the student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. 3.4.4 Eligibility for HELP programs To be eligible for HELP a student must be one of the following: an Australian citizen; a holder of a permanent humanitarian visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit; a holder of a permanent visa who is undertaking bridging study for overseas-trained professionals and will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit. 3.4.5 Ineligibility for HELP programs Other domestic students, such as New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents (other than holders of a permanent humanitarian visa), are not eligible for HELP. These students must pay their Student Contribution or Tuition Fee in full by the census date and are not eligible for a discount. If a CSP student who is not eligible for HECS-HELP assistance fails to pay their Student Contribution amount in full by the census date, RMIT is required by federal government legislation to cancel the 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Page of 161 student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. 3.5 Higher Education - domestic and international full fee paying 3.5.1 Program fees and charges RMIT offers a number of undergraduate, research and postgraduate places to students that are not supported by the Commonwealth Government. The tuition fees for these programs are set on an annual basis and may be subject to change each calendar year. Under HESA, the tuition fees for all Higher Education full-fee paying programs must be greater than or equal to the current year's maximum 'Student Contribution Amount' for the program; the fees for all of RMIT's domestic fee-paying programs have been set above the respective maximum student contribution amount. Appendix 1 provides a list of the average annual 2012 tuition fees for all local undergraduate and postgraduate full-fee paying programs. 3.5.2 Capping of research tuition fees All students undertaking research programs at RMIT are levied tuition fees based on the nature of their program. Tuition fees for research programs with research EFTSL calculation have tuition fees capped at 48 credit points per semester for full-time students and 24 credit points per semester for part-time students, regardless of enrolled credit point load. This applies to domestic, international onshore and international offshore non-partner enrolm ents. Many research programs, typically those with a significant coursework component, have standard EFTSL calculation, not research EFTSL calculation. Tuition fees for research programs with standard EFTSL calculation are not capped and are charged on a pro-rata basis. Examples of research programs with research EFTSL calculation: MR082 Master of Applied Science DR003 Doctor of Philosophy Examples of research programs with standard EFTSL (not research) calculation: DR060 Doctor of Project Management DR061 Doctor of Business Administration 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Page 13 of 161 3.5.3 Degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication Fees have been set and configured within RMIT's student administration system for domestic full fee paying candidates enrolled in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication as outlined in Appendix 1 of this Schedule. In accordance with RMIT Council Regulation 5.1.9 sections 5 and 6, candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication will normally be enrolled part-time for a duration of one year. As with section 3.5.2 above, the standard part time load for a research program is 24 credit points. 3.5.4 Changes to fee-paying domest ic undergraduate places From 1 January 2009, fee paying domestic undergraduate places are being phased out of public universities. Please note: Postgraduate programs are unaffected by this announcement and will continue to be offered to domestic students on a fee-paying basis. New domestic students In 2010, no full-fee places were offered at RMIT University to new domestic students in undergraduate programs through VTAC (Victorian Tertiary Admission Centre). Current fee-paying Australian students Students who are currently enrolled in full-fee Australian undergraduate places can continue to complete their degree as a full-fee student. RMIT Univ ersity's scheme of allowing high achieving, full- fee paying, undergraduate students to transfer to CSP places is still in existence for any student who enrolled in 2008 or earlier (see 3.5.5). Exemptions There are some exemptions to the Government's prohibition on new full-fee undergraduate places which will affect a very small number of applicants and students. These include applicants who: are enrolling in a full-fee Spring or Summer School course are enrolling in a bridging course for overseas trained professionals are enrolling in a unit that forms part of a course of study that is subject to determination by the Minister specifying that a student cannot be enrolled as a Commonwealth supported student have commenced their course of study as an overseas student and become a domestic student part way through their course do not fall into the above categories but who wish to apply for a full-fee place Such applicants are required to apply directly to RMIT's admissions for a full-fee place. 3.5.5 Transfer of domestic fee-paying student s to Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) Students may be eligible to transfer from a domestic fee paying undergraduate place to CSP funded place in the same program if they meet the criteria for a Guaranteed Transfer or a Discretionary Transfer. The procedure for Academic merit-based transfer of domestic undergraduate fee-paying students to commonwealth supported places can be located from the RMIT Policies and Procedures website www.rmit.edu.au/policies . 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Page 14 of 161 3.5.6 International onshore students The Commonwealth does not contribute to educational costs for international students unless the students are in receipt of an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship. Furthermore, Commonwealth grant amounts provided to universities for the education of domestic students are not provided for the purpose of subsidising places or services for international students. The fees charged to international onshore students must be greater than or equal to a minimum indicative fee specified by DEEWR. All RMIT fees have been set above these minimum requirements. Appendix 2 of this document lists the 2012 fees for international onshore students. 3.5.7 International off-shore students RMIT University does not set fees for international off-shore students. All tuition fees and charges for international off-shore students are established by the relevant off-shore partner. 3.5.8 RMIT International University Vietnam Australian and New Zealand citizens studying at RMIT International University Vietnam (RMIT Vietnam) are subject to the fees and charges detailed in the RMIT Vietnam schedule of fees and charges , and may be eligible for FEE-HELP. 3.5.9 Change in citizenship or immigration status International students who change residency during the course of their study, and become an Australian citizen or permanent resident, may be entitled to pay fees at the same rate as local fee-paying students (if they are not eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place or Victorian government subsidised place in respect of TAFE st udents), provided they can show evidence that the change in citizenship or immigration status was granted by the applicable census date and the student submits a Change of Citizenship/Immigration Status form to RMIT by the same applicable census date. Please note, depending on the established fees for individual programs, changing citizenship or immigration status may not necessarily result in a reduction in fees. Students may also incur a $500 administrative fee. 3.6 TAFE - State Government Supported Places 3.6.1 TAFE Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria In 2009, the Victorian government announced major changes to TAFE education under the Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria reforms which took effect from 1 July 2009. TAFE tuition fees now depend on the program level or qualification level, which have been categorised as follows: Foundation Skills, Skills Creation, Apprenticeships, Traineeships, Skills Building and Skills Deepening. New rules determining student eligibility for a government subsidised place have also been introduced. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Eligibility criteria for gover nment subsidised places 1. Citizenship Students must be: An Australian citizen; or A permanent visa holder; or A special category visa holder (New Zealand); or An East Timorese asylum seeker or TPV holder. 2. Age Students under 20 years of age are guaranteed a training place at any qualification level (i.e. Foundation Skills to Skills Deepening) even if they have a prior qualification. Students over 20 years of age are guaranteed a government subsidised place only in foundation skills qualifications (unless they are a Victorian apprentice, see point 4 below). 3. Prior Qualifications Students over 20 years of age, who enrol in a course that is accredited at a higher level than the highest Australian qualification that they hold, are eligible for a government subsidised place. 4. Apprenticeships Following a review of the implementation of Securing Jobs for Your Future , Skills Victoria has made an amendment to the eligibility criteria for a government subsidised place applicable to apprentices. If you are a Victorian apprentice commencing your pr ogram of study in 2012 and meet the citizenship requirements, you have access to a government subsidised place regardless of age or prior qualification. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 16 of 161 The below diagram details the eligibility rules in effect from 1 January 2012 for all individuals for all qualification levels. All qualifications Does the applicant meet the citizenship/residency requirements? Is the applicant under 20 on 1 Jan in the year in which the course commences? Applicant is eligible for a government subsidised place Is the applicant seeking entry to a Foundation Skills course? Is the applicant an apprentice? Is the course applied for at a higher level than the highest qualification already held? Applicant is not eligible for a government subsidised place Applicant is eligible for a government subsidised place Applicant is eligible for a government subsidised place Applicant is eligible for a government subsidised place Applicant is not eligible for a government subsidised place Yes Yes No No No No NoYes Yes Yes 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Page 17 of 161 3.6.2.1 Asylum Seekers and Victims of Human Trafficking Asylum See kers and Victims of Human Trafficking who commence a program prior to 1 July 2012 are exempt from the citizenship/residency eligibility r equirement for a government supported place, for the duration of their program, or until they withdraw. They must meet all other eligibility criteria for a government supported place. Asylum Seekers must be confirmed as 'Asylum S eekers' by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC). Victims of Human Trafficking must be confirmed as 'Victims of Human Trafficking' by the Australian Red Cross (ARC.) The ASRC and ARC have been provided with a grant to cover the tuition fees levied to eligible students, so RMIT will invoice these organisations for the tuition fees. 3.6.3 2012 TAFE tuition fees In October 2011, Skills Victoria informed Victorian TAFE institutes of proposed changes to funding and the removal of minimum and maximum fee caps . This means that from 1 January 2012, TAFE institutes are entitled to charge commencing students (and continuing apprentices) for the full amount of the training delivered to them. However, RMIT has made the decision to continue applying maximum tuition fees to all students in 2012. The changes in funding also included the reduction of the industry weighting for business programs (reducing the government contribution for these programs by 12.5%), and the reduction of the government contribution for Certificate I - Certificate IV programs. In 2012 TAFE tuition fees depend on the program level or qualification level which have been categorized as follows: Foundation Skills, Skills Creation, Apprenticeships, Traineeships, Skills Building and Skills Deepening. For study undertaken in 2012 the following tuition fees apply: Level name Program level Fee per Nominal Hour Student fee Concession rate Student fees Maximum fee (per calendar year) Apprenticeships various $2.17 $188 $923 Traineeships various d pre-accredited programs $1.08 $50 $500 Skills Creation Certificate I Certificate II $1.62 $105 $875 2012 Schedule of Fees and date: 22/12/2011 Page 18 of Skills Building Certificate III Certificate IV $2.17 $188 $1,250 Skills Deepening Diploma Advanced Diploma $4.33 $100* $2,500 *Eligible students under the age of 25 at 1 Januar y 2012 will be charged a concession fee of $100 for enrolments at the Skills Deepening level. For students aged 25 years and over at 1 January 2012, no concession is available at the Skills Deepening level,however indigenous students will only be charged the concession fee of $100. *** As per section 3.6.3.2 below , regardless of nominal hours and combination of TAFE programs enrolled, in 2012 the annual maximum fee is $2,500. 3.6.3.1 Calculating the TAFE student contribution for a program or course TAFE fees for government subsidised places are calculated based on the nominal hours of enrolment. To calculate a student's tuition fees, multiply the total nominal hours for the course or program by the fees per nominal hour for the appropria te qualification level listed in the table above. Maximum fee: students will be charged up to the maximum tuition fee of the qualification level of the program enrolment. Example 1: Tuition fee per nominal hour for one program A student is enrolled in a Skills Building program with 400 nominal hours. The tuition fee per nominal hour for the Skills Building qualification is $2.17. Therefore, the tuition fee will be 400 x $2.17 = $868 Example 2 : Tuition fee per nominal hour for multiple programs A student is enrolled in a Foundation Skills program with 200 nominal hours and a Skills Creation program with 300 nominal hours. The fees per nominal hour for Foundation Skills is $1.08 and the fees per nominal hour for Skills Creation is $1.62. Therefore, the tuition fee will be 200 x $1.08 = $216 (Foundation Skills) 300 x $1.62 = $486 (Skills Creation) Total fees: $216 + $486 = $702 Example 3: Tuition fee per nominal hour with maximum fee for qualification level During the course of 2012, a student enrols in a Skills Creation program with 720 nominal hours. The fees per nominal hour for Skills Creation is $1.62 with a maximum fee of $875. Although 720 times $1.62 is $1,167, the tuition fee will be no more than the maximum fee of $875. Therefore the tuition fee will be: $875. The full list of TAFE courses in 2012 with their nominal hours and the fee per course at each qualification level is available online: www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Page 19 of 161 3.6.3.2 Overall annual maximum fee As well as t he maximum amounts at each qualification level there is also an overall annual maximum fee. At RMIT, the overall annual maximum fee in 2012 is $2,500, regardless of how many TAFE programs a student enrols in and at what qualification level. Example : student's fees charged up to the 2012 overall annual maximum fee During the course of 2012, the student undertakes 720 hours of a Skills Building program ($2.17 per nominal hour) and 400 hours of a Skills Deepening program ($4.33 per nominal hour). Based on their enrolled hours, the student is charged $1,250 (up to the maximum rate) for their Skills Building enrolments and $1732 for their Skills Deepening enrolments. With the overall annual maximum fee, the total tuition fee amount charged for the student's 2012 enrolments will not exceed $2,500. 3.6.3.3 Fee exemptions and concessions for students in government-subsidised places Some students in government-subsidised places may be enti tled to an exemption or concession on their tuition fees. This includes students with a Health Care Card or who receive government benefits through Centrelink. Applicants who believe they are eligible must submit an Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form and provide supporting evidence of eligibility before an exemption or concession can be provided. Forms are availabl e from and can be submitted to any campus Hub. 3.6.3.4 Skills Deepening (Diploma and Advanced Diploma) students From 1 July 2009, Skills Deepening (Diploma and Advanced Diploma students) were no longer eligible for TAFE fee concessions. However, in 2011 the Victorian government reintroduced tuition fee concessions for people under the age of 25 enrolled at the Skills Deepening level. Eligible students under the age of 25 at 1 January 2012 are charged a concession fee of $100 for enrolments at the Skills Deepening level undertaken in 2012. For students aged 25 and over at 1 January 2012, no concession is available at the Skills Deepening level, however indigenous students will only be charged the minimum fee of $100. Diploma and Advanced Diploma students may be eligible for the VET FEE-HELP loan scheme to defer fees through the tax system (as per section 3.4 Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) of this schedule). 3.6.3.5 Tuition fees for Indigenous Students The Indigen ous Completions Initiative announced in 2004 has been extended to cover tuition fees for all enrolments of Indigenous students in 2012. Indigenous students who enrol in TAFE programs in 2012 are entitled to the concession tuition fee amount at all program levels (including a concession fee of $100 for the Skills Deepening level.) 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: of 161 3.6.3.6 What about New Zealand citizens? New Zealand citizen s who are holders of a Special Category Visa* (subclass 444) are entitled to apply for a government subsidised place for TAFE programs. Their application will be subject to the same Skills Reform eligibility checks as local students. A Special Category Visa (subclass 444) allows visa holders to live and work permanently in Australia so long as they remain citizens of New Zealand. New Zealand citizens are however not eligible for VET FEE-HELP (as per section 3.4.5 Ineligibility for HELP programs of this Schedule). For more information: www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe/nz 3.6.4 Eligibility for exemptions and concessions - TAFE If you are a TAFE certificate student or preparatory (pre-university) student enrolled in a government subsidised place at RMIT University you could be eligible to apply for an exemption or concession on tuition fees if you hold a Health Care Card, Pension Card or Veteran's Gold Card. Many students are eligible for a Health Care Card, such as low income earners. You can apply for a fee concession each term for each program in which you are enrolled. Under Skills Reform, concession fees are no longer available at the Skills Deepening level (diploma, advanced diploma, vocational graduate certificate and vocational graduate diploma) for students aged 25 and over, however Indigenous students will only be charged the concession fee of $100. 3.6.4.1 Concession, and exemption categories for tuition fees Concession categories HC Health Care Card holder (or dependent spouse or child of the holder) PC Pension Card holder (or dependent spouse or child of the holder) PR Prisoner VC Veteran's Gold Card holder OT University discretion ATSI Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fee exemptions JJ Job Seeker with Concession JK Job Seeker without Concession 3.6.4.2 Job seeker Concession As a result o f agreed funding arrangements between the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government, job seekers undertaking training at Certificate I through to Certificate IV level will not be required to pay tuition fees. Please note that this does not extend to any other fees (e.g. material fees). A category \"JJ\" or \"JK\" job seeker are defined as a person who is: registered with an Employment Services Provider (ESP) and/or a participant in the Community Devel opment Employment Program and/or the Commonwealth's Access Program. Both \"JJ\" and \"JK\" categories have their tuition paid in full; their concession status is registered for reporting purposes. Enrolment will be subject to the availability of places and to the same eligibility requirements applicable to other enrolments. Job Seekers will be referred to training providers by an 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 21 of 161 ESP - a Job Services Australia provider, or a Vo cational Rehabilitation Service provider, or a Disability Employment Network provider. Access Program providers may also refer Job Seekers. Job Seekers enrolling at RMIT will have a referra l form from their Job Seeker's ESP agency which RMIT must return to the agency. Commonwealth Government ESPs are also responsible for assisting Job Seekers participating in training, so there may be further contact between them and RMIT University. Two concession codes have been created for this category: JJ Job Seeker with Concession JK Job Seeker without Concession 3.6.4.3 College Discretion (OT) Authority to grant a colle ge discretion concession is delegated to the Academic Registrar. RMIT is permitted to grant a concession on a tuition contribution where RMIT considers that its collection in full would impose extreme financial hardship. This ma y include a further concession on, or exemption from, the concession charge. If RMIT grants a concession on a tuition contribution, this is done using the TAFE waiver code \"OT\" on the Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form. If RMIT grants an exemption from a tuition contribution, this is done by a waiver approved by the Academic Registrar. 3.6.5 Concessions for dependant spouse/child of card holder For Commonwealth Health Care Cards and Pensioner Concession Cards concessions that apply to tuition fees apply equally to the holder of the card, their dependant spouse and/or child. Dependant child has the same meaning as in the Social Security Act 1991 of the Commonwealth. 3.6.6 Verification of exemptions a nd concessions - TAFE Students are required to complete and lodge an Application for TAFE concession, minimum fee and exemption form to request a concession or exemption of fees. Students must complete a separate application form for each TAFE program in which they are enrolled.The basis of the exemption/concession should be clearly indicated on the form. Evidence is required from the student to substantiate the application for a concession and must be sighted by the enrolment officer and a copy attached to the application form. 3.6.6.1 Applying for fee concessions To be assessed for TAFE fee conce ssion eligibility, you are required to complete a 2012 Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form. The application form is available from the Hub on your campus. You must submit the form in person at the Hub with your Health Care Card, Pension Card or Veteran's Gold Card on or before your first census date in the term you are seeking concession. If you are on fee maintenance (as per section 3.6.11 Fee Maintenance: students who commenced programs before 1 July 2009 of this schedule), you will have up until your last census date in the relevant term to lodge your application form. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: Page 22 of 161 3.6.6.2 Health Care Cards You may be eligible for a TAFE fee concession due to your eligibility for a Health Care Card. As a Health Care Card holder you could get a significant concession on fees, reducing your tuition fees to as little as $50 to $188 for the year, depending on your level of study. The effective date of your Health Care Card will affect your fee concession eligibility: If you commenced your program after 1 July 2009, your Health Care Card start date must be on or before the first scheduled class of the term If you commenced a Diploma or Advanced Diploma program after 1 July 2009, your Health Care Card start date must be on of before the first scheduled class of the term and be aged under 25 as at 1 January 2012 If you commenced your program before 1 July 2009, your Health Care Card start date must be before the last census date in the term. 3.6.7 Change in concession status Concession fees will only be applied during a term if the eligibility conditions are met (as per section 1.1.1.2 Health Care Cards above) and the 2012 Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form is lodged at the Hub prior to or on the first census date in the term. If a student does not meet the eligibility criteria or the application form is not lodged by the relevant deadlines outlined above (section 1.1.1.1 Applying for fee concessions) the concession cannot be applied until the following term (subject to eligibility criteria being met for that term). A student who was not eligible for a concession in first term who becomes eligible for a concession and then enrolls in further training at the same category (e.g. Skills Deepening, Skills Building) within the calendar year will not be liable for any further tuition fees above the maximum concession rate for the calendar year. 3.6.8 East Timorese asylum seekers Students who are East Timorese asylum seekers are entitled to apply for state government funded TAFE places . 3.6.9 Interstate Apprenti ces and Trainees For interstate apprenticeships a contract signed between RMIT and the interstate State Training Authority must be in place (NSW has its own procedure for eligible students who commenced their training prior to 1 January 2011, see 3.6.10.1 below). The State Training Authorities provide their contract for RMIT to sign. Each apprentice must have a Training Contract signed by their employer that specifies the program and RMIT as the Regi stered Training Organisation (RTO). A form must also be completed to establish Mutual Recognition within 21 days of commencing delivery of the course. This Mutual Recognition process ensures that RMIT has approval to deliver the course and that it is recognised by the interstate State Training Authority. The funding arrangement for these programs is also determined in this process. More information is available from the RMIT Apprenticeship and traineeships website: http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/apps-trainees or the National Training Information Service: http://www.ntis.gov.au . 2012 Schedule of Fees and of 161 3.6.9.1 New South Wales Apprenticeships The Victoria n and New South Wales Governments, through their respective State Training Authorities, have had a Memorandum of Understanding that has enabled apprentices from either state to freely enrol at a TAFE institute in Victoria or New South Wales. Again, it must be verified that RMIT has authority to deliver this training and that the apprenticeship offered is a designated trade listed on the NSW Vocational Training Order (VTO). This Memorandum of Understanding will cease as at 1 January 2012 but will be honoured for apprentices who commenced their program prior to 1 January 2011. The 2012 rate for these NSW apprentices and trainees is equivalent to the TAFE State Government Supported rate of $2.17 per nominal hour, up to a maximum of $1,250 (see the table in section 3.6.3 of this schedule More informati on is available from RMIT's Office of the Director of TAFE . 3.6.10 Fee Maintenance: students who comm enced programs before 1 July 2009 In 2009, the Victorian government announced major changes to TAFE education under the Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria reforms which took effect from 1 July 2009. In line with the Victorian Minister for Skills and Workforce Participation's 2009 Ministerial Directions on fees and charges, under the 'fee maintenance' scheme, students who commenced their programs before 1 July 2009 are entitled to continue to be charged in accordance with the fee structure in place at the time of their initial enrolment in that program. This arrangement will remain in place until the student either complete their studies, withdraw from their program or until the deadline of 31 December 2012. Fee maintenance rates are subject to annual indexed increases as directed by Skills Victoria. This policy does not apply to students who commenced a new program after 1 July 2009, see 3.6.1 TAFE Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria above. 3.6.10.1 2012 Fee Maintenance standard tuition fees and concession rates: Standard tuition fees - Victorian government funded students 2012 fee per nominal Student Contact Hour 2012 Minimum per year 2012 Maximum per year Standard tuition fees (non- concession) $1.47 $59 $939 Fee concessions and exemptions (eligible students must submit an application) Commonwealth health care Strait Islander $1.47 $59 $59 Prisoners, persons on remand or attending a course as part of a non-custodial order $1.47 $0 $0 2012 Schedule of Fees Page 24 of 161 *Concessions that apply to tuition fees apply equally to the holder of the card, their dependant spouse or child. 3.7 Recognition of Prior Learning (R PL) and Recognition of Current Competency (RCC) In the TAFE sector it is possible for students to gain formal recognition of their current skills or to receive further training to update or improve their qua lifications. RMIT offers two services under this scheme: 1. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process through which people can gain entry to, or credit in, recognised courses based on competencies gained. The competencies may have been gained through experience in the workplace, in voluntary work, in social or domestic activities or through informal or formal training or other life experiences. 2. Recognition of Current Competency (RCC) applies if a client has previously successfully completed the requirements of a unit of competency or module and is now required to be reassessed to ensure that the competence is being maintained. RPL and RCC do not include any additional training at the unit of competency or module level. If a unit of competency or module has any training activity associated with it then it is not classified as RPL or RCC. Depending on availability, students who require additional tuition before they can achieve recognition for their chosen program may be offered as state government subsidised program or enrol in a fee for service program. At RMIT, RPL and RCC are offered as a separate m ode of study which will be available for all TAFE courses based on nationally endorsed units of competency and State Accredited units/modules. 3.7.1 TAFE RPL Fees for Government subsidised places RPL is available as a study mode in all RMIT TAFE courses. Students can apply for RPL for all of the courses in their program of study, from a minimum of one course to a maximum of all courses in the program. In 2012 TAFE RPL fees depend on the program level of qualification which have been categorized as follows: Foundation Skills, Skills Creation, Apprenticeships, Traineeships, Skills Building and Skills Deepening. For RPL undertaken in 2012 the following tuition fees will apply: Level name Program level Fee per Nominal Hour RPL fee Concession fee Maximum RPL fee (12 d pre-accredited $50 $500 Skills Creation Certificate I $1.62 $105 $875 2012 Schedule of Fees and date: 22/12/2011 Page 25 of 161 Certificate II Skills Building Certificate III Certificate IV $2.17 $188 $1,250 Skills Deepening Diploma Advanced Diploma $4.33 $100* $2,500 *Concession fees are no longer available at the Skills Deepening level, however st udents under the age of 25 and Indigenous students will only be charged the minimum fee of $100. Calculating the TAFE student contribution for an RPL program or course TAFE fees for government subsidised places ar e calculated based on the nominal hours of your enrolment. To calculate your tuition fees, multiply the total nominal hours for your course or program by the fees per nominal hour for the appropriate qualification level listed in the table above. Maximum fee: your RPL fees will be charged up to the maximum tuition fee of the qualification level of the program enrolment Example 1: RPL fee for one course/unit of competency A student enrolled in a Skills Deepening program applies for RPL in one course. The fee per nominal hour for RPL in Skills Deepening qualifications is $4.33. The course has 60 nominal hours, therefore the RPL fee will be 60 x $4.33 = $260 Example 2: RPL fee for multiple courses in a qualification A student enrolled in a Skills Deepening program applies for RPL in three courses: A, B, and C. Course A has 60 nominal hours; course B has 50 nominal hours and course C has 80 nominal hours a total of 190 nominal hours. Therefore the RPL fee will be 190 x $4.33, a total RPL fee of $823 Example 3 : RPL fee for all courses in a qualification. A student enrolled in a Skills Deepening program with a total of 850 nominal hours and applies for RPL in all courses in the qualification. Overall annual maximum RPL fee The overall annual maximum RPL fee of $2,500 applies for RPL in this case. 3.7.2 RPL for TAFE full fee paying students For non-government subsidised full fee paying students accessing VET FEE-HELP, RPL Fees are equivalent to the standard tuition fees for the course/s for which RPL is sought and can be calculated using the information on the RMIT TAFE full-fees website www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe/fullfee . 2012 Schedule of Page 26 of 161 3.8 TAFE international and domestic full fee paying 3.8.1 TAFE international program fees Appendix 2 of this document tabulates the 2012 tuition fees applicable to students studying under a student visa arrangement (classified as international onshore students). 3.8.2 TAFE tuition fees for Australian Fee Paying Students RMIT offers a number of places in TAFE progr ams on a full fee paying basis. Students who are ineligible for a state government supported pl ace or who are repeating a government supported course may enrol as full fee paying students. The tuition contribution, concessions or exemptions outlined in section 3.6 do not apply to full fee enrolments. Appendix 3 provides a list of the average annual 2012 tuition fees for all TAFE programs for Australian fee paying students. 3.8.3 TAFE AFP fees for programs Cert IV and above With the implementation of the Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria initiative all TAFE programs Cert IV and above have had AFP fees (fund source 3) set for 2012 (outlined in Appendix 3) due to the expected increase in demand for fee paying places. The majority of these fees will be automatically configured in the student adminis tration system, removing the need to manually calculate and levy these fees. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 27 of 161 4 Student services and amenities fees With the passage of the Voluntary Student Union (VSU) bill in 2005, RMIT was required to cease charging Compulsory Non-Academic Fees (CNAF) to higher education students. For reasons of equity, RMIT opted to also cease charging Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) to TAFE and preparatory students. On 11 October 2011, the Australian Parliament passed legislation allowing universities and other higher education providers to again charge a fee for student services and amenities of a non- academic nature. The fee may be spent by higher education providers on items such as sporting and recreational activities, employment and career advic e, child care, financial advice and food services from 2012. With the re-introduction of this fee to the higher education sector, RMIT will also re- introduce this fee for TAFE and preparatory students. The maximum Student Amenities fee will be $263 per student per annum in 2012 and will be indexed annually. The part time rate will not exceed 75% of the maximum rate. Eligible students will be able to defer payment of this fee via the new SA-HELP scheme. For further information, refer to www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/servicefees 5 Material fees Material fees and charges are for goods and services associated with a program of study, such as field trips or lecture notes, reading material or course readers and laboratory or workshop equipment retained by the student after they have completed their program. These fees are not compulsory and students may choose to purchase these items independently. The material fee schedule is made available at the time of enrolment and material fees may only be levied with a student's signed consent . The fees approved for 2012 have been reviewed to ens ure consistency with the above principles. Appendix 4 provides a list of the course (material) fees for 2012. Material fees are also published on the website http://www.rmit.edu.au/fs/studentfees/material . 5.1 Higher Education and TAFE sector Material fees for VET/TAFE courses eligible for VET FEE-HELP are now required to be compliant with identical fee provisions to those that govern Higher Education under the Higher Education Support Act (HESA). The general principle governing material fees is that students must be able to complete their chosen award without paying additional course related charges. Schools are authorised to charge material fees if the charge falls under one of the following categories: 1. The fee is for a good or service that is not essential for the completion of the program/course. 2. The fee is for an alternative form or access of a good or service that is an essential component of a course or program, but is otherwise readily available at no additional charge from RMIT. 3. The fee is for an essential good or service that the student has the choice of acquiring from a supplier other than RMIT and is for: 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 28 of 161 Equipment or items that become the physical property of the student and that are not consumed during the course of study; or Food, transport and accommodation costs associated with the provision of field trips. 6 Administrative fees RMIT has a number of administrative fees to cover specific additional services provided to students. In addition, a number of fees have been approved that can be levied against a student's account as a fine or penalty when university regulations are broken, or borrowed goods are not returned. These fees are principally levied as a disincentive. Although the majority of fees and charges are levied via the student administration system for practical reasons, some Administrative fees are levied outside of this system (ie. car parking fees and fines). Appendix 5 details a full list of administrative fees and charges. Administrative fees are also published on the website http://www.rmit.edu.au/fs/studentfees/admin . For some administrative fees and charges, information about how they will be levied is noted below. 6.1 Service fees 6.1.1.1 School of Computer Science and Information Technology The School of Computer Science and Information Technology charges a fee of $110 (ADM10) for recognition of prior industry experience (Exemption Challenge Test Fee). 6.2 Late enrolment fee 6.2.1 Higher Education sector Students who enrol after their scheduled re-enrolment date may be charged a late enrolment fee. Failure to enrol by scheduled time/date : Unless prior alternative arrangements have been negotiated with the relevant College/School, Higher Education students who fail to enrol by the specified time and date, and who subsequently receive approval to re-enrol late, will incur a late enrolment fee of $175. The late resolution of any outstanding debts will not be considered as justification for waiving the late enrolment fee ($175). Appeals against the $175 late enrolment fee must be directed to the Academic Registrar in writing with documentary evidence (e.g. medical certificate) in support of the student's application.

Students are required to make all payments in Australian dollar currency only and are responsible for any bank charges that originate from their bank or financial institution. Students must determine any fees chargeable by their bank or financial institution and ensure these are paid direct as only the net proceeds remitted will be credited to the student's account. 9.8 Allocation of payments Payment of fees and charges is automatically allocated to the oldest outstanding charge within a student's account (determined by system determined due date, rather than billing date). Partial- upfront payments of student contributions for Commonwealth-supported students are allocated in class number order. 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL date: 22/12/2011 Page 39 of 161 10 Discounts, fee waivers and partial scholarships The Higher Education Support Act (2003) does not permit universities to apply discounts or waive tuition fees for fee-paying students. The only exception to this requirement is in the instance of local Research students who may be on a HECS-exemption scholarship funded by DEEWR's Research Training Scheme. However, universities may award fee-paying students a scholarship to pay all or part of their tuition fees. 10.1 Authorisation/approval of partial scholarships Applications for a partial scholarship are only permissible if the Tuition Fee Partial Scholarship form is completed, approved and signed-off by the Head of School (funding the scholarship) and approved by the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the relevant College. Partial scholarships can be granted on the basis of compassionate, marketing, staff and other grounds. More information on partial scholarships is available online: www.rmit.edu.au/fs/studentfees/partial_scholarships (staff login required). 11 Scholarships A wide range of scholarships are available to assist students while undertaking study at RMIT.

These rules apply equally to all new and re-enrolling students unless otherwise stated. These rules are based on the following assumptions: The funds for the refund must be available (cheques are cleared, telegraphic transfers have been received); and Any fines or other incidental fees incurred during enrolment or engagement with RMIT must be paid in full. The acceptance of the refund rules, and the availability of complaints and appeals processes, does not remove the right of the student to take action under Australia's consumer protection laws. 12.1.1 Refund application process Students who lodge their application to withdraw on or before the census date for a course or VET unit of study will be withdrawn or granted a deferral without penalty and will not incur a HELP debt for that course or VET unit of study. Local or re-enrolling international students who have paid their fees up-front and wish to have their tuition fees refunded must do so by lodging an Application for Refund of Fees (see supporting documents and information tab on the web page, URL: http://www.rmit.edu.au/policies/refunds ) and supporting documentation at one of RMIT's Student Hubs (this form can be obtained from the Hub). A commencing international student must lodge an Application for Refund form for International Students (see supporting documents and information tab on this web page) at International Services. If a refund is to be provided to a third party, this must be specified in or with the student's application. Enrolled international students must also submit an authorised Leave of Absence, Cancellation of Enrolment or Change of Program for International Students form, with supporting documentation. International students who are not in Australia must lodge an Application for Refund form for International Students (see supporting documents and information tab on this web page) with International Services. 12.1.2 Payment of refund Applications for refunds take 2 - 3 weeks to process (earlier, if specifically required by legislation). Refunds must be requested in writing under the applicant's signature, and supported by production of 2012 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: date: 22/12/2011 Page 41 of 161 a valid offer letter. Where a sponsoring body or scholarship agency pays the student's fees, any refund will be paid to that sponsoring body or scholarship agency. To obtain their refund students have one of two options: 1. The most secure and efficient method is via direct credit to the nominated student bank account (or that of an alternative party if the student's fee liability was assumed by the party). 2. Alternatively an Australian dollar cheque may be drawn against the name of the student account and sent to the student's registered address, (or that of an alternative party if the student's fee liability was assumed by the party). 12.1.3 Definition of returning and commencing Students For the purposes of these rules, a student is defined as a commencing student if they are enrolling in a particular program for the first time with RMIT or, in the case of offshore students articulating to onshore, when they commence their studies in Australia. A student is defined as a returning student if they are re-enrolling in a program in which they have already undertaken study at RMIT. 12.1.4 Refunds for domestic students and returning internat i onal students This section outlines the refund rules that apply to all domestic students, and to returning international students. (The next section 12.1.6 outlines the refund rules for commencing international students.) Census date The census date is a predetermined date for a course or VET unit of study. Students who lodge their application to withdraw on or before the census date for a course or VET unit of study will be withdrawn or granted a deferral without penalty. All associated tuition fees will be refunded in full. Students who withdraw from either a Higher Education course or VET unit of study on or before the census date will not incur a HELP debt for that cour se or VET unit of study.
