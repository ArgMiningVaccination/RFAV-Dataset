For this reason, conventional drugs and other interventions relate purely to the physical symptoms, and frequently involve exposure to unwanted side effects. Anthroposophic doctors are conventionally qualified practitioners who go on to train with a fuller picture of the human body, examining the wider dimensions which make the human organism function as an actively thinking, feeling and aware person. Using Rudolf Steiner's principles and related treatments and therapies, anthroposophic doctors often attend to cases which conventional medicine has failed to cure. By responding to the wider picture of the patient, in terms of lifestyle, temperament and sociability, they can re-establish a healthy balance while greatly reducing the use of conventional drugs. About the Author Dr. Michael Evans trained in medicine in Britain, Germany and Switzerland before helping to found Park Attwood Clinic near Birmingham. He was a GP and anthroposophical doctor until his retirement. Iain Rodger is a freelance writer. "}
