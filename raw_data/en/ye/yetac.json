The Spirit of Health A newsletter from July 2017 AUGUST IS NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION AWARENESS MONTH VACCINE -PREVENTABLE DISEASE HAS DECLINED BY OVER 99% SINCE T HE INTRODUCTION OF VACCINES Vaccination is one of the best ways parents can protect infants, children and teens from potentially harmful diseases. Vaccine -preventable diseases can be very serious, may require hospitalization, or even be deadly - especially in infants and young children. Young babies can get very ill from vaccine -preventable diseases. The vaccination schedule is designed to protect young children before they are likely to be exposed to potentially serious diseases and when they are most vulnerable to seri- ous infections. HOW THEY WORK Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but this \"imitation\" infection does not cause illness. It does, however, cause the immune system to develop the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recog- nize and fight the vaccine -preventable disease in the future. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symp- toms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. As a parent, you may be concerned when you watch your baby get 3 or 4 shots during a doctor's visit. But remember, all of those shots add up to your baby being protected against 14 infectious diseases. Although children continue to get several vaccines up to their second birthday, these vaccines do not overload the im- mune system. Vaccines contain ingredients, called antigens, which cause the body to develop immunity. Every day, your healthy baby's immune system successfully fights off thousands of antigens -the parts of germs that cause the body's im- mune system to respond. The antigens in vaccines come from weakened or killed germs so they cannot cause serious illness. Vaccines contain only a tiny amount of the antigens that your baby encounters every day, even if your child re- ceives several vaccines in one day. PAIN KILLERS & ADDICTION Addiction is a worldwide problem that affects many different people, their families, and communities. Addiction is a chronic disease, like diabetes or heart disease, meaning there is no cure. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as \"a chronic brain disease in which a person regularly finds and uses drugs, or regularly does something (such as gambling) despite the negative things that can happen...\" Opiate painkillers (OxyContin, Demerol, Codeine, etc.) can be very dangerous depending on the individual, the amount and the length of time taken as to the severity of the danger. One thing is for sure, opiate painkillers can kill you. Of the 20.5 million Americans 12 and older that had a substance use disorder in 2015, 2 million had the disorder involving prescription pain relievers and 591,000 had the disorder involving heroin. Drug overdose was the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with 52,404 lethal drug overdoses in 2015. Opioid addiction is driving this epidemic with more than twice the accidental deaths due to overdose compared her- oin death due to overdose 20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose related to heroin. Four in five new heroin users started out misusing prescription painkillers. One of scariest statistics is that people including family members share the prescriptions pain relievers unaware of the dangers. Most teens who misuse prescription pain killers ae given to them for free by a friend or relative. ALL MEDICATIONS NEED TO BE IN A LOCKED CONTAINER. TREATMENT : Treatment using safe and helpful methods provided by trained drug and alcohol clinicians can lead to a healthy, positive way of life. This healthy way of life is re- ferred to as recovery. Treatment can occur in several differ- ent places and settings depending on the severity of the addiction which also will be assessed by a professional clini- cian. Seeking and wanting help is the first important step to recovery. Participation in treatment and recovery is shown to improve outcomes. Because addiction is a chronic dis- ease, treatment will be ongoing . RECOVERY : Once the addicted person has a period of ab- stinence and is working on changing the behaviors and working toward living a better quality of life, this is known as recovery. It is said regular attendance to support meetings along with other tools and skills learned it treatment pro- vides the greatest opportunity of going on to live a healthy, productive life. Recovery is a lifelong journey.
