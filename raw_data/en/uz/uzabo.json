LecturerI could not introduce this issue of Heartbeat without first acknowledging the widespread destruction wrought by Hurricane Ian. Visiting Florida's Southwest coast in late September, I witnessed massive power poles snapped in half, flooded homes, and washed-out bridges. It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to my first days as this school's dean, when a 2017 hurricane shut down the University of Miami for weeks. This time our campus was not affected physically, but Ian's impact caused lasting effects in our 'Canes community. One student living on a barrier island, for example, was instantly cut off from the rest of the state in the storm's wake. To her and dozens of others with addresses in the hardest hit areas of the Gulf Coast, I relayed our fervent wishes for a safe recovery, assuring we will do everything we can to help them weather this crisis. On a personal note, if you want to pitch in, the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), which mobilized volunteers statewide, does tremendous work (for local information, call 786-792-5299 or email marc-eddy.chery@flhealth.gov). Each emergency bears its own signature. Whether hurricane or pandemic, though, a common denominator is the need for preparation, coordinated response, and shared resources. I have been speaking a great deal lately on how to address ongoing education challenges from the COVID-19 emergency\u2014first, at the PAHO/WHO Virtual Campus of Public Health-Caribbean Node Meeting, and again at the International Conference on the Future of Health Professions Education led by President Julio Frenk. My co-editor Aluko Hope, M.D., and I also tackled this topic in the American Journal of Critical Care in May. \"In a global survey of nursing education conducted by the International Council of Nurses, 73% of national nursing organizations around the world reported that nursing education was disrupted by the pandemic,\" we wrote. \"...[R]obust academic-practice partnerships ... are well suited to responding to the pandemic.\" For this issue of Heartbeat, we delve directly and indirectly into such matters. Our cover story on page 18 is about the fantastic XVII Pan American Nursing Research Colloquium we just hosted under the theme \"Building the Future of Nursing for Universal Health.\" In the feature stories on pages 14 and 22, we showcase other examples of robust local, national, and global collaborations aimed at building our immunity against the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) that has become a baseline these past few years. As this issue of Heartbeat demonstrates, our strategic inroads and ideological infrastructures ensure a healthy pipeline for students, faculty, and alumni alike. From Miami's Hialeah Hospital to Japan's Juntendo University, each new venture we solidify for our students at SONHS helps us to strengthen the superhighway from education to practice. In closing, as we look to our milestone 75th anniversary in 2023, our mission grows bolder and brighter. I am pleased to report we had 97 donors for Giving Day\u2014a 198 percent donor increase over last year. Your generous support is fueling student scholarships, simulation programs, and other key initiatives. Thank you, and enjoy the magazine!

These achievements are particularly notable in Florida, which has the nation's lowest average first-time NCLEX pass rate. Whereas the U.S. average first-time pass rate dipped from roughly 88 percent in 2019 to around 82 percent in 2021 and in the first half of 2022, Florida's dropped from about 69 to 65 percent for the same period. Meanwhile at SONHS, the average first-time pass rate for September Faculty, students, and staff share in delicious foods and festive music from Latin America and the Caribbean in honor of the first in-person National Hispanic Heritage Month get-together at SONHS since COVID-19. Several positive metrics underscore exemplary preparation through pandemicBy the Numbers Released this fall, the 2022-2023 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Colleges\" Best Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Programs ranked the School of Nursing and Health Studies' (SONHS) No. 29 out of 681 accredited schools ranked nationwide. The BSN program has moved up two spots from its ranking last year, which marked the first time U.S. News included nursing schools offering baccalaureate degrees. SONHS tied with two other private schools and seven public institutions for this year's No. 29 spot. In addition to its four-year BSN, SONHS offers an RN-to-BSN track and a 12-month accelerated BSN program. U.S. News determines its rankings by scores received from surveys of top academics and officials at nursing schools or departments at institutions nationwide that are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education or the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing. Ranked institutions must be regionally accredited and have recently awarded at least 40 BSN degrees. More Notable Numbers As COVID-19 raised unforeseen challenges for health care education, SONHS faculty, simulation leaders, and community partners collaborated on new and inventive ways to prepare students to hit the ground running after graduation. Their efforts ensured that nursing students at SONHS maintained access to hands-on education, both simulation and clinical, to keep up with the requisite skills and experiences addressed on VITAL SIGNS Scenes from Fall 2022 students started strong and quickly bounced back. After starting at 98.51 percent in 2019, it was 94.95 percent in 2020 and 91.29 percent in 2021. But as of 2022's first two quarters (through June), NCLEX scores at SONHS are 97.39 percent\u2014back to nearly pre-pandemic levels. \"There is a correlation between test scores and how long students were kept out of clinicals and simulation during the pandemic,\" says Dean Cindy L. Munro. \"Our NCLEX-RN pass rates started high before the pandemic, and we never dipped below 91 percent.\" Pass rates for graduate programs have been equally affirming of the work taking place at the school. The current average certification exam pass rates for graduate programs are as follows: 100 percent Nurse Anesthesia, 98 percent Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, 98 percent Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner, 96 percent Family Nurse Practitioner, and 89 percent Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner. \"This is just incredible data. Our undergraduate and graduate numbers are equally spectacular,\" says Dean Munro. \"Our students' first-time pass rates are an incredible testament to how strong we are in promoting education for life. The next step is for us to stay at the top.\"VITAL SIGNS \"This is my sixth year at the U, and I still get as excited as if it were my first!\" \u2014 Dean Cindy Munro welcomes students to a new academic year October Students and parents take part in Family Weekend activities. The Dean's Fall 2022 Lecture Series opened with \"Health Equity: A Nursing Research Perspective,\" presented by distinguished speaker Shannon N. Zenk, Ph.D., M.P .H., R.N., F .A.A.N., director of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). Dr. Zenk spoke on October 6 in the S.H.A.R.E. Auditorium about the NINR's strategic plan and new NIH initiatives, detailing approaches to optimizing health and advancing health equity. The head of the Neighborhoods and Health Lab at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), she is known for investigating how aspects of community and built environments\u2014such as food accessibility and food deserts\u2014can be viewed as social determinants of health that impact health and health inequities. Dr. Zenk and Dean MunroFALL 2022 | heartbeat 7 6 heartbeat | FALL 2022The University of Miami Graduate School offers a number of prestigious scholarships. Among those competitive awards, the Dean's Fellowship represents the highest honor, carrying with it a stipend of $38,000 each academic year for two years. In addition to the stipend, plus travel and health insurance benefits, the financial assistance package includes a full tuition waiver from the department for the cost of all program coursework. At SONHS, 2 out of the 16 current Ph.D. in Nursing Science students are Dean's Fellows. One of these is Jiye Lee, who is in her second year of the M.S.N. to Ph.D. program. She was profiled with her mentor, Dr. Yui Matsuda, in the Spring 2022 issue of Heartbeat. Lee came to Florida from Pennsylvania, where she was a registered nurse at the University of Pennsylvania-affiliated Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. A new mother herself, Lee says she is focused on advancing understanding of \"mental and behavioral health outcomes in children with chronic or medically complex illnesses\" in the hopes of ultimately developing interventions that \"alleviate some of the burden these vulnerable families go through by addressing the family unit more holistically and studying their mental health needs further.\" The other Dean's Fellow from SONHS is Dalton Scott, who started the B.S.N. to Ph.D. program in Fall 2022. Scott graduated with his Bachelor of Science in Nursing with High Distinguished Honors from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 2020. In UAB's Honors Program, he assisted with HIV, cardiovascular, mental health, and nutrition research aimed at reducing health disparities among underserved urban populations. This research experience combined with international volunteering solidified his desire to work with immigrant populations. Upon graduation, he accepted an RN position in UAB Hospital amid the pandemic, working in the Neuroscience intensive care unit, which was a designated COVID unit. During his time at the bedside, he also earned a Master of Public Health in health behavior at UAB and volunteered extensively with the Alabama Interfaith Refugee Partnership (ALIRP). His work with ALIRP focused on improving access to health care, language, housing, and transportation resources for asylum-seekers living in Alabama. The experience transformed Scott's interest in migrant populations into a passion. At SOHNS, where his faculty mentors are Drs. Nicholas Metheny and Rosina Cianelli, Scott plans to study violence among LGBTQ+ migrant populations and their health outcomes. Ultimately, his goal is to craft and improve culturally tailored health interventions that meet the unique health needs of underserved immigrant populations. Scott is a member of the American Association of Critical Care Nurses and Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society. In 2019, as an undergrad, he won a group Hackathon Innovation Competition at Sigma's International Nursing Research Congress. Internationally, he has studied in Salamanca, Spain, and done outreach work in Quito, Ecuador. \"I grew up in a small East Texas town, and in middle school, I realized I wanted to help people through a career in the medical field,\" says Scott. \"After job- shadowing several professions, I knew I wanted to pursue nursing based mostly on two observations: nurses connect with their patients on a deeper level than any other medical professional, and there are enormous opportunities for growth.\" Cynthia Lebron, an assistant professor in the public health program at SONHS and current president of the American Public Health Association's Latino Caucus for Public Health, has been studying racial and ethnic health disparities for a decade, and notes that weight-based inequity begins early in life. \"Hispanic children have a higher prevalence of behaviors and determinants that put them at a high risk of obesity, including suboptimal breastfeeding, early introduction of solid foods, and poor infant sleep quality and duration,\" she says. Scientist Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). To advance the science of early childhood obesity prevention, she will develop, test, refine, and pilot Caring for Beb\u00e9: Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Intervention for Hispanic Families. Her novel study addresses two critical gaps in the literature: obesity prevention for children younger than 5 years and minority health. Despite evidence suggesting that successful obesity prevention interventions take place in infancy/early childhood and are family-based, few studies meet those criteria and even fewer target at-risk minorities, much less Hispanic mothers. Lebron's bilingual, multigenerational intervention will harness the power of social media and entertainment education such as video content to promote health behaviors Grad School Names Fellows Bringing Up Beb\u00e9's Health Outstanding Ph.D. students selected for prestigious award with significant benefitsSONHS scientist earns 5-year, $764,996 NIH award to pilot early life obesity prevention intervention for Hispanics will be assessed secondarily, as will sociodemographic information, health history, measures of breastfeeding self- efficacy, and acculturation. In addition to feasibility and acceptability measures, the research team will calculate Caring for Beb\u00e9's preliminary effect estimates to inform a subsequent R01 trial. The NHLBI states that K01 awards like this one are reserved for \"highly innovative research in humans.\" \"There is plenty of evidence for parental influences on their children's eating behaviors, but minimal research examining feeding practices in Hispanic families, including socioeconomic, cultural, and acculturation influences,\" says Dr. Lebron, whose Ph.D. degree is in prevention science and community health. \"Our data and findings on three generations of Hispanic families\u2014 grandmother, mother, and infant\u2014will inform evidence-based pregnancy and early life obesity prevention interventions, and advise actionable recommendations for pediatric and family clinical care delivered to diverse families.\" Cynthia LebronVITAL SIGNS VITAL SIGNS \"Preventing obesity as early as possible is critical.\" In fact, while nearly 14 percent of U.S. children are obese, Hispanic 2 to 5 year olds have a 16.7 percent prevalence rate for obesity compared with non-Hispanic Black (12.4 percent), white (9.3 percent), or Asian (9.1 percent) children. Children who begin life overweight are at least five times more likely to become overweight or obese adults, adds Dr. Lebron. \"Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions, many of which disproportionally affect Hispanics, are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood,\" she explains. \"Thus, preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce health care costs associated with obesity- related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\" Dr. Lebron is principal investigator on a newly announced Mentored Research among 50 pairs of first-time pregnant Hispanic women and their mothers. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either the 12-week Caring for Beb\u00e9 intervention or the control condition of \"care as usual\" and followed for 6 months. Changes in mother and grandmother health and social support Dalton Scott Jiye LeeFALL 2022 | heartbeat 9 8 heartbeat | FALL 2022From 2015 to 2020, use of PrEP (pre- exposure prophylaxis) to prevent HIV infection increased from 3 to 25 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A national plan known as Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) aims to double PrEP coverage to 50 percent by 2030 to help curb this country's decades-long HIV epidemic. However, at-risk populations poised to benefit most from the potentially life-saving PrEP regimen lag behind overall uptake. Only 9 percent of the nearly 469,000 Black people who could benefit from PrEP , for example, received a prescription in 2020, and only 16 percent of the nearly 313,000 Hispanic/Latino people who could benefit from PrEP were prescribed the medication, according to preliminary CDC data. Women trail in PrEP use too. Rosina Cianelli, a School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS) professor, notes that only about 10 percent of women versus about 28 percent of men use PrEP , with minority women disproportionately impacted by HIV and undereducated about PrEP . Data shows that HIV rates are 2.5 times higher for Hispanic women and 11 times higher for Black women than for non-Hispanic white women. Meanwhile, only about 11 percent of Hispanic women have heard of PrEP . \"That is the reality we are confronting,\" says Dr. Cianelli, principal investigator Innovator and philanthropist Michael Incorvaia Jr., who previously pledged a planned gift to the Simulation Hospital Advancing Research and Education (S.H.A.R.E.), has donated a $500,000 life insurance policy in support of researching the science of holistic health care at the School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS). Though from the Midwest, Incorvaia's connection to Miami came early. He grew up in football country watching former Hurricanes quarterback Bernie Kosar play for the Cleveland Browns and strongly identified with that era's well-known UM swagger. To this day, Incorvaia maintains South Florida ties through family and friends. Now, with the University preparing to celebrate its centennial in 2025, he is proud to help lay a foundation to deliver novel advances in precision health care while supporting the U's Ever Brighter campaign. \"UM has a tremendous record of utilizing resources to produce practical results that can be applied to scale with the potential to improve lives across the entire country,\" says Incorvaia. A prominent business owner, Incorvaia employs innovative approaches to enhance both personnel and customer satisfaction. He believes a vibrant economic ecosystem is defined by the people who live, work, and play in it. \"Having a successful business is not just about the individuals inside of a single office. Yes, it's important to have 'your house' in order, but ultimately, the key to having any enterprise flourish is elevating the comprehensive health of the broader community,\" he says. \"I actually have an entire platform in my business that is dedicated to showcasing what other successful entrepreneurs are doing to enhance the overall quality of life in the markets they serve. A rising tide lifts all boats, and that philosophy applies to both financial and physical health.\" In his native Ohio, Incorvaia has parlayed his business acumen into a highly successful real estate firm\u2014The Incorvaia Team brokered by eXp Realty. He also recognizes the pressing need for the kind of high-quality, world-class scientific research being advanced at SONHS. In particular, he is interested in driving his support behind the emerging methods of integrative precision health care and wellness SONHS faculty are advancing, with a focus on prioritizing broader access to more effective, scalable interventions. This is because Incorvaia understands that, even as new therapies surge in popularity and potential, many remain under- researched and inadequately understood. \"I am a huge advocate for collaborative strategies that leverage the latest technological advances in consumer- focused devices, digital technologies, and data science to understand and improve health care,\" he says. Incorvaia's generous gift to SONHS will spur such improvements.PrEP-ing Women to End HIV Ever Brighter: Entrepreneurial Vision With belief that healthy businesses are strengthened by healthy communities, donor drives investment in Science of Holistic Health Care campaign pillarCFAR studies promote equity-focused prevention approach social and structural determinants of health are key to her efforts to decrease health disparities and inequities among Hispanic and Black women. She and her co-investigators\u2014SONHS associate professors Drs. Joseph De Santis and Giovanna De Oliveira, and Miller School of Medicine professor Dr. Jose Castro\u2014collaborated with local women, health care professionals, and community organizations such as MUJER in south Miami-Dade to ensure a culturally appropriate adaptation of SEPA that would increase PrEP use among Hispanic women. Preliminary data showed that not only did study participants have little knowledge about HIV and AIDS, none knew of PrEP prior to the study. After evaluating the proposed intervention, participants expressed that PrEP would be excellent for preventing HIV in a \"machista\" (sexist) culture, where men do not want to use condoms. \"Adding this biomedical component to SEPA will give at-risk women another possibility besides condoms to prevent HIV,\" says Dr. Cianelli. For the new study, SONHS faculty Drs. Renessa Williams and R\u00e9gine Reaves have joined Dr. Cianelli's existing roster of co-investigators. Over the next two years, this expanded research team will assess sexual risk behaviors, social determinants of health, cultural norms, and stigma among CHBW ages 18 to 49 who live in south Miami-Dade's Homestead and Cutler Bay communities. \"This study has the potential to bridge the gaps among research, practice, and policy by building a knowledge base that will allow us to adapt/refine SEPA into SEPA+PrEP as an effective HIV intervention for Black women,\" says Dr. Cianelli. \"This knowledge will be crucial for public health, for the overall well-being of the women and their families, and for informing future interventions addressing HIV testing and PrEP uptake.\"on two National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded studies examining potential barriers to PrEP use among minority women in Miami-Dade County, where HIV infection rates are historically high. The studies respond to EHE and were funded through the Miami Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. Dr. Cianelli's first PrEP study\u2014one of just seven the NIH selected nationwide in 2020 to help reduce PrEP use barriers among heterosexual women\u2014focused on Hispanic/Latina women who are cisgender (that is, who identify with their birth sex). That study and her current investigation\u2014SEPA+PreP: An HIV Prevention Strategy for Cisgender Heterosexual Black Women (CHBW) to Access, Initiate, and Sustain Use of PrEP\u2014build on a culturally tailored behavioral-change strategy known as SEPA. An acronym for Salud, Educaci\u00f3n, Prevenci\u00f3n, y Autocuidad (Health, Education, Prevention, and Self-Care), employs group discussions and role-playing to empower low-income heterosexual Hispanic women to negotiate condom use and better communication with male sexual partners. Dr. Cianelli explains that a community- based approach and recognition of Michael Incorvaia Jr., left, connects with Bernie Kosar at a Hurricanes-Virginia Tech game. Rosina CianelliVITAL SIGNS VITAL SIGNSFALL 2022 | heartbeat 11 10 heartbeat | FALL 2022A committee dedicated to advancing the School of Nursing and Health Studies' diversity and inclusion efforts is spearheading the search group for an associate dean for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. The new position was r ecommended by the Dean's Special Advisory Committee on Faculty Diversity. Dean Cindy L. Munro established the committee in 2020, charging members with studying issues related to diversity and inclusion such as recruiting and retaining underrepresented faculty, explains Charles Downs, an associate professor and one of the six faculty members comprising the committee. \"We are aligned with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at UM, specifically completing a self-assessment related to DEI at the school, and we continue to make recommendations to the Dean as our work is ongoing,\" says Downs. His colleagues on the committee are Debbie Anglade, Victoria Behar-Zusman, Nichole Crenshaw, R\u00e9gine Placide-Reaves, and Denise Vidot. to Downs, this workgroup has been assessing the school's current standards and practices related to DEI, and is identifying potential opportunities to advance and improve DEI at SONHS. \"There are a wide range of benchmarks that can be used, such as racial and ethnic composition of the faculty, numbers of faculty who represent the LGBTQIA+ community, among others,\" says Downs. \"Other metrics might include the number of minorities, women, and those in the LGBTQIA+ community who are in leadership positions, and the ability to retain a diverse faculty.\" Not only does the committee reflect the gender, orientation, ethnic, racial, and academic diversity Downs references, it is a microcosm of overall faculty diversity at SONHS. Besides recommending a school leadership position dedicated to advancing and overseeing DEI, the committee is focused on mentoring support and has suggested regular interaction with the University-wide DEI committee, \"so that we are efficient in meeting our goals and in resource utilization,\" says Downs. A key figure in fostering alignment with University DEI efforts has been committee member Crenshaw, associate dean for undergraduate nursing programs. Last year Crenshaw was named UM's associate provost for DEI. At the time of her appointment, she noted the importance of \"taking deliberate actions to build a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community where ... all members of the University community feel valued and can add value.\" The Dean's Special Advisory Committee on Faculty Diversity meets monthly. DEI Hire Recommended Updates from the Dean's Special Advisory Committee on Faculty Diversity During National Hispanic Heritage Month, Graduate School Dean and SONHS Professor Guillermo \"Willy\" Prado contributed his expertise at two prominent public health discussions on the national stage. First, Dr. Prado, a board member of Research!America, a nonprofit advocating for better health for all through science, discovery, and innovation, conducted an on-stage interview with Ashish Jha, M.D., M.P .H., the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator for the Biden Administration for Research!America's 2022 National Health Research Forum. He asked Dr. Jha about lessons from the nation's frontline response after two-plus years of the COVID-19 pandemic during a discussion billed \"Becoming a Public Health Nation.\" \"One of the biggest lessons of this pandemic is that partnership\u2014public, private, academic, social, and civil society\u2014is critical,\" said Jha. He emphasized the importance of ongoing vaccinations, treatment, and testing, as well as preparing for future pandemics by developing a stronger public health data infrastructure to be supported by a \"robust public health workforce\" engaging in contact tracing and bringing vaccines into communities. Dr. Jha encouraged scientists, public health leaders, and clinicians to combat disinformation. \"Use opportunities to talk to people, to engage people, to listen,\" even to those who don't agree with you. \"That is really critical for how we begin to build bonds back in our society.\" Dr. Prado agreed, noting that everyone\u2014from academics to advocates\u2014has an important role to play in promoting public health. Following Research!America's Washington, D.C. event in September, Dr. Prado, also UM's Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, presented a Director's Seminar for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. The October 6 seminar, titled \"Reducing Health Disparities in Hispanic Families: 20 Years of Research, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities,\" highlighted key findings from numerous National Institutes of Health-funded parenting interventions he and his team have implemented locally and nationally, as well as in Latin America. The fast-growing U.S. Hispanic population stands at about 61 million, with disparities in illicit drug use, pediatric obesity, and mental health issues on the rise among Hispanic youth. To reach more families with parenting skills, said Dr. Prado, his team adapted Familias Unidas into an online format in which an eight-episode telenovela (soap opera) is used to convey parenting topics. \"The telenovela is culturally syntonic. There's a cliffhanger, it's overly dramatic, and parents want to come back to see what happens,\" said Dr. Prado, who shared a clip of an episode. Asked for advice by early-career investigators attending the virtual event, he said it is all about people. \"My team members are more than friends; they're family,\" he said. \"It's really important to nourish those relationships over time so everybody feels valued. Surround yourself with the very best people who complement your skills.\" Dr. Prado also expressed gratitude for the chance to serve his own community through 20-plus years helping Hispanic youth. \"I'm a product of the Miami-Dade Public School system, and it's been an absolute honor and privilege to be able to work in the same middle school and high school I went to,\" he said. \"It's really gratifying to give back to the community that has given my family and colleagues so much.\" Days later, Dr. Prado was inducted into the prestigious National Academy of Medicine during its annual meeting.

The innovative clinical collaborations highlighted in this feature are just three of the successful community-based partnerships forged since the start of the pandemic with the aim of preparing well-rounded nurses to improve patient outcomes in a complex health environment.On a typical day at the UHealth Clinic at Walgreens, you will find Master of Science in Nursing (M.S.N.) students from the University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS) helping patients with a broad range of acute care complaints. Whether caring for a toddler with a rash, a child with an ear infection, or an adult with respiratory problems, the students work closely with UHealth's board-certified nurse practitioners, learning advanced practice skills in a fast-paced, real-world setting. \"The clinics deliver patient-driven care that addresses health care access issues in the community,\" says Sarah Flory, M.S.N., A.P .R.N., F .N.P of UHealth Clinic at Walgreens and Healthy 'Canes Clinics. \"We are known for providing care for acute episodic illness\u2014pinkeye, strep throat, UTIs, and most everyday things that come on suddenly. We also offer COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, and physicals for school, sports, summer camp, and employment.\" UHealth operates the clinics\u2014the University leases the space and staffs interim executive for Advanced Practice Providers and assistant vice president of Connected Care for the University of Miami Health System (UHealth). \"The visits are in and out. You can set your own appointment time, and we are open evenings and weekends, 363 days a year.\" SONHS M.S.N. students, who are already licensed registered nurses, complete their semester-long clinical rotations at the convenient care clinics located inside one of 12 Walgreens stores in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. \"We have an excellent relationship with the School of Nursing,\" said Rubio-Delgado. \"We work hand-in-hand to place 20 students from the NP programs every semester.\" \"The providers on our team love to teach, and the students receive a well-rounded clinical experience,\" adds Flory. \"They are transitioning from being nurses to NPs, which is a different skill set, and our NPs guide them and teach them those skills. They need to develop opportunities they do not usually encounter in the classroom or even in other clinical placements. \"Our NPs do everything for the patients\u2014check them in, verify their insurance, write prescriptions, discharge them\u2014so that's unique about the clinical experience,\" says Flory. \"Students also sit in on telehealth visits and participate in e-consults with specialists in areas such as dermatology, ENT, and ophthalmology.\" \"The students interact daily with NPs who have demonstrated a high competency level and are working at peak efficiency,\" adds Matthew Weeks, M.A., M.B.A., director of business operations for UHealth's Office of Patient Experience. \"Showing them how it's done in a very dynamic, real-world environment is invaluable.\" The SONHS-UHealth partnership only strengthened during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, just when other clinical placements started closing down, and SONHS leadership struggled to provide students with the requisite hours for clinical practice. \"When it was near impossible to find clinical experiences for our students due to the pandemic, we were able to secure rotations through the UHealth Clinic at Walgreens,\" By Yolanda Mancilla and Robin ShearJoining Forces A look at just a few of the thriving clinical collaborations SONHS forged in the midst of COVID-19UHealth Rubio Sarah Flory Flit the clinics with its own employees\u2014an advantage that allows the nurses to refer patients for follow-up in primary or specialty care and to facilitate those appointments. \"Patients love us because we are family that clinical knowledge and quick, critical thinking skills to be prepared for the unexpected\u2014someone may be complaining of a headache, for example, and suddenly develop blurry vision and decompensate quickly.\" The retail setting of the clinics also provides the students with learning FALL 2022 | heartbeat 15 14 heartbeat | FALL 2022In September, Drs. Alonso and Agostinelli came to SONHS to hold an orientation for a cohort of students preparing to start clinical rotations with CareMax. While there, the physicians took time to tour the Simulation Hospital Advancing Research and Education (S.H.A.R.E.). After exploring all five floors, they noted how lucky students are to have such an expansive, comprehensive resource. But as seasoned clinicians, they know there is no substitute for interacting with patients.\"It's so good for the students because they learn real life, value-based care,\" says Dr. Agostinelli, an internist with CareMax. \"We keep people healthy. They get frequent access to care and preventive medicine.\" The positive relationship, she adds, is reciprocal. \"It is also good for CareMax. You are a prestigious university,\" she says. \"It is a privilege to have these students. We at CareMax want to make sure we prepare good professionals committed to the health and wellness of our aging patient population. If we can share what we know, it is a good relationship to foster.\"care rotations as well. Paola Pupo was one of those students. \"I honestly had a great experience and great preceptor,\" says Pupo. \"She was very thorough in her teaching technique. She answered all my questions and engaged me in the process of decision making, diagnosis, and medication prescription. I loved it there and hope to get another experience to work with CareMax.\" Recently retired, Pablo Alonso, M.D., served as the medical director of CareMax's South Florida market and helped shepherd the preceptor program to its present success. \"CareMax is back to basics,\" he says. \"We identify the needs of our elderly and fragile patients and bring them in at a minimum of every three months. We spend time discussing nutrition, educating them, and reviewing medication compliance. As a practitioner, you can't be too busy to look at the patient and see what is going on.\" Raised in Hialeah, Dr. Alonso pursued specializations in pediatrics and emergency medicine before going into managed care. He respects the role of nurses in health care. \"I come from a family of nurses,\" he says. \"My sister is an R.N., my niece is a nurse practitioner, and my mom always wanted to be a nurse in Cuba during the Depression.\" Dr. Alonso notes that wholly-owned CareMax centers have expanded into Tennessee, New York, and Texas. In fact, the company recently acquired all of the Medicare value-based care owned by Dallas-based Steward Health Care System (see page 17). Although Dr. Alonso has handed the reins of the preceptor partnership to his long-time colleague at CareMax, Dr. Cristina Agostinelli, he still has sage words for incoming students. \"I love patient care,\" he says. \"Primary care is not only numbers; it is not just about what the patients are feeling physically. The office where primary care takes place is sort of sacred. Patients share stories, ask advice. You address health care and wellness but also act as an advisor and spiritual guide, like you would talk to a friend.\"One year into a clinical partnership between the School of Nursing and Health Studies and CareMax Inc., the prognosis for the collaboration is looking good. \"CareMax is a new partnership that allows our Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) graduate students to train at CareMax primary care sites,\" explains Dr. Kenya Snowden, associate professor of clinical, who directs the Family Nurse Practitioner Program at SONHS. \"It is an ideal site for FNPs because these sites are engaged in true primary care\u2014prevention and management of mostly chronic illnesses with some acute exacerbations of chronic illnesses.\" explains Elizabeth Markowitz, an M.S.N. program manager at SONHS. \"They stepped up to help our students complete their required hours and graduate on time.\" \"We were one of the only sites that stayed open,\" recalls Flory. \"We outsourced the supply chain to get enough PPE to keep everyone safe, and took on as many students as we could. Our team was grateful to have them, and the students were so thankful that we stayed open and provided that experience.\" The high-caliber of the clinical placement is evidenced by the recognition the UHealth Clinic at Walgreens has garnered: in 2021, they earned the Press Ganey Guardian of Excellence Award for maintaining an exceptionally high level of satisfaction among their patients for 12 consecutive months\u2014over 95 percent of whom are likely to recommend the clinics. Building on that solid foundation of clinical excellence, both partners are looking to future collaborations with excitement and gratitude. \"As more preceptors and clinics become available, the partnership continues to expand,\" says Markowitz. \"We hear from our students that they are enjoying excellent clinical experiences, and the preceptors indicate they love having our students there.\" One of those enthusiastic August grad who as of press time was set to start a dermatology NP position, had her first clinical rotation at the UHealth at Walgreens last fall. \"It was an amazing rotation that tied together everything I was learning in my foundation classes such as pathology and pharmacology,\" she says. \"Many of the preceptors had been students at UM as well, so they were able to provide a lot of insight and guidance. In addition, the clinic offers Currently about 12 clinicians\u2014physicians and advanced practice nurses\u2014precept over a dozen FNP students from SONHS at several of CareMax's 37 medical centers located from South Dade to Broward County. Students placed at CareMax Hialeah, for example, get to connect with Antonio Sanchez Gonzalez, B.S.N. '19, M.S.N. '20, a preceptor who knows just what is expected of them in their M.S.N. program at SONHS. A double alumnus, Sanchez Gonzalez has been a primary care nurse practitioner with CareMax for the past two years. Learning Whole- Person Health Miami-based CareMax is a publicly traded senior-focused health care platform with approximately 2,000 providers and over 200,000 senior patients spanning 10 states and 30 markets. The CareMax platform provides a whole-person model of care, which includes comprehensive, coordinated health care, social services, and chronic disease management for seniors and a network of medical centers and affiliated providers. Although their focus is largely on the geriatric population, CareMax offers students a couple of pediatric primary services to both adult and pediatric patients, so the rotation offers a very comprehensive experience.\" It is a win-win clinical connection. \"Another plus is that when positions open up at UHealth Clinics at Walgreens, we always give first interviews to students who have precepted with us because we know how they perform and that they like this type of setting,\" notes Flory. The CareMax Connection \"We plan to keep taking students to our absolute max capacity and continue this partnership. The collaboration benefits the students and the clinics, and we sure do enjoy it!\" One year into a clinical partnership between the School of Nursing and Health Studies and CareMax Inc., the prognosis for the collaboration is looking good. \"It was an amazing rotation that tied together everything I was learning in my foundation classes.\" \u2014 Gabriela Flit, M.S.N.

There is a tremendous At the height of COVID-19, Dallas-based Steward Health Care System LLC (Steward) made a big move in South Florida, acquiring five South Florida hospitals. Not long after, SONHS joined forces with the large physician-owned health care network. This past Spring semester, SONHS announced a partnership that would include clinical rotations and preceptorships in all five of those recently acquired hospitals, as well as the creation of a significant scholarship fund for nursing students. \"Steward Health Care System and our thousands of team members are excited about this partnership with the University of Miami, and we are exploring other areas where we can collaborate clinically,\" said Michael G. Callum, M.D., Steward executive vice president for Physician Services. As part of the new partnership, Steward gave a charitable gift in the amount of $100,000 to create the Rosa de la Torre Nursing Scholarship at SONHS. The scholarship is named for the (CK) mother of Ralph de la Torre, Steward's chairman, CEO, and founder. \"The University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies enthusiastically welcomes Steward Health Care to South Florida,\" said Dean Cindy L. Munro. \"We are happy for the opportunity to partner with Steward, an innovator in community-based, value-driven, and outcome-focused care, to provide unique and beneficial clinical experiences for our nursing students throughout the community.\" Steward owns North Shore Medical Center, Coral Gables Hospital, Hialeah Hospital, and Palmetto General Hospital in Miami-Dade County, and Florida Medical Center in Broward County. Initially, clinical placements in these five hospitals focused on undergraduate student placements, with plans to expand to preceptorships for graduate nursing students, including those in the nurse anesthesia D.N.P . program.Dr. Snowden agrees, putting the importance of this individual program into the broader context of the future of health care for the U.S. and beyond. \"There continues to be a lack of available primary care providers to \"As part of the largest physician-owned and led hospital network in the country, this partnership will bring significant resources and a dedicated commitment to meeting Florida's ongoing need for nurses,\" said Marisela Marrero, Steward's regional president for South Florida at the time. \"We are honored to partner with the UM's School of Nursing and Health Studies to provide outstanding clinical training and mentorship, while preparing the next generation of nurses to deliver the highest quality, compassionate care to our unique and diverse community.\" Steward created the Rosa de la Torre Nursing Scholarship at UM to provide scholarships for full-time students enrolled in the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (A.B.S.N.) at SONHS. Preference is given to students in the A.B.S.N. cohort who desire to complete clinical rotations and pursue subsequent employment upon successful completion of their degrees. \"Clinical rotations at Steward's South Florida hospitals provide a fantastic opportunity to develop our students' capacity to care for patients in a wide range of clinical specialties supervised by world-class clinicians while honing their capacity for cultural humility, health equity, and patient safety,\" said Nichole Crenshaw, associate dean for Undergraduate Nursing Programs and associate professor of clinical. \"This opportunity will enhance their ability to shine as the next generation of nurses caring for diverse populations.\" Dr. Callum noted that Steward is aware of the financial demands facing students in the A.B.S.N. program, which is designed for individuals who already have a bachelor's degree in a field other than nursing. The scholarship enables UM's Office of Financial Assistance to award ten scholarships in $10,000 increments. The 12-month A.B.S.N. program helps address the nursing shortage locally and nationally. Because of the accelerated curriculum, A.B.S.N. students are limited in their ability to work outside of the classroom throughout the program year. Meanwhile, interest in this particular nursing program is expected to grow due to increased demand for nurses. \"Scholarship support is critical among A.B.S.N. students because they've often exhausted eligibility for financial aid while earning prior degrees,\" noted Dean Munro. \"This generous gift from Steward will result in recipients' participation in clinical rotations for nursing students and offers of employment to qualified nurses throughout Steward's health system.\"need for more A.P .R.N.s in primary care.

'13, was a chief CRNA and served on a cardiovascular anesthesia team conducting clinical trial procedures at UHealth. Today, not only does she continue an active practice at UHealth, she is celebrating her tenth anniversary with the School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS), readying the next generation of CRNAs for health care's ever-changing expectations and environment. \"In recent years, greater numbers of doctoral-level Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) have been at the forefront of health care advancements, not only in their clinical role but also as leaders of change,\" explains Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov, an associate professor of clinical and the newly appointed director of the school's three-year nurse anesthesia track BSN-to-DNP program. \"Our goal is to prepare them to enter clinical practice equipped with the highest level of evidence-based knowledge and skills to provide high quality patient care.\" With a doctorate in nursing practice from SONHS, extensive experience as a clinical preceptor, and national recognition as a certified health care simulation educator (CHSE), she is well-equipped to lead this effort. The current board certification pass rate is an exceptional 100 percent on first attempt for the program's 35 to 40 annual graduates. One secret to this and other aspects of the program's success is a robust simulation-based curriculum, including innovative use of virtual reality (VR). \"We're moving forward, expanding our use of cutting-edge technologies in simulation, building our clinical partnerships, and addressing environmental concerns,\" says Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov. \"We provide The Cutting Edge of Anesthesia Education By Yolanda Mancilla Javier Corrales students with extensive simulation- based education early in their training to decrease anxiety and begin developing competencies before they ever go to their clinical sites. They learn how to manage anesthesia with a full range of patient populations and needs, from labor and delivery to pediatrics to administering nerve blocks for pain management.\" The program is also responding to emerging issues, such as the need for \"green\" anesthesia. As part of the University's Green U initiative, Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov is looking at the relationship between anesthesia and global warming. \"Living in Miami, we can't ignore global warming and the carbon footprint created by anesthesia through the gases that are used,\" she says, mentioning a poster on that topic that she and her team presented at the inaugural UM Climate Resilience Academy Symposium in 2022. In addition to teaching anesthesia science, cardiothoracic anesthesia, and health care tech courses, Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov focuses her research on using simulation and VR in anesthesia education. \"Escape Operating Room\" is a mixed-reality simulation application she spearheaded to teach students how to set up anesthesia equipment in an O.R. (see \"Anatomy of an Operating Room,\" Heartbeat Spring 2022). Recognized by a 2020 Provost's Research Award, Escape O.R. is now licensed and under commercial development\u2014the first technological innovation from SONHS to reach this stage. As a member of the University's \"XR Initiative\" advisory board, Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov helps other faculty who are creating extended reality (XR) projects across disciplines to access emerging technologies and integrate these resources into research and teaching. Nationally, she chairs the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiologists' Simulation Subcommittee, which she helped found, and is the 2022-2024 vice-chair of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare's Section of Anesthesia. Recently she gave a podium talk on \"Extended Reality - The Evolution of Anesthesia Training\" at the 6th Annual International Virtual Reality and Healthcare Association's Global Symposium, held at Vanderbilt University, and a panel presentation on \"Innovation in Anesthesia Simulation\" at the 2022 International Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare (IMSH). She will take the stage again at IMSH 2023 to discuss simulation use in developing competencies for anesthesia machine checkout. When she's not pioneering new dimensions in VR simulation for anesthesia education, Dr. Mitzova-Vladinov enjoys exploring nature, traveling, and promoting Bulgarian culture. FACULTY PROFILE FACULTY HIGHLIGHTS The Josiah Macy Foundation's \"Macy Notes\" blog recently featured an article coauthored by Drs. Cynthia Foronda and Ruth Everett-Thomas on how to make simulation-based education more inclusive. \"Research has repeatedly demonstrated that racial diversity and cultural humility is lacking in simulation,\" they write. \"Our aim is to bring to light the initial steps to examine and redesign simulation-based learning environments.

In Memoriam By all accounts Dylan Edson Santos, B.S.H.S. '23, had a magnetic, exuberant personality and a smile so bright it lit entire rooms. Kind and caring, he was a protector to his friends and a hero to his little brother, Christian. At a Celebration of Life held November 11 in his honor at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, many from Dylan's large circle of loved ones spoke of his enduring values and qualities as well as the outsize impact he made during his too-brief 21 years. Dean Cindy Munro presented Dylan's parents, Isabel and Edson Santos, with the cap, gown, and diploma their son would have received in May 2023 as a student in good standing of the school's health science program. Dean Munro said he was \"engaged and selfless,\" qualities that made him perfectly suited to a career in health care. Born April 2, 2001 and raised in Long Island, New York, Dylan Santos excelled at soccer before setting his sights on becoming a physician. He was a premed student at SONHS when he passed away on September 24, 2022. The theme of his celebration of life was \"Dream Big!\" because, as all who knew him said, that is what Dylan always expected of himself and others. His memorial concluded with a candlelight vigil. I am very excited for the coming year and the opportunity to serve as your alumni representative! For those who don't know me, I have been active in the SONHS Alumni Association since 2017, and I teach part-time at SONHS. As our alumni group's newly named president, I urge other young alumni to get involved, help us steer this school's future, and gain leadership and networking skills in the process. Our meetings will be virtual to promote inclusivity and allow participation from anywhere in the world, but we also hope to host many fun in-person gatherings, like happy hours. As health professionals, you understand the importance of teamwork, so you know we can't pull this off without your valuable feedback and contributions. We are a welcoming, inclusive group looking to increase engagement as we prepare to celebrate our school's 75th anniversary of upholding educational excellence for the health professions in South Florida.

Hurricanes may not have been part of the transition plan, but COVID-19 was. The pandemic inspired her immediate family members to converge in one city. \"We were spread out all over the country,\" she explained. \"My brother has been here [in San Diego] for some time, so this was the winning location.\" For Dr. Arcia, that meant leaving her associate professorship in nursing at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. She retains an affiliation at Columbia Nursing, where she and Dr. Suzanne Bakken are multiple principal investigators on \"Reaching Communities through the Design of Information Visualizations (ReDIVis) Toolbox for Return of COVID-19 Results,\" funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research. Having recently relocated to San Diego, Dr. Arcia is excited to explore the complex new opportunities for health information scholarship that this U.S.-Mexico border town presents. \"It's a very dynamic situation where we're seeing the effects of diverse communities, refugees, and climate change,\" she said. \"My job now is to start building relationships within the community.\" Early in life, Dr. Arcia thought she might want to work in the arts, designing costumes or jewelry. Although her desire for a more service-oriented career led to nursing, she says the invaluable skills and perspectives she gained as a theater major remain with her to this day. At the start of the pandemic, for example, she used her late grandmother's collection of fabric remnants to sew over a hundred masks for neighbors, nursing home residents, and local essential workers. In a larger sense, her research harnesses the theatrical art of storytelling to convey one very important story\u2014that of people's health. \"Theater is about storytelling,\" she says, \"and storytelling is concerned with how we communicate a message clearly.\" To that end, Dr. Arcia works extensively with community members, using what she learns about their concerns and needs to tailor simple, clear visualizations such as infographics, illustrations, and charts designed to help them better manage their health. \"We don't do enough burden reduction, where we eliminate barriers to informing people,\" she said. \"Caregivers are not getting enough information.\" Dr. Arcia's Alzheimer's Association-funded study, \"Validity of Functional Assessment Staging by Caregivers,\" aims to change that. She and her team are developing an app for Hispanic family caregivers of people with dementia in which questions, bullet points, and curated resources help caregivers learn to navigate their loved one's changing abilities. One link, for example, might offer safety tips for bathing someone with moderate dementia who now needs assistance. In recognition of these and other significant contributions to nursing, Dr. Arcia was inducted as a Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing this October. \"I got excellent training at the University of Miami,\" she said. \"The Ph.D. program equipped me to be able to ask and answer a lot of different types of scientific questions.\" Health Literacy Champion: Adriana Arcia, Ph.D. '11 By Robin PROFILE CLASS NOTES Ismael Fernandez Alumnus of Distinction 2022 Photos from the celebration honoring hospital executive Dr. David Zambrana Over 100 members of the business and health care community, including Jackson Health System CEO Carlos Migoya, filled the S.H.A.R.E. Auditorium this spring to show their love and admiration for the School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS) 2022 '17. After hearing him speak, they gave a standing ovation. Dr. Zambrana, who started as a bedside nurse at Jackson and earned two doctoral degrees from SONHS, is now the executive vice president and chief operating officer for Jackson, which, with seven hospitals, comprises one of the nation's largest safety net health systems. The event was sponsored by Vitas Healthcare and emceed by Kim Baez-Williams, D.N.P . '18, an executive board member of the SONHS Alumni Association. Dean Cindy L. Munro introduced Zambrana as \"a true leader in nursing and health care.\" Dr. Zambrana with Jackson Health System's president, Don Steigman and CEO, Carlos A. Migoya Dr. Zambrana with his family36 heartbeat | FALL 2022Growing up in Portmore, Jamaica, Fabrizio Darby spent his youth watching and being inspired by his grandfather, a famed racehorse trainer. What impressed Darby most was his grandfather's devout work ethic and gentle approach to caring for the animals. \"He always taught me to treat the horses the way you'd treat a human. If you treated them the way you want to be treated, they'd win for you,'' says Darby, a senior double-majoring in health science and biology. \"That philosophy translated into how he interacted with everyone. He taught me always to leave a situation knowing that you were a good person.\" At the U, Darby has been recognized for doing just that, combining his passion for medicine, creative writing, and social change. One example is his spearheading of a situation-based game called Answer Campus, created in collaboration with communications professor Clay Ewing, creative writing professor Jaswinder Bolina, and members of UM's New Experience Research and Design Lab (NERDLab), a student-faculty cooperative that develops social impact games. \"I never questioned my identity until I came to the U.S. I am sitting in my biology class. A peer I was growing close to uttered these words, unprovoked: 'You know, if you tell people you are Indian and not Black, they would believe you.' Silence. I did not know how to respond. However, at that moment I knew I had to do something to change the way people discussed identity on campus,\" he says. Answer Campus engages users in complex conversations about race and other aspects of personal and social identity. In it, players get to explore situation-based scenarios anonymously in a simulated world, embarking on difficult conversations from the safe space of the game. As a writer, Darby curates situations inspired by some of his own experiences. \"No matter how good you try to be, I think we can all be villains in someone else's story,\" he notes. \"What's important is being able to have these tough conversations and understand what changes can be made. That's the whole premise of this game.\" Observing Darby's commitment to positive change, UM President Julio Frenk nominated him for Campus Compact's 2022-2023 Newman Civic Fellowship, for which Darby was selected. \"Understanding the importance of having meaningful yet challenging conversations around identities, Fabrizio, along with other university stakeholders, has helped develop an interactive, dialogue-based game, Answer Campus,\" wrote President Frenk. \"Through these experiences and others, Fabrizio has shown a dedication to using innovation and compassion to improve access to quality education, well- being, and social justice.\" After earning the Fellowship and a Sherwood Weiser Memorial Fund for Student Community Service scholarship as a junior, Darby was tapped into UM's Iron Arrow Honor Society. Over the summer, he conducted research on the circadian nature of glioblastomas as an ENDURE Scholar at Washington University in St. Louis and is now studying the role of glycine in zebrafish circadian rhythms for his senior honors thesis at UM. Darby's community involvement continues as well, from leading professional development workshops for Jamaican youth through the Yes Effect organization to serving as a lead first-year fellow for Mahoney Residential College to volunteering with Bristol Hospice. \"Fabrizio is an incredible student leader who leads by example,'' says Andrew Wiemer, senior director of the Butler Center for Service and Leadership. \"He genuinely pours his heart and soul into all of his involvements and fully commits to their success and growth. This young man truly cherishes others and has already left a lasting legacy upon the University of Miami campus.\" Despite all of the accolades, Darby remains focused on being a mentor and advocate, just like his grandfather taught him to be. \"There are many ways to heal people,\" says Darby. \"Medicine also provides a platform for my writing and advocacy work. Why work hard and not lift the next generation to reap these benefits with you? It takes a village to achieve things. For me, it took several villages. I'm just trying to be a part of other people's villages, too.\"Opening New Paths to Healing By Jennifer Hudak and Robin Shear STUDENT PROFILE Jennifer Hudak Congratulations, 'Canes!
