Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Specific learning objectives of the advertising major: Objective 1: To acquaint the student with important concepts, m ethods, and examples of successful advertising design and media strategies. Assessment: Written case studies, class critiques, group projec ts and required cla ss presentations. Objective 2: To provide the student with train ing to make strategically soun d analysis of advertising decisions. Assessment: Group projects and required class presentations. App and web site dev elopment, and advertising campaign execution. Community nonprofit organizations provide an opport unity for students to test their acumen. Objective 3: To provide opportunities to appl y knowledge and creativity to r ealworld advertising situations. Assessment: A professio nal custom website, p ortfolio and execut ion of 23 campaigns are requirements of the capstone. Students are also encouraged to complete an internship at Image west. Objective 4: To develop the student's ability to present wellr easoned conclusions and recommendations in writing and oral presentations. Assessment: Students learn how to complete a S. W.O.T. analysis and Brand Blueprint and participate in the National Student Advertising Competition (NSAC) and community service projects. Objective 5: To develop in students the foundation for continue d selfeducation and personal development Assessment: The UX certificate (available fall, 2018) was devel oped to address the transforma tive nature of the advertising industry. Consumers are choosing new technologies to access a variety of content wh ere and when they choose. Conventional media revenue mode ls are being cha llenged and a ne w type of advertising pr ofessional is needed. In 2016 advertising was moved to t he Communication Department, providing the opportunity to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. As a result, the twotracked major ( branding and interactive experience design) were condensed into a single track and the IXD c lasses were conve rted to the U X Certificate (availabl e fall, 2018) and offered to the entire institution and professionals in the community. Students in the SJB now are able to minor i n Advertising an d add the UX Certificate-previously prohibite d by their ACEJM C accreditation . c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Faculty actively track graduates through WKU Alumni reports and professional social media accounts. Alumni regularly share job postings and participate on the Prof essional Advisory Boards for the Advertising program and Imagewest. There are few graduate programs in advertising programs, less t han 3% of our alumni choose gr aduate school and are limited to advanced business degrees. Traditional advertising titles: Chief Creative Officer, Creative Director, Account Manager, Br and Strategist, Brand Manager, Market Research Analyst, Media S pecialist/Buyer, Designer, Prod uction Assistant, Traffic Mana ger, Product Coordinator, Copywriter Emerging digital titles: Digital Strategist, UX/UI Desig ner, Web Designer, App Develope r, Social Media and Digital Assets Manager, Information Architect, User Researcher Compensation in the largest nati onal Designated Market Areas (D MA's) varies between $3090, 000 (students with the UX certificate command higher compensation). Students seeking empl oyment in the Commonwealth see lower starting wages outside of the Louisville market. Salaries in Kentucky range fr om $2445,000, with 5255% of graduates from Kentucky universities employed 37 years p ost graduation. (Kentucky Post Secondary Feedback Report) Job statistics for WKU Advertising alumni from 20132018 show 7 0% are employed in advertising fields. 77% of May 2018 graduates were placed in the ir field within six months. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Students can use the Imagewest internship or a qualifying inter nship with a corporation or ag ency to satisfy a restricted elective credit. All internships are 200 hours and include two supervisor reviews. Those evaluations invite employers' feedback on students performance workforce readiness and a ski lls assessment. The Communication Advisory Committee participates in curriculum review s to align proposed curriculum to industry. Deficits identified by employers and professional partners: Basic programming and coding for web site and app development .In 2017 the UX Certificate was developed to address this, specifically UX 340 Programming for Media Platforms. Efforts we re made to find WKU courses in other colleges to assist with the programming courses. The Comp uter Science department teache s math based theory and was an unsuitable and unwilling partner. The UX Certificate further allows profession als in related fields to reeduc ate themselves to meet the need for these highpaying te chnology based jobs. Dedicated design course for advertising specific application . The AD program relied on the Graphic Design minor, however, their emphasis was purely aesthe tic. Students were missing mess age and image strategy in bran ded material. AD 310 Visual Concepts in Advertising (available Fall 2018) was created to ad dress this deficit. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) 2013: 53% of graduates in major field of study after five years. 2014: 66% of graduates in major field of study after four years. 2015: 79% of graduates in major field o f study after three years. 2016: 72% of graduates in major field of study after two years. 2017: 70% of graduates in major field of study after one year. 2018: 77% of graduates in major field of study after 6 months.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Imagewest is a notforprofit Adv ertising and Public Relations, studentrun business and its revenue pays for computers, software licenses and a portion of the manager's salary. (Addit ionally, $12,750 was raised in donor support during AY 18 and 19 to subsize salary and computers). Advertising students share in th e Department of Communication's DELO monies. These monies support high impact experiences for students, such as study abroad and internships. Advertising also shares in the Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Distinguished Lecture Series and the Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Internship Scholarship . Further, Advertising students ben efit from three endowed schola rships. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Two professors and one professiona linresidence teach 90% the Advertising major, minor and UX Certificat e courses. Occasionally, a parttime instru ctor teaches a lower division c ourse. Course sizes are limited t o 20 in lab cla sses, due to th e need to have computers for each student. The limit on class siz es increases the costs of the program. The program relies heavily on th e availablilty of computer hard ware and specific industry standard software (primarily the Adobe Creative Suite). Incoming freshman have limited technolog y exposure making it necessa ry to create and sustain expensive computer labs. Discu ssions requiring incoming student s to purchase the necessary hardware and software are ongoing at the departmen t and university levels. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Advertising pr ogram supports WKU's Strategic Plan i n the following ways: 1. Facilitate student advising through a dedicated program advisor who meets with every major student prior to registration and to ensure student completion ( Students/3.8 ), 2.

What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) After researching job statistic s for WKU Advertising alumni fro m 20132018,we ascertained that 70% are employed in advertising fields. 77% of May 2018 graduates were placed in their field within six mo nths. Our curriculum has a proven record of success and professional placement that exceeds the median for Kentucky Post Secondary schools. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are potential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections b e made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: (5 percent growth is considered average) Employment of advertising managers is projected to grow 10 percent from 2016 to 2026. Employment of web developers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2016 to 2026. Employment of software developers is projected to grow 24 percent from 2016 to 2026. Employment of multimedia artists is projected to grow 8 percent from 2016 to 2026 Employment of graphic designers is projected to grow 4 percent from 2016 to 2026. https://www.bls.gov/ooh/managemen t/advertisingpromotionsandm arketingmanagers.htm By positioning the Advertising pr ogram between traditional adve rtising sales and researchbas ed curricula and technology centric programs (UX), advertisin g will continue its growth tra ck. Plans are underway to discuss in terdisciplinary connections wit h the Graphic Design and Consumer Family Science programs. The Advertising program completed a 2+2 Pathway to Bachelor Pro gram with Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) in AY 19. This move promises greater visilibity among transfer students. To meet the increasing need for a dvertising and UX professional s in Kentucky, Tenne ssee, nationally and globally, we will need to expand our offerings in content and frequency. In addit ion to our Kentucky and Tennessee students, we have potential in increasing our stud ent population from Illinois an d the Greater Atlanta area, both geographic areas recently represented in our advert ising student population. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) While considered social sciences, Advertising and Public Relati ons are necessary complements to many business disciplines. These two categories were third and first, respectively, in th e greatestnumberofdegreesconferred categories provided by the National Cente r for Education Statistics. The Advertising program tracks a ll trends as part of its ongoin g class content review and curriculum changes. When social media and digital tactics, such as web content, infographics an d podcasts, became more prevalent in the industry, this information was incorporated in our class content and eventuall y led to the addition of the us er experience curriculum (UX) . Changes in social media constant ly bring new ideas to the class room content by adding new platforms and updating our use of existing ones. As always, the Advertising program and class content are adjusted to me et these changing needs. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In 2017, the Adv ertising program went through extensive revisio ns: 1. Decreased the major hours from 45 to 36 hours 2. Consolidated the two track major to a single track, removing ad vanced UX courses 3. Created a stand alone UX Certifi cate available to the entire st udent body and commu nity professionals 4. Realigned staffing to create a dedicated advisor to the program 5. Removed unnecessary prerequisites for easier advising and matri culation 6. Revising the minor to complement the new major Creating synergy on campus and beyond: 1. Increased the student positions a vailable in the Imagewest agen cy from 12 to 25, creating opportunity for students in other programs 2. Crosslisted AD 210 (SJB 2 10) and UX 330 (SJB 330) 3.

Redesigned all signage and promotional material d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The revised 36hour Advertising major is poised to grow in the next 5 to 10 years as students learn of the ease with which they can construct their academi c studies to best fit their car eer aspirations. The curriculu m does an excellent job of providing students with th e kinds of skills desired by 21st century employers. A blending of theory and applied curriculum with an emphasis on digital literacy will create work force ready professionals transitioning e asily into rewarding and profitable careers. The amount of growth w ill depend upon the re sources available.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) \"I found my salvation on this campus, in FAC, when I took cultu ral anthropology four years ago. It changed my life - all of yo u have changed my life - and I am eternally grateful.\" (exit survey) Anthropology has been changing t he lives of WKU students since 1968. Anthropology is the scientific and humanistic study of human culture and biology anywhere and anytime. Our rigorous pr ogram enriches students' understanding of biocultural practices and adaptations in con temporary societies and in the archaeological and evolutionar y past, develops their cross cultural perspectives, and prepa res them for a variety of caree rs. Delivered facetoface by four fulltime faculty, the curriculum emphasizes a holistic, fourfield approach; handson learning in the classroom, lab oratory, field, and community; and cocurricular opportunities and activities. Anthropology majors complete 15 hours of core courses with grad es of at least C, nine hours in a concentration, and six hours of electives. About 1025% of majors opt to complete additional concentrations. A second major or minor is required. There are no admission criteria or supporting course requirements. There is an anthropology minor but no graduate program. 20132018 graduates rated their ov erall satisfaction with the a nthropology program at 4.61/5.00 and likelihood to recommend anthropology to potential students at 4.71.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Anthropology supports the university mission to prepare students of all backgrounds to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizenleaders of a global society. \"I use the basic concepts and perspectives of anthropology to n avigate the world. My anthropology courses have given me a framework for se eing the world in a unique way.\" (alumni survey) Regarding university priorities, faculty were mock interviewers for OSD scholarship applicants, reviewed FUSE and RCAP applications, judged the Student Research Conference , and led colle ge/university committees like University Senate and Student Research Conference. Anthropology courses were used in 34 programs spanning all colleges: 15 majors , 15 minors, two preprofessio nal programs, one certificate, and one associate degree. Several 400G courses were used as electives by graduate students in folk studies and education; anthrop ologists served on two MA thesis committees . General education contributions were 611 section s of five Old GenEd courses eac h fall during the review period for 186355 (avg=285) students and 5581065 (avg=855) SCH. We offered 79 s ections of five Colonnade courses to 177305 (avg=233) students for 531915 (avg=699) SCH each fall. In Honors, we offered 36 HEEC sections to 1025 (avg=18) students for 3 075 (avg=54) SCH each fall, supervise d several augmentations, and s erved on seven thesis committees. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The fiveyear average student enrollment in anthropology was 72.4/term, 60th among 112 majors an d slightly below the median average of 77.6. The fiveyear average conferrals in anthropology was 17.6/term, 57th among 113 majors and equal to the median average. In the review period, CPE data show WKU conferred 88 of 453 (19%) anthropology BA degrees among the fouryear public unive rsities. The fiveyear average SCHP in anthropology was 799/term, 59th among 110 majors and only 12% lower than the median average of 896. Again, anthropology w as delivered by just four FTF; one was department head in 20172018 with limited tea ching responsibilities. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) SLOs were assessed by all faculty through three components of t he culminating exit experience : written exam, paper portfolio, and exit conversation. Students completing the anthr opology BA could: 1. define anthropology and st ate its characteristics. 2. identify and describe the four subdisciplines of anthropology. 3. identify, describe, and illustra te themes linking the four subd isciplines. 4. explain how issues of cultural a nd biological diversity are add ressed in anthropology. 5. explain how anthropology makes one more understanding of and re sponsive to a glo bal society. 6. compose a logical, wellsupporte d, and appropriately documented research paper. 7. describe and appraise an experience (course project, directed s tudy, internship) in which t hey applied anthropological content, concepts, methods, and/or theories. Exit exams were rigorously evalu ated as passing, passing but in need of rewrites, or failing. S tudents who failed resubmitted revised exams. Our target was 80% of students passing on the fi rst attempt. During the review period, 85% of 88 graduates passed with rewrites, 10% passed, and 5% failed on the first at tempt. Portfolio papers from anthropolog y courses were evaluated by le tter grade. Papers graded lower than C could be revised and resubmitted. Our target was 80% s atisfactory portfolios on the first attempt. During the revi ew period, 97% of portfolios were satisfactory on the first attempt. Programmatic assessment and surv ey feedback indicated the need to improve student proficiency in core anthropology concepts and the percentage who pass the exit exam without rewr ites. In response, we created a onecredit Senior Seminar course in 20172018. In addition to synthesizing key content from the anthropology curriculum, it covers current discipline trends, graduate sch ool, and careerrelated professional develo pment (see 5.e.). The first offering was Fall 2018 with six students; 15 elected to enroll fo r Spring 2019. We will make it a required course once the curricular moratorium is lifted. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the program? Referenc e relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We discuss postgraduatio n plans as part of the exit conversation . We contact alumni and comp ile data from postings on LinkedIn for a central file of status updates. We conducted an alumni survey of 20132018 majors (31% return rate) and will repeat in the future. Through these means, we have data for 78% of 20132018 graduate s. 74% are employed (43% in anthropology/related fields and 57% in other fields), 21% progressed to graduate school (71% in the field, 29% other), 4% did both (33% in the field, 67% other). Relevant employment areas are contract archaeology, CRM, medical anthropology, nonprofi t sector, visual media, and international education. Future employment of anthropologists/archaeologist s is expected to grow 4% from 20162026. Median pay is $62,000 (Dept of Labor). USN&WR ranked anthr opology/archaeology as the 5th/6th best science jobs (money.usnews.com). Medical schools are increasingly admitting anthr opologists (Mount Sinai SoM); a nthropology and evolutionary a nthropology are two of the top ten \"nonscience\" majors for med school (College Magazine). Opportunities in applied anthropology are expanding, especially in development, medic al, and business anthropology; for example, Microsoft is the secondlargest employer of anthropologists globa lly (Business Insider). When related fields (e.g., museu m studies, forensic science, su rvey researcher) are considered, employment prospects are even better. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) One means is employment surveys and curriculum/training assessm ents conducted by national professional organizations . We inventory job postings regarding the tasks, respon sibilities, abilities, and qualific ations enumerated in position descriptions. We collect anecdotal information from employers, especially app lied firms. These sources consis tently identify the following as desirable skills/ training: research methods, f ieldwork experience, data anal ysis, effective verbal and writte n communication, teamwork, interact ion with diverse peoples, mult itasking, cultural competenc y, and problem solving. Regardless of field, 55% of surveyed working graduates reported using anthro pology training \"most\" or \"all of the tim e\" on the job; none reported \"not at all.\" Most relevant are intercul tural/interpersonal communication , professional writing, critic al thinking, creative problem sol ving, holism and relativism, arch aeological lab/field methods , ethnographic methods, data analysis, and eth ics. Said one, \"As a Freelance Videographer I am constantly using anthropologi cal skills, methods, ethical principles, communication skills, and experiences in my everyda y work.\" While our curriculum addresses th ese needs, feedback prompted u s to create a new course in Applied Anthropology . Most anthropology jobs, esp ecially for BAs, are not in academia but in applied corporate, nonprofit, and government sectors. This course introduces applied anthropology domains (e.g., human rig hts, educational anthropology, community health, environmental change, design anthropology) and career opportuni ties in them. Students compl ete collaborative, semester long applied research project s in the local community. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) 44% of graduates earned university honors and 21% were Honors College graduates . Scholarships received by majors included Critical Language, Gilman, Princeton in Asia, and Mars hal (finalist). Regarding retention , time to degree decreased 22%. A nthropology ranks among the be st PCAL majors at persistence and keeping students in the same major and graduating them. 91% completed highimpact experiences (e.g., independent study, internship); seven of these were FUSE funded . 40% presented at department/university conferences and 9% at regional/national conf erences. Two are coauthors on three peer reviewed publications . Of surveyed graduates progressing to advanced degrees in the field, 67% reported being \"significantly\" or \"somewhat more\" prepared than peers. Said one, \"My WKU training was instrumen tal in my success in graduate sch ool. I often say if my professors and courses hadn't been the quality they were I woul d not be nearly as prepared and successful.\" 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Faculty 8 12 Number of NTE Faculty 1 4 Cost per SCH / Department $102 $128 Cost per SCH / Anth Major+Minor $251 Cost per SCH / Folklore Minor $550 Cost per SCH / Folk Studies MA $335 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 377 371 340 433 435 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 67.4% 73.7% 78.0% 83.2% 75.8% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 18 13 13 20 23 19 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 45.5% 56.7% 54.3% 37.1% 12.5% 36.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Anthropology has a history of extramural funding from the National Park Service, as well as subcontracts for ar chaeological surveys at the WKU Green River P reserve (GRP). In this period, anthropology received grants t otaling $103,387, 6% of total PCAL extramural funding. In 201617, anthropology brought in 16 % of the PCAL total. In additi on, $17,835 was subcontracted from the Biology Department. Anthropology faculty completed archaeological consulting contracts totaling an additional $40,480 for clients including Breckinridge County Airport Commission, Ga rrard County Water As sociation, Grayson County Wa ter District, Leitchfield Utilities Commission Vincent Dairy Farm, Newcome Farms, City of Campbellsville, and City of Gl asgow. In the future, this revenue stream could be run through the university, expanded wi th staffing support, and employ students. In the evaluation period, NPS grants employed 12 anthropology students as archaeology field technicians and ethnographic researchers. Four students worke d as archaeology field technici ans at the GRP. Pay rates are several dollars above minimum wage. 43 students in anthropology courses volunteered on these projects. The department averaged $13,955.81 in DELO distributions from online and undergraduate summer courses, including those in the major. Faculty and alumni contributions support two foundation accounts for studentfaculty research, travel, and campus events. Faculty currently have sizeable grant applications to NSF and Fulbright under review. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) FSA is 15th of 44 departments for SCHP in 20172018 and 18th for fiveyear averages. Delive red almost exclusively by FTF, anthropology SCHP was affected by alternate assignments for ant hropology faculty fu lfilling administrative positions. Even so, the fiveyear average SCHP in anthropology was 799/term, 59th among 110 majors and only 12% lower than the median university average of 896. Underenrolled sections by level for the department, which reflects both anthropology and folklore programs, declined by 73% over the evaluation period. FSA is 11th of 40 departments for upperdivision class size in 20172018 and 21st for fiveyear averages. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Anthropology addresses strategic objectives in many ways, such as: \"Enroll a diverse body of regional and global undergraduate, gr aduate, and nontraditional students...\" Though lower than university proportions each year by 0.75.4 p oints, the proportion of underrepresented students in the anthropology major has increased 36% over the review period. Th e proportion of anthropology firstgeneration students exceeded the university proportions by 0.212.4 points in four of five years, and the fiveyear average is 10% higher. \"Prepare students for career and life in a global context.\" As described previously, anthropo logy graduates in the review p eriod were successful in finding jobs and progressing to graduate programs . Four of five surveyed gradua tes who completed professional internships after graduation judged their anthropology training \"extremely relevant\" and one \"very releva nt.\" Said one, \"I teach in one of the largest, most diverse urban school settings in the country, which requires the perspe ctives of holism and relativ ism to actively embrace and respond to the variety of cultures which I am exposed to each d ay.\" \"Facilitate high impact practice s, immersive learning in differ ent cultures, process learning practices...\" Highimpact practices and experi ential learning are central to the program. Said one graduate, \"The ethical principles I studied and practiced ... applies to my personal and professional life almost every day. I am hoping to apply my education to a position developing a plan to address food insecurity with th e Blackfeet Reservation in Montana.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Among others, anthropology addresses the following: Objective 1: \"Improve diversity and inclusiveness of campuses...\" By its nature, anthropology prom otes understanding of and appre ciation for biocultural diversity. This theme pervades our curriculum , and we promote it through campus events that expose students/faculty/st aff/public to diversity. Events included an ethnographic film series a nd six public lectures. See 5.a. r egarding underrepresented and firstgeneration students. Objective 9: \"Improv e the career re adiness and employability...\" Most surveyed alumni are employed and strongly indicated the importance of their training for an thropology and other careers (see 3.d.). Said one, \"Anthropology has greatly helped me to understand people on ano ther level and helped me tremendously in relation to my Human Resources and Management [ position].\" Another stated \"Every class that I took in the Anthropology major has contributed to my day to day experiences and has made me a wellrounded candidate for multiple jobs.\" Objective 11: \"Expand regional partnerships, outreach and publi c service...\" Anthropology students/faculty partnered on projects with campus groups like Office of Sustainab ility, Kentucky Museum, McChesney Field Campus, and several departments. Community collaborators included BG International Center, WC Cemetery Board, WC Refugee Healt h Services Fair, Bristow Elemen tary School, Community Farm ers Market, Green River Museum, Mammoth Cave NP, Abraham Lincoln NHS, and Living Archae ology Weekend. See also 4.b. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Anthropology addresses workforce needs in Kentucky. 68% of employed alumni work here. 39% and 14% of surveyed alumni indicated, in the next five years, they are likely to or defini tely will seek an anthropologyr elated job or another job in Kentucky, respectively. KSOEO predicts jobs in anthropology and archaeology will be stable with 19 opening s and an average wage of $64,193 over 20172021. KSOEO predicts 20 openings by 2020, a 25% increase, and KOO predicts 4.5% growth by 2026. Many additional opportunities for our graduates will come in related areas pred icted to see growth, such as soc ial science research assistants , survey researchers, forensic science technicians, and museum sp ecialists. See also 3.c. In a 2015 AAC&U survey, 91% of employers agreed \"a candidate's demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than his or her undergraduate major.\" This clearly is borne out in the anthropology alumni su rvey data cited elsewhere. Our graduates use these \" soft skills \" in anthropology and other jobs. Said one, \"Although Broadcast News was my major area of study, if it had not been for anthropology I don't think I would be as curious or understanding. Studying anthropology allowed me to b ecome an outofthebox thinker, a more in depth researcher and interviewer.\" d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU's holistic, fourfield anthropology program is distinct from that of other comprehensives. We require cour sework in all four subdisciplines, only we offer a concentration in CRM (a pr imary employment opportunity for BAs), and only we have an Ethnographic Visual Production Lab and related coursework in pr oduction. Collections in our Anthropology Lab offer unique opportunities for facultysupervised student learning and resea rch, which is limited at the Rank I schools. Surveyed alumni rated opportunities to do handson learning at 4.29/5.00 and op portunities to do independent lea rning at 4.36. Our CRM and archaeology students find work easily after graduation and are soughtafter by contract firms owing to their training. Current disciplinary trends empha size the need for training in ethnographic field methods . For example, the American Cultural Resources Associ ation recently argued \"Because consultation and collaboration with descendant communi ties have increased the demand for ethnographic projects, it is imperativ e that we better understand how to conduct ethnographic research with integrity.\" WKU is the only compr ehensive to require t his course. It is op tional at NKU, UK, and UofL; MuSU, EKU, and MoSU do not offer it. WKU's faculty includes an internationally recognized scholar in Mongolian ar chaeology and a leader i n Kentucky archaeology who recently won a Special Lifet ime Achievement Award from the state's professional organization. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) We have offered careerrelated professional development workshops throughout the review per iod. Majors must submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9/vitae as part of the exit experience, so each fall and s pring we offered two wo rkshops on preparati on and evaluation. Each fall we offered a graduate school workshop. In 20172018 w e developed a careers workshop. These workshops now are folded into the new Senior Seminar course (see 3.b.). 43% of surveyed alumni in graduate school are studying in Kentucky. Said one, \"My graduate experience has somewhat been easier (in the ways that matter such as how challenged I was an d what subjects truly educated and changed my perspectives) than my WKU experience.\" 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) We are considering changing the CRM concentration into a CRM certificate . Practiced in government and private sectors, CRM is a broad, interdisciplinary field so our program could be expanded in exciting ways with new course options. It could draw students from programs acro ss colleges, such as folklore, history, resource interpreta tion, tourism, tourism and development, education, and business administration. If we create a CRM certificate, we are considering replacing it with a concentration in applied anthropology , given that the majority of anthropology jobs ar e in applied anthropology and t here are career options in it f or BA students. We can utilize existing courses (e.g., Applied An thropology, Applied Archaeolo gy, Forensic Anthropology), providing students with targeted training and a special transcrip t endorsement. Further, there i s potential for creating a service unit for applied research , through which CRM and ethnographic contracts and other external collaborations could operate. For example, we have expertise to consult with communi ties on historic cemeteries, c ultural interpretation, cultur al competencies, and visual media. One faculty member is a former employee of UArizona's fa med applied anthropology center. We are exploring ways to expand interdisciplinary collaborations with other campus units and have been in conversation with art, religious studies, and public health. College reorgan ization may provide additional opportunities. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Generally, in 2014-2015 the third greatest number of undergradu ate degrees were conferred in social sciences and history . However, there has been an overa ll decreasing trend in social s cience and history degrees b etween 2004-2005 and 2014- 2015, down 3% (NCES). In anthropology , job postings were generally inc reasing since 20 04 until the r ecession of 2008. Afterwa rd, there was a rather steep decline, 34% in 2009 but r ebounding a bit to 19% the ne xt year. Postings started to u ptick in 2011. Throughout this period, positions in cultural anthropology far outpaced other s ubdisciplines, with job postings in archaeology and biological anthropology strong but at about 1/3 the level, a pattern that enrollments in our BA concent rations follows. There was a steady increase in BA degrees conferred from 2003 to 2009. In 2 0092011, 74% of fouryear in stitutions saw increasing student declined, and 19% had no change. \"Stron g\" programs were those with high visibility, interdis ciplinary collaborations, entrepreneurial and innovative approa ches, recruitment and retention initiatives, and opportunities for applied work. BA conferrals peaked in 2013 but declined ove r the next three years. We peaked in 20142015 but rebounded in 20172018 (see 2.a. ). Discipline data since 2016 i s not available (American An thropological Association). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) One focal area has been publicity. Department faculty fully redesigned the website over the last two years, adding more content and making it easier to n avigate, especially for potent ial students. We produced and distributed widely our first departmental newsletter in 20172018. We began targeted messagi ng to students of particula r majors/minors regarding course offerings of potential in terest, as well as more widely advertising gened offerings. We began a multiyear process of developing and implementing a marketing plan for the department , starting with branding in our campus spaces. For increased efficiency , we are working to balance program and gened course offerings to strike the best balance for SCHP. Adding the Applied Anthropology and Foodways courses to KSC, A rchaeology of Environmental Change to KLG, and Paleoanthropology to K S in Colonnade, as well as raising the e nrollment caps in these courses, has increased SCHP and introduced more students to our discipline and our program. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect to return to the higher enrollment numbers experienced earlier in the revi ew period (2.a.). One key facto r is increasing the number of students who enter WKU knowing about a nthropology. Most majors dec lare after taking a gened course, so we will develop a high school outreach program to sh are information with guidance counselors and do inschool programming. We want to expand our focus on applied anthropology . This could be a new concentration (see 6.a.) or, in the long term, an MA. Despite discipline trends, MA granting institutions UK and UofL continue to train academic anthropologists. WKU could fill an open niche. This would re quire an additional faculty li ne, especially since one of four FTF serves as department head. One alum expressed what we hear often, \"I wish Western had a Master's degree program.\" We need an appropriate and permanent space for the Anthropology Lab . There is no budget for the lab and no com pensation, other than occasional course release, for the facult y member who directs it. A dedicated lab director, who could also contribute to applied anthro pology curriculu m, could deal with a backlog of curatorial tasks; supervise increased opportunities for students to gai n experience with collections management, a growing career option, and independent research; and respond to increa sing requests for information an d collections access by external agencies and researchers. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Modern Languages College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Arabic Reference Number: 609 CIP Code: 161101 Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): AB STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 120 List Concentrations (if any): Arabic for Journalism, Arabic for International Service, Arabic for Business, Arabic Language and Culture 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Arabic major has four concentrations, three of these are in terdisciplinary career tracks (Ar abic for Journalism, Business and International Service), which require 39 credit hours. The fourth, Arabic Language and Culture, requires 36. A second major or minor is required. In the three career tracks, nine h ours of courses are provided by other departments (Journalism, Political Science, Business and Ma nagement). Students can also choose Arabic with teacher cert ification (73 hours), which does not require a minor or seco nd major. All courses are deli vered facetoface with the exception of ARBC 310 (Structure of the Arabic Language), which is a hybrid online and facetof ace course.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Courses offered in this major co unt for the International Affai rs major offered by Political Science (12 hours of language up to ARBC 202 required, and an addit ional six hours in Arabic possib le). In the three career tracks of the Arabic major, nine hour s of courses are provided by oth er departments (Journalism, Polit ical Science, Business and Mana gement). Students enrolled in ROTC receive bonuses for studying Arabic and can earn an add itional $1,000 per month for Arabic proficiency. The majority of Arabic majors are do ublemajors, as language profic iency is a value added skill for a wide variety of careers. Graduates who speak a second language can expect to earn $128,0 00 more than those who do not over their careers (source: The Economist ). Most graduate programs in the Humanities require foreign la nguage proficiency. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) As over 70% of program students participate in study abroad pro grams (the vast majority durin g the summer), a significant part of our credit hour producti on (approximately 17% for those who do study abroad) is deliver ed by external agencies and institutions, thus reducing the number of faculty required here , and reducing our credit hour cost. 3.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Learning Outcomes: 1. Demonstrate proficient inter pretive communication skills (li stening and reading) in various settings, which provide students with enhanced opportunities for ca reers at the regiona l, national, and international levels, and/or prepare them for advanced study in language , literature, and culture; 2. Demonstrate basic knowledge about the target culture, especi ally the history, civilization, and society, which enable students to work in a variety of professional settings, such as government institutions, the media, and education; 3. Demonstrate advanced profici ency in presentational communica tion skills (speaking and writing) which aid students in their research, later government work, business or other profes sional endeavors, and to inter act with native speakers in a culturally appropriate way; 4. Demonstrate knowledge and abili ties in cross-cultural commun ication. Assessment: The program has a comprehensive assessment system based on ACTF L standards. Students take an externally evaluated proficiency test of all four sk ills (Listening, Reading, Writin g, Speaking) at three points in the program: end of first year, end of second year and end of last year . The test is approximately th ree hours in length. S tudents receive cert ification of their proficiency on the in ternationally recognized ACTFL scale. Stu dents take a full Oral Proficiency Interview with a certified t ester during their final year and rece ive a certificat ion on the ACTF L scale. On a verage, 1/3rd of graduates have scored at the Advanced level, which represents professional competence and ty pically requires 1,320 contact hours of instruction in national studies, although our students re ceive less than half that amou nt. Students also take the locally dev eloped Test of Arabic Cultura l Literacy, which tests knowledge of Arab history, religion and arts from the pre-Islamic period to current day . This test is given in two parts, pre-Moder n and Modern, as part of the Arab Civilization course sequence. Over 70% of majors participate in partner study abroad programs which also administer an Oral P roficiency Interv iew before and after the program. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Due to the recent creation of th e program (2014), we do not hav e sufficient data to give accurate statistics, other than anecdotal evidence. As part of a Modern Languages' initiative, we are developing surveys of alumni to gather this information. Because Arabic is designated as a strategic langu age by U.S. government agenc ies, program graduates have exceptional opportunities in gove rnment service. This is also reflected in the award of State Department sponsored scholarships and intern ships (see d below). d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best examplewhere the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Due to the short time the program has been in existence (since 2014), we do not have statistical ly significant data. As part of an initiative of the Modern Languages' department, we are devel oping surveys of recent gradua tes to align program offerings and methods to employment experiences. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Arabic program students have received a large number of federal scholarships, second only to Chinese. Since the inception of this program in 2014, seven have received State Department C ritical Language Scholarships, three have received Boren Scholarships, two were selected for the State Department Intern ship program (out of only 34 in a year). 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) One fulltime faculty position is completely funded by a federa l grant ($53,000 per year). A teaching as sistant, who teaches two sections per semester, is fullyfunded by the Fulbright gra nt. Therefore, the actual cost per credit hour in university funds is $132. Additionally, the federal grant allocates $19,5 56 in funding to DELO (CITL) this year. The grant also allocat es $1,280 for student assistants th is year. Grants from the Qata r Foundation fully fund student travel and participation in the annual international Arabic deba te competition in Qatar, amount ing to $40,000 per year. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) As mentioned in b above, the actual credit hour cost is $132 be cause of external grants. Two of the four teachers in the program are completely externally funded. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Arabic program directly serves Affordability and Accessibility, a Sustainable Budget Model by reducing costs through a large contribution of external g rants (see sectio n 4). It supp orts Accessibility, Continuing Education and Innovation by developing a grantfunded online curriculum to be publicly avai lable. It supports Preparation for the Global Stage and Global Learning by building indemand language skills, encou raging study abroad and offering 300 and 400 level cultural courses. It supports Research and Creative Activities Research and Creative Activiti es through federally grantfunded development of new educational d elivery means, including fundin g for DELO (CITL) development of online and blended language education materials. It serves as a Regional Lighthouse by offering teacher certification to transform the language offerings at public schools in the state and offering the only Arabic major in the region, thus attracting students from throughout the state and beyond. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) This program contributes to College Readiness by increasing effectiveness of K -12 teachers by developing a n ew teacher certification program that inclu des external proficiency certif ication, 36 hours of language cour ses, and six hours of languag e pedagogy courses. It supports Goal 1 of a \"seamless, integrated\" syste m by aligning learning outcom es to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Langu ages proficiency standards and conducting outreach to K-12 faculty on implementing these standards. The program launched a summer Arabic camp for 5th-8th grades which was funded by external grants since 2017. To support Opportunity , the program has provided an ave rage of $10,000 in study abroa d scholarships in 2017 and 2018. It supports Goals 4 and 6 by proficiency assessment at a ll levels; proficiency outcomes have been consistently above national averages. The program contributed to Impact by bringing in over $300,000 in federal and international gran ts to establish career-preparation programs; and placed students in federal int ernships, such as the State Departmen t Intern Program. The department enhanced cultural aware ness through the annual Hatch er lecture series and Fulbright s eries, which presented over 15 free lectures on international cultures and c ommunications. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Foreign language skills support a wide range of growing fields. The US government spent over $517 million on language/interpreter services in 2017 alone. While Defense, St ate and Homeland Security are the largest consumers, the Department of Justice and Health and Human Services are also in the top agencies. These represent needs the agencies are not able to meet internally. Ara bic is among the fastest growi ng languages in the US (42% gr owth in the last seven years, surpassed only by Tamil and Beng ali). In the last five years, Kentucky exports to some Arab countries have grown by over 500%. The top three countries fo r growth in exports from Kentu cky were all Arabic speaking (Tunisia, Morocco and Iraq). d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Arabic is unique among language programs in offering four diffe rent interdisciplinary tracks in the major. This is also uniqu e among Arabic programs nationally and a major recruiting factor. WKU has the only A rabic major in the state. As a result, most of our majors come from outside the local region for the p rogram. The faculty also contributes to diversity. Of nine teachers and teaching assistants w ho have taught in the program since its inception, eight have been born in the Middle East region. Each year, the Arabic program hosts an externally fund ed teaching assistant from an Ar ab country who serves as a cultural ambassador. The Arabic club is a joint effort of prog ram students and international st udents from Arab countries. A new federal grant will fund the design and launch of an online Arabic curriculum to be offered at no charge to the public. This will help compensate for th e lack of secondary school Arab ic programs and greatly increa se our recruiting pool in the state. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) WKU's Arabic program continues to work with external agencies t o identify funding and cooperation opportunities. We are working to expand cooperation with the Qatar Foundation, which already funds a number of our programs and are pursuing additional federal grants. We are working actively with facult y in other departments (Polit ical Science, Philosophy and Religion) to develop interdiscip linary certificate programs. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Opportunities in Arabic, as well as Chinese, have expanded fast er than any other languages nationally. Arabic remains on the priority language lists for most g overnment agencies, while tra de between Kentucky businesses and major Arab countries has increased over 500%. We have developed careerfocused interdis ciplinary tracks (see c. below) and have received a Federal grant to develop interdisciplinar y certificates (Arabic and Isl amic Studies). Currently, only one other Arabic for Business program exists in the United States, in contrast to other langu ages. Demand for K12 Arabic instruction greatly exceeds supply (only one fulltime Arabic instructor works in the state ), for which we have started the only Arabic teacher certificat ion program in the state. With a new Federal grant, we are develop ing the K12 Arabic support inf rastructure for the state as well as pursuing further interd isciplinary programs. Many furt her areas for interdisciplinary career programs exist, such as Health Care and Social Work. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Arabic is the fastest growing la nguage of instruction in the Un ited States (Source=Modern Lan guage Association). Arabic enrollments in the first three ye ars of the major have been 300 % the projection of majors we submitted when the program was approved. The increase in Ar abic enrollments at WKU aligns completely with the increasin g national trend. Arabic continues to be one of the strategic languages sought for recru itment by the military, State De partment, National Security Agency and other intelligence age ncies, who canno t meet current demand for linguists. Growth in Arabic programs has been strongest in major East coast metropolitan areas, Michigan, Chi cago, California, Florida and Texas. As the only Arabic major in the state of Kent ucky, WKU is well posit ion to fill this vit al gap in supply. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Using a Federal grant, we created careerfocused tracks in the Arabic major (Arabic for B usiness, Journalism, and International Service) in coordination with faculty from other departments, being the only language to offer such specializations. We also created the only Arabic K12 teacher certification program in the s tate. With our new 20182020 Federal grant, we are creating a completely online Arabic basic course for distance learning, a teacher support network, and a Colonnade course for the Foundations and one for the Connection s level. The Federal grants also provide four years of salary and benefits for a fulltime instructor of Arabic, and provided $10,000 in stude nt scholarships. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect continued growth in the Arabic major through the teac her certificationprogram, new career tracks, presence in Colonnade and the outreach through the free online course to hi gh school level, and our increased capacity with a grant funded instructor. Based on our recruitment and retention rate s, the Arabic program can easily exceed 100 majors in five years. With the train ing and sending Arabic certified teachers , over the next ten years, we expect to see significant growth in K12 Arabic enrollments that will lead to s teadily increasing A rabic majors, in the range of 150. We are pursuing internation al cooperation with Arabic educational foundations which would con siderably reduce costs. The gre atest need is for a presence in the Colonnade program to expo se students to Arabic, for whic h have developed proposals. e.

(maximum 200 words) Accredited by NASAD, the Art History Major (613) was instituted in 2009 to serve an important cohort of WKU students who seek to in vestigate how visual imagery in its myri ad forms engages and motivates\u2014not merely records\u2014political, social, cultur al, economic, an d intellectual movements that impel hu man civilization. These students graduate prepared to suc ceed in a world that is as nev er before defined by images. Armed with multidisciplanary ve rbal and visual literacy paired with critical thinking skills, our graduates find careers within and beyond the di scipline. 613 comprises one of a triad of Art Majors: The professional 514 BFA (mostly making), the liberal art s 509 AB (a blend of making and interpretation), and th e 613 AB in Art History (mostly interpretation). Courses are predominantly lecturefor mat, with ample online, study abroad, and internship options, one studio c ourse, and one capstone seminar . A minor or additional major is required. WKU's Art History Major is the only ar t history major offered in Kent ucky outside of UK and the U niversity of Louisville. Art History faculty ar e adept in developing new course delivery methods, have created robust and wellevaluated online courses, and teach summer, JTerm, and studyabroad cour ses to accommodate student schedules and enhance student learning.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) In 201718, 53% of students enrolle d across all art history cou rses majored in another Art program; an additional 42% majored in programs outside Art, meaning the SCHP reported here (capturing only art history majors) reflects only 5% of SCHP produced by art history courses. The program teaches four Colonnade courses (two Explorations and two Connections). Faculty teach courses necessary for all three departmental majo rs. 613 courses provide integral support to our other NASADaccredited programs, teaching the ex pected breadth and scope of art history required for accreditation. Taught by just two faculty lines, 613 courses co mprise 25% of the 509, 20% of the 514, 100% of the 21hour art history minor, 25% of the graphic design minor, and key components of Colonnade. Ten art history courses are elec tives for the Popular Culture M ajor, two for the Religious Studies Major, two for the Classical Studies Minor, and one each for certificates in M iddle East Studies, Asian Studies, and Brewing and Distilling. Decreasing major numbers reflect national and WKU enrollment tr ends and a decline begi nning in 2013 with a NASADrequired 3 additional program hours. See 6c for strategie s to reverse this trend. A recent enrollment snapshot shows 12 majors, already a 50% increase. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The art history major is an effi cient, valueadded program that teaches courses required for our other larger departmental majors. With just two fulltime art histo ry faculty whose primary respo nsibilities are to serve our 200+ other Art Majors, we currently support 12 Art Hist ory Majors (up 4 this semester from the 8 listed here). UK has 21 majors, but utilizes 6 fulltime art history faculty to serve them. Louisv ille has just 18 art history majors served by 6 fulltime art history faculty. When measur ed by major to faculty ratio we are the most efficient program in the Commonwealth. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Our program is accredited by NASA D (National Association of Sch ools of Art and Design), wi th SLOs based on their recommendations. In summary, they dictate that graduates must: 1. Know the History of Art, including nonWestern Art 2. Know World History 3. Know how to do research and use evidence to make and evalua te arguments 4. Communicate ideas effectively We utilize papers produced by st udents in our capstone seminar to assess SLOs. Using exp ert readers from within and outside of the department, we assess the quality of student work in terms of (a) writing ability and (b) content (use of evidence/argumen tation, and mastery of subject matter). Evaluations have found that while our students have a fairly high degree of subject mastery and resea rch skills, they are slightly less likely to write well and articulate their thoughts e ffectively in prose. To this end we have incorporated basic writing \"best practices\" into our introductory course lect ures re: prose style and sente nce structure. We have also emphasized the resources available to students on campus to assist them with b asic composition skills (e.g. The WKU Writing Center). As we move forward, we anticipate that these additiona l points of emphasis will bear fruit in closing the loop. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Our department consistently tracks data related to employment a nd graduate school admissions with regard to our graduates. Over the past five years, we have accurate data on 91.3% of our graduates. 43% of our graduates earned or are enrolled in an ad vanced degree program in art his tory or aesthetics, a nd 100% of graduates for which we have data are either employed or currently enrolled in a graduate program. 50% are employed in visual artsrelated fields including curators, teachers, professors, m useum personnel, and art conservators, while the other 50% work in fields that inc lude law, educational administ ration, and journalism. These numbers reflect the strength of our program and our ability to leverage close, coll egial relationships with s tudents into successful placement in graduate school and diverse career paths. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Our program maintains productive relationships with the Speed, Cincinnati, Taft, and Frist Museums of Art. Our department has recently evaluated and restructured our internsh ip program and now routinely solicits feedback from students' internship hosts. As our placements include indu stries that hire art his tory graduates, such as museums and galleries, we anticip ate using this information to ensure our art history curriculum is aligned with necessary employability skills. The most common \"skills gap\" with which employers currently gra pple, according to a 2017 study by Andrew Weaver in the MIT Technology Review , are deficiencies in reading a nd writing\u2014precisely the skills that our art history program is well equipped to endow. We train our student s to think critically and compose valid arguments based on a mastery of factual information. Armed with visual, c ultural, and historical liter acy, our students, as the diversity of their employment pa ths demonstrate, are adaptable to changing economic realit ies and are successful in many fields. Remarkably, a full half of art hi story program graduates find f ulltime jobs in the visual arts. This, plus our high rate of success at placing student s in other fields, is ample e vidence that our program produces students with skillsets that are wellmatched to employer needs . e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) 26% of our graduates over the past five years have *won* a majo r national fellowship or competitive campus based award, including two Fulbright Scholars, a Gilman Fellow, an Ogden Fou ndation Scholar, one WKU University Research Award, a WKU Lifetime Experience Grant and multiple WKU FUSE grants. At many museums in our region, we have multiple interns and emp loyees. 22% of our graduates over the past five years were Honors Students. We are proud of our ability to make connections for them for competitive national fellowships, internships, graduate school, and meaning ful employment. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) We will soon receive more than $80,000 in scholarship funds *pe r year* from the Jerry Baker Foundation, a gift that will transform the Art Depa rtment and greatly enhance the Art History Program. The student financial support made possible by this gift and the publicity that will flow from it will tremendous ly enhance our ability to recruit, retain, and graduate students. It makes no strategic sense to cut major programs in the arts at WKU at the precise moment that financia l support, after so many lean y ears, is set to unleash a new opportunity for vigorous growth. Courses in the Art History Progr am generate the overwhelming ma jority of DELO funds for the Art Department. These funds provide the primary source of support for faculty t hroughout the department for professional development, including supplies, travel, and shipping costs ass ociated with exhibiting thei r artwork and research. Many art history courses are taught by our two fulltime facult y during summer and winter term, online, during study abroad trips, and as onde mand courses for nontraditiona l students. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) A more accurate underenrolled course calculation is 28.7%. See the 509 or 514 report fo r cost and underenrolled course calculation information. The primary jobs of the two full time art history faculty are t o support the 509 and 514 de partmental majors and Colonnade. Only 5% of those faculty members' SCHP is devoted to art history majors/ minors. This makes the art history major/minor programs remarkably affordable and efficien t. If either were eliminated, the course rotation and professional responsibilities of our art history faculty wo uld not change, as these courses are required to maintain NASAD accredit ation and for progra ms both in and outsi de of the art department. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Effective instruction in art his tory depends upon firsthand en gagement with objects in their global contexts. We leverage this inherent aspect of our field to create and promot e study abroad opportunities, supporting the strategic plan goal to \"expand offcampus educational opportunities.\" While art history faculty comprise only 2 of 13 fulltime faculty in the art department, they have design ed and led over 50% of the department's Faculty Led Study Abroad opportunities over the past 10 years, includin g leading courses in Turkey, Italy (twice), the Netherlands, and France, and pr ovided $8,000 in student financi al aid for those trips. The Art History Program also lev erages the global scope of its course offerings to \"prepare students for a career and life in a global context.\" With nonwestern content in every course, the program provides students with a systematic knowledge of the way images articulate connections b etween culture, politics, economics, science and a plethora of other fields of hum an activity around the world. Our study abroad experiences, success at encouraging and suppor ting student internships and supporting our students to win competitive natio nal fellowships all constitute \"high impact pra ctices to develop hard and soft skills as well as to cultivate good, productive citizens.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The art history program is stro ngly aligned with the CPE's stra tegic agenda, where the phrase \" support a higher quality of life \" appears many times. The arts a re and have always been at the center of life in Kentucky. A vibrant visual arts community makes communities in Kentucky more desira ble places to live and work, and supports the CPE's charge to \" attract high w age employers \" to Kentucky. Our program produces employees who make the arts accessible to our citizens. The first thing listed on the \" We Value \" graphic on page 4 of the agenda is \" Academic Excellence and Student Success.\" The Art History Program at WKU has been impressively profic ient at producing both of those things. Accredited by NASAD, we have a decadelong legacy of producing students who perform both in the classroom and in the workforce. See our a nswer to question 3(c & e) abov e to this regard. Access to higher education is also a central tenet of the CPE's strategic agenda. Our fo rthcoming infusion of student aid from the Baker Foundation will allow us to greatly enhance the ability of our students to afford their degrees. We look forward to implementing this financial aid to transformatively expand access. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Bureau of Labor Statistics h as recorded a 5.89% drop in art history majors since 2015 and a 4.6% increase in the number of artsrelated jobs. This positions our graduates t o take advantage of an upward trend in employment sector growth. There are over 200 museums and hi storical societies located in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. There are important jobs to do at each and every one of these institution s, and we are proud that our program has produced graduates who work at so me of the most important ones, including the Frazier Museum of History and the Speed Museum of Art in Louis ville. According to the Nation al Arts Administration and Public Policy Database, \"The economic impact of the arts in Kentucky due to arts spendi ng, arts donations, and spending at restaurants, hotels and shopping near arts ev ents was estimated to be $41.5 million in worker inco me and 2,400 fulltime equivalent jobs in the last year.\" The arts enhance our lives in unmeasurable ways, but they are also an integral part of Kentucky's economy and we are proud that the art histor y major is helping to provide leaders for our arts institutions as our Commonwealt h moves forward into the 21st Century. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU's Art History Major is the o nly major program in the field offered at a nonflagship, nonresearchone state university campus in our Commonw ealth. It's remarkable when an understated art history program at a regional state university in southcentral Kentucky produces two Fulbright Scholars, a Gilman Scholar, a WKU Ogden Foundation Scholar, a WKU Lifeti me Experience Grant winner and multiple WKU FUSE grants in a short span of time and gets every single one of its students who wish to go to graduate school into a major researchone program. We do that. Our students build c lose relationships with facul ty that clearly benefit their research, the quality of their education, and the specificity/quality of thei r faculty mentorship. There are plenty of larger art history programs in the United States at flagship campuses with their own discrete art history departments who have never produced a Fulbright Scholar. As previously stated, our two art history fa culty provide the m ain source of DELO teaching/income for the department. We design and teach courses that cover the history of art in Asia, Africa, PreColumbian North and South America, and the Islamic world, adding to the diversity o f WKU's curriculum. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) We are an efficient, highly reputable, valueadded program that routinely produces preem inently successful WKU Graduates. Our majors don't stumble upon the program, but seek us out deliberately. And because of that, they succeed. They are highly invested and passionate about the fiel d, and it would be a profoundly unstrategic net loss to WKU to simply send them away to another university . We are the only fullfle dged art history major in Kentucky that isn't at a flagshi p campus. We are proud of our a ccomplishments and what we continue to accomplish year after year. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) We envision the future of the ar t history program as one that b etter integrates the liter acy, skills, and body of knowledge we provide for our stude nts into other fields taught on campus. We will acco mplish this through targeted advising that better pr epares students for specific ca reer paths. For instance, careers in art conservation, restoration, and hi storical preservation require a knowledge of both art and chemistry/materials science. Copyright law demands p roficiency in visual analysis and the interpretation of style and influence of precisely the kind that we teac h in our classes. Medicine reli es upon the careful evaluation of images and graphic data. Art Therapy is a growing field that requires a knowledge of both art history and de velopmental psychology. We will emphasize art history not only as a standalone discipl ine, but also as a major to be paired with other fields that maximize opportunities for student success in a wor ld where STEM fields are increasingly important. We are nimble enough to adjust to whatever strategic emphases a re required moving forward. Our program stands easily on its own but is a lso seamlessly integrated with other programs to create curricular combinations that adapt to changing vocational landscapes. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The visual arts are alive and we ll in the US. According to the American Alliance of Museums, museums are economic engines that support 720,000 jobs and contribute over $50 billion to the US econ omy each year. Last year, there were over 850 million museum visits, more than the attendance for all major league sporting events and theme parks combined. While the number of degrees award ed in the humanities since 200 1 remains flat, the job opportunities for students majoring in art history are growing. The Bureau of La bor Statistics estimates a 14% increase in curatorial positions in American museums by 2026. In 2016, there were 4,3 30 undergraduate art history degrees awarded in the United States, a 5.89% drop from 2015, but at the same t ime there was a 4.6% increase in the number of visual artsrelated jobs. In ot her words, there is more opport unity for students who get an art history degree now than there has been for those entering the workforce with the s ame major in the past. This is an encouraging trend. Our students have jobs wa iting for them, and the data sh ow that our program is doing a great job of preparing them for their new careers. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three yearsto increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In 2014, NASAD require d an additional 3 cre dits for the 613 cur riculum, raising the total from 33 to 36. This made us less competitive with other humanities majors within Potter College and caused a drop in our majors. To address this issue, we are implementing the following changes: 1. We created two Connections co urses that count as major prog ram electives. This allows students to simultaneously fulfill a major elective and a Colonnade require ment. 2. We are adding Art 325 (NonWes tern Art) and Art 407 (Islami c Art and Architecture) as additional Connections courses, which allows another oppo rtunity for students to simul taneously fulfill a major and Colonnade requirement. 3. We are increasing the number o f online courses during the F all and Spring semesters so that students who doublemajor in Studio (which requires classes with more contac t hours) and Art History can more easily negotiate their schedules. 4. We plan to incorporate the Colonnade requirement HIST 101/1 02 (World History) as a required course in the art history curriculum to help streamline students' progression through the program. 5. We are implementing a more active and vigorous recruitment s trategy that utilizes socia l media as well as more traditional methods of oncampus marketing and engagement. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) With our streamlined curriculum and enhanced recruiting strateg y, we envision sustainable growth in number of majors, whom we will encourage to pair art history with a secon d field that helps them de velop skills applicable to specific career paths. Our pro gram will utilize its natural po ints of engagement with th e Colonnade Program to be more efficient, adding a World C ivilization course requirement to the curriculum in lieu of another art history course to help students progress in a more timely manner toward s graduation. We will increase our study abroad and study away opportunities to provide lifechanging experient ial learning for our majors that also allow them additional opportunities to take relevant courses in the curric ulum. We will continue to mentor our students towards winning prestigious competitive fellowships and nationa l awards, gain entry into competitive graduate programs, and find gainful and meaningful employment as they make their w ay in the world as informed, cr itically acute, productive citizens. The Baker gift will revolutionize what we're able to accomplis h with our art history program. The publicity opportunities alone that come with this act of generosity will greatly enhance our recruiting efforts for the Art Hi story Major for years to come. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major , minor, or certificate) , supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admission. (maximum 200 words) The Asian Religions and Cultu res (ARC) major is interdiscipl inary and requires 31 hours t o complete. Majors must take three religion courses, two his tory/political science courses, one year of a language (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Arabic), three electives (which may include one additional year of language) a nd a one hour senior seminar. M ajors must also take a second major and minor. Most majors have two or three other majors, a s ARC pairs well with maj ors in Chinese, Arabic, International Affairs, Internati onal Business, and other progra ms that are international in focus (e.g., the Chinese Flagship program). While all the courses to compl ete the major are generally ta ught in a classroom setting (rather than online), at least 40% of our majors also study abroad in the Middle East and/or Asia. S ome of our majors who are also part of the Chinese Flagship program complete some of their language study either at Indiana University or abroad. As an interdisciplinary major, most of the courses that coun t toward ARC are those that are r egularly taught for other majo rs across WKU. Thus, the costs asso ciated with the program are mi nimal (see section 4). COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELF-STUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in suppor t of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, a nd interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) As an interdisciplinary program , majors take courses from pr ograms and departments across the university (i.e., religion, history, political science, modern languages, geography, sociol ogy, English, film, etc.). The major fill seats in these departments, and the religion courses offered for the ARC major (e.g., Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Islam, and so on) contribute to other programs requiring students to take courses in other departments (e.g., international affairs, Chinese, Arabic, the Chinese Flagship program, and others). ARC contributes to several university missions and prioritie s. Approximately 30% o f the courses that c ount toward ARC are part of Colonnade. Focused on the Middle East a nd Asia, ARC pr epares students for the \"Globa l Stage,\" thus ensuring that, per WKU's strategic plan \"a world view and international issues are intentionally incorporated across the curriculum.\" Moreover, by providing students with a broad foundation (religi on, culture, history, politics, economics, geography, languages), majors are prepared \"to enter a competitive global workforce\" with the tools to \"think critically, solve problems, and engage effectivel y with others.\" Over 40% of ARC majors study abroad. Thus, the ARC major \"[ p]rovide opportunities for people of the region to be educated, entertained, assisted, and inspired outside the class room\" thus, facilitating \"the transferability of students and develop[ing] faculty and staff e xchange opportunities with othe r academic institutions.\" c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The number of majors has remained somewhat consistent. We r esponded to the slight decrease in enrolled students this year by increasing our social media presence and offering targeted r ecruitment events to Ch inese, Arabic and International Affair students. Those efforts are paying off; we have added another 3 majors since the fall census date cutoff. The SCHP number given in the data above for the major is ina ccurate. In our department, faculty simultaneously teach both religion and ARC majors (with the exception of the one hour ARC senior seminar [taught once a year as an overload]); thus, if we count that in a single course we have both religion and ARC majors, our SCHP is closer to 450. 3.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificat es may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of a ssessment were used to improve the program (i.e., closin g-the-loop). ( maximum 300 words) There are 4 SLO for ARC: communicate clearly and effectively in written work; construct and effectively write a thesis for a research paper and defend it through the use of relevant lite rature and resources; locate the relevant literature or resources for research paper; an d utilize relevant literature o r resources to defend research paper thesis. These SLOs for ARC are assessed in two ways. Given that the program is interdisciplinary, the method used to assess students was their final grade in courses that require a resear ch paper. Discussin g objectives with faculty across the university, the program determined that students receiving an A or B in such courses meet the learning outcomes. The second means of assessing the outcomes i s through ARC 49 9. Given the interdisciplinar y nature of the major, that senior seminar was changed (closing the loop) from a 3 hour cou rse to a one hour course in which students produce writings in the form of grant applications, fellowships, and/or research pa pers that contain a well-worded thesis statement, that illustra te clear and effective communication , that show their own familiar ity with the relevant sources, a nd also that bring together multiple disciplines. To assess the students, there is an assessment committee tha t meets at the end of each academ ic year to judge the papers using a 4 point scale: Far exc eeds expectations, exceeds expect ations, meets expectations and does not meet expectations. For the two past year, over 85% of the students enrolled in the cou rse met or exceeded expectations. c. In what ways does the program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progre ssing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The program sends out surveys each year to graduates of our p rogram. Given that the program is a relatively new one, we only have data from the past three years. From surveys conducted, we have found that out of 24 students who responded, 4 were living and working in Asia while the rest where living and working or pursuing graduate school in th e U.S. Of the 24 students, five were involved in administrativ e work, four in education, three i n IT, and the rest in a variety of fields including the State Department, and several worldwid e foundations (Bring me Hope Foundation, UBI Taiwan). Given the international and in terdisciplinary focus of our p rogram, the key professional op portunities for students are wit h global companies, NGOs either in the U.S. or abro ad, or with th e government (most commonly, the State Department). Approximately 20-30% of ARC graduates pursue either graduate sc hool (with an 80+% acceptance rate) or work abroad through opportunities such as Fulb right. Many of the students pursuing graduate school were accepted into progr ams with full funding. Such programs include American University, London Sch ool of Economics, UT Austin, ASU, and Emory. d. In what ways does the program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in ord er to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boards, national data)? Provide one best example where the in formation gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Currently the program does not have the staffing to conduct o ur own systematic studies with respect to the needs and satisfaction of employers, but we pay close attention to report s produced by AAC&U, AASCU, as well as the Council on Postsecondary Education, and the Bowling Green Chamber of Comme rce. In addition to close atten tion to external reports and studies, the chair and several faculty have regular conversatio ns with those in Bowling Green with respect to the needs of and satisfaction of employers who hire students with a major in ARC . From those conversations, the program coordinator became bet ter aware of the employment trends in the region and commonwealth. One example with this has been working with the Japanese Consulate in the Nash ville area two years ago to determine the job needs of our graduates seeking employment in companies that have Japanese o wnership in the area and in the Commonwealth. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) Our students are among the highest achieving in the universi ty, winning awards, scholarships, and national honors. From 2013-2018, ARC majors submitted 81 separate applications for na tional and international scholarships; of those, 2 were finalists for a Truman, 1 won a Truman, 15 won Crtitical Langua ge Scholarships, 9 received Boren scholars hips, 6 won Freeman-Asia fellowships , 2 were awarded Fulbrights, 1 received a Humanity in Action fellows hips, and 4 r eceived Gilman scholarships. As noted in the data above, ARC majors take shorter time to graduate than the medium, despite the fact that many are double , triple, and quadruple majors who spend at least a semester stud ying abroad. Given the very involved and hands on advising for the major, the ARC program also has a substantially higher prog ression rate than oth er programs at WKU. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data 2 . 5 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH 104.00 128.00 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 358 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 75.7% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 17 19 % Under-Enrolled Sections by Level 47.4 36.3 % Under-Enrolled Sections for ARC < 5 . 0 % b. What external revenue strea ms are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buy -out time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate-university partnershi ps, and economic development rel ationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college, and/or university . (maximum 200 words) Numerous members of our faculty have been awarded outside gr ants and support for scholarship, including from prestigious organizations like th e National Endowment for the H umanities, Chiang ChingKuo Foundation,the Korea Foundation, Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore, and so on. In addition, faculty are involved in numerous community projects that serve underrepresented popula tions. ARC faculty often take advantage of funding to support attending conferences and pedagogy workshops that suppo rt excellent teaching practice s, as well as through larger funds that offer support for fieldwork in Asia. Currently, members of the department are in conversation wit h the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville about establishing an endowed speaker series that b enefits underrepresented stude nts that major in ARC. In additi on, faculty have lectured at universities abroad in Taiwan, Si ngapore, Malaysia, and Indones ia. Faculty have also mentored students at these universities, all in an effort to create economic and educational partnership s (such as with with AIFAS [American Institute for Indonesian Studies], which provides grants to both American and Indonesian scholars on an annual basis). Fi nally, through FUSE, faculty have involved students in research in Taiwan, Japan, Korea,and Singapore. In addition to grants, the re venue stream from DELO has aver aged 7500.00 over the past 5 years. c. What else should evaluators k now about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For exam ple, if the data provided for the department as a whole di ffer substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) With the exception of the senior seminar, which has been tau ght as an overload, the courses that count toward ARC are taught regularly for other majors across WKU. Thus, the costs a ssociated with ARC is minimal, at best. Finally, if we conside r that ARC majors help fill seats in courses taught across the un iversity, the revenue stream becomes substantially higher. Regarding the % of underenrolle d sections, this number is le ss than 5.0% for ARC , as the only course listed as being under- enrolled in the major is the 1 hour senior seminar (and which h as always been taught as an uncompensated overload). 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics . (maximum 200 words) ARC has a commitment to student completion and success , graduating the majority of our majors in four years. We attribute this in large part to our emphasis on mentorship and meaningful facultystudent e ngagement in the classroom as well as collaborative studentfaculty research ( research & creative activities ). Many WKU students take courses as part of a complementary or interdisciplinar y program of study (Arabic, In ternational Affairs, Chinese, an d Political Science) and many major in our program. We also have foreign students from Africa , Asia, and the Middle East in our courses. ARC is a diverse program at WKU, directly serving the univer sity's strategic goal of increasin g diversity and inclusion. Ou r course offerings also model div ersity, equity, and inclusion. ARC is focused on preparing students for a career and life i n a global context through highimpact practices (see next section). The program offers numerous other Colonnade courses f ocused on a global world, through topics such as material religion, ritual, langu age, and religious literature. These are courses not offered elsewhere at WKU, or in Kentucky, but they are seen at prestigious regional institutions of higher learnin g, like Vanderbilt and Duke. This illustrates how ARC is on the cutting edge of humanities higher education and raises the prof ile of WKU. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goa ls, policy objectives, strategies, an d metrics. (maximum 200 words) The program contributes to the statewide strategic agenda by promoting academic excellen ce through teaching, with a particular emphasis on LEAP outcomes related to knowledge of hu man cultures, information literacy, critical thinking, and intercultural knowledge (8.4). Wi th regard to Obj ective 6, the program has ensured that students graduate within four years or less (last two years shows an average of 3.9 years to graduation) w hich is an outcome of eff ective student advising and program instruction. Quality advising has also ensured a gradua tion rate of over 90%. Also, as many students in our program study abroad, we have also allo wed for greater flexibility in s tudy abroad programs and courses that count toward the major as well as been open to a variety of research-based and independen t learning projects bo th here in the States and abroad that cou nt toward the requirements. The interdisciplinary nature of the pr ogram prepares students for the 21st century by ensuring that they have a solid foundation from which they can pursue a wide range of professions (language translation, government organizations, non-government organizations, education, and so on) after graduation. Finally, p articipation in high-impact practices sugh as student resea rch has steadily increased with numerous faculty actively engaged in FUSE. Five students successfully completed FUSE proj ects during the review period. c. How and to what ex tent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent p ossible. (maxi mum 200 words) ARC teaches cultural literacy a nd supports the university's numerous language programs. Kentucky is a state with numerous international businesses, including those in Bowling Green and Scottsville that feature a dominantly Asian (Japanese) workforce. In fact, cu rrently there are 195 companies with Japa nese ownership in the Commonwealth that employ 46,777. ARC supports WKU students who se ek careers in business, seconda ry education, public service, and politics, through courses that expose them to Asian and ot her immigrant communities that we live and work with in the state. According to the Kentucky Future Skills Report, this is a st ate that will see a huge demand f or professionals working in healthcare and technical occupatio ns. Asia is a critical part o f the world's economy that is a t the forefront of medical resea rch and technological ventures. The f irst part of this jobs report that deserves attention is health care, a profession that requir es working with a diverse public. In Bowling Green, a large contin gent (approximately 50% at one clinic) of physicians are of Asian descent. ARC provides stude nts with the religious and cul tural literacy beneficial for positions with MDs and other medical professionals. Technology is another area that requires a global outlook and due to the importance of Asian economies, it is important that Kentuckians have familiarity wi th the religions and cultures of Asia. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Ref erence unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty /staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus imp act, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Our courses feature innovative design and delivery through h ighly effective pedagogies, as evidenced by the numerous awards our faculty has won for teaching. Thi s includes faculty that have won the university wid e teaching award, the universit y wide research award, and college awards for teaching, research, and advising. The impact of our faculty's commitment to excellent teaching is matched b y their research record. As noted throughout this report, our faculty and students ar e diverse, representing Kentuckians, regional students, racial and ethnic minorities, and international students. One of the impac ts of ARC is that it pr epares our students for lifelong learnin g, an effect seen in our faculty's teaching and mentorship of many of WKU's top students who go on to careers in diplomacy, public affairs, and higher education. Report after report (e.g. Blo omberg, 2015; NACE 216; AACU 20 18; Hart) notes that one of the workforce challenges across the nation, including in Kentucky, is students' weaknesses in o ral and written communication, as well as ability to think creatively, work with others, and solve complex problems. ARC h as made an explicit effort to take this into account in the pas t five years. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and dist inctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) ARC is one of several programs in the Department of Philosophy and Religion that is integral to the university. Our contributions to the Strategic Plan are extensive, as outlined in this report, but it is the dis tinctiveness of t he program th at sets us apart from other programs. Kentucky is a state with few inst itutions of higher learning, when compared to our northern neighbors of Indiana and Illinois, as well as to regional easte rn states like North Carolina an d Virginia. Of all the public institutions of higher learning in Kentucky, WKU is the only on e to offer an Asian Religions and Cultures major. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are potential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections b e made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Alongside China, there has been a a growing interest in Arab ic and the Islamic world over the past 15 years. Going forward , the ARC program may tap into st udents interested in the latter by creating two separate tracks within ARC: one focusing on Asia and one on the Islamic wo rld. While ARC al ready caters to students interested in Arabic a nd the Islamic world, there is a marketing problem as most of thos e students do not associate As ian with the Middle East and I slam. By creating tracks and renaming the major, the growing number of Arabic majors as well as those interested in the Midd le East would become majors. With the recent hiring of Dr. Arj ana in our department, there i s potential in creating ties with other professors focused on t he Middle East (e.g., Drs. Romero, Kiasatpour, and DiMeo). A second area relates to the number of Japanese companies in the region and in the Commonwealth. Currently, there are 195 companies with Japanese ownership in the Commonwealth that empl oy 46,777 employees. Thus, there is a growing need for majors with a greater focus on Japanese cultures, lanugages and religion. Packaging the major more creatively to highlight the employment potentials for those i nterested in Japan and Japanes e would help inc rease majors. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 5-10 year s? (maximum 200 words) Asian Studies in American uni versities has in recent years bu rgeoned with Asia itself. Alo ng with program s specifically dedicated to Asian Studies, the number of professional, peer-re viewed journals and local and national conferences has also increased. The ARC program has a ligned itself with a number of national trends within the field of Asian Studies. These include the general goal of global-mindedness for our students (that is, creating an inclusive \" us\" rather than the implicit \" us\" and \"them\" of decades past), as well as the more specific goals of cross-cultural and interdisci plinary courses, an emphasis o n language acquisition, and a greater focus on critical thinking skills. An example of a new interdisciplinary course is Arjana' s Islam and Pilgrimage, which is not only global in scope, but al so incorporates art, anthropology, tourism, political science, and cyber-technology. By creating an Islamic world track within the ARC major, the major would become further aligned with national trends that have seen a growth in interest in Islam. c. What if any significant changes has your program instituted within the past th ree years to increas e productivity, success of students, and/or effici ency that may not yet be evid ent in the data provided? Exa mples might include course sequencing/scheduling desi enhance students' prog ress towards degree, mplementati on of a comprehensive recruiting and mark eting plan, or reallocation of faculty resources to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) ARC has worked with SAGL to produce a list of programs in th e Middle East and South, Sou theast, and East Asia for majors. Students interested in s tudying abroad in Asia and the Middle East are now be informed about the ARC major here and how our program dovetails with their interests. We created a social media pr esence as well as directed recru iting events for those students interested in Arabic, the Middl e East, International Affairs, Chinese, and International Busines s. The first set of those events paid off well as we have had three students declare ARC since th e fall census cutoff date. Last year we hired Dr. Arjana to teach courses in Islam and Islamic culture here at WKU. S he has already created two new Colonnade Connection courses and is currently proposing several more. Drs. Fischer and Samuels have included their regularly-taught religion courses into the Colonnade Connection s categories. It seems reasonab le to believe that with the inclusion of 7 courses into the Connections category, that we c an increase recruitment further. Department-wise, we have been working to increase efficiency . Last year we suspended our MA program in religion as well as completely revised our religion and philosophy programs to a ttract more students. This academ ic year, we w ill suspend our Middle East Studies certificate and Classical Studies minor. d. Where do you see the program i n five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We see real potential for growth through increased collabora tion with other PCAL programs, with the development of an Islamic World track within the major, and an increased emphasis , within the Asia track, on Japan and Japanese. While the firs t two goals are relatively easy to achieve and do not result in a dditional costs to the university, the third one will need some additional resources as there is a dearth of courses focused on Japan available at WKU. Several ideas for new courses that fulfill both ARC and WKU-w ide Colonnade requirements are being considered for future implementation. Our current staff is well situated to foster th e growth that we envision. Within the next five years we e nvision a more robust program that is well marketed to students interested in both Asian and the Islamic world/Middle East. T hose changes could easily be p roposed during the next academic year, though given that it would require CPE approval, may take two years to complete. To accomplish the third goal , additional resources will be n eeded to increase the range of c ourses that focus on Japanese a nd Japan. Hiring a full-time tenure track faculty in Modern Langu ages who could teach both Japanese and courses on Japanese culture and history in Englis h, would be helpful. e. What recommendation would you p ut forward for t he program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or important complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teach-out may be required) Department/School: Philosophy and Religion (Y/N) Minimum Hours Required: 21 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The minor in Asian studies, w hich consists of 21 hours,has t wo tracks: the Asian religions and cultures track or the South and East Asian track. Both tracks are subsets of the interdisc iplinary ARC major, requiring stu dents to take classes in at le ast three disciplines. Given that most majors at WKU require a sec ond major or minor, the minor serves a vital function to the college and university. Since the minor is a subset of the ARC major, there are no inherent costs associated with it. While all the courses to complete the major are generally taught in a classroom setting ( rather than online), at least 1 0% of our minors also study abroad in the Middle Ea st and/or Asia. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) As an interdisciplinary program, minors take courses from pr ograms and departments across th e university(i.e., religious studies, history, political scien ce, and modern languages). Th e major helps fill seats in these departments, and the religion courses offered for the ARC minor (e.g., Buddhism, Confucianism , Daoism, Islam, and so on) c ontribute to programs across the university that require stude nts to take courses in other d epartments (e.g., international affairs, Chinese, Arabic, the Chinese Flagship progr am, and others). Asian studies contribute to s everal university missions and priorities. Approximately 30% of the courses that count toward it are part of Colonnade. Focused on the Middle East and Asia, the minor prepares students for the \"Global Stage,\" thus ensuring that, per WKU's strateg ic plan \"a world view and inter national issues are intention ally incorporated across the curriculum.\" Moreover, by providing students with a broad foun dation (religion, culture, hi story, politics, economics, geography, languages), majors are prepared \"to enter a competit ive global workforce\" with the t ools to \"think critically, solv e problems, and engage effectively with others.\" Minors often study abroad. Thus, the ARC major \"[p]rovide o pportunities for people of t he region to be educated, entertained, assisted, and inspir ed outside the classroom\" thus , facilitating \"the transferabilit y of students an d develop[ing ] faculty and staff exchange opportunities with other academic in stitutions.\" c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The SCHP number given in the data above for the major is ina ccurate. In our department, faculty have both religious studies and ARC majors in their courses (with the exception of the one hour ARC senior seminar [taught once a year as an overload]); thus, if we count th at in a single course we have b oth religion and ARC majors and minors, the SCHP is closer to 450. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 % FirstYear Retention Rate Progression 150% Graduation Rate Time to Degree 3.34 3.67 4.50 6.67 5.75 4.20 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The SLOs for the minor are the s ame for the ARC major: communic ate clearly and effectively in written work; construct and effectively write a thesis for a research paper and defend it t hrough the use of relevant literature and resources; locate the relevant literature or resources for research paper; and utiliz e relevant literature or resources to defend research paper thesis. Since minors are not required to take a senior seminar, the SLOs are assessed in one way. Given that the program is interdisciplinary, the method us ed to assess students was their final grade in courses that require a research paper. Discussing objectives with facu lty across the university, the p rogram determined that students receiving an A or B in such courses meet the learning outcomes. For the two past year, over 70% of the students enrolled in cou rses that require writing a research paper met or exceeded expectations. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The program does not gather and incorporate feedback from min ors. However, it does send out surveys each year to majors. From surveys conducted, we have found that out of 24 students who responded, 4 were living and working in Asia while the rest where living and working or pursuing graduate school in th e U.S. Of the 24 stude nts, five were invol ved in administrativ e work, four in education, three in IT, and the rest in a variety of fields including the State Department, and several worldwid e foundations (Bring me Hope Foundation, UBI Taiwan). Given the international and interdisciplinary focus of our p rogram, the key professional oppo rtunities for students are wit h global companies, NGOs either in the U.S. or abroad, or with th e government (most commonly, the State Department). Approximately 2030% of ARC gradua tes pursue either graduate sc hool (with an 80+% acceptance rate) or work abroad through opportunities such as Fulbright. Many of the students pursuing graduate school were accepted into programs with full funding. Such pro grams include American University, Londo n School of Economics, UT Austin, ASU, and Emory. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Currently the program does not have the staffing to conduct our own systematic studies with respect to the needs and satisfaction of employers, but we pay close attention to report s produced by AAC&U, AASCU, as well as the Council on Postsecondary Education, and the Bowling Green Chamber of Comme rce. In addition to close attention to external reports and studies, the chair and several faculty have regular convers ations with those in Bowling Green with respect to the needs of and satisfaction of employers who hire students with a major in ARC. From those conversations, the program coordinator became bet ter aware of the employmen t trends in the region and commonwealth. One example with this has been working with the Japanese Consulate in the Nash ville area two years ago to determine the job needs of our graduates seeking employment in companies that have Japanese ownership in the area and in the Commonwealth. e.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Numerous members of our faculty have been awarded outside gr ants and support for scholarship, including from prestigious organizations like th e National Endowment for the H umanities, Chiang ChingKuo Foundation,the Korea Foundation, Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore, and so on. In addition, faculty are involved in numerous community projects that serve underrepresented popula tions. ARC faculty often take advantage of funding to support attending conferences and pedagogy workshops that suppo rt excellent teaching practice s, as well as through larger funds that offer support for fieldwork in Asia. Currently, members of the department are in conversation wit h the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville about establishing an endowed speaker series that b enefits underrepresented stude nts that major in ARC. In additi on, faculty have lectured at universities abroad in Taiwan, Si ngapore, Malaysia, and Indones ia. Faculty have also mentored students at these universities, all in an effort to create economic and educational partnership s (such as with with AIFAS [Am erican Institute for Indonesian Studies], which provides grants to both American and Indonesian scholars on an annual basis). Fi nally, through FUSE, faculty have involved students in research in Taiwan, Japan, Korea,and Singapore. In addition to grants, the re venue stream from DELO has aver aged 7500.00 over the past 5 years. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) As a subset of the ARC major, th e costs associat ed with Asian s tudies minor is $0.00. Moreover, if we consider that ARC majors help fill seats in course s taught across the university, the revenue stream becomes substantially higher. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The minor has a commitment to student completion and success , graduating the majority of our majors in four years. We attribute this in large part to our emphasis on mentorship and meaningful facultystudent e ngagement in the classroom as well as collaborative studentfaculty research ( research & creative activities ). Many WKU students take courses as part of a complementary or interdisciplinar y program of study (Arabic, In ternational Affairs, Chinese, an d Political Science) and many major in our program. We also have foreign students from Africa , Asia, and the Middle East in our courses. Asian studies is a diverse prog ram at WKU, directly serving the university's strategic goal of increasing diversity and inclusion. Our course offerings also model diversity, equity, a nd inclusion. Asian studies is focu sed on preparing students for a career and life in a global context thro ugh highimpact practices (see next section). The program offers numerous other Colonnade cour ses focused on a global worl d, through topics such as material religion, ritual, langu age, and religious literature. These are courses not offered e lsewhere at WKU, or in Kentucky, but they are seen at prestigious regional institutions of highe r learning, like Vanderbilt and Duke. This illustrates how it i s on the cutting edge of humanities higher education and raises the profile of WKU. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The Program contributed to the Commonwealth's strategic agenda for student success in a numbe r of ways. Some minors, for instance, study abroad and we h ave also allowed for greater fle xibility in study abroad programs and courses that count toward the minor as well as been open to a variety of research-based a nd independent learni ng projects both here in the States and abroad that count toward the requirements. The interdisciplinar y nature of the program prepares students for the 21st century by ensuring that they have a solid foundation from which they can pursue a wide range of professions (language translation, government organizations, non-government organizations, educati on, and so on) after graduation . c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Asian studies teaches cultural literacy and supports the uni versity's numerous language progr ams. Kentucky is a state with numerous international businesses, including those in Bowling G reen and Scottsville that fe ature a dominantly Asian (Japanese) workforce. In fact, currently there are 195 companie s with Japanese ownership in the Commonwealth that employ 46,777. ARC supports WKU students who seek careers in bu siness, secondary education, pu blic service, and politics, through courses that expose them to Asian and other immigrant c ommunities that we live and work with in the state. According to the K entucky Future Skills Report, this is a st ate that will see a huge demand for professionals working in healthcare and technical occupati ons. Asia is a critical part o f the world's economy that is at the forefront of medical resea rch and technological ventures. The first part of this jobs report that deserves attention is health care, a professio n that requir es working with a diverse public. In Bowling Green, a large contin gent (approximately 50% at one clinic) of physicians are of Asian descent. ARC provides students with the religious and cul tural literacy beneficial for positions with MDs and other medical professionals. Technolog y is another area that requires a global outlook and due to the importance of Asian economies, it is important that Kentuckians have familiarity wi th the religions and cultures of Asia. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Our courses feature innovativ e design and delivery through hi ghly effective pedagogies, as evidenced by the numerous awards our faculty has won for t eaching. This includes faculty that have won the university wide teaching award, the university wide research award, and college awards for teaching , research, and advising. The impact of our faculty's commitment to excellent teaching is matched by their research r ecord. As noted throughout this report, our faculty and students ar e diverse, representing Kentucki ans, regional students, racial and ethnic minorities, and intern ational students. There is no other program at the university where one can learn about Islam in Indonesia, ancient and modern Chinese thought, Buddhis t practice, Hindu iconography, communities of queer Muslims in Southeast A sia, and the variety of other subjects th at are a focus of ARC. One of the impacts of ARC is that it prepares our students for lifelong learning, an effect seen in our faculty's teaching and mentorship of many of WKU's top students who go on to careers in diplomacy, public affairs, and higher education. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Asian studies is one of several programs that is integral to the university. Our contributions to the Strategic Plan are extensive, as outlined in this report, but it is the distinctiv eness of the program that sets u s apart from other programs. Kentucky is a state with few ins titutions of higher learning, w hen compared to our northern nei ghbors of Indiana and Illinois, as well as to regional eastern s tates like North Carolina and V irginia. Of all the p ublic institutions of higher learning in Kentucky, WKU is one of several t hat offer an Asian studies min or. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Asian studies minor should continue as is as it fulfills a specific need among students needing a minor and/or interested in Asia but does not have the time to complete the major. If t here is a change to be made, it would be to create a Islamic world track within the minor to serve the needs of students stu dying International Affairs and Arabic. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Asian Studies in American univ ersities has in recent years b urgeoned with Asia itself. Alo ng with programs specifically dedicated to Asian St udies, the number of professional, peerre viewed journals and local and national conferences has also increased. The Asian studies prog ram has aligned itself with a number of national trends within the field of Asian Studies. These include the general goal o f globalmindedness for our stu dents (that is, creating an inc lusive \"us\" rather than the implicit \"us\" and \"them\" of deca des past), as well as the more specific goals of crosscultural and interdisciplinary courses, an emphasis on language acquisition, a nd a greater focus on critic al thinking skills. An example of a new interdisciplinary cours e is Arjana's Islam and Pilgrimage , which is not only global in s cope, but also incorporates art, anthropology, tourism, politic al science, and cybertechnology. By creating an Islamic world tra ck within the minor, the minorwould become further aligned with national trends that have seen a growth in interest in Isl am. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Asian studies has recently wor ked with SAGL to produce a lis t of programs in the Middle East and South, Southeast, and East Asia for majors. Students interested in studying abroad i n Asia and the Middle East are now be informed about Asian studies here and how our progra m dovetails with their interests . Last year we hired Dr. Arjana to teach courses in Islam and Islamic culture here at WKU. She has already created two new Colonnade Connection courses and is currently proposing several more. Drs. Fischer and Samuels have included their regularlytaught religion course s into the Colonnade Connection s categories. It seems reason able to believe that with the inclusion of 7 courses into the Connections category, that we c an increase recruitment further. Departmentwise, we have been working to increase efficiency . Last year we suspended our MA program in religion as well as completely revised our religion and philosophy programs to attract more students. This academic year, we propose suspending our Middle East Studi es certificate and minor in Cla ssical Studies. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We see real potential for growth through increased collaborat ion with other PCAL programs, with the development of an Islamic World track within the minor, and an increased emphasis , within the Asia track, on Japan and Japanese. While the first two goals would be relatively easier to achieve and not r esult in additional costs to the university, the third one will need some additional resources as ther e is a dearth of courses focus ed on Japan available at WKU. Several ideas for new courses that fulfill both Asian studies and WKUwide Colonnade requirements are being considered for future implementation. Our current staff is well situated t o foster the growth that we envision. Within the next five years we envision a more robust program that is well marketed to student s interested in both Asian and the Islamic world/Middle East. T hose changes could easily be p roposed during the next academic year, though given that it would require CPE approval, may take two years to complete. To accomplish the third goal, additional resources will be n eeded to increase the range of courses that focus on Japanese and Japan. Hiring a fulltime tenure track faculty in Modern L anguages who could teach both Japanese and courses on Japanese culture and history in English, would be helpful. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Music College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Bachelor of Arts (Liberal Arts/Music) Reference Number: 583 CIP Code: 50099902 Degree Type (AB, (Y/N) No Minimum Hours Required: 3648 music/120 total List Concentrations (if any): General; Extended The Department of Music (and all programs) is a fully accredite d member of the National Association of Schools of Music or NASM.

References to NASM throughout this review refer to this organization and its standards. Please note that many responses refer to the \"department\" rathe r than the individual degree program. Many, if not all, of the courses and experiences in music inextricably cross internal pr ograms as well as include students from across campus. The maximum word counts requested allow for only a cursory response to individual questions. The department can provide more detailed information upon request. 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Bachelor of Arts in Music is a liberal arts degree witha no nprofessional emphasis in music . The degree can be combined with other fields of study from across campus such as: advertis ing, art, business, c ommunications, English, foreign languages, history, journalism, marketing, philosophy, psychology, religio n, and sciences. The 36hr General Concentration, first offered in 2016, is specifica lly designed for stude nts with multiple in terests and potential career options, both directly and indirec tly related to music. WKU students earning th e AB have entered graduate school (in mu sic history, theory/composition, and performance) and/or pursued careers in Performing Arts Management, music teaching/p erformance, church music, administration as well as medical school, retail and bankin g, and universit y staff positi ons in admission, graduate studi es, development and alumni relations. A performance auditio n is required prior to declarin g the major as students should have precollege training in the ir principal performing instrument and be able to read music fluen tly. Delivery is facetoface a nd a minor or second major is required for the General Concentration and optional for the Ext ended Concentration.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Music also offers a B M, MM, and a minor - students in all four programs sh are courses and artistic exper iences (including large/chamber performance ensemb les, stage produ ctions, tours/c onferences, university spec ial events, and community service). Music provides required courses for programs in the S chool of Teacher Education (BS in Special Education and BS in Elementary Education) and the Department of Theatre and Dance ( BFA in Music Theatre and minors). Each spring the Departments of Music and Theatre/Dance collaborate on an Opera or Musical Theatre productio n. Music contributes to the Colonnade Core Curriculum (six di fferent course options in thre e different categories) and offers over twenty performance ensembles (open to all students) . Music graduate and undergradu ate programs are directly linked as those students conduct and perform with each other throughout their programs. The athl etic bands are an invaluable part of the game day experience for Football, Volleyba ll, and Men's/Women's Basketba ll (over sixty events each y ear) and most notably the department presents over 100 diverse music concerts and recital s each year that attract stude nts, faculty/staff, parents, alumni, donors, and community mem bers to campus. The department is also directly involved i n campus activities that include cultural enhancement even ts, dedications/award ceremoni es, parades, investitures, gal as, orientation/MASTERPLAN, recruitment, and commencement. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The AB provides an alternative t o the BM degree for students wh o reconsider their future and/or who, for a variety of reasons, cannot complete the extensive demands of the BM. Simpl y put, the AB helps keep students in school - it is a vehicle for student retention, success, and completion of a college deg ree where otherwise student s might consider other institutions or drop out o f college altogether. The WKU Mission states \"...WKU enr iches the quality of life for t hose within its reach\" - through the broad and diverse activities noted above this is exactly what the Department of M usic provides for the WKU community. 3.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) 1. Students will demonstrate proficiency in musicianship and th e application of analytical and reflective thinking processes through performing music literature representative of historica l periods and world cultures. Activity: Capstone Jury Assessment - prepared document, oral pr esentation, and live performance The capstone document demonstrates synthesis of music learning including theoretical anal ysis, composer/composition background, text interpretation (for vocalists), and a bibliogr aphy. The department generally holds a 100% pass rate for the Capstone Jury. If a student is not ready to complete the capsto ne their individual applied teacher, and/or the faculty jury during the previous semester, recommend postponement until such a time as the student is adequately prepared. In addition, each semester of applie d study requires a juried perf ormance that promotes students to the next level of study. Students cannot attempt the Capstone Jury until all six (minimu m) degree required semest ers of applied study are completed. 2. Students will participate in a variety of civiccommunity pe rformances (solo/ensemble) e ngagements that will prepare them to contribute as scholarly musicians in our current global society and everchanging world. Activity: MUS 155 Performance Attendance Students are required to attend 14 recitals/events each semeste r through enrollment in MUS 1 55 Performance Attendance (a P/F course) for a minimum of six semesters. This complies wi th the NASM standard that students will have \"the ability to address culture and history from a variety of perspectives,\" \"t he ability to respect, understand and evaluate work in a variet y of disciplines,\" and \"an acquainta nce with a wide selection of musical literature.\" MUS 155 ha s consistently he ld an 8592% pass rate; however, the department found that students were gen erally attending more events that were consistent with their discipline than e vents that were out side their area. In t he fall of 2015 the department redefined expectations to help encourage students to attend and be exposed to more events acro ss a broad and diverse musical spectrum. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Students in the AB program have a wide spectrum of potential ca reers depending on individual interests and the second minors/majors AB students usually pursue. WKU students earning the AB have entered graduate school (in music history, theory/composition, an performance) and/or pursued careers in P erforming Arts Management, music teaching/performance, church music, administration as well as medical school, retail and banking, and university st aff positions in admissions, graduate studies, development, and alumni relations. The department conducts an alumn i survey every two years regard ing career satisfaction. In 2018, 83.33% of respondents selected \"good\" or \"outstanding\" when asked how well WKU prepar ed them for their current po sition. Department faculty are highly engaged in personal/professional relationships with regional colleagues and school/p erformance officials as well as through association with KMEA (t he state music education associ ation) - we are in constant communication regarding area teaching and performance needs as well as student success. Whil e the information gathered through these relationships is anecdotal it is a vital, and hig hly informative, source of info rmation - arguably much more s o than data driven surveys. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gatheran d incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) As noted above, department faculty are highly engaged in person al/professional relationships wi th regional colleagues and school/performance officials as w ell as through association wit h KMEA (including an annual statewide alumni reception attended by 75100 Kentucky teach ers). Personal relationships w ith colleagues at graduate inst itutions also provides a means for feedback regarding student preparation for graduate level m usic study. Recently we found, through survey responses and anecdotal conversation, that our students could benefit from a stronger background in the business skills required to be self employed professional musicians in the 21st century. As a result a new elective course was developed and p roposed in Music Entrepreneurism. This course (MU S 325) will be offered in sprin g 2019. The department also con siders state and national databases/reso urces through KMEA, the College Music Society (CMS), and NASM as needed and appropriate. While not always specific to em ployability, these organizatio ns regularly track student enrollment/engagement /success, faculty/personnel, program offer ings, financial/facility/library resources, and diversity. These organizations are also strong advocates for the arts/musi c in state and national convers ations regarding standards, assessment, and graduation requirements. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) The Wall of Fame at www.wku.edu/music/walloffame celebrates alumni for their outs tanding careers and contributio ns to the arts. It includes renowned p erforming artists as well as ou tstanding music educators. The department regularly publishes a magazine titled Rhapsody that features success stories ab out current students, faculty, and alumni.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) In addition to personnel, scholar ship, and operating budgets th e Department of Music has six nonendowed accounts through the University Foundation specific to performance areas within the department (band, choir, orchestra, jazz) where spending is generally reflective of annual gifts. Music also ha s seven endowed accounts (including a professorship) that generate funds based on annual rates of return. The music DELO distribution has been roughly $13,000 for the past few years and goes directly towards studen t travel for invited performanc es at state, regional, a nd national events. There are many opportunities for donor involvement through perf ormance ensembles, special eve nts, and student activities as well as instrument acquisitio n and travel. Community members and donors are very supportive of the department and in many cases are dedicated support ers of specific ensembles and/o r faculty. Annual giving is generally in the $100500 range with occasional larger gifts dep ending on the specific need/eve nt (new uniforms, Carnegie Hall performance etc.). The department reaches out and engages the community and potential donors as best as possible; however, the department alone does not have the dedicate d staff, or expertise, needed t o communicate with donors (pa rticularly outside Bowling Green) towards the high level of financial return required for major purchases and internat ional student experiences. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The AB shares almost all teaching with the BM. The numbers abov e reflect a very rough estimat e of teaching sp ecific to the AB - which is primarily individua l applied lessons. Because so many courses are shared the SCHP numbers provided by IR may not be accurate. A Department of Music of our size and scope ha s unique and significant cos ts, revenue avenues, and efficiency options; however, the defined word count does not al low for further explanation. The following is offered as an example of a unique financial aspect of the department: The data above suggests that the costs per SCH are high and cla ss sizes are significantly underenrolled. It is important to n ote that a fundamental aspect of college music programs is applied study through oneonone instruction. Most of the above full time faculty teach multiple sect ions (upper and lower level) of applied lessons. As these are individual and at different leve ls a single class may only have 24 students enrolled. In addition, and as defined by NASM, applied faculty receive .66 load credit for each individual student; ther efore, 18 students is equivale nt to a full 12hr teaching load (18x.66=12hrs). Naturally this negatively effects relative SCH costs and median class size num bers. IR ran the same data set for music and excluded applied instruction. The data below reflects that information and is a better accounting of the upperlevel median class sizes for thi s program. 201314 201415 201516 201617 201718 WKU Median Class Size by Level 15 15 15 16 14 19 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 49.40% 46.00% 49.50% 46.50% 51.00% 36.30% 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) From the 201828 Climbing to Greater Heights Strategic Plan: 1. Our Students A Diverse Body of Students: the department actively engages in extensive recruiting activi ties both on and off campus, personally v isiting schools throughout the s tate/region and bringing hundreds if not thousands of students to campus for festivals, auditions, KMEA events, an d competitions. Completion & Success: The department successfully advises all music majors with specialis t advisors who are activel y involved in weekly and even daily student engagement. T he department enjoys a natural peer mentoring atmosphere through applied studios, ensemble participation, and leadership opportunities. Scholarship opportunitie s specifically towards recruitment and retention are available for music majors and ma rching band students (from across campus). Preparation for th e Global Stage: HighImpact Practices, that dev elop hard and soft skills towar ds productive citizenship, are a regular and essential part of being a music major including concert presentations, stage productions, collaborative event s, athletic bands, hosting fest ivals, touring, guest art ist classes, and engagement with study abroad tours, courses, and experiences. 2. Our Community and Beyond - Quality of Life: The department offers roughly 100 musical events each year tha t are open to the entire campus and regional community, and faculty r egularly share/exchange recital programs with other academic institutions. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Assuming this question refers to the KY Council on Postsecondar y Education 20162021 Strategic Agenda Stronger by Degrees, many of the objectives are alrea dy established in the departmen t and program - samples below (objective #): 2a - College Readiness: while this objective centers on reading and math, music studen ts must equally be proficient on their respective instrument and be flu ent with music literacy. These proficiencies are met through an entrance audition prior to entrance to the program. Music faculty regularly communicate an d collaborate with public school teachers giving potential students a clear understanding of what is expected for music ma jor \"college readiness\". 5 - Financial Access : Music students have access to a dditional scholarships both fo r performance (music majors) and participation (marchin g band - across campus). In addition, tui tion for participation in music ensembles beyond 18hrs is waived. Ensemble participation helps retention as it provides a space for students to be additionally engaged and connected to WKU. 6c - Retention: Firstsecond year retention rates are significantly higher tha n university averages as noted above (3a). 6e - Progression: percentages are also significant ly higher than university aver ages as noted above (3a). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The AB addresses multiple workfo rce needs; however, in many cas es it is through selfemployment or a field outside of music. Musicians who gra duate with the AB en ter the workforce a s professional performers, chur ch musicians, private studio teachers, business workers/owne rs, A/V technicians, and/or arts administrators. In many cases AB graduates need to be proactive and build/develop their own individual career based o n local needs and the regional market as it applies to their specific skills and interests. S tudents who double major signif icantly broaden their workforc e opportunities through that additional field. In 2018 the National Academies Press published a report sponsor ed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine titled The Integration of the Humanities and Arts with Sciences, Engin eering, and Medicine in Higher Education: Branches from the Same Tree . From the Preface: \"...many employers\u2014even, and, in fact, especi ally in \"high tech\" areas\u2014 have emphasized that learning outcomes associated with integrat ed education, such as critic al thinking, communication, teamwork, and abilities for lifelo ng learning, are more, not le ss, desirable.\" This report argue s for exactly what the AB in music offers our students - an integrated approach to education that provides stude nts with the wide ra nging skills needed to navigate an unknown future. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) See 5c above. The Bachelor of Arts is a common undergraduate mu sic option and many KY Universities have BA programs. Some of these institutions offer a general Bachelor of Arts in Music, similar to WKU, and/or a B achelor of Arts with a specifi c emphasis (U of L - jazz studies). A program emphasis will natur ally define a specific student body and possibly have limited enrollment based on faculty and course load/scheduling as well as other available resources. The uniqueness of the program is demonstrated in how individual students combine the program with other disciplines/elect ives across ca mpus. Each institution has a wide and diverse number of degree programs an d program/course opportunities - it is not feasible in this report to comment on every progr am combination at every Kentuck y institution. Beyond the defined curriculum, institutional differences are recognized in performance opportunities, ensemb le quality, and faculty exper tise. WKU faculty are well respected within their individua l disciplines and performances ensembles are highly competitive in the state and region (with multiple invitations to KMEA, AC DA, ASTA, and CBDNA). The depar tment also offers multiple colonnade courses through DELO during the wint er and summer sessions. Due to proactive an d diverse scheduling, summer/winter enrollments have doubled since 2015. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) It is vitally important that high er education is not solely a v ehicle towards workforce dem ands and employability. Our fundamental philosophy should be driven by a commitment towards graduating students who are not only competent in their chosen field, but who one day might change the world in w hich we live. We must train our students to be creative, curious, intelligent, and critical thinkers who embrace the bea uty and passion of the world and our place in it - constantly engaging fellow citizens in purs uing a higher quality of life. This is what arts programs, like the AB, distinctly bring to ou r strategic alignment, the campus, and our regional community. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The AB in music has great interd isciplinary potential with litt le or no curriculum changes to the program - what is needed is stronger marketing and collaboration with departments/programs across campus towards effective course scheduling and sequencing. By design the AB is meant to provide students with multiple interests the opportun ity to study music while also studying disciplines outside of m usic. Specific interdisciplina ry opportunities might include: AB paired with Business (for careers in the music/entertainment industry), AB paired with Ph ilosophy/Religion (for careers in church music/seminary), AB paired with Psychology (for car eers in music the rapy), and AB p aired with Theatre and/or Perfor ming Arts Administration (for careers in the arts and/or arts administration). These types of defined combinations could potentially attract new students and provide them with the inte rdisciplinary sk ills needed to na vigate an unknown and/or multiple option career future. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) As noted in 5c and 5d, the AB in Music is a common undergraduat e degree option. The WKU pr ogram is consistent with programs at other institutions and as defined by NASM standards . National trends continue to push for \"highimpact practices\", \"living learning communities\", and \"project based l earning\". These types of e xperiences and learning environments have existed in music for many years as music and the arts are defined by experi ential learning through face toface group instruction, preparation/presentation, and perfor mance. It is notable that while national trends also appear to recognize the STEM disciplines as a high priority, those bodies of employers equally, if not more so, look for arts and humanities related skills in their future applicants (see 5c an d the National Academies Press report titled The Integration of the Humanities and Arts with Sciences, Engineering, and Medicin e in Higher Education: Branches from the Same Tree ). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In 2016 the AB was expanded to include a 36hr track with a requ ired second major or minor a long with the existing 48hr track. Previously the 48hr standalone program was all that was available (where a second major/minor was optional). We intentionally wanted to provide students who were undecided abo ut their career aspirations, or who wanted to double major, an opportunity for music study at WKU. While longterm d ata is not yet available, prelim inary observations reflect genuine interest in the 36hr pro gram for new students looking t o double major (recruitment), but also for current students who have reconsidered their degree midway through their college career (retention). The 36hr o ption includes equal music fundamentals, less credit hours towards applied lessons, and mi nimal music electives. NASM approved the track as it meets defined standards for a Bachelor of Arts degree. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect the AB in Music to remain a viable degreefor many yea rs to come. Given the national trend towards critical thinking skills, inter disciplinary programs, and experiential l earning the AB in Music is potentially an ideal vehicle for a collaborative education. In addition to faculty, resources and personnel in advising (noting WKU's recognition of the complexity of advising in music a nd the arts) and marketing are needed to realize the pote ntial of the program. It is important to note that faculty numbers are lower than tho se reported by other NASM institutions. NASM public institutions with music programs of comparable size and scope h ave an average of 23 fulltime faculty. We lost a position last year; therefore, we currently h ave 20 fulltime faculty (17 TE, 3 NTE) not 21 as noted previou sly. Additionally, WKU music faculty salaries are in the 25th percentile of comparable N ASM public institutions. Current budgets are also not satisfactory for a music program o f our size and scope. We have significant needs in instrument acquisition, repair, and maintena nce (including over 40 pianos) , travel/guest artist fund ing, and for the university performance expectations of our ensembles, particularly the ath letic bands. Our curre nt budget is in the 10 th percentile of comparable NASM institutions. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Music College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Bachelor of Music Reference Number: 593 No Minimum Hours Required: List Concentrations (if any): Music Education -Instrumental, Vocal, Integrated; Music Performance The Department of Music (and all programs) is a fully accredite d member of the National Association of Schools of Music or NASM. This organization provides detailed national standards th at all programs must adhere to for continued membership and accreditation. References to NASM throughout this review refer to this organization and its standards. Please note that many responses refer to the \"department\" rathe r than the individual degree program. Many, if not all, of the courses and experiences in music inextricably cross internal pr ograms as well as include students from across campus. The maximum word counts requested allow for only a cursory response to individual questions. The department can provide more detailed information upon request. 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Bachelor of Music is a prof essional music degree that prepa res students for careers in school or studio teaching, performance, or continued study at the graduate level. A perfor mance audition is required prior to declaring the major as students should have precollege t raining in their principal pe rforming instrument or voice and be able to read music fluently . Delivery is facetoface and no minor or second major is requir ed. The education concentration offe rs tracks leading to three dist inct teaching certifications: In tegrated (instrumental or vocal focus), which leads to certifica tion for Teaching Music P12; I nstrumental, which leads to certification for Teaching Instrumental Music P12; and Vocal, which leads to certificatio n for Teaching Vocal Music P12. All tracks require 25 hours in professional education in additio n to music and core curriculum content. The performance concentration has a track in both instrumental (70hrs) and vocal (72hrs with two additional courses in vocal diction). This program provides preparation for graduate study in music performance and/or a music performance career. Students earning this degree are preparing for careers as colle ge/private studio teachers and /or professional performers as soloists or members of professiona l ensembles: opera, chorus, c hamber ensemble, orchestra, band, or military service.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Music also offers an AB, MM, and a minor - students in all four programs sh are courses and artistic exper iences (including large/chamber performance ensemb les, stage produ ctions, tours/c onferences, university spec ial events, and community service). Music provides required courses for programs in the S chool of Teacher Education (BS in Special Education and BS in Elementary Education) and the Department of Theatre and Dance ( BFA in Music Theatre and minors). Each spring the Departments of Music and Theatre/Dance collaborate on an Opera or Musical Theatre productio n. Music contributes to the Colonnade Core Curriculum (six di fferent course options in thre e different categories) and offers over twenty performance ensembles (open to all students) . Music graduate and undergradu ate programs are directly linked as those students conduct and perform with each other throughout their programs. The athl etic bands are an invaluable part of the game day experience for Football, Volleyba ll, and Men's/Women's Basketba ll (over sixty events each y ear) and most notably the department presents over 100 diverse music concerts and recital s each year that attract stude nts, faculty/staff, parents, alumni, donors, and community mem bers to campus. The department is also directly involved i n campus activities that include cultural enhancement even ts, dedications/award ceremoni es, parades, investitures, gal as, orientation/MASTERPLAN, recruitment, and commencement. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The WKU Mission states \"...WKU enr iches the quality of life for t hose within its reach\" -through the broad and diverse activities noted above this is exactly what the Department of M usic provides for the WKU community. 3.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) 1. Students will demonstrate proficiency in musicianship and th e application of analytical and reflective thinking processes through performing music literature representative of historica l periods and world cultures. Activity: Capstone Jury Assessment - prepared document, oral pr esentation, and live performance The capstone document demonstrates synthesis of music learning including theoretical anal ysis, composer/composition background, text interpretation (for voc alists), and a bibliogr aphy. The department generally holds a 100% pass rate for the Capstone Jury. If a student is not ready to complete the capsto ne their individual applied teacher, and/or the faculty jury during the previous semester, recommend postponement until such a time as the student is adequately prepared. In addition, each semester of applie d study requires a juried perf ormance that promotes students to the next level of study. Students cannot attempt the Capstone Jury until all six (minimu m) degree required semest ers of applied study are completed. 2. Students will participate in a variety of civiccommunity pe rformances (solo/ensemble) e ngagements that will prepare them to contribute as scholarly musicians in our current global society and everchanging world. Activity: MUS 155 Performance Attendance Students are required to attend 14 recitals/events each semeste r through enrollment in MUS 1 55 Performance Attendance (a P/F course) for a minimum of six semesters. This complies wi th the NASM standard that students will have \"the ability to address culture and history from a variety of perspectives,\" \"t he ability to respect, understand and evaluate work in a variet y of disciplines,\" and \"an acquainta nce with a wide selection of musical literature.\" MUS 155 ha s consistently he ld an 8592% pass rate; however, the department found that students were gen erally attending more events that were consistent with their discipline than e vents that were out side their area. In t he fall of 2015 the department redefined expectations to help encourage students to attend and be exposed to more events acro ss a broad and diverse musical spectrum. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Roughly 85% of BM stud ents follow the educat ion trackand are pr eparing for professional career s in public school teaching. The studentteaching experience is considered an \"internship\" a nd faculty observe those students and communicate with their professional mentors offici ally and unofficially througho ut the process. Performance majors pursue graduate school and/or individual careers as pro fessional performing musicians. The department conducts an al umni survey every two years regarding career satisfaction. In 2018, 83.33% of respondents s elected \"good\" or \"outstanding \" when asked how well WKU prepared them for their current p osition. The department also k eeps track of PRAXIS test pa ss rates specific to music students and the music content por tion of that teaching certifi cation exam (90% pass rate in 201718). Department faculty are highly engaged in personal/professional relationships with regional colleagues and school officials as well as through association with KMEA (the state music education association) - we are in constant communicati on regarding area teaching and performance needs as well as student success. While the inf ormation gathered through thes e relationship s is anecdotal it is a vital, and highly inform ative, source of information - arguably much more so than data driven surveys. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In addition to their diploma, mu sic education students also rec eive KY Teaching Certification. Standards and requirements are defined by the Kentucky Board of Education and reflect the curr ent expectations and demands of public school educators. The studentteaching experience is considered an \"internship\" a nd faculty communicate with professional mentors officially and unofficially throughout the process (including an annual st atewide alumni reception attended by 75100 Kentucky teachers). Personal relationship s with colleagues at graduate i nstitutions also provides a me ans for feedback regarding student preparation for graduate level music study. Recently we found, through survey responses and anecdotal conversation, that our students could benefit from a stronger b ackground in the business skills required to be selfemployed professional musicians in the 21st century. As a result a new elective course was developed and p roposed in Music Entrepreneurism. This course (MU S 325) will be offered in sprin g 2019. The department also con siders state and national databases/reso urces through KMEA, the College Music Society (CMS), and NASM as needed and appropriate. While not always specific to em ployability, these organizatio ns regularly track student enrollment/engagement /success, faculty/personnel, program offer ings, financial/facility/libra ry resources, and diversity. These organizations are also strong advocates for the arts/musi c in state and national convers ations regarding standards, assessment, and graduation requirements. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of studen ts in this program?(opti onal, maximum 100 words) Our healthy relationsh ip with schooldistri cts and their teache rs provides an opportunity for recruitment that goes beyond the discipline. Successful graduates are employed in schools, r emain in touch with the program, and ultimately recommend new students to WKU. Th ese students may or may not go into musi c, but they consider WKU because of the highly valued and influential studentteacher relationship they have with the ir school music teachers. This relationship is one that goes beyond test scores and grades and it is one we constantly model at the highest level within the program.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) In addition to personnel, scholar ship, and operating budgets th e Department of Music has six nonendowed accounts through the University Foundation specific to performance areas within the department (band, choir, orchestra, jazz) where spending is generally reflective of annual gifts. Music also ha s seven endowed accounts (including a professorship) that generate funds based on annual rates of return. The music DELO distribution has been roughly $13,000 for the past few years and goes directly towards studen t travel for invited performanc es at state, regional, a nd national events. There are many opportunities for donor involvement through perf ormance ensembles, special eve nts, and student activities as well as instrument acquisitio n and travel. Community members and donors are very supportive of the department and in many cases are dedicated support ers of specific ensembles and/o r faculty. Annual giving is generally in the $100500 range with occasional larger gifts dep ending on the specific need/eve nt (new uniforms, Carnegie Hall performance etc.). The department reaches out and engages the community and potential donors as best as possible; however, the department alone does not have the dedicate d staff, or expertise, needed t o communicate with donors (pa rticularly outside Bowling Green) towards the high level of financial return required for major purchases and internat ional student experiences. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The BM shares teaching with other programs in the department (m ost notably the AB). The numbers above reflect a very rough estimate of teaching specific to the BM. Because so many courses are shared the SCHP numbers provided by IR may not be accurate. A Department of Music of our size and scope ha s unique and significant cos ts, revenue avenues, and efficiency options; however, the defined word count does not al low for further explanation. The following is offered as an example of a unique financial aspect of the department: The data above suggests that the costs per SCH are high and cla ss sizes are significantly underenrolled. It is important to n ote that a fundamental aspect of college music programs is applied study through oneonone instruction. Most of the above full time faculty teach multiple sect ions (upper and lower level) of applied lessons. As these are individual and at different leve ls a single class may only have 24 students enrolled. In addition, and as defined by NASM, applied faculty receive .66 load credit for each individual student; ther efore, 18 students is equivale nt to a full 12hr teaching load (18x.66=12hrs). Naturally this negatively effects relative SCH costs and median class size num bers. IR ran the same data set for music and excluded applied instruction. The data below reflects that information and is a better accounting of the upperlevel median class sizes for thi s program. 201314 201415 201516 201617 201718 WKU Median Class Size by Level 15 15 15 16 14 19 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 49.40% 46.00% 49.50% 46.50% 51.00% 36.30% 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) From the 201828 Climbing to Greater Heights Strategic Plan: 1. Our Students A Diverse Body of Students: the department actively engages in extensive recruiting activi ties both on and off campus, personally v isiting schools throughout the s tate/region and bringing hundreds if not thousands of students to campus for festivals, auditions, KMEA events, an d competitions. Completion & Success: The department successfully advises all music majors with specialis t advisors who are activel y involved in weekly and even daily student engagement. T he department enjoys a natural peer mentoring atmosphere through applied studios, ensemble participation, and leadership opportunities. Scholarship opportunitie s specifically towards recruitment and retention are available for music majors and ma rching band students (from across campus). Preparation for th e Global Stage: HighImpact Practices, that dev elop hard and soft skills towar ds productive citizenship, are a regular and essential part of being a music major including concert presentations, stage productions, collaborative event s, athletic bands, hosting fest ivals, touring, guest art ist classes, and engagement with study abroad tours, courses, and experiences. 2. Our Community and Beyond - Quality of Life: The department offers roughly 100 musical events each year tha t are open to the entire campus and regional community, and faculty r egularly share/exchange recital programs with other academic institutions. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Assuming this question refers to the KY Council on Postsecondar y Education 20162021 Strategic Agenda Stronger by Degrees, many of the objectives are alre ady established in the departme nt and program - samples below (objective #): 2a - College Readiness: while this objective centers on reading and math, music studen ts must equally be proficient on their respective instrument and be flu ent with music literacy. These proficiencies are met through an entrance audition prior to entrance to the program. Music faculty regularly communicate an d collaborate with public school teachers giving potential students a clear understanding of what is expected for music ma jor \"college readiness\". 5 - Financial Access : Music students have access to a dditional scholarships both fo r performance (music majors) and participation (marchin g band - across campus). In addition, tui tion for participation in music ensembles beyond 18hrs is waived. Ensemble participation helps retention as it provides a space for students to be additionally engaged and connected to WKU. 6c - Retention: Firstsecond year retention rates are significantly higher tha n university averages as noted above (3a). 6e - Progression: percentages are also significant ly higher than university aver ages as noted above (3a). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The BM in music specifically addr esses workforce needs in schoo l music teaching. The BM educat ion tracks include Kentucky Teaching Certification and most, if not all, graduates immediat ely gain employment in Ken tucky public schools after graduation. As recognized through conversations with KMEA admin istration, WKU has a very strong music teaching reputation throughout the state. In some cases public school of ficials seek out WKU music graduates kn owing our strength in providing quality teachers to the region. Faculty are in consta nt communication with school officials and current music teachers, and are generally aware early of potential open posit ions - which are then shared with qualified students in addition to our making recommendations to the individual distri cts. As a result potential stude nts continue to see WKU as a prime avenue for career readiness particularly in music teachin g. While the WKU Teacher Edu cation Program has seen a significant drop in enr ollment (over 400 students in the past 5 years) the BM degree has remained steady with both enrollment and degree completion. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) See 5c above. The Bachelor of Music is a common undergraduate m usic degree particularly in Music Education. The defined standards, from both NASM and st ate certification, are specific and require teacher preparation programs to have similar, if not exactly the same, content. A unique aspect of the degree at WKU is the option of the inte grated tracks - these tracks allow students to focus in one pe rformance area (instrumental, strings, or choral) while a lso developing skills in a secondary/opposite area. Beyond the defined curriculum, institu tional differences are recognized in performance opportunities, ensemble quality, and faculty expertise. WKU fac ulty are well respected within t heir individual disciplines and performances ensembles are highly competitive in the state and region (with multiple invitati ons to KMEA, ACDA, ASTA, and CBDNA). The department also offe rs music education courses at t he regional campuses (as required for Teacher Education programs) and multiple colonnade courses through DELO during th e winter and summer sessions. Due to proactive and diverse scheduling, summer/winter enrollments have doubled sinc e 2015. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) It is vitally important that high er education is not solely a v ehicle towards workforce dem ands and employability. Our fundamental philosophy should be driven by a commitment towards graduating students who are not only competent in their chosen field, but who one day might change the world in w hich we live. We must train our students to be creative, curious, intelligent, and critical thinkers who embrace the bea uty and passion of the world and our place in it - constantly engaging fellow citizens in purs uing a higher quality of life. This is what arts programs, like the BM, distinctly bring to ou r strategic alignment, the campus, and our regional community. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The BM is a professional degree th at trains future music teache rs and performers. The market for graduates continues to be school employment, professional performance, and graduate schoo l. We do not anticipate broad new markets for the degree; however, potential exists for new/broader content as we ll as musical experiences, whic h in turn might attract new students to the program and benefit future school teachers/perf ormers. The WKU music depart ment is built on a classical traditional that centers on performance experiences and coursew ork from Western Art Music (European heritage); as well as teaching/performing through three major areas - band, choir, an d orchestra. In recent years the department has developed new colonnade courses in rock, blues, country, world music, and music/drama to complement existing courses in western music history and appreciation. While these courses are outside the BM degree, there is potential for similar new opportunities for music majors in cluding world/popular music en sembles, music history/ theory from different cultural/historical perspectives, aural tradition pedagogy, and connections with the entertainm ent industry (recording, film, technology, electronics). Many o f these potential offerings cou ld include interdisciplinary connections with different departments, community partners, school districts, and performi ng arts organizations. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) As noted in 5c and 5d, the BM is a common music u ndergraduate d egree option. The WKU pr ogram is consistent with programs at other institutions and as defined by NASM standards . National trends continue to push for \"highimpact practices\", \"living learning communities\", and \"project based l earning\". These types of e xperiences and learning environments have existed in music for many years as music and the arts are defined by experi ential learning through face toface group instruction, preparation/presentation, and perfor mance. While major news outlets continue to report on cuts to the arts (in schools, profess ional organizations, and the NE A) we are encouraged that en rollment in the BM is strong (particularly as enrollment in o ther education programs has dip ped significantly) and that our students at WKU have found great success in the classroom an d on the stage. National trend s also appear to prioritize STEM disciplines as the vehicle to improve our quality of life - but it is important to remember t hat music and arts are what make that life worth living. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) There have not been significant changes to the curriculum, cour se content, or sequencing in the past three years (aside from changes articulated by state cer tification requirements); howev er, faculty in the program are constantly considering new approaches to teaching, repertoire/programming, performance opp ortunities, and pedagogy. These changes appear on recital/concert programs, perfor mance recordings, and in classr oom assignments. The program is content he avy (at 120 135hrs) and there is little room f or significant curricular cha nge without approval from NASM, the College of Education, and the EPSB. Music facul ty are consistently ov erloaded; however, t he department continues to make minor adjustments to teaching loads to facilitate stud ent success as well as faculty engagement - recent examples in clude aligning orchestra/string faculty with more colle ge teaching versus precollege, better e nrollment management with appreciation courses, utilizing parttime faculty with expertise in needed areas, and offering appropriate performance ensemb les for our majors as well as the broader WKU student body (where notable growth has occurred ). d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect the BM to remain a viable degree for many years to co me. Students in the BMform the core for highimpact performance ensemble experiences across campus including the at hletic bands, choirs, orchestra, and jazz/chamber ensembles. We have seen notable nonmajor growth in these group s and there continues to be interest in growing both numbers and performance options. It is predictable that in five years the marching band has 350 members, there are multiple orchestra, choir, and jazz options, and world music ensembles b ecome a reality at WKU. However, there are serious impediments that currently exist limiting our ability to mainta in the current level of success as well as consider future grow th. These include limited and overworked faculty (in the 25th percentile of comparable N ASM public institutions), budget constraints that put us in the 10th percentile of comparable NASM in stitutions (most notably for c apital equipment - pianos, instruments, trucks, e tc.), and changing state certification requirements that dramatically effect student workload and degree completion. New strategica lly identified faculty positio ns, enhanced budgets (for the department, scholarships, and the athletic bands), and expert staff in both music and the Col lege of Education are vital fo r the program to continue its success and move forward into the 21st century. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Theatre & Dance College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Reference Number: Degree (Y/N) No Minimum Hours Required: 74 List Concentrations (if any): Acting, Directing, Theatre Design & Technology, Musical Theatre 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Bachelor of Fine Arts in Per forming Arts degree program, ac credited by the National Associ ation of Schools of Theatre (NAST), requires the completion of a 74credit curriculum compr ised of two complimentary components: 1) ised career prep courses, and; 2) An indepth concentration in one of the follo wing areas: Acting, Directing, Musical Theatre, Tech. & Desig n. No second major or minor is required. Acceptance into the BFA is selective, requiring forma l application, faculty interview, and audition or portfolio review, all of which typically o ccur in a studen t's third semes ter in the department. Student s seeking admission into this program must have a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA, and demonstrate exceptional talent, commitment, selfdiscipline and reliability commensurate with a reasonable likelihood of succes s as a performing arts profe ssional in at least one BFA concentration area. Once admitted, students must maintain a cum ulative GPA of at least 2.5, earn a grade of C or better in all courses required by the BFA program, continue to demonstrate th e exceptional talent, commi tment, selfdiscipline and reliability that earned them adm ission, as well as demonstrate consistent artistic growth and development appropriate their chosen concentration, as assessed through the department's Jury /Portfolio Review (JPR) process.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/ college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Performing Arts BFA is an imp ortant part of the cultural en vironment of the campus and community. Theatre & Dance provides approximately 80 individual performances of 20 to 25 d ifferent shows every year, serving an annual audience of around 11,000. The department pr oduces a very wide range of wor ks including Shakespeare, mu sicals, childre n's theatre, new works, dance concerts, and plays. This includes oncampus p erformances for school groups, and a show which tours to elementary schools. Any WKU student may audition for these prod uctions. All courses required in this BFA program also serve the BA in T heatre, the Theatre Minor, and the Musical Theatre Minor. Acting (PERF101) and Acting for the Camera (THEA 303) serve the Film BA, and Film Studies Minor. A number of courses serve the BA in Dance, including PERF 175, PERF 120, PERF 220, THEA 2 41 and THEA 250: Theatre in Education (THEA 325) and Play Production in the Sch ools (THEA 425) suppo rt the BA in English and Allied Langua ge Arts degree. Theatre Appreciation (THEA 101) and Culture and Performance (TH EA 341) also serve the Colonnade program. Both are also offered each Winter Term as part of the WKU Study Away program to New York City. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Performing Arts BFA comp lies with all standards of NAST. Faculty and students in the p rogram are also active in the Southeastern Theatre Conference, the Kentucky Theatre Associati on, the Midwest Theatre Auditions, and the Unified Professional Theatre Auditions, w here student wor k is adjudicat ed, and students have the opportunity to seek professional internships. The program also spo nsors a showcase for graduatin g seniors each year in New Yor k where students audition for a panel of agents, managers, and casting directors. The program has a very strong trackrecord of success through these events. Dozens of students are engaged in internships each summ er and many graduates go directly into professional theatre employment. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 Rate 16 75.0% 24 79.2% 34 76.5% 14 22 16 (N=5) 4.51 (N=17) 3.67 (N=20) 4.39 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The Performing Arts BFA program meets all NAST standards for st udent learning outcome assessm ent and periodic program review. Departmentspecific Student Learning Outcomes can be fo und here. Routine departmental programlevel assessment of this BFA degree program is conducted largely through a rigor ous, semesterbysemester Jury/Portfolio Review process, the most recent round of which concluded on 12/12/2018. This proces s provides constructive, individualized feedback aimed at maximizing each student's full potential for success after grad uation and to assess the overall effectiveness of our program. Students are assessed at the end of each semester in the progra m by all members of the Perfo rming Arts BFA faculty. The results of these assessments are c ompiled at the end of each se mester and used to monitor the effectiveness of the program and identify areas for program improvement. Student scholarly a nd creative work are regularly adjudicated by faculty and are also frequently presented for adjudication at regional and nati onal professional conferences. Results of this adjudication process are also used to maintai n the quality and effectiveness of the program. This most recent review suggests that despite a shortage of fac ulty, we are continuing to meet our program's student learning outcomes. Recent feedback through our JPR process, and well as our NAST selfstudy process, has led us to pursue a realignment of our BFA curriculu m. We are in the process of dis continuing our Directing concentration and reworking the required courses in the Acting concentration to broaden it, inc orporating both acting and directing coursework. We found students in both concentrations were taking coursework in both areas. Our last NAST Visitors' Report also suggested this course of action. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) As a smaller program where student s work closely with faculty f or long hours in the studio an d classroom, it is common for faculty and students t o stay in close contact for many years af ter graduation. The BFA Perfor ming Arts Program utilizes a number of methods to informally gather feedback from alumni, in cluding several Theatre & Dance Alumni Facebook groups, an annual alumni reunion in New York, an oncampus alumni reuni on every five years and a recent ly instituted alumni survey. Faculty also regularly communica te with alumni via email. In a field where most jobs are short term, it is diffi cult to genera te employment data comparable to ot her fields. Anecdotal informati on would suggest BFA pro gram graduates are quite competitive in the performing ar ts. Alumni are currently workin g in regional theatre companies, national tours, cruise ships, theme parks, film and television work, as well as teaching, dir ecting and being arts administra tors. Examples of successful alumni include Becky Ann Baker , Michael Rosenbaum , Matt Long , Ruby Lewis Benton Adam Perry Fouts, Jocelyn Moss . Program students have also gone onto graduate sc hools, includ ing, NYU, Yale, Penn State, SIU, University of Oregon, and KU. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Performing Arts BFA fa culty stay in close contact with entertai nment industry professionals and are continually adapting the BFA program to changes in the industry. This feedback is gather ed at profession conferences such as SETC and UPTA where student work is adjudicated by employers, and at events organiz ed by the department such as our New York Showcase. Most of the program faculty continue to work professionally themselv es, and maintain a close relatio nship with employers. A good example of this process was at our most recent New York Showcas e on 1/5/19 where 8 graduati ng seniors performed before a panel of six major New York ag ents and casting directors. Aft er the performance, the panelist s provided an hour of detailed feedback. Casting Director Michael Cassara provided an additional hour of audition workshop with the stud ents. Program faculty took detailed notes that will be used to f ine tune trai ning in future years. While feedback was overwhelmingly positive, faculty noted the need for additional coursework in f ilm and television acting as ca reer opportunities continue to grow in this area, as emphasized by industry professionals at t he showcase. The program will no w pursue additional faculty in this area to respon d to this need. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Theatre program makes a very concerted effort to keep reten tion high and boost the su ccess of incoming students. These efforts include a Universit y Experience class required of all department majors and team taught by department faculty. Each freshman is also assigned a student mentor from their prog ram. Each freshman student also meets with the full department faculty at the end of their fall and spring semester . At that time faculty makes sure they are on track with coursework, answer any questions they have, and discuss solutio ns for any challenges the are facing. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 3.7 12 Number of NTE Faculty .6 4 Dept. Cost per SCH* $108 $128 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 231 244 220 229 235 373.0 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 42.0% 45.5% 42.3% 44.9% 46.0% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 9 10 7 9 6 18.5 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 81.7% 72.2% 81.3% 77.9% 80.0% 37.3% * On the advice of Academic Affairs, we are reporting the depar tment average cost per SCHP. This is due to the fact that curriculum between all Theatre an d Dance degrees is so tightly interwoven. b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buy out time, philanthropic p otential, DELO revenue, corporateuniversity partnerships, and economic development rel ationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college, and/or university. (maximum 200 words) Theatre & Dance funds its extensive production series entirely through ticket sales. WKU provides no funding to support our shows, typically budget at a round $55,000 annually. The dep artment operates the Fine Ar ts Box Office in order to do this. Our annual budget is well below the average of benchma rk programs of a similar size. It is also highly unusual for a program of our size to be unsubsidized by their instituti on. Significant department resources must be dedicated to marketing department productions, straining personnel. Program faculty and students are frequent recipients of RCAP, QTAG FUSE, and student travel grants. The department also gener ates production revenue through individual and corporate sponsorships. The Theatre program has been fortunate to have recently recei ved two significant philanthropic gifts. The program is one of five to be supported annually from the $10 millio n Jerry Baker Endowment. We are also scheduled to receive a future estate gift from Dick Frockt of an endowed professorship. The Theatre Program also receives a few thou sand dollars annually of DELO i ncome generated by a small number of online, dual credit, Study Away, and Study Abroad classes. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Please note, the department typically offers 25 practicums (pro duction labs, performance labs, ensemble performance courses) every semester, compr ising roughly 29% of the total nu mber of courses. These pract icums are not included in teaching loads and are taken by students as part of their parti cipation in productions. Enro llments in these are typically quite small, 1 to 5 students, and significantly skew the median class size and underenrolled sections data above. NAST guidelines range from 12 to 20. After removing practicums from the equation, the average siz e of upper level courses in the Theatre Program is 15. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) A sample of specific S trategic Plan objectives addressed by the BFA Performing Arts Program: \"Provide opportunities for peopl e of the region to be educated, entertained, assisted, and inspired outside the classroom.\" The Theatre Program is a significa nt part of the cultural lands cape, providing entertainment and educational opportunities for a total audience of over 11,000 every year. \"Work with regional K12 and Com munity College educational syst ems to provide educational opportunities through outreach\" The Theatre Program provides per formances and wo rkshops to loca l schools, typically servi ng around 20 schools and over 3,000 K12 st udents per year. \"Facilitate high impact practice s, immersive learning in differ ent cultures, processlearning practices, and collaborative learning and instructional opportunities.\" The Theatre Program, following standards of the NAST, utilizes best practices to provide i mmersive, processlearning practices. Much of the learning takes place in the studio and o n the stage. Students deve lop extensive resumes of practical learning, supported by instruction from professors an d guest artists from the profession. \"prepare Personal and Professional Development Plans for each W KU student.\" The BFA Performing Arts Program has a very intensive and indivi dualized advising and retent ion process to chart student progress. Students are juried every semester and given individualized feedback mu ltiple times per year. Extensive career preparation is embedded in the curriculum. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Strategy 1.1., The Theatre Program increases cultural competenc e among students, staff, and faculty at WKU through its many productions which focus on diversity and inclusion. Strategy 8.1, The BFA Program has developed an intensive and ef fective advising an d jury process to e nsure the steady progress of its majors toward gra duation, and to continually me asure the effectiveness of the program's learning outcomes, curriculum, and preparation of its majors for professional work upon graduation. Strategy 8.2, The BFA Program fa culty are active ly engaged in c ontinual training as well as sch olarly and professional work to ensure their teaching is effectiv e, timely, and of the highest professional standards. Strategy 9.1., The BFA Program makes career development a prior ity by presenting its majors with numerous professional contacts, development of professio nal resumes, opportunities fo r professional apprenticeship s and summer training, and entrepreneurial opportunities to create their own theatre produ ctions. The program's focu s on high qual ity theatre performance gives the students p ractical experience within the field while strengthening their professional portfolios. Strategy 10.5., The BFA Program helps foster an innovative, cre ative and entrepreneurial culture at WKU and in the region through its many theatre productions, workshops, scholarly pres entations, and Colonnade courses. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) KY Workforce data suggests a 23% increase in demand for \"arts, design, entertainment\" professio nals over the next five years in the 27county service area. National data from the Bureau of Statistics forecasts a 12% inc rease in demand for actors, directors and producers nationally over the next decade, and a 6% increase in demand for singers and music directors. Multimedia artist demand should r ise by 8% over the decade. Cle arly, most employment opportunities in these fields are not in the WKU service area, and the majority of BFA Program gradua tes move to large metropo litan areas to pursue their careers. Those who stay within the service region teach, operat e youth theatre programs, or wor k in some forms of nonprofit administration. Overall, the art s and entertainment industry is predicted to grow at an above average rate over the next decade, thanks to demand in the areas of film and TV production , virtual reality and gaming media, web entertainment, cruise ship, and theme park growth. Nonprofit theatre productio n in the US is growing modestly and forecast to continue slow growth according the Theatre Communications Group. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The BFA Performing Arts Program is the only accredited theatre BFA in the state of Kentucky. Also, WKU is one of only 36 universities in the nation accred ited in all four arts areas: t heatre, dance, music and art and design. The WKU Theatre Program has a strong regional and national reputation. For exam ple, in 2015, Onstage Blog ranked WKU #6 in a list of the 10 most underrated theatre colleges in the Midwest. When polled, i ncoming program freshmen r eport choosing WKU over institutions such a Point Park, Elon, Savannah school of Art an d Design, NKU, University of C incinnati, U of L, UK, MTSU, Belmont, University of Michigan, Ball State, Hofstra, and the A merican Academy of Music and Drama. The program draws students from a number of state s, including Illinois, Indiana, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, Penn sylvania, and even California. The average incoming ACT is 25. The program is unique in the number of handson learning experi ences it offers. In 20172018, we produced 90 total performances of 32 individual wo rks, creating 797 onstage roles and 1040 backstage jobs for students. 2018 graduates of the program wer e employed by the Pacific Coas t Performing Arts Center, Serenbe Playhouse, Charleston Stage, Actors Theatre of Louis ville, Missoula Children's Theatr e, Royal Caribbean, and Disney. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Theatre Program very activel y recruits. Faculty not only pa rticipate in All WKU recruitmen t events such as Head for the Hill, but they also travel to eve nts such as the Governor's Sch ool for the Arts/Youth Performing Arts High School College and career Day Audition/Interviews, the Kentucky Thespian Festival College Day and Auditions, the Southeastern Theatre Conference Auditions/Interviews, and the summer GSA College Fai r. The department also holds an audition/interview day every spring which brings dozens of prospective students to cam pus. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The overall growth of this progra m's enrollments o ver the past two decades is clearly evident in the data. The major impediment to the continued growth and preeminence of this prog ram are lack of commensurate growth in faculty and staff to match those increased student enrollments, and the lack of f unding to support prod uction activities. The department is very interested in partnering further with th e WKU Film Program. There is already a very good working relationship, but we feel there are more opportunities for shar ing curriculum, faculty, resource s, and marketing. Looking at national trends and benchmark programs, there is evidence that a strong relationship between theatre and film would enhance the attractiveness of b oth programs, increasing enrollm ent. The increasing number of employm ent opportunities in the areas of cruise ship and theme park entertainment indicates that an additional faculty member in t he area of musical theatre and commercial dance would increase enrollment and employability. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National enrollment trends in th e visual and performing arts ha ve fallen somewhat over the last 5 years, after rising to a pea k around 2012. Contrasting that, t he BFA Performing Arts has gro wn steadily. Continued strong interest from prospective students during the fall 2018 se mester would indicate healthy e nrollment for the coming yea r. In fact, the WKU Theatre Program is the 14th largest accredited, public, undergraduateonly theatre program in the US. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The BFA Program faculty chose to discontinue the Directing conc entration and embarked on a redesign of the Acting concentration curriculum in 201 72018. The university's current freeze on program revisions h as suspended this effort. The department hopes to resume this process in 2019. We feel this w ill increase interest in this co ncentration and make a more uptodate, flexible, and accessible program for interested stu dents. The department has increased recruitment efforts in recent year s. The Potter College Creative Arts Scholarship has become an increasingly important elemen t of the recruitment process, p roviding scholarship support to 27 incoming students in the most recent year. The faculty ar e increasingly using email and social media to communicate wit h prospective students. We host, on average, three visits pe r week by prospective students and their families. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The program has strong prospects for continued growth in presti ge and enrollment, should resources be made available to support such efforts. The departm ent recently lost an instructo r/costume shop manager positio n (nonetheless incorporated in data above) which must be restored in order to maintain our production series. We are also short faculty in the areas of acting and history/theory. A new acting instructor would allow us to solidify our relationship w ith the Film Program. Current faculty are regularly teaching overloads to support the acting curriculum. In fact, reliance on parttime instructors to teach lower level courses skews the da ta regarding FTF SCHP productio n. Our sole theatre history and theory faculty member is also regularly teachin g overloads. A second faculty member in t his area would be necessary to support any enrollment increase. The department also l ost an instructor line in techni cal theatre several years ag o and this position needs replacement to support enrollment in the technical theatre prog rams. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or important complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teach-out may be required) Department/School: Potter College of Arts & Letters College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Brewing and Distilling Arts & Sciences Reference Number: 1733 CIP Code: Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): Certificate STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 10 List Concentrations (if any): N/A 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The BDAS is a workforce devel opment certificate that gives stud ents the background in the fundamentals of the brewing and distilling industries\u2014 the science, the business, an d the history or geography, as well as an internship\u2014they need to become competitive in the marketplace i n their given fields. It is specifically designed to be a complementary program, exi sting alongside whatever major f ield interests the student, and to help them gain employment in the industry in a field related to their major. S o, students looking to move into any aspect of the brewing or distilling industry\u2014whether it be in advertising, gr owing \"heirloom\" grains, working on the Bourbon Trail, in the financial side of the industry, as a brewer or di stiller, or in one of the many o ther parts of the industry, would take the BDAS certificate to complement majors in Adverti sing/PR, Agriculture, Accounting, Biology, Chemistry or some other major . As an example, in 2015 only abou t 10% of the workforce at Jim Beam was dedicated to the production of alcohol. The other 90% helps sup port that mission in a variety of ways. This certificate speaks to workforce development viz. that balance. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a. IR 201314 SCHP n/a n/a n/a 0 1 44 b. In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) This certificate is meant to be c omplementary to other majors, and because of the interdisciplinary nature most of the courses are drawn from already-existing programs. The ferme ntation science course is the only one that does not; it is narrowly specific and does not support other program s. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) This data goes from the beginning of the program, in fall 2016, to the 17-18 year. For the fall 2018 snapshot the BDAS certificate has 15 students in the program, which is highe r than the 17/18 median, and demonstrates significant growth over three years. \"SCHP\" is not an relevant measur e for this program, as there ar e no faculty dedicated to this program\u2014they are located in other programs and their SCHP follows them to their departments. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 n/a b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) SLOs: Have a basic familiarity with the brewing and distilling indust ries, including the underlying science, the management and business, and history; Have experience, through an inter nship, in a distillery or brew ery. Means of assessment: For BDAS 300, HIST 341, and EN T 312 the assessments were conduc ted through in-class written and oral examinations and assignments. For BDAS 495 (Internship) the assessment is conducted via writt en assignments, oral examinations, and a feedback interview with the stude nt by the program co-coordinat or. A recent example of assessment fo r the internship came from a s tudent who spent a summer as a quality control sensory analyst at Heaven Hill. T he interview helped us underst and how to better design internship experiences at large versus small distilleries. T his is applicable to brewerie s as well, and will help us be tter tailor the internship experiences to fit the kinds of s ituations in which students wi ll find themselves in the working world. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) This is a new program, and to dat e we have graduated one studen t from this certificate. He has been employed at Jim Beam since May 2018. The progr am is too new for more extens ive assessment. We do not envision graduate school as a normal progression from this certificate program, a s graduate school does not enhance student prospects within the industry. Key areas of professional opportunity are the myriad jobs in a brewery or distillery, as well as ancillary industries such as agriculture, construction, enginee ring, tourism, and so forth. This certificate is meant to complement existing majors in this regard. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In summer 2014 Dr. Webb and I inte rviewed almost a dozen brewer s and distillers in Kentucky to help us design the program. The courses we included were based on those interv iews. The program co-coordinators make regular visits to, and are in regular phone and e-mail contact with, br eweries and distilleries in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana, and attend industry conf erences to get a sense of the changing needs in the industry. Based on that feedback we have modified the i nternship requirements, and ins tructors in the history and marketing courses have modified their curriculum. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Data for the n/a col umns above was either not available, or was not separated out from the other programs in 99AR in a way that could be u sed for the CAPE process. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by 12 Number of NTE Faculty n/a 4 Cost per SCHP/FTF by Dept. n/a n/a n/a n/a 36.3%* b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Revenue for this program was in itiated with a donation from All tech, Corp, the parent company of Kentucky Ale. Each year the BDAS program receives $27,493, with the final pay ment coming in December 2019. The current (Jan 2019) account balance is $51,824. Expenses for the program are minimal\u2014student tra vel, program faculty conference travel, equipment and supplies for the BDAS 300 cour se, and some other minor expenses\u2014and come from that account, not the general university E & G budget. The program coordinators are enga ged in philanthropic outreach to other breweries and distilleries for continued program support. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The costs for this certificate we re not separated out from seve ral other programs in the I R data we received for 99AR. However, program costs for BDAS a re minimal. The internship cou rse is supervised as an overload by one of the program co-coordinators. The ENT 312, HIST 341, and GEO 386 cou rses are all Colonnade courses offered as part of regular departmental rotations, regardless of the BDAS certi ficate. The BDAS 300 lab science course is offered each spring and the BDAS Foundation account pays for lab suppli es and offers to pay replacement costs for the for the faculty in biology who teaches that course. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The BDAS program addresses a number of components of WKU's stra tegic plan, including: \"A Diverse Body of Students\"\u2014Forty percent of students current enrolled in the BDAS certificate are women. This is higher than most programs in the country, and hi gher than industry employment (~20% in craft brewing, \"Facilitate high impact practices. \"\u2014BDAS 495 is an internship, which all students must complete and which has been identified as a high-impact practice. \"Schedule course offerings . . .\"\u2014BDAS is offered every spring, all other courses are offered every semester. \"Engage with the communities we s erve . . .\"\u2014The program has pa rtnered with regional breweries and distilleries to created student- centered learning opportunities including promotional brewing opportunities. \"Sustainable Budget Model\"\u2014This program is independently funded . \"Incentivize and support resear ch and creative activities that promote student learning\"\u2014Students conduct research relevant to the brewing and distilling industry, along side industry professionals. \"Develop shared intellectual cap ital and viable products throug h collaborations, internships, and other partnerships.\"\u2014This program engag es in ongoing partnerships wit h breweries and distilleries in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The BDAS program meets a number of components of the statement strategic agenda, including: 4.2\u2014\"Strengthen partnerships w ith business and industry . . .\" This program works closely with brewers and distillers to ensur e that faculty have access to relevant industry information, data, trends, and ot her \"teachable\" information fo r use in their course offerings. The program itself relies on consulting advice from brewers and distillers in the KY/TN/IN region, and in turn the co-coordinators give their own expertise to the industry at conferences and thr ough site visits. 6.3\u2014\"Share, implement, and evaluate high-impact educational pra ctices . . .\" The internship is the cornerst one of the BDAS certificate, and provides students with real-world experience in preparation for the job market. Program coordinators 9.4\u2014\"Promote regular, meaningful employer involvement in the de velopment and evaluation of postsecondary programs. . .\" Program coordinators meet regular ly with industry leaders to he lp refine the program and student opportunities. 9.5\u2014\"Identify current and emerging workforce demands . . .\" Program coordinators attend the major industry conference in br ewing and in distilling, and gather information from the brewing and the distilli ng trade associations to help understand employment a nd market trends. The brewing class and the internship experience are modified accord ingly based on that input. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Craft brewing in Kentucky is a $750 million industry (2017 stat s), while distilling employs more than 15,000 and is worth $8.5 billion to the state (2016). This certificate is des igned to place students in many places within the industry by helping them round out an existing career major. Th e workforce data at the supplied link does not have a category for brewing or dis tilling (oddly enough). However, a lmost any category in the list fits a major program that is enhanced by the BDAS certificate. For example Healthca re, Legal, Graphic Design, Construction, Accounting, Agriculture, etc. are all related to the alcohol in dustry in some way. Primary majors for students in BDAS include Entrepreneurship, A nthropology, Hospitality, Marke ting, Graphic Design, Social Media Marketing, Finance, and Political Science, all of which are majors associa ted with fields in the \"Futu re Skills\" database linked above. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) There are some two dozen brewing majors and minors in the count ry, with more being created each year. The vast majority are fermentation scien ce programs, while a few focus o n the business side. The largest and most well- known brewing programs (UC Davis , Appalachian State, Oregon Sta te, Niagara College Canada) have large labs and feature multiple science cl asses. Ours is, as of this writ ing, the only interdisciplinary program that complements an existing career major and is speaks to career in terests apart from becoming a brewmaster or a master distiller. Simply put, at current and foreseeable fundin g and staffing levels, WKU cannot compete with those programs. The design of the BDAS was based on statewide i ndustry feedback, and gives us a strategic niche that contributes to our success. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) This is very specifically a w orkforce development program. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program goingforward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Right now most of the students in the program are interested in the distilling side of the industry. That's to be expected because of our location , but the craft beer industry i s still growing in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana. The BDAS program needs to market itself to that side of the ind ustry more effectively. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Brewing and Distilling programs a re not listed in the national trends. Indeed there are only one or two programs that train people for both industries, and no other programs at all that are not fermentation science programs. In that sense this program is unique, and we are therefore the leader i n our programmatic discipline. This is likely why we field so many requests from nationwide breweries and distilleri es asking if we have students ready for employment or internships. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) This program is in its third year . The one revision we have ena cted is to add the Geography course for additional flexibility. Given WKU curricular requirements instituted by th e UCC last year, the number of hours in the certificate will need to be raised to a minimum of 12 in the ne xt year. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) In five years this program should grow to about 25-35 students in its current configuration. It works well as a service certificate to complement students' career paths. In 10 years it would be good to have a dedicated Fermentation Science faculty line in Biology, and another dedic ated line in the business co llege in order to provide more specific courses relevant to the industry and to increase the number of students to 50-75. We have marked \"maintain\" below , but in truth this program has excellent \"grow/enhance\" potential. Just not in the current economic climate. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Broadcasting/Sch ool of Journalism and Broadcasting College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Broadcasting Reference Number: 726 CIP Code: 090402 Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): AB STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 39 List Concentrations (if any): N/A 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting major provides s tudents with the ability to be active professionals in broadcast journalism, broadcast management, and video production th rough classes presenting eth ical standards, theory, and prac tical application. Students learn about the import ance of protecting a journalist's rights as provided by the First Amendment and how to be inclusive when dealing with a diverse audience. They create content for local, regional, national, and international communities. Each course in the Broadcasting major builds on the knowle dge of the previous semester, ultimately leading to a capstone course. That capstone, in either news/sports reporting, radio/television man agement, or video production , prepares the student to step directly into the broadcasting profession after graduation. Prospective majors may take no more than 15 hours in the major before admission. Students must also meet the following requirements before th ey can be admitted: 1. Completion of a minimum of 24 hours of coursework applicable to a baccalaureate degree 2. Completion of ENG 100 with a grade of C or higher and 9 addi tional hours in the Colonnade Program 3. Completion of SJB 101, SJB 102, BCOM 201, and BCOM 266 with a grade of C or higher. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET January 2019 2.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The WKU mission statement states , \"Western Kentucky University prepares students to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizenleaders of a global society.\" Production, engagement, and ethical social interaction are all key elements of Broadcasting. Our students create content (audio, video, or online) which showcases the diversity of our community, state, and nation. Their training and projects in the classroo m force them to seek stories fro m outside their personal sphere and develop professional inclusive relationships with members o f the community. The Broadcasting program provides a writing course (BCOM 325) f or the Advertising and Public R elations major. That course provides students with an overvi ew of the broadcast writing sty le for multiple outlets. The enr ollment in this writing class by broadcasting and other majors is so overwhelming that we could offer and fill three sections every semester. Broadcasting also offers Meteorolo gy majors two courses (BCOM 3 28 and BCOM 329) in weather graphic development and weather program production. An average of ten students per seme ster takes these courses. Finally, Broadcasting provides a series of video editing course s (BCOM 366, 380, and 480 ) which share their enrollment with the Film major. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Students in the Broadcasting pro gram are required to cover huma n interest stories in the co mmunity. There are multiple platforms within the B roadcasting major: NewsChannel12 \u2014 A 30minute telecast of news, weather, and sports. NewsChanne l12 focuses on the university community. WWHRFM \u2014 Revolution 91.7 targets adult listeners aged 18 34 who attend Western Kentucky University, and young professionals in Bowling Green an d surrounding areas. It featur es news, weather, sports and g enrespecific programming. In addition, a public affairs platform show airs twice a week. WKYUPBS \u2014 Broadcasting students create original content for PBS and wor k for the station as production assistants, editors, and master control operators. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student learning outcomes are as follows: 1. Storytelling: ability to create interactive, inclusive, and soc ially significant pieces fo r the broadcast audience 2. Critical Thinking: abl e to solve complex situations when workin g as a broadcaster in the field 3. Legal, Ethics, and History: knowledge of laws and ethics which guide the broadcasting industry One issue the departm ent found during our l ast accreditation pr ocess was with the area of diversity. Diversity is integrated i nto all of the Broadcasting course s, but to take i t one step furthe r, a dedicated course, SJB 310 or Media Diversity, was added to the curriculum. In addition, we have identifie d a list of upper -level courses on diversity offered by other programs at the University. Our majors may mee t this requirement by taking a di versity course from this list. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting major is review ed through a selfassessment st udy provided to our accrediting body, Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Ma ss Communications (ACEJMC). Accor ding to our last study, recent graduates from the Broadcasting program h ave a 77% fulltime em ployment rate in the media industry. When other fields are added to that number, more than 80 percent of recent graduates are employed f ulltime. Some of the areas Broadcasting st udents are finding fulltime em ployment include: Reporting and editing Audio production Broadcast management Broadcast sales Mass communication law TV Field production Electronic/Social media Radio or television announcer Sound engineering technician News/Sports analyst News/Sports Reporter Television production director d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)?

(maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting faculty maintain a professional advisory board consisting of alumni from rad io, television, management, and production. We are working on another assessment of our pr ogram by that board during the 2019/2020 academic year. We consulted with members of our professional advisory board wh en purchasing equipment for our new high definition studio. Because of their input, we were able to obtain equipme nt for the station that is the industry standard and is durable enough to deal with student wearandtear in a classroom enviro nment. Our board members also helped us find reputable venders and keep our costs below budget. We also have faculty who serve on professional broadcasting boa rds. Those faculty gather inf ormation on the latest trends and skill sets required by gradua tes for employment in the broa dcasting industry and adjust their course materials to make our students more competit ive and better prepared. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Students in the Broadcasting program routinely win awards for t heir work at the state, regional , and national level(last year alone, our students took home ten Kentucky AP awards for radio and television). Those awards come from professional organizations like the Associat ed Press, Society of Professiona l Journalists, the Broadcast E ducators Association, and the National Academy of Television Ar ts and Sciences. Students ha ve received accolades for their work in public affairs, investigative journalism, breaking news, and video /studio produ ction. All of these awardwi nning pieces are created for class, faculty approved, and peer reviewed. These awards include the Kentuck y Associated Press awards for B est Radio Reporter, Best T elevision Reporter, Best Newscast, Best Overall in Radio , and Best Overall in Television . We have won two regional st udent Emmy awards for onair talent and one for news coverage (we have also received quite a few honorable mentions). Our students have received national awards for reporting a nd sports production (the recipi ent of the reporting award became a news anchor straight out of college and the sports production winner is now working in a top thirty market as a tele vision photojournalist). Our studentrun sportscast (the Extra Point) was named runnerup fo r a national award from the Broadcast Educators Association. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Broadcasting department has the following accounts: Remiszewski Fund for Exc ellence in Broadcasting This is an endowed account. You have a separate account that ea rns interest or dividends and a percentage is then put into this account for use by Broadcasting. Terry Climer Fund for Broadcasting Excellence This is a nonendowed fund. No separate interest or dividend ea rnings Dept. of Broadcasting This is also nonendowed. No sepa rate interest or dividend earn ings. Donations to Broadcastin g are generally put into this account. WWHR Radio This is nonendowed and donations for WWHR are placed in this a ccount. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) We have changed our curriculum in Broadcasting to cover classes that are required and move away from courses that were under enrolled. However, we have hit the limit for our efficie ncy. Without the faculty and in structor lines we have recently lost or have gone unf illed, we will no longer be able to meet o ur obligations to our students. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) As is required by the by WKU's strategic plan, our students dev elop critical thinking skills, understand the importance of inclusion and diversity in our industry, and learn the professi onal skills needed to gain employm ent quickly after graduation. Our student's critical thinking comes from our projects and in class assignments. They are prov ided with the necessary tools and guidance to overcome a situa tion, but it is up to them to p ersevere. Their understanding of diversit y and inclusion comes from assig nments where students are forced out of their comfort zone and required to work with other races, religions, cultures, and genders. Their new percept ion is then shared in class. Good advising by our faculty and a streamlined curriculum allow s our students to graduate within four years. On average, our students graduate in under four years. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The Council on Postsecondary Edu cation identifies encouraging m ore people to take advantage of postsecondary opportunities as one of their urgent priorities. Broadcasting w orks with prospective (recruitin g events, lectures, and tours) and current students (professio nal and academic advising) to ma ke assist the Council in a chieving that goal. The Broadcasting department also encourages more people to take advantage of postsecondary opportunities by providing programs and services that reach future students. We have the a nnual Mark of Excellence awards which are presented by WKU. The entries are ju dged by our Broadcasting faculty, and aw ards are given to the most gifted Kentucky High School journalism students. Our interac tion and feedback as faculty en courages these students and provides them with an idea of the training they will receive in our department. Broadcasting faculty members and our stude nt ambassadors also take the time to set up oneonone appointments with potential students and their families to explain the program in detail and answer any questions they have a bout the Broadcasting curriculu m. After the question and an swer session, the visitor is taken on a private tour of our labs and studios. Finally, our f aculty regularly attend recruiting events to attract students, both locally and statewide. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Council on Postsecondary Edu cation also states that guiding more graduates to a career path is critical for Kentucky. The Broadcasting program curriculum is designed specif ically to all ow our graduates to leave the classroom and step into the newsroom/control room. Students ar e trained with the latest ind ustry technology and taught to use it in a legal and ethical manner. Students acquire professio nal internships which reinfor ce the student's interest in broadcasting, allows the student to make professional contacts, an d receive credit toward their major. The Broadcasting department enters our students' work into state, regional, and n ational awards. Those entries o ften win, showcasing the stude nt's talent to an extended audience, introducing the student to potential employers, and p roviding the student with a resume which will make them stand out when pursuing employment in the industry. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting department at W KU has been named a program of distinction by the state of Kentucky. Our faculty are not only academics, but also worki ng professionals in our field of study. We provide our students with an education in theory, including legal and ethical issues . Many of those issues invol ve inclusion and providing a diverse voice in our industry. We also offer our students a pragma tic approach toward journalism, production, and management. The combination of both theory and practical application creates well rounded graduates . That is why our students are often sought after by news, sales, and production managers, even before those students grad uate from the program (hence our 80% fulltime employment for recent graduates). Our pragmatic approach also leads to other benefits. Our stude nts win awards because the y are creating professional content that employers want to see from their own employees. T hat is why our students won ten awards from the Kentucky Associated Press (inclu ding Best Television Reporter and Best R adio Reporter), three stude nt Emmy awards (with six honorable mentions), won two national awards from the Society o f Professional Journalists, place d seventh nationally in the Television Hearst competition, an d won multiple national awards from the Broadcast Educ ators Association. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) It should be added that our students win more Associated Press awards at the state level than any other broadcasting program in Kentucky. Every area of our program is award winnin g, including television, radio, pr oduction, news, and sports. Our students also win s cholarships for their work in our progra m. Just last year, WKU senior Dalton Godbey won the Tom Peterson Memorial Scholarship. That scholarship is awarded to only one Kentucky student st udying broadcasting. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Now that we have a digital foundation in the program, our stude nts can explore multimedia platforms and create exceptional content to share with a larger audience. Social med ia (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) and other online outlets (podcasting) can now hav e more of a prominent place in the Broadcasting curriculum. We can also teach drone piloting and the ethical respo nsibilities journalists face when using drones in the field. Audio and video are being used by more fields than ever. Video shooting and editing is us ed for sales, marketing, commercials, athletics, engineerin g, etc. Our classes could be used by more majors on campus. Our audio outlets can service just as many majors, if not more . There is so much potential f or growth in our program. Howeve r, if our staffing issue is not addressed, growth will be impossible. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Visual and performing arts is on e of the most successful areas of academics nationally. Since Broadcasting falls into that region of study, it is no wonder why we are the largest program in the School of Journalism and Broadcasting. There has never been a time when the public consumed more audio and video content than they are today. We train students to provide that content for multipl e platforms. That is why we ca n maintain our numbers. Our recent decline in enrollment has nothing to do with our rel evance or curriculum. Three ma jor factors have contributed to those numbers. First, our previous director did not see the importance of recr uiting. Our unit has seen this as one of the biggest issues wi th student enrollment. We have taken steps to reach out to potent ial students both loca lly and nationally. Second, we separated from Film as a major. The production port ion of Broadcasting gave birth to the Film program. Our students did not leave the Univer sity, they just moved into the new major. Finally, we have several lines t hat have not been replaced afte r faculty member have retired or left the university. This is forcing us to rely upon adjuncts and current faculty teaching o verloads. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting department has updated all of the equipment in the program to High Definitio n (field cameras and studio) and digital nonlinear editing (Av id and Premiere). HD has beco me the industry standard, so the Broadcasting program must use that equipment to provide th e students with a relevant educ ation. The department has also updated all of the digital editing software to the latest industry standards. These change s have made studentcreated content look more professional and helped those students win more state, regional, and nationa l awards. The radio station, WWHR 91.7, has added a digital channel to it s broadcasts. That channel is called Evolution and will allow for more original local programing and studentproduced content to reach audiences in the community. WWHR has also added multiple digital studios a nd a fully functional radio new sroom, which is used to create h ourly newscasts and socially driven platform reports. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The Broadcasting department will continue to teac h creative sto ry tellers, producti on specialists, and m anagers. Since we have a digital foundation in pla ce for program, our faculty can continue to build our curriculu m (reflecting industry needs) over the next decade. With proper recruiting and faculty numbe rs, we will be able to change with the industry, maintain our relevance, and increase our student enrollment. Our greatest disadvantage at the moment is our lack of faculty. We currently have two and a half faculty in our department teaching over 200 students. We h ave one line that fed one of th e most important areas of our department (producing) withheld and cut last year. There is a shortage of producers n ationwide and cutting this area of study in our major has had a major effect. We have an instru ctor that teaches multiple core courses including law and ethi cs, news writing, and radio production that is in transitiona l retirement. We desperately need to fill her position or the major will no longer function. We also had a tenuretrack faculty member in production leave u nexpectantly last semester. We have a temporary hire who is helping us cover those courses , but we really need that facu lty line filled. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

(maximum 200 words) Integration of Highimpact Pract ices into a Proficiencybased C urriculum : The Chinese major is built upon student centered curriculum and standard sbased assessments. It provide s WKU undergraduates with extensive language training (on campus and abroad) and an indepth study of Chines e culture and society (through studyabroad, Flagship Capstone, internships a nd experiential student activit ies). It transforms the lives of students and prepares them to be linguistically profici ent, culturally competent and globally ready for their future careers. Individualized learning trajectories : Thirtysix credit hours are required in this major, and it al so requires another major or minor. No course with a grade of \"D\" or below may be c ounted toward the major. A. Prior Skills : Some of the required course wo rk may be accomplished through approved methods (external or internal standardbased exams) for demonstration of previous kn owledge; B. Experiential Learning : Students may select the regular CHIN coursework to achieve fu nctional competence, targeted at intermediatehigh and advancedlow proficiency; C. Exceptional Performances : Students may take the intensive Chinese Flagship coursework ( CHNF) to achieve professional competence, targeted at advanced and superior prof iciency. Chinese Flagship students must remain in good standing in the Ho nors College or Honorseligibl e to enroll in the CHNF courses.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Students successfully complet ing the Chinese major will: 1) Demonstrate interpretive listening and reading skills at the intermediatehigh prof iciency level, which provides them with enhanced opportunities for careers at the regional, n ational, and international levels, and prepare them for postgraduate programs. o Students enrolled in regular CHIN courses take standardized Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) , Level 4 or Level 5; o Students enrolled in Flagship CHNF courses take standardized Av ant STAMP tests or BYU Listening and Reading tests; o Students completing the Flagship Capstone year take American Co uncil listening and reading tests. 2) Demonstrate presentational speaking and writing skills at the advancedlow proficiency level, and interact with Chinese people in a cult urally appropriate way. o Students usually take ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (externa l assessment) or exit program interview (internal assessment); o No standardized writing assessmen t exists due to the nature of the Chinese language since the formal (in contrast to colloquial spoken la nguage) writing skill is primar ily developed at the advanced level. 3) Demonstrate general knowledge about Chinese culture , especially the history, civiliz ation, and society of China and Taiwan, and appropriately participate in crosscultural communication where race, ethnicity, and/ or gender all play a part. o Several thematic events are organized to provide students with the public showcase opportunities to put their cultural knowledge and intercultural competency into practices, including Chinese Calligraphy Exhibit, Chinese Film Reenactment, Chinese Classics in Drama: from Page to Stage , Chinese Resume Competition, and Chinese Mock Interview . Datainformed Changes : After finding that some students struggled with prestudyabr oad tests or underperformed in the exitprogram assessments in 2015, we created and started to offer CHIN209/409 Chinese Lab I/II (Independent Courses) in 2016 to help them pre pare for the highstake assess ments as well as Honors the sis projects. After that, we made steady progress in the final results. c.

In December 2018, Dr. Laura McGee, Ms. Amanda Lich and Dr. Ke Peng will attend the Language Flagship Development Officers Meeting at San Francisco State University to learn: (1) how to prepare the US Workforce for the Global Future; (2) Development strategies: assessing the possib ilities; (3) Foundation and cor porate relations; (4) Engaging alumni and friends; (5) Deferred and planned giving. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Effectual Cost per SCHP (<$73) : In 20172018, a total of 627 SCHP was generated (409 for the major, 52 for the minor and 166 for general education). The TE faculty member dedicated 70% of her time to the major and the rest to the minor, program coordination and administration. The actual cost is much lower because (1) the TE faculty position started in 2011 and her annual s alary is $15,000 lower than the departmental average, (2) the current NTE faculty position is 100% sponsored by external seed money, and (3) the majority of the courses are ta ught by visiting scholars or graduate assistants via external funding. DELO (990 SCHP/year) : Dual Credit Chinese is offered in 12 high schools, which serv e as feeder programs for the Chinese program. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Focus on career readiness and student success: The program produces highly comp etitive students as testified i n Section 3 above. Personalized Learning Enhanced w ith Highimpact Practices and D iversity, Equity and Inclusion : Faculty integrate internships, studyabroad programs and undergraduate research t o the program. Affordability, accessibility and sustainability : The program is cost efficient by making full advantage of ext ernal resources and extends an affordable opportunity to the students from throughout the state and beyond. Provide a global context to the WKU Experience: The program prepares students through engaging coursework and experience abroad to be ready for their professional endeav ors and to become responsible citizens of the local, regional, and global comm unities. At the national level , enrollment of Chinese courses at higher education grew from 51,382 in 2006 to 53,069 in 2016. The growing number for Chinese majors at WKU reflects the same trend. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) This program presents careerready opportunities ( Goal 9) to students in Kentucky and neighboring states ( Goal 2), and increases effectiveness of K 12 teachers by developing a ne w teacher certification program ( Goal 4). It also focuses on student success ( Goal 6) by aligning learning outcomes t o the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages proficiency st andards and by delivering consi stent retention and gradua tion results since its inception. It also blends applied and translational research to students' undergraduate experience ( Goal 10) demonstrated in the high percentage of Flagship students receiv ing FUSE grant year after year. Last but not least, the program contributes to Impact by training a globally competitive, entrepreneurial workforce, educating an engaged, informed citizenry thro ugh effective use of external f unding and resources. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) With the growing economic, polit ical and cultural significance of Chinese societies worldwide, the need for citizens with advanced Chinese language skills and a sophisticated under standing of Chinese culture is increasing dramatically (ref. 2009 NSEP report of 100 business leaders). Over 3,300 critical language lear ners with advanced to superior level proficiency have joined the Federal Government in varied departments during the past decade. In November 2018, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin led trade trip to China. Chineseowned compani es employ about 8,700 people Kentucky. ( http://wdrb.web.franklyinc.c om/story/39425523/kentuckygov mattbevintoleadtradetriptochina ) d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspectsof the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) We are one of the most unique recruiting programs at WKU. First ly, Chinesemajor is only offe red in two institutions in Kentucky. Secondly, the Chinese Flagship Program is one of the twelve most intensive Chines e language programs in the nation with rigorous curriculum tied to clear proficiency objec tives sponsored by the National Security Education Programs. As mentioned above, ov er 55% of Flagship students cam e to WKU for this prestigi ous program and 25% of Flagship students come from out side of statement. Thirdly, we a re super cost efficient and quality effective. Last but not least, 100% of our faculty member s are minority in ethnicity. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Chinese is one of the fastest gro wing languages in the U.S. and the recent visit of Govern or Matt Bevin to China in November 2018 also illustrates th e strategic position of this p rogram in the commonwealth of Kentucky. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) I can see many opportunities going forward: WKU becomes THE place in Kentucky and neighboring sta tes to study foreign languages, especially critical languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian etc. By working seamlessly and strate gically with the Office of Scho lar Development and the Office of Study Aboard and Global Learning, we extend affordable and quality study abroad experie nces to help more Kentucky students make transformational changes in life and become globalready citize ns. Develop partnership with other programs at WKU to create person alized and solid p athways for Domain + Chinese skills. e.g. Criminology + Chinese, Inte rnational Business + Chinese, I nternational Affairs + Chines e, Psychology + Chinese, Journalism+ Chinese, Bio logy + Chinese. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Chinese continues to serve as a critical language andimmense ca reer opportunities range from intelligence agencies (homeland security & law enforce ment: growing number of bachelo r's degree conferred) to other government and business jobs. Chinese as a critical language and business (growing number of bachelor's degree conferred) has a growing number of enrollments at higher education from 51,382 in 2006 to 53,069 i n 2016. Our program implements a significant number of measures of high impact practices endorsed in higher education. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The merger between the Chinese major & minor program and the Ch inese Flagship program started in July 2018. After curricular and personnel changes, we expect to achieve higher S CHP and better program effe ctiveness and efficiency. We are a new program (inception in 2014), therefore, many of ou r new graduates are still pur suing advanc ed degrees, who have a high potential in becoming future donors. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Five Years (20182023): Create three concentrations: Exploratory (Intercultural Competency/ Novi cehigh Proficiency Level, e.g. journal report and travel in China), Experiential (Functional Competence/ Intermediate Proficiency Level, e.g. l ocalization) and Exception (Professional Competence/Advance d and Superior Proficiency Leve l, e.g. Translation and Int erpretation, Intelligence, Government, etc.) Higher SCHP through strategic curricular to Colonnade/Fou courses su ch as Conducting Busine ss in Chinese Market co taught with professors in International Business program, and C hinese Films cotaught with professors in English. HIPs: We will continue our High Impa ct Practices to deliver active recruitment, high persistence and successful graduation. Ten Years (20182028): Customization and individualization in student learning traject ories: three concentrations with different paces and distinctive domain/field interests AI and Technologyenhanced language learning experiences : Online and ondemand Chinese language courses at intermediate and advanced levels with either facetoface immer sion experiences or synch ronous online tutoring experiences enhanced with techno logy and deep learning models. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Certificate in Communicating in Healthcareis a 12 credit ho urprogram focused on understanding the role of communication in healthcare contexts. It explores interpersonal as well as organizational fact ors affecting he althcare and assists students in developing co mmunication strategies and ski lls to communicate more effect ively within their health profession but also knowing how b etter to communicate with pati ents to maximize compliance and enhance advocacy. The program is ideal for students employed in the health professions, studying for advanced health degrees, or planning to hold a communication position in any organization . Students take 6 credit hours of required courses related to h ealth communication and health campaigns; 3 credit hours of a restric ted elective providing broad coverage of communication within contexts relevant to healthcare such as intercultural, g roup, interpersonal, and organizational communication; and 3 credit hours of a free elective f rom healthcare administration, public health, or gerontology. A ll program courses are offered at night, online, or on weekends to serve workingage adults in pu rsuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials while maintaining fulltime employment . Admission to our program require s a minimum unde rgraduate GPA of 2.75 and an academic writing sample. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a. IR 201314 0 0 2 4 Conferrals N/A 0 0 0 0 5 SCHP N/A 0 0 0 6 44 b. In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Certificate in Communicating in Healthcare (#0475) compleme nts the Master of Arts in Organizational Communication (#0012) and the Certificate in Communicating in Organizations ( #0471) programs because it focuses on applied communication within healthcare c ontexts. Topics include commun ication with clients, communication campaign development, and the assessment of communication programs. Our certificate contributes to other nonCommunication Master's and Doctoral Degree prog rams at WKU, such as in organi zational leadership, nursing administration, public health and health care administration. Moreover, it contributes to th e university mission in that it provides opportunities for students to engage in a pplied research and lifelong learning op portunities leading to produ ctive careers and increased capacity to make a good life. Our certificate program is not re quired for the Master of Arts in Organizational Communication degree. While it took a few years for students to start enrolli ng in our certificate program, t he number is increasing with ea ch year. There were 2 students enrolled in 201718 and 5 students in 20182019 . These students are seek ing a master's degree in public health and organizational leadership. We anticipate e nrollment growth as WKU's gr aduate programs in health continue to grow. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) While enrollment of the certificate was slow to start, we have worked with the Nursing department and Public Health to expand elective offerings that w ould fit within their graduate programs. Since making these changes, the enrollment has increased. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 N/A b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Students in the certificate prog ram will: (1) analyze and apply communication and health theories to help explain factors that affect the delivery of health ca re, (2) evaluate communication behaviors in health care relationships, health care teams, and health care organizations, (3) identify communication variables that affect communicating in health care contexts, (4) critiqu e the effectiveness of health communication campaigns, (5) develo p a wellrounded understanding of communication processes within contexts that a pply to healthcare including in terpersonal, organizational, and intercultural, and (6) understand the centrality of communication in health care admin istration, public health, and health behavior. These learning objectives are indirectly assessed within individual coursework through multiple tools such as exams, application papers, presentations, research proposals, and qualitative, quantitativ e, and rhetorically grounded primary research studies. Students, who pass each course an d maintain a 3.0 overall GPA, complete the certificate program . If a student fails a course, however, they are required to repeat the course. If the deficie ncy persists, the gra duate curriculum committee would discuss how deficiencies need to be addressed, what curriculum changes are needed, and then consult r elevant faculty to implement the changes. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We have not tracked our graduates to date, because we not yet h ad any.According to the 2018 Postsecondary Feedback Report on \"Student Employment outcomes (FFY 1116)\" prepared by KCEWS, key areas of professional development for students completing our certific ate program are in health and h ealth care administration/ma nagement and organizational leadership. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In 2013, our department establish ed an Advisory Council compris ed of leaders in their respect ive professions. The council, which offers biannual feedback to our program, has been instru mental in helping the depart ment identify the skills and competencies our students need t o achieve career success. Our p rogram also has plans to conduct employee surveys of our MA graduates every three years starting in the summer of 2019 f or students graduating from 20172019 to systematically assess employer needs and/or sat isfaction. We plan to contact t hese students' employers directl y via email and request that the appropriate supervisor complete our online survey. We have started and maintain a list (vi a excel spreadsheet) of MA graduates' careers and employers that we intend to update yearl y so that contacting employers will be easily achieved for future surveys. e.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Our major external revenue strea m is through DELO monies genera ted by teaching online. Further, the department enjoys modest donor support. These combined resources are used to supp ort student travel to conferences and student research costs, such as small reward s for survey recipients. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Communication Studies and Corp orate and Organizational Comm unication faculty members wh o hold graduate status (7 tenure/track and 1 nontenure track as of AY 18) all teach in t he graduate program, so all are included in the calcultations a bo e. In AY 18, when the percentage of faculty effort in all the c ourses taught in the grad program are added up, the total comes to 1. Since the work of the prog ram is spread across 8 people, it is highly cost effective. In the Communication in Healthca re certificate, currently, we d o not have a fulltime faculty member in healthcare, so the Communication classes are taught online by Dr. Stephanie Dopson , a PHD who works fulltime at the Center for Disease Control. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program is designed for heal th care professionals seeking a dvanced training in health c ommunication by integrating communication theory, practice, and problembased research in d ealing with realworld proble ms. This addresses the WKU Mission, Experience, and Strategic Plan in s everal ways. Our pr ogram provides research and lifelong learning opportunities to our graduate students and working professionals wanting to enha nce their skills and abilities to be productive workers and engaged citizens, as well as to enrich the qualit y of life for those within their reach. Our program has effectively woven in highimpact practices throughout as it is writingintensive, en courages collaborative learning, explores \"difficult difference s,\" and encourages internships. The new certificate program was int roduced in Fall 2014 and offere d completely online. This was to match job market opportunities so that our course rotation s chedule would maximize student progression and completion (see Our Hill - G.3: Strat.12 ), and also to be more accessible for workingage adults in the pursuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials on the other (see Our Community and Beyond - G.3: Strat.9 & 10 ). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program aligns with the stat ewide strategic agenda to incre ase the education and skill leve ls of employees to catalyze state economic development. Strat. 1.1 & 1.4 - We offer courses that increase cultural competence and recru it underrepresented students and faculty, including international students (see 5.e for details). Strat. 6.3 Our program implements and evaluates highim pact educational practices to i ncrease persistence and compl etion (see 5.a for details). Strat.8.2 - Annually, our department expends approximately $10,000 on fa culty development activities including pedagogical training offered by CITL or at various conferences. Strat.8.4 - Students in our graduate programs practice a variety of intellectual and practical skills to address challenging proble ms. Strat.9.2 -A biannual meeting with the Department Advisory Council identifies key skills and competencies students need to achieve career success. Strat.9.5 - In response to emerging workforce demands and opportunities, members of the faculty com pleted a major program revisio n in 2013 resulting in a focused curriculum, streamlined performance standards, and 2 ne w certificates. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the KCEWS Statewide Skills Da ta on 201721 KY work force demand, the projected number of job openings for the following occupations which employ our graduates will incre ase significantly: ( 1) Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations at 23% (32,628 openings), (2) Healthcare Support Oc cupations at 27% (12,306 openings), (3) Office and Administrative Support at 15% (48,000 openings), and (4) Manage ment at 18% (10,804 openings). The highquality postsecondary Master's degree and certificates our program offe rs not only align with the wor kforce needs in KY, but will help prepare a skilled and employ able workforce t o meet the nee ds of those occupations and to help the state to meet its goal to raise Kentucky's educatio nal attainment level to 58% by the year 2025 from its current level of 45%. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Approximately 25 institutions na tionwide offer concentrations a nd master's degrees in Health Communication and several offer certificates, including Eas tern Carolina University, Univ ersity of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Utah and Univer sity of Southern California. Within the state, the University of Kentucky offers a certifica te in Health Communication with a focus on research in the behavioral sciences. Our graduate certificate p rogram is distinctive in that it takes an applied approach to communicating in healthcar e contexts and is offered onlin e. While we do not have first hand data about the reputation and impact of our certificate pr ogram, we do have data on our core program, which is reputed to have higher levels of publishing productivity than o ur competitors. In a 201 7 study published by the Journal of the Association for Communication Administration (Vol. 36(2), 2017), our program was ranked 54th out of 134 Master's degree programs listed on the website of the largest and oldest nation al association, the National Communication Association. The ranking was determined by the to tal citations of faculty resear ch available in Google Scholar. Am ong schools in Kentucky that have a Master's degree in communication, our program came well above Northern Kentucky (72nd) and Murray State (92nd). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) To help diversify course offerings, the department has hosted two Minority PostDoctoralFaculty Fellows in 201214 and 201517, a competitive uni versity fellowship (see Our Students - G.4: Strat.10 ). Also, we have supported over 56 student paper presentations at state, regional, national, and international conferences to encourage student research activities which promote student learning and expand the university outrea ch (see Our Hill Goal 4 ). 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) There are exciting developments within the region, such as the new UK Medical School at the Medical Center, the Center for Applied Science in Health and Ag ing, and other healthrelated p rograms here at WKU which call for furthe r interdisciplinary collaboration. The health communication certificate is ideal for graduate students employed in the health professions or studying for advanced health deg rees, such as nursing, nursing administration, health care administration, public health, and physical therapy. We see great potential for this certificate program, because it has highly skilled faculty that are dedicated to student success and strong research production and collaboration. Moreover, the program aligns with projected market needs in KY. Th e KCEWS anticipates rising work force needs in the healthcare sector in the next five years due to unprecedented demographic shift in the country . Moreover, the department merge d with Advertising and Public Relations in July 2017, bringing with it faculty who teach clas ses in sport, media and branding with concentration in Strategi c Sport Communications. Healthcare communication related to sport is a growing area. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The national trend for completion of certificate programs in he alth communication is not known. The closest category to our program, however, is the Master's degrees conferred in the fiel d of health professions and related programs. Over the last 5 years, this number increased by 30%. Compared to the 33 cred it hour master's degree program, our cer tificate program requires only 12 credit hours t o completion. This will be a mor e affordable and attractive option for those seeking graduate level credentials. Our first student en rollment was observed in Fall 2017, and we have seen this number more than double for 201819. Given the high demand for profe ssional training a nd credentials in healthcare service and providers, we anticipate this upwar d trend will continue in the future. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Over the last few years, faculty have been working hard to dive rsify the delivery of their cla sses so that this and another certificate program (#0471) can be taken completely online . As a result, enrollment in b oth certificate programs has increased significantly. In Fall 2019, our program will be addi ng a new fully online graduate certificate, Strategic Sport Communications, with an estimat ed annual enrollm ent of 15 stude nts. Our Master's degree and certificate programs align with occupations projected to grow in KY and beyond (see 5.a). In terms of implementing a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, we have taken part in Honors Conferences and in Graduate Fairs at regional and national conferences. We have also sent targeted email to graduating WKU seniors from th e Honors College as well as those in the Public Health, Nursing, and Physical Therapy programs. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We see great potential for this c ertificate program, because it aligns with projected market needs in KY. However, the graduate certificate in Healthcare Communication needs a tenure track hire to help grow and expand the still fledgling program. We had two fulltime, PHD holding, graduate faculty me mbers with expertise and experience in Healthcare Communication. Unfortunately, one retired completely and the ot her took a position at UTAustin. Currently, Dr. Stephanie Dopson, of the CDC, teaches our graduate healthcare courses onl ine. This allows us to limp along, but certainly does not offer the resources a fulltime, onsite faculty member brings to build relationships, work across disciplines, participate in grant opportunities, and rea lly, to grow the program. There are exciting developments within the region, such as the new UK Medical School at the Medi cal Center, the Center for Applied Science in Health and Ag ing, and other healthrelated p rograms here at WKU wh ich call for further interdisciplinary collaboration. The Communicating in Healthcare c ertificate is ideal for gradua te students employed in the health professions or studying for advanced health degrees, suc h as nursing, nursing administration, health care administration, public healt h, and physical therapy. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Certificate in Communicating in Organizations is a 12 credi t hourprogram focused on general organizational communication theory, applied organizational communication, com munication within specific o rganizational contexts, and one other course chosen by students as relevant to their own wo rk and interests. Our mission is to provide graduate students the opportunity to develop an indepth understanding of how com munication functions in organizations. The program prepares students for a variety of careers and pursuits in whic h advanced communication stu dy is helpful, especially management, human resources, public relations, marketing and ed ucation. A major program revisio n in Fall 2012 streamlined the curriculum and aligned it with program learning outcomes. T he old certificate (#175) and masters (#109) programs were phased out and we introduced the newly revamped Certificate (#0 471) and Masters (#0012) programs in Organizational Communication. All program cour ses are offered at night, onlin e, or on weekends to serve workingage adults in pursuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials while maintaining full time employment. Admission to our program requires a minimum undergraduate GPA of 2.7 5 and an academic writing sampl e. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Certificate in Communicating in Organizations (#0471) compl ements the Master of Arts in O rganizational Communication (#0012) and the Certificate in Communicating in Healthcare (#04 75) program, and contributes to other nonCommunication Master's and Doctoral Degree programs at WKU. It contributes to the university mission in that it provides opportunities for students to engage in a pplied research and lifelong learning op portunities leading to produ ctive careers and increased capacity to make a good life. While our certificate program is a subset of the Master of Arts in Organizational Communication program, it is not required for th e master's degree. Our certif icate student population represents a mix of workingage adults pursuing jobenhancin g credentials, working professionals, and students from nonCommunication graduate degree programs at WKU. Starting in 201718, our certificate program w itnessed a surge in the number of students from the Master's Degree in Organizationa l Leadership program. We have 1 3 students enrolled this year , 50% of whom are in the master's program in organization al leadership. We anticipate ou r enrollment trend will be sim ilar in the coming years. c.

Students are abl e to complete the certificate within two years; however, the conferral data presented may be indicative of the fact that man y students in the certificate an d pursuing the Master's degree in Leadership Studies are typically working adults and parttim e students. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data IR 201314 N % FirstYear Retention Rate 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 100 0 0 N/A b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The learning outcomes of our certificate program are as follows : (1) Explanation of Theories and Concepts, (2) Identification of Distinct Communication Practic es of Culturally Diverse Group s, (3) Ability to A pply Communication Concepts in Organizational Contexts, and (4) Writing Mastery. Within course s, these learning outcomes a re indirectly assessed through multiple tools such as exams, app lication papers, presentations , research proposals, and qua litative, quantitative, and rhetorically grounded primary res earch studies. These learning objectives are indirectly assessed within individual coursework through multiple too ls such as exams, application pa pers, presentations, research proposals, and qualitative, quantitative, and rhetorically grounded primary research studie s. Students, who pass each cou rse and maintain a 3.0 overall GPA, complete the certificate pr ogram. If a student fails a cou rse, however, they are required to repeat the course. If the deficiency persists, the graduate curriculum committee would di scuss how deficiencies need to be addressed, what curriculum changes are needed, an d then consult r elevant facult y to implement the changes. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We have not tracked the success of graduates of our certificate programto date, becausethey have generally been working professionals. In terms of profe ssional opportunity, the 2018 P ostsecondary Feedback Report on \"Student Employment outcomes (FFY 1116)\" prepared by KCEWS show that key opportuni ties are in education and business. This actually matches jobs our M.A. graduates secured one year after graduation, such as in teaching and in struction, education admissions/advising and administra tion, and marketing/PR/advert ising and HR. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In 2013, our department establish ed an Advisory Council compris ed of leaders in their respect ive professions. The council, which offers biannual feedback to our program, has been instru mental in helping the depart ment identify the skills and competencies our students need t o achieve career success. Our p rogram also has plans to conduct employee surveys of our MA graduates every three years starting in the summer of 2019 f or students graduating from 20172019 to systematically assess employer needs and/or sat isfaction. We plan to contact t hese students' employers directl y via email and request that the appropriate supervisor complete our online survey. We have started and maintain a list(via excel spreadsheet) of MA graduates' careers and employers that we intend to update yearl y so that contacting employers will be easily achieved for future surveys. e.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Our major external revenue strea m is through DELO monies genera ted by teaching online. Further, the department enjoys modest donor support. These combined resources are used to supp ort student travel to conferences and student research costs, such as small reward s for survey recipients. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Communication Studies and Corp orate and Organizational Comm unication faculty members wh o hold graduate status (7 tenure/track and 1 nontenure track as of AY 18) all teach in t he graduate program, so all are included in the calculations above. In AY 18, when the percen tage of faculty effort in all t he courses taught in the grad program are added up, the total comes to 1. Since the work of th e program is spread across 8 pe ople, it is highly cost effective. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program focuses on applied organizational communication and integrates communication theory, practice, and problem based research in dealing with r ealworld problems. This addres ses the WKU Mission, Experience, and S trategic Plan in several ways. Our program provid es research and lifelong learni ng opportunities to our graduate students and working professionals wanting to enhance their skills and abilities to be productive workers and engaged citizens, as well as to enric h the quality of life for those wi thin their reach. Our program h as effectively woven in highimpa ct practices throughout as it is writingintensive, encourages co llaborative learning, explores \"difficult differences,\" and en courages internships. During 20122015, our entire program w as revised and 8 courses put onl ine so that the certificate pr ogram can be taken all online. This was to not only match job market opportunities so that our course rotation schedule would maximize student progression and completion (see Our Hill - G.3: Strat.12 ), but also to be more accessible for workingage adults in the pursuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials on the other (see Our Community and Beyond - G.3: Strat.9 & 10 ). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program aligns with the stat ewide strategic agenda to incre ase the education and skill leve ls of employees to catalyze state economic development. Strat. 1.1 & 1.4 - We offer courses that increase cultural competence and recru it underrepresented students and faculty, including international students (see 5.e for details). Strat. 6.3 Our program implements and evaluates highim pact educational practices to i ncrease persistence and compl etion (see 5.a. for details). Strat.8.2 - Annually, our department expends approximately $10,000 on fa culty development activities including pedagogical training offered by CITL or at various conferences. Strat.8.4 - Students in our graduate programs practice a variety of intellectual and practical skills to address challenging proble ms. Strat.9.2 -A biannual meeting with the Department Advisory Council identifies key skills and competencies students need to achieve career success. Strat.9.5 - In response to emerging workforce demands and opportunities, members of the faculty com pleted a major program revisio n in 2013 resulting in a focused curriculum, streamlined performance standards, and 2 ne w certificates. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the KCEWS Statewide Skills Da ta on 201721 KY work force demand, the projected number of job openings for the following occupations which traditionally employ our gradua tes will increase significantly: (1) Office and Administrative Support at 15% (48,000 openings), (2) Education, Training, and Library at 18% (20,809 openings), (3) Management at 18% (10,804 openings), and (4) Business and Financial Operations at 16% (13,638 openings). The highquality postsecondary Master's degree and certificates our program offers not only al igns with the workforce needs in KY, but will help prepare the skilled and employable workforce t o meet the needs of those occ upations and to help the state to meet its goal to raise Kentucky's educational attainment level to 58% by the year 2025 from its current level of 45%. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Our graduate certificate program is distinctive in that it is o ffered online and emphasizes the role of theory and application in a range of specific organization al contexts. We do not have inf ormation about the reputation and impact of our certificate program in relation to other sim ilar programs in KY and/or the country. We do, however, have data on our core program, the Masters of Art in Communication p rogram. The Masters of Art in Communication program is one of three such programs in the state of KY. It is reputed to have higher levels of publish ing productivity than our competitors. In a 2017 study publishe d by the Journal of the Association for Communication Administration (Vol. 36(2), 2017), our program was ranked 54th out of 134 Master's degree programs list ed on the website of the large st and oldest national association, the National Communication Association. The ran king was determined by the to tal citations of faculty res earch available in Google Scholar. Among schools in Kentucky that have a Master's degree in communication, our progra m came well above Northern Kentucky (72nd) and Murray State (92nd). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) To help diversify course offerings, the department has hostedtw o Minority PostDoctoralFaculty Fellows in 201214 and 201517, a competitive uni versity fellowship (see Our Students - G.4: Strat.10 ). Also, we have suppo rted over 56 student paper presentations at state, regional, national, and internati onal conferences to encourage st udent research activities which promote student learning and exp and the university outreach (se e Our Hill Goal 4 ). 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The program has highly skilled fa culty that are d edicated to st udent success, as well as strong research production and collaboration. The department mer ged with Advert ising and Publi c Relations in July 2017, bring ing with it faculty who teach classes in sport, media and bra nding with concentration in Stra tegic Sport Communications. W e also successfully hired a digital communication professor . The range of s kills among our faculty will allow us to add a wider array of research applicationsbased courses to our program in the future and att ract students who are corporat e minded or digit ally savvy. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The national trend for completion of certificate programs in or ganizational communication is not known. The closest data we have, however, is the number of Master's degrees conferred in t he field of communication, journalism, and related programs. This number has remained the same over the last 5 yea rs. Compared to the 33 cred it hour master's degree program, our certificate program only requires 12 credit hours to completion. This will be a m ore affordable and attractive option for those seeking graduatelevel credentials. Not surpri singly, our program has started to grow in student enrollment since Fall 2017. We see a simila r enrollment number in 201819. We anticipate this growth trend in the future. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Over the last few years, faculty have been working hard to dive rsify the delivery of their cla sses so that this and another certificate program (#0475) can be taken completely online. As a result, enrollment in both certificate programs has increased significantly. In Fall 2019, our program will be addi ng a new fully online graduate certificate, Strategic Sport Communications, with an estimat ed annual enrollm ent of 15 stude nts. Our Master's degree and certificate programs align with occupations projected to grow in KY and beyond (see 5.a). In terms of implementing a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, we have taken part in Honors Conferences and in Graduate Fairs at regional and national conferences. We have also sent targeted email to graduating WKU seniors from th e Honors College and Marketing, Leadership and Human Resources programs. We plan to target HR professionals who admi nisters education (tuition reimbursement) programs at their respective organizations. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We see great potential for this c ertificate program, because it aligns with projected market needs in KY. Among the complementary program that this certificate program is part of, the graduate certificate in h ealthcare communication needs a tenuretrack hire to help grow and expand the still fledgling program. There are exciting dev elopments within the region, such as the new UK Medical School at the Medical Center, the Ce nter for Applied Science in Health and Aging, and other healthrelated programs here at WKU which call for further inte rdisciplinary collaboration. Th e health communication and organizational communication cer tificate is ideal for graduate students employed in the healt h professions or studying for advanced health degrees, such a s nursing, nursing administratio n, health care administration, public health, and physical therapy. The KCE WS anticipates rising work force needs in the he althcare sector in the next five years due to unprecedented demographic shift in the country. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Available Fall, 2018, this major was re designed completely in 201718 to meet 21stc. workforce demands, blending communication theory with handson learning. Delivered online a nd facetoface, the 36hour major in Communication Studies prepares students with s kills needed to be not only job , but also careerready upon graduation. Requiring a minor, certificate, or second major, it partners well with other major s. Courses integrate high impact practices such as collaboration, writing intensity, service learning, gl obal engagement, internships. Coursework includ es recommended emphases from National Association of Colleges and Educators in critical thinking, teamwork, leadersh ip, and digital technology. Through advising, students are encouraged to develop skill sets recommended by Burning Glass Technologies, such as s ales, data analysis and management, ma rketing, general business and s ocial media . In 201617, all courses in the communication area of the department were analyzed for alignment with the recommended l earning outcomes of the Nationa l Communication Association. Admission requirements include 1) completion of minimum 24 hour s of coursework, 2) minimum overall GPA of 2.3, and 3) completion of COMM 200 with a grade of \"C\" or better.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Communication Studies' courses co ntribute significantly to othe r programs, including Colonna de; eighteen majors, minors and certificates outside of the Department of Communication; an d the JUMP program. In Colonnade, Communication Studies is the home program of COMM 145 (the only course in FOC), which offers over 110 sections a year; 1516 sections of COMM 200 (one of three cours es in FW2); 810 sections of COMM 365 (KSC); and 89 sections of COMM 349 (KSY). Eighteen majors, minors, and cer tificates across every college include Communication Studies courses as electives. Of particular note, three programs, the Dental Hygiene and Health Services Leadersh ip and Management majors, and the Interdisciplinary Patient Naviga tor Certificate, include COMM 4 40: Health Communication . Further, COMM 463: Advanced Intercultural Communication, is included in ten major and minor programs , including, among others, International Business, AfricanAmerican St udies, Photojournalism, Journalism, and Inte rnational Affairs. COMM 463 contributes significantly to the support of diversity, equity, inclusion, and internationalism. Communication Studies contributes to the JUMP program . Currently, there are 11 JUMP students in the Organizational Communication MA program (3 are f ully in the graduate program a nd 8 are still undergraduates). Three of the 11 JUMP students come from Communication Studies. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The SCHP for the university (above) include all hours taken wit hin a department. In the Department of Communication, 4,415 SCHP is the accurate comparison number, not 1,382, which is the SCHP number for Communication Studies. Communication Studies is one of five major programs in the department. Alone, it produces 49% of the SCHP of entire departments across the university. The 'enrolled students' and 'conferrals' do indeed compare prog rams to programs. Communication Studies faculty mem bers have mentored four FUSE s tudents and chaired one Hono rs thesis in the past five years. Three undergraduate students have presented at nationa l and regional conferences. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Learning outcomes for Communication Studies focus on critical a nd theoretical thinking, as we ll as pragmatic skill building, leading communicators to connect w ith audiences through meaning ful messages. The program's s tudent learning outcomes include: 1. To develop competencies in analy zing communication situations 2. To construct and present messages appropriately adapted to spec ific contexts and audiences 3. To develop the communi cative skills essential to complementing careers in a variety of fields including, but not limited to business, law, politic s, health care, social work. r eligious ministries , and teaching. Assessment begins at the macrolevel where courses are systematically aligned with SLOs, ensuring presence in multiple core courses. At the microlevel , professors of each core cours e collaboratively construct a designated assessment assignment/rubric ases students' mastery of resp ective SLOs. They meet annually to evaluate students' work, discuss qualitative and quantitat ive assessment data, and make changes when needed. The biggest closing the loop str ategy completed within Communic ation Studies and every departmental major program except Popular Culture Studies, was to revise from th e ground up , trimming the number of hours to between 3036, reducing prerequisites for upper division courses, and increasing possi bilities for crossfertilization among all major programs throu gh enabling double majoring and embe dding electives from other pro grams within each program. W e realized Communication Studies students needed to lear n computer coding skills, take i nternships, learn how to communicate effectively on digital platforms, and understand how bu sinesses such as advertising an d public relations work, among other things. This revision was planned in AY 17, passed through curriculum approvals in AY 18, and has been implemented in AY 19. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Department of Communication works closely with a 22 member Advisory Council , consistently mainly of alumni from our major programs. The Council meets biannually and has guided de cisionmaking within programs through clarifying employer and industry workready expectations, particularly tho se relating to communication and technology. A key member of that C ouncil is Sam Fo rd, Director of Cultural Intelligence at Simon and Schuste r. A Communication Studies alumnus, Sam has advised the department over the past four year s on how best to align with f uture professional needs. Further, student workers harvest a lumni information on jobs thr ough LinkedIn and alumni selfreports to the department newsletter, grouping job categories, and locating estimates of salaries through Glass Door . We share that information with our capstone and internship students and use it to gain a bette r sense of the breadth of employment possible for Communication Studies students. T hese data are helpful because the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics because link does not have a category that matches Communicatio n Studies. Key areas of employment for Communication Studies graduates inc lude: executive directing (forprofit and nonprofit), human resources, management, marketing, politics, business, res earch, sales, social media management, and sport management. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Please see 3.c. above. Working with the Communication Advisory Council over the past seven years has led to a transformation of the e ntire department. Every program recognizes the crucial importance of students mastering both the tr aditional educational goals such as disciplinary knowledge , theoretical awareness, and s trong writing and speaking and also the 21 st c. skills of creating visual communication, understanding how softwares work, and cre ating messages geared to pa rticular audiences. Each program has 'bent' in the direction it had lacked, whether to l earning more about how communication operates or to communicating visually, as well as verbally. For Communication Studies students, the addition of courses suc h as Software Studio, Adver tising in a Digital World, Fundamentals of Public Relations, and Writing for Digital Platf orms, has opened up possib ilities that can lead to a second major, a certificate, and to jo bs that were not available to th em before. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) While Communication Studies students in the past have found suc cess in many areas of life, b ecause of our new curricula, instituted in AY 18, they will be positioned far better fo r the higher tec h jobs that com munication professionals of the future will hold. While coursework available within the Communication Studies maj or itself provides initial exposure to emerging technologies, the fact that the major requires only 36 hours means a student could take a second major such as marketing, advertising, or graphi c design, or could add a certi ficate in User Experience which digs deep into how audiences process images and med iated communication. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) DELO revenue has been a significant source of support for the D epartment of Communication and the Communication Studies program. Because of the n umber of DELO points earned th rough online teaching, dual credit, conferences, and the like, faculty members and students in all programs have benefit ed. In particular, because of DELO, the department routinely supports undergraduate enhanced experiences, such as studying a broad or competing in national competitions and routinely supports research productivity by sending program faculty membe rs and graduate and undergraduate students to multiple conferences every year. Overall, the Department of Communication has received modest ph ilanthropic support in the past, with the exception of the most recent gift establishing the Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Distinguished Lecture Series in Communication, an annual lecture series designed to add ress contemporary issues of commu nication in societ y. Students across the University will benefit from scholarly presentations educating audiences about the ways in which communication extends farbeyond simply public speaking. Dr. Kell also established the Dr. Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Internship Scholarship to support students completing summer internships, a particular benefi t to Corporate and Organization al Communication majors whose required internships are often unpaid by employers. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) [Note: Because of the overlap of courses required or elected in the Communication Studies and Corporate and Organizational Communication major programs and the Communication Studies Mino r Program, at the advice of Dr. McElroy, we combined the costs for these three programs into one number.] There is a very significant area of potential growth for Commun ication Studies in Hea lthcare Communication . Over the past two years, the department lost two excellent program professors in Health Communication. One retired and one took a position in an R1 university. Given the new medical school, the strong nursing program, the d octorate in physical therapy, and all the ancillary health related education at WKU, there is an excellent opportunity for PCAL to connect with STEM+H through h ealth communication. Further, within PCA L itself, there are healthrelated initiatives, such as in Sociology and Political Science's MPA program that could be buttressed by a Healthcare Communication profess or. Healthrelated research is eminently fundable through grants. WKU can afford a Healthcare Communication professor. The Depart ment of Communication runs very efficiently and leanly , with high SCHP, betterthanuniversitymedian retention, progre ssion, and graduate rat es, and low salaries. Hiring a health communication professor is a wise use of resources . 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Communication Studies directl y contributes to WKU's strateg ic plan. As mentioned in 2.b., Communicati on Studies has a solid stake i n Colonnade ( SP 3.8), in Foundations through COMM 145 and COMM 200; and through two courses in Connections, COMM 349 and 365, both of which are fully enrolled and are offered every semester. Communication Studies' outstanding advisor ( SP 3.8), Prof. Bruce Crawley, serves t hat program and also Corporate and Organizational Communication. He has won both PCAL and Universi ty advising awards. Communication Studies has an outstanding record related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (SP 4). Our introductory intercultural course, COMM 365, is a Connect ions course; our ad vanced intercultural course, COMM 463, is included in ten major or minor programs; and Communication Studies has hosted two Minority Postdoctoral Fellows . Communication Studies courses inc lude assignments and projects that enhance high impact practices (SP 3.10 and 11 ), including study abroad (15 in the past five summers), projectb ased and communitybased learning through's involvement with the $100 Solution, research with students ( SP 4.15) through FUSE grants and Honor's theses, and active recruitme nt into the JUMP program. Through our fall ExecutiveinResidence and our spring ScholarinResidence , Communication Studies serves and educates the community as well as our students ( SP 4.12). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Communication Studies has contributed to SSA 1.4through participating in the Min ority Postdoctoral Fellowship p rogram. Student advising (SSA 2.5) is handled by Pr of. Bruce Crawley, w ho has won both the PCAL and university advising awards. Communication Studies engages in high impact practices (SSA 6.3) recommended by the Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) initiative. Communication Studies contributes to LEAP's essential learning outcomes ( SSA 8.4) through offering coursework and experiences in knowledge of human culture (COMM 365, 463, and s tudy abroad courses); inte llectual and practical skills (every course touches on these skills, with emphases in courses such as 200, 300, a nd 349); personal and social responsibility (COMM 388) and intercultural knowledge and competence (COMM 365 and 463); and integrative and applied learning through upperdivision course projects. Career development (SSA 9.1) takes place throughout the maj or, culminating in Capstone, wh ere students research jobs, interview alumni, write resumes and cover letters, and practice interviewing. Communication Studies connects with STEM+H (SSA 9.6) through Health Communication courses. A Healthcare Communication/Campaigns hire would enable significant collabora tion within WKU. Communication Studies faculty support student research (SSA 10.4) through FUSE grants, coauthoring, mentoring honor's theses, and chairing or servin g on graduate t hesis committees. The department funds student r esearch. Last year, we spent $10,000 on student research. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Kentucky Future Skills Report areas that Communication Stud ies graduates might serve in clude, management, sales, business, and healthcar e support. Of the top five general occup ation jobs in the future, thre e are most appropriate for Communication Studies graduates: office and administrative, sales, and healthcare practitioners . Communication Studies specifically prepares graduates with the skills employers want (The 10 Top Skills That Will Land You HighPaying Jobs by 2020, Inc. December 29, 2107 ) such as creativity, people management, coordinating with othe rs, emotional intelligence, judgment and decisionmaking, serv ice orientation, negotiation skills, and cognitive flexi bility. Courses in group communication, intercultural communication, organizational comm unication, leadership, and pers uasion build just such skill sets. Further, since the jobs of the future are not yet in existence or even imagined yet , the top skills graduates can bring to the workforce of the future do not i nclude solely 'soft' skills or solely technical skills, but a smart blend of both (7 Job Skills of the Future (That AIs and Robots Can't Do Better than Humans), Forbe s, August 6, 2018 ). In addition to knowing how art ificial intelligence, communicati on technologies, and design soft wares work, the people who will succeed will know empathy and communication, critical thin king, strategy, imagination, and vision found in communication classes. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The key distinctive quality of Co mmunication Studies is its rel ation with other major programs in the newly enlarged Department of Communication, co mbined with our strong advising. No program requires more than 36 hours. Students can stack majors, add ce rtificates (such as User Exper ience or Political Communica tion), and blend in minors. Communication Studies aligns with best practices in the Communi cation discipline. All cour ses have been analyzed and aligned with the National Communi cation Association's guideline s on student learning. Each course requires between 1530 pages of writing; most courses require presentations and projec ts; and many courses include s pecific learning such as press release writing and persuasiv e campaign development. The Communication Studies faculty is documented as having higher levels of publishing pro ductivity than our competitors. In a 2017 study p ublished by the Journal of the Association for Communication Administration (Vol. 36(2), 2017), our program was ranked 54 th out of 134 Master's degree prog rams listed on the website of t he National Communication Association. Rankings were determined by the total citations of faculty rese arch available in Google Schola r. Among schools in Kentucky that have a Master's degree in communication, our program came well above Northern Kentucky (72nd) and Murray State (92nd). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Communication Studies is located within a set of five major pro grams in Communication that together allow for double majoring, stacking of credentia ls such as minors and certificat es, and expose students to key learning in the aspects of the communication discipline and indu stries that will not only get them their first job, but po sition them for a career. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Communication is suffering multi ple losses of tea ching personne l and areas. In health and interpersonal, we have lost two professors. In interpersonal and family, we have lost one. In p ublic communication, we had been relying on just one tenured professor and two retirees to te ach the key areas of persuasion , argument, and public speak ing. The two retirees will not teach for us after the spring of 2019. So, we need to enhance Communication Studies by hiring at least one interpersonal/health communication and one public communication professor. These two areas are key for interdisciplinary connections, grant getting, and workforce development. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Communication Studies related degree conferrals have remained relatively steady over the years from 2000-2016 (https://nces.ed.gov/program s/coe/indicator_cta.asp) , leading to the conclusion that communication education with a technological edge will continue to provide good preparation fo r WKU students. \"The fastest growing sector of degr ee conferrals is found in the hea lth professions . The number of degrees conferred in health professions and related p rograms increased by 61 percent between 2004-05 and 2009-1 0 and then by 67 percent between 2009-10 and 2014-15\" ( https://nces.ed.gov/fastfa cts/display.asp?id=37) . Given this fast and consistent u pward trend, it makes sense to return the capacity to teach healt h communication and to develo p research in it to the Depa rtment of Communication. If we do not make this hire, WKU will have lost a significant o pportunity for interdisciplinary study and collaborative resear ch. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three yearsto increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Significant changes have been a lluded to throughout this report . In 201617, Dean Snyder added Advertising, Public Relations, and Popular Culture Studies to Communication. In 201 718, all programs except POP (we did not yet have a faculty member to run it) were transform ed into slimmed down majors, wi th fewer prerequisites and mo re crossprogram electives. Communication Studies has been productive in the face of losses . Communication Studies has sustained significant faculty losses, not only in health communicati on, but also in interpersonal co mmunication, which in many ways is the bread and butter of Communication Studies as a discipline. Ellen Bonaguro and Laura Brown also taught interpersonal communication, as did one of the Minority Postdoctoral Fellows, Tammy Jeffries . Further, Blair Thompson w as just taken from the department to serve as the interim director of Teacher Educatio n, for this year and perhaps further into the future. He, too, taught interpersonal communication. These things need to be on record . In the face of these losses, t he department perseveres, but it could do more than persevere \u2014it could thrive if granted adequate fulltime, tenure track faculty members. The good chan ges we have made to programs are leading to growth in student numbers that will be seen in the spring and fall of 201 9, as the word gets out about how these programs suit students for success. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) If we do not receive the resourc es we need, we will be about ex actly where we are at this m oment, doing fine, but not growing as we can. The education and skill set fo und in the Department of Communi cation are just what the careers of the 21 st c. require : critical thinking, ada ptability, problemsolving, understanding of digital and communication technologies, and strong written, spoken, and visual communicati on skills. No matter what your ac tual job may be, these sk ills will help you succeed. With adequate resources, both faculty and physical, the Departm ent of Communication and the program of Communication Studies will be renewing constant ly, as technolog ies and means of communication morph. And s o, Communication Studies will be the department students s eek in order to be better doct ors, designers, lawyers, sal espersons, nurses, farmers, professors, teachers, and managers. 'Adequate resources' means a new hire in health and interperson al communication immediately, a hire in public communication and rhet oric, and enough space to increase capaci ty enough to allow growth. Current impediments include the hiring freeze and losing our talented people to higher pay and better opportunities. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) X Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: English College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Creative Writing, MFA Reference Number: 0478 STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 48 List Concentrations (if any): Secondary Concentrations: Composition and Rhetoric (ENCR), Literature (ENLI), Teaching English as a Se cond Language (ENTL) 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Our MFA in Creative Writing is a twocalendaryear, residential program requiring students to take coursework in both creative writing (mostly worksho ps) and a secondary area (semin ars in Composition, Literature, or TESL) and sit for an oral exam. The courses are ENG507, Intro to CW Studies ENG 510, Rhetoric & Writing ENG 512, Reading as a Writer ENG515, 2 Internsh ips (2hr and 1hr) 3 Graduate Writing Workshops 4 Courses in Seconda ry Concentration 2 Open Electives 1 Literature Elective ENG599 Thesis (6 hours) Students also tutor in our writing center, shadow a more experi enced instructor who serves as their mentor, and then teach classes on their own dur ing their second year. The program admits six students a year through a highly competi tive process in which an applic ation letter, writing sample, and academic transcripts are clo sely evaluated. In the four yea rs the program has existed, numbers of applications have increased every year to the point that they have now more than doubled. By admitting a select number of students in each cohort, we are able to work closely with them and provide the k ind of mentoring they need as they teach, write, and then prepare to move on to their lives after graduation.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/co llege/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such as co urses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (maximum 20 0 words) Firstyear MFA students tutor undergraduate students in the wri ting center. In 201718, MFAs tutored 4500 hours as part of the ir assistantships ($54,000 worth of labor\u2014$12/hour is the MA summe r tutoring rate). Firstyear MFA students have served as social media assistants for the program itself, publicizing the progra m and bringing in more applicants, and as editorial assistants for Steel Toe Books, the publishin g house founded at WKU. In the second year, MFA studen ts teach 88 students annually in four composition courses; in othe r words, 6 MFA GTAs instruct over 500 WKU undergraduates each year in exchange for a modest stipend and tuition remission. T his is an economic boon for WKU, and it's also important for undergraduate student retentio n that we have motivated, sm art, enthusiastic teachers interacting with WKU's f irstyear students. MFA students have also brought their experience to bear on the undergraduate side of the creative writing program since graduate students and undergraduates occasionally take courses together. In this way, there is not a rigid barrier between the two groups of students. The undergraduates benefit and are chal lenged by their interactions wit h the graduate students inside and outside of the cla ssroom. The graduate students gain experi ence by filling informal mento r roles to undergraduates. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Our graduate students have been extraordinarily productive both while they are in the program and after they graduate. Exit survey data we collected for the first two cohorts reveals that our MFA students have already published thirtytwo short stori es, sixtythree poems, twentysix essays, and two poetry chapbooks. One scriptwriting student had a short film produced. In addition, our graduates have been finalists for national book c ontests three times. W e have clearly done an excellent job of selecting talented, hardworking writers whose careers have jus t begun. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

[asse ssed through thesis defenses, co ursework, exit surveys, and alumni surveys] 5. Students will demonstrate that t hey have adequat e professional knowledge in one of three secondary career concentrations in Teaching Eng lish as a Second La nguage, Compos ition/Rhetoric, or Literature. [assessed through coursework and thesis defenses] 6. Students will demonstrate that t hey have the skills to build li terary communities via writing groups, book circles, public readings, blogs, and publishing projects such as small literary presses and both print and online journals. [assessed through the internship progr am and the exit interviews] 7. Students will demonstrate that t hey have the skills to be comfo rtable and competent public readers of their work. [assessed through coursewo rk and alumni surveys] We always intended for the MFA st udents to participate in inter nships that sent them out into the local community. It's possible that students weren't as familiar with t he region as t hey needed to be, but they weren't taking advantage of communitybased internships. We pushed the students to search f or these kinds of internships in Intro. to CW Studies, and this year one of our MFA students is taking on an internship at Hope Harbor here in town. We hope this will open the door for future students to do the same. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a ndincorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Since our students are earning a terminal degree, it is most na tural for them to enter the teac hing ranks or to go on to more graduate school by gaining adm ission to a PhD program. However our program was de signed to give our graduates a wide variety of options for employment after graduation, including b ut not limited to working in publishing or business. The required secondary concentrations in composition/rhetoric, lite rature, and TESL encourage p reparation for a number of careers. We use our exit interv iews and alumni surveys to trac k where our graduates end up, and it's fair to say that 100% of our graduates are employed in a variety of fields. Three of our graduates have gone one to more graduate studies at the PhD level. One is employed as a community college instructor in Tex as. One works for the book d istributor Ingram in Nashville. One has recently entered a sales training program in Missouri. These profiles of our first two g raduating classes highlight th e variety of work that our MFAs are doing: Class of 2017 and Class of 2018 . d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) One of the ways the program trac ks the needs of employers is th rough our internship program. MFA students are required to write a paper about their intern ship experience, and we ask the m to address the skills employers are looking for and how we are addressing those skills in our program. In this way we feel we will be better able to prepare students for the workforce. One recent example in which we received feedback from an intern ship employer involved a student who spent a summer as a publishing intern at Sarabande Books , one of the country's premier i ndependent literary publishers. The student informed us that her employers at Sarabande found her to be particularly prepared for her work there because she had previously worked as a graduate assistant at Steel Toe Books in our program. Her experience at Sarabande as well as their f eedback reassured us that the work we're requiring of our students is h elping prepare them for the needs and expectations of employers. It also let us know that the other work students are doing in the program\u2014tutoring, teaching, reading and responding to their peers' wor k\u2014contributes to the skills they will take with them into the workforce. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) In addition to the publication and employment success, one of o ur 2018 MFA graduates, Elizabeth Upshur , earned a Fulbright, becoming the first WKU student to earn a Fulbright t o Africa. And one of our 2017 graduates, Erin Slaughter, just published a short story in Prairie Schooner , one of the most prestigious literary journals in the world. B oth of these are amazing accomplishments fo r our young program. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 1 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH $275 $128 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 360 371 351 367 353 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 55.6% 54.2% 58.7% 60.0% 63.7% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 8 9 8 8 7 8 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level* 58.3% 63.6% 66.7% 81.3% 62.5% 58.2% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Over the past five years, the department has earned $225,655 th rough DELO (average of $45,131). We have supplemented professional development, update d classrooms, equipped computer labs, purchased projectors, funded student recruitment activities, and supported student travel. Over the past five y ears, we have generated over $28,500 through the WKU Foundation (average of $5700/year) to support faculty developme nt, student travel, awards, etc. In 2016, we replaced the CLEP Literature Exam with an E nglish 200 Departmental Exam. Wh ile the exam was created to provide a better measure of students' achievement of learni ng outcomes in E nglish 200, over three years, it has also generated over $8600 (average $2850/year) to s upport professional development in the departme nt. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The MFA in Creative Writing and MA in English are complementary programs, as these students work together in the Writing Center and take courses with each other. In summer 2018, our MFA and crea tive writing programs lost a fi ctionwriting specialist; we mus t replace her to maintain the programs' quality. *We disagree with data for medi an class size and underenrolled sections because combined graduate and undergraduate courses don't appear to have been considered and WKU had been o perating at a significantly lower graduate course cap before the new number was retroactively put into place. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Our MFA program supports a number of the goals, objectives, and strategies of WKU's strategic plan. On page four under \"Students,\" the strategic plan c alls for students to \"participa te in shared intellectual experi ences in and out of the classro om and will have access to highimpact practices such as internshi ps.\" Our rigorous internship pro gram allows students to have the types of shared intellectual experiences outside of the cla ssroom that can lead to future emp loyment. Goal 5, Strategy 12 of the strategic plan also calls for students to become \"good, productive citizens.\" A key co mponent of our MFA program, and one of the things that makes it unique, is its emphasis on literary citizenship, the notion that we're not just turning ou t writers but active members of the community. Our intensive thes is process and small program allow students to \"cultivate individual research projects,\" wh ich supports the strategic pla n's stated goal on p age eight under the section called \"Our Hill.\" And the teaching , tutoring, and inte rnships allow our st udents to \"improve the quality of life regionally [and] support regional economic dive rsification\" as stated in goal four of th e strategic plan on page 13 under the section called \"Our Community and Beyond.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The unique structure o f our MFA program a nd its emphasis on car eer preparedness alongside ar tistic development supports and fulfills the statewide agenda of making career development an institutional and statewide p riority. Our program, through its coursework about the professio n and through its internship program, provides students wit h \"clearly articulated career pathways, \" which meets the stat ewide plan's objective 9.1. Bec ause we solicit feedback from the students about their internships we \"work with the em ployer community\" to understand ways we can better prepare our students for their lives after WKU in support of statewide objective 9.3. Our MFA studen ts, who are a rather diverse group, also support the statewide Objective 1 of improvi ng the diversity and inclusiven ess of Kentucky's campuses. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) One of the distinctive features o f our MFA program is that stud ents take a careerfocused sec ondary emphasis in one of our English department's ot her concentrations such as Literature, R hetoric/Composition, and Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL). This approach better prepares them for life af ter graduate school than traditional \"studiostyle\" MFA programs. Furthermore, students complete internships to gain ha ndson professional training in editing and teaching that will open avenues for later employment . Our students' success in gai ning employment is a sign of the effectiveness of our approach. The Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) regularly compiles reports on the number of academic and non academic jobs available to MFAs every year. According to the da ta available from AWP's latest survey conducted in 201516, 890 academic jobs were available, and a record high of 1306 non academic jobs were available. As of November 2018, The Kentucky Future Skills Report ant icipates that 145 writer/autho r jobs are/will be available in K entucky from 2 0172021. Of course, students would also be positioned to take college instr uctor, technical writing, and TESL jobs, depending on the secondary concentration they choose. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The design of WKU's MFA program is unique in several ways. The extensive coursework in the secondary area and internships uniquely prepare our students for the workforce or further grad uate study. Our program is also unique among MFA programs housed in English departments in that we offer students the opt ion of concentrating and wri ting a thesis in one of four different areas\u2014fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, and scri ptwriting. Given students' inc reasing interest in film and television writing, our inclusion of scriptwriting component is one of our most unique features for attracting students and makes our program one of the mos t distinctive in the nation. Th e increasing number of applications and student satisfaction shows that the program is off to a great start. Because we recruit and admit students from all over the country , we have contributed to the diversity of the student population. In just a few years , we've had students from Russia , California, Utah, Texas as we ll as Wisconsin, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. One quarter of our first two cohorts came from un derrepresented minority groups, and we have also been able to hire a more diverse faculty since the creation of the MFA pr ogram (Shane Book, Jessic a Folk, Cheryl Hopson.) e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) We have a successful MFA program and maintaining it would conti nue to produce excellent results. However, an opportunity exists to enhance the program. The national trend is toward MFA programs lasting three years in stead of two, and if we kept credit hours basically the same, eliminated the summer componen t, and expanded to three years, we would reap additional benefits. To make this work finan cially, we would decrease the annual number of students we admit from six to five -we would then have fifteen total students in the program at one ti me instead of the current twelve. Consequently, we would have ten students teaching every year instead of six, which wou ld give GTAs more teaching experience and additional mentoring from faculty. The additional year would also give stu dents more time to work on their theses and more time to prepare for what they want to do when they finish the program. The revisions would benefit the department by allowing us to cover more sections of genera l education classes instead of relying on adjunct help. Fin ally, it might allow the MFA students to teach some different general education courses or e ven Introduction to Creative Wri ting (ENG 203), all of which would make them more marketable and employable. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) There are no national data available (that we could find) on th e conferral of MFA degrees in creative writing. We have deliberately limited the number of students admitted and have h ad a steady increase in compet itive applications since the program's inceptions (see 1a). If anything, our program has been a little ahead of the curve i n some regards. When we created the program, we placed creative writing pedagogy and lit erary citizenship at the heart of the curriculum. Over the past five to ten years, creative writing pedagogy has been emerging as a key area of study withi n the larger field of creative writing. Very few MFA programs in the country place this kind o f emphasis on pedagogy, but mor e and more will do so in the f uture. In that way, we have staked out a unique place for o ur program that is lining up wit h national trends. Our intern ship component also addresses the national trend of trying to ensure that students can gradua te from an MFA program and be able to do more than simply write. The high employment numbe rs for our graduates show how s uccessful we've been at doing that. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Using student feedback and our o wn assessment, we have made sma ll adjustments to the progr am. We have continued to focus our attention on recruiting and admi tting better and more accomplished students. To that end we have advertised in national writing publications like Poets and Writers and The Writer's Chronicle . Every year, one graduate student serves as the assistant to the program dir ector and their main job is pub licizing the program. We contin ually utilize social media to recruit, publicize, and share student successes. We have also c reated a mailing list of a larg e number of undergraduate English departments, a nd we reach out to th em with a creatively designed email to share with their students. We have also found that our current students and alums are one of the best s ources for spreading the word about our program, and we frequently receive applications from students who have heard ab out our program from a current or past student. Publicizing the program is an ongoing job. In 2018, we instituted a twoyear course rotation to help stude nts plan for course offerings (semesters, days, and times). The department contacted affiliated programs to address scheduling conflicts that had occurred in the past to prevent future conflicts. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would itreasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We believe that the best course of action is to convert our pro gram from a 2year to a 3year program as described above\u2014 the costs would be minimal and th e positive impact on students would be significant. We would hope to see more applications submitted from an increasingly diverse pool of app licants. If we opt to grow the pr ogram by adding an additional year, we would be bringing the program in line with the nationa l trend for MFA programs, giving our students even greater opportunities to prepare for the job market, and providing addi tional teaching support for WKU. When one considers the value of course coverage that we would get with a threeyear pr ogram, we would experience more than enough savings from the parttime budget to make up the difference in outlay for st ipends and tuition remission. W e would also increase our terminal degree production by 25%. Whether we make this change to the program or not, we hope to c ontinue to recruit and retain excellent graduate students who will continue to contribute i n a big way to the life of the university and the community. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The new, 36hour Corporate and Organizational Communication pro gram (effective Fall 2018) prepares students to understand and apply communication theories/concepts that expla in human interaction in the workplace and guide the formulation of messages for the organization and its constituen cies in a wide range of situations. Students build competence in critically analyzing communication within organiz ations, develop skill in asse ssing internal and external communication need, and become proficient in developing strateg ic communication plans f or diverse audiences. Students engage in a solid core of organizational communication courses and are exposed to complementary courses focusing on message strategy, hum an relations, critical thinkin g, and proficient writ ing. Elective course s are carefully chose n with an adviser to ensure the student receives the necessary ba ckground to succeed in an organizational setting. The program requires a second major and partners well with Mark eting, Sales, Business, Publ ic Relations, Nonprofit Administration, and Tourism, giving students more opportunity a nd flexibility to create their ow n career options. Courses are delivered in multiple formats: 71 % of required courses and 76% of elective courses are offe red both facetoface and periodically online. Admission requirements include 1) completion of minimum 24 hour s of coursework, 2) minimum overall GPA of 2.3, and 3) completion of COMM 200 with a grade of \"C\" or better. 2.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 Corporate and Organizational Communication coursesmake signific ant contributionsto other undergraduate and graduate programs across all five colleges of the University. Undergraduate Level: 1. Two core/required courses (COMM 200 and COMM 349) are in Col onnade. 2. Core courses are included in 15 other majors (12 outside the Department of Communication), 5 minors (4 outside the Department of Communication), 2 certificates (1 outside the Department of Communication), and 1 Associate degree . 3. Elective courses are included in 14 other majors (12 outside the Department of Communication), 4 minors (3 outside the Department of Communication), 1 certificate (outside the Department of Communication), and 1 Associate degree . Graduate Level: 4. The program is also intricate ly tied to the JUMP program lea ding to a Master of Arts in Organizational Communication. Of the 12 students who have entered the JUMP program, 9 of those are Corporate and Org anizational Communication major s. 5. In addition to JUMP students, 5 Corporate and Organizational C ommunication graduates are curr ently enrolled in the Organizational Communication graduate program. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Despite lower than median progra m enrollment, conferrals for th e Corporate and Organization al Communication program have remained steady at or above the University median. Our stu dents are earning their degrees. In addition, as evidenced above, our courses are not only in demand for Colonnade credit but also well integrated into multiple other majors, minors, and certificates across campus. We believe the curriculum revision made in 2017 /2018, effective Fall 2018, will bolster enrollment once students become aware of the flexibility and ease with which they can tailor th eir own studies in partnership with other programs. 3.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student Learning Outcomes were thoughtfully constructed torefle ctthe curricular goal s outlined by the National Communication Association , the leading body of scholars and professionals in the communi cation discipline. PROGRAM GOALS CORE COURSE ALIGNMENT Communication majors will understand Goal 1: The communication process and human relational interaction in increasingly complex and diverse environments. COMM 200, 346, 349, 362, 489 Goal 2: Multiple theoretical and philosophical perspectives of communication as reflected in its history. COMM 200, 300, 362, 462, 489 Goal 3: The role of ethics in communication. COMM 200, 300, 346, 362, 462 Communication majors will demonstrate competency in Goal 4: Analyzing situations and constructing and delivering messages. COMM 300, 346, 362, 462, 489 Goal 5: Conducting reflective analysis of discourse and construction o f arguments intended to influence beliefs, attitudes, values, and practices. COMM 346, 362, 462 Goal 6: Analyzing and interpreting mediated communication (i.e., CMC, organizations, mass media, politics etc.). COMM 200, 300, 362, 462 Goal 7: Analyzing the role of communication within organizations. COMM 200, 362, 462, 489 Goal 8: Systematically asking questions, attempting to answer them, and understanding the limitations of the findings. COMM 300, 349, 489 Goal 9: Adapting communication across contexts and diverse communities. COMM 200, 349, 362, 462, 489 Assessment begins at the macrolevel where courses are systematically aligned with SLOs, ensuring presence in multiple core courses. At the microlevel , professors of each core cours e collaboratively construct a designated assessment assignment/rubric ases students' mastery of resp ective SLOs. They meet annually to evaluate students' work, discuss qualitative and quantitat ive assessment data, and make changes when needed. For example, in May 2015, COMM 362 professors noticed a steady decline in students' ability to apply course concepts to analyze the role of communication in organizations (Goal 7). Co nsequently, they revised the major assignment to include clearer directions, more examples, and a guiding matrix. In May 2016, they reexamined the data to find that student performance had improved. They consistently \"close the loop\" by using datadriven results to make changes to improve student learning. Assessment reports for each core course are s ubmitted annually to the Department Head. The outcome based approach and strong course alignment ensure assessment da ta impact the program, all the way down to specific learning activities. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Feedback on the success of gradua tes is obtained through period ic alumni surveys conducted by the Department of Communication, WKU alumni reports , and continual monitoring of graduates' professional social media accounts, such as Linked In. Based upon the titles of communication alumni found in the WKU alumni databas e, key areas of professional op portunity include the following: Business (sales, customer service , account managers, corporate marketing, strategy, employee benefits) Education (teacher, counselor, advisor, researcher, administrat or, admissions, college recru iter, college placement) Technology (trainer, systems analyst, technical copywriter, inf ormation systems) Social and Human Services (human resources, public relations, p ublic administration, phila nthropy, recreation) Government/Politics (public infor mation officer, speech writer, legislative assistant, lobbyist, research specialist) Health (health educator, hospital administration, health commun ication analyst, activitie s director, fundraiser) International Relations (transla tor, tour coordinator, diplomat , foreign relations officer) Law (public defender, corporate lawyer, legal researcher, media tion, paralegal, cit y/county attorney) Our majors often work in four of the top eight employment sectors identified by the 2018 Postsecondary Feedback Report , including healthcare, education, public administration, and adm inistrative. Furthermore, according to The Economic Value of College Majors 2016 report released by Georget own University's Center on Educ ation and the Workforce, \"college graduates with a bachelor's degree in Communication can expect to earn a median average of $54,000.\" d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) First, our majors must complete a 200hour internship including two supervisor evaluations. Those evaluationsinvite employers' feedback on students' performance, as we ll as curriculum and desirable skills/abilities of prosp ective employees. Second, we seek feedback regarding employment trendsfrom our Communication Advisory Council , consisting of area alumni in a variety of industrie s. The faculty regularly review s the suggested list of critical c ompetencies in relation to sp ecific coursework and update courses as needed. For example, the Advisory Council noted an increasing need for students to write video scripts and integrate video into emails. Professors agreed to add content to the A dvanced Organi zational Communication course to ensure students receive the training they need for 21 st century jobs. Consequ ently, in the progra m curriculum revision , courses such as Communication in the Digital Age and Writing for Digital Texts & Media were added to address employers' growing need for technologically com petent employees. Finally, we routinely consult national data concerning employer needs. Our students graduate with communic ation and related skills often cited among the top five most desired empl oyee attributes: 1. communication, problemsolving - The Chronicle of Higher Education 2. problemsolving, teamwork, written communication, leadership - National Association of Colleges and Employers 3. communication, teamwork , leadership - www.mba.com 4. teamwork, decisionmaking, co mmunication - www.forbes.com 5. communication, teamwork, th inking skills - www.careers.govt. nz e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Our retention, progression, and gr aduation rates are consistent ly above University medians, w hile our time to degree is routinely shorter. Typically, students do not enter our program as freshmen, but rather find our program later as they become exposed to communication courses, particularly through C OMM 145, COMM 200, COMM 263, and COMM 349 in the Colonnade. In addition to aligning courses with SLOs, our core courses also integrate a variety of highimpact educational practices cited by the Associat ion of American Colleges & Universities. According to the AAC&U, thes e are the practices that \"educational research suggests i ncrease rates of student retent ion and student engagement.\" 1. Writingintensive courses - COMM 200 (one of only three Writ ing in the Disciplines c ourses in Colonnade) 2. Collaborative Assignments and Projects - COMM 349 3. Undergraduate Research - COMM 300 4. Service Learning, CommunityBased Learning - COMM 349 5. Internships - COMM 489 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Corporate and Organizational Communication programprimarily contributes to the Department of Communication's revenue streams through DELO funds . DELO points are accumulated through online teaching. Currentl y, two of the core courses (COMM 362 and COMM 349) are offered online nearly every semester. Additionally, two other core courses (COMM 200 and COMM 462) and five elect periodically online. DELO revenue benefits facult y and students across the Department of Communication, largely funding conference travel which not only enhances student learning expe riences, but also provides important opportunities for faculty to develop a s teacherscholars. Overall, the Department of Communication has received modest ph ilanthropic support in the past, with the exception of the most recent gift establishing the Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Distinguished Lecture Series in Communication, an annual lecture series designed to add ress contemporary issues of commu nication in societ y. Students across the University will benefit from scholarly presentations educating audiences about the ways in which communication extends farbeyond simply public speaking. Dr. Kell also established the Dr. Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Internship Scholarship to support students completing summer internships, a particular benefi t to Corporate and Organization al Communication majors whos e required internships are often unpaid by employers. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) [Note: Because of the overlap of courses required or elected in the Communication Studies and Corporate and Organizational Communication major programs and the Communication Studies Mino r Program, at the advice of Dr. McElroy, we combined the costs for these three programs into one number.] As evidenced by the data above, the Corporate and Organizationa l Communication program is run quite efficiently, offering quality courses at above Unive rsity median class sizes and generating more SCH at nearly half the University median cost . However, fulltime faculty are only teaching approximately two thirds of our courses, and our nontenured faculty is double that of the University median. Co mparatively, based on cost and production, our fulltime faculty is a good investment. The data above reference total faculty across the Department of Com munication. Those teaching in the Corporate and Organizational Communication program also teach courses in the Communication Studies program. Therefore, the Department of Communication and our students would be better se rved by adding a fulltime, tenuretrack faculty member who could bring expertise to gr owing areas of employment, in particular, healthcare , to both communication programs. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Corporate and Organizational Communication program supports WKU's Strategic Planin the following ways: 1. Facilitate student advising thro ugh a dedicated program advi sor who meets with every major student prior to registration and has won advising awards at college and university levels to ensure student completion (Students/3.8), 2. Prepare students for career and life though a focused curric ulum that undergoes annual asse ssment (see 3.B.), integrates highimpact practices (see 3.E.), and allows students to tailor their academic and career interests (Students/5.12 and 13), 3. Support the Colonna de Program with two core courses (Hill/3. 9), 4. Provide uptodate classroom technology and faculty training , as well as createtwonew co urses to address technology skills and trends (COMM 4 51 and COMM 212) (Hill/3), 5. Conduct annual reviews of faculty teaching and research, off er travel funding for pedagogy training and research presentations, monitor instructi onal practices and scholarly ac tivity in T&P review s (Hill/3.10, 4.15), 6. Integrate highimpact practices in numerous courses (see 3.E .), including collaborative learn ing, particularl y in COMM 349 where students participate in a semesterlong problemsolving g roup project ( Hill/3.11), 7. Meet demand and maximize stude nt progression/completion by m onitoring and revising (Hill/4.12) ng 83% of the progra m online (Community/3 .8), 8. Engage the community though service learning projects (Commu nity/1.1) and alumni as guest speakers and internship supervisors (Community/6.17and 18) 9. Align courses with business and industry feedback and needs (see 3.D.) (Community/1.2), 10. Integrate critical thinking, problem solving, and effective interpersonal, group, and organ izational interactions througho ut curriculum (Community/1.4) b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Based upon the Statewide Strategic Agenda (SSA) , we address the following: 1. Focus on student ad vising through a dedicated, awardwinning program advisor who has 10+ years of experience (SSA 6.1), 2. Reduce time to degree by reducing required hours, removing u nnecessary prerequisites, and streamlining course sequencing (SSA 6.2), 3. Integrate highimpact educational practices as recommended b y the LEAP initiative (see 3.E.) (SSA 6.3), 4. Conduct regular program/cours e assessment and \"close the loo p\" by revising instruction, a ssignments, and /or curriculum as needed (see 3.B.) (SSA 8.1), 5. Support faculty travel to and participation in pedagogical t raining (SSA 8.2), 6. Contribute to LEAP's essentia l learning outcomes through cou rsework emphasizing intellectual and practical skills (inquiry and analysis, critical and creative thinkin g, written and oral communication, quantitative literacy, information literacy, teamwork and problem solving) in all of the core courses (COMM 200, 300, 346, 349, 362, 462, and 489) and integrative and applied learning in all upperdi vision courses and particularly the internship (SAA 8.4), 7. Survey communication alumni (Advisory Council) and Kentucky employers (internship superv isors) to assess the career readiness of current students, to identify needed skills for th e future, and to develop and eva luate the program (see 3.D.) (SSA 9.2 and 9.4), 8. Develop careers throughout the curriculum, particularly work ing with employers to provide internships (SSA 9.1 and 9.3), 9. Increase opportunities for undergraduate research through th e required research method s course (COMM 300), FUSE grants, and Honors projects/theses (SSA 10.4). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Corporate and Organizational Communication graduates work in a variety of occupations (see 3.C.), including sales, healthcare, management, and business which are among Kentucky's top 10 largest projected employment occupation al categories , according to the Kentucky Occupational Outlook to 2026 report (p. 2). Furthermore, our graduates are prepared for positions as general and oper ations managers, business oper ations specialists, and other managers, which are three of the occupations with the most openings given a Bachelor's degree (p. 11). Nationally, according to The Labor Market for R ecent College Graduates report, based on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and released in January 2018, the unemployment rate for Communication majors is only 3.9%, the lowest among all humanities and so cial science disciplines. In addition to these statistics, the demand for communication a nd organizational skills in emp loyees across industries continues to increase. As outl ined in section 3.D. above, national data from multiple agencies consistently show that employers are looking for communication, problemsolving, leade rship, critical thinking, and teamwork . These skills are generally embedded throughout the Corporate and Organizational Communication curriculum and particularly in courses such as persuasion (C OMM 346), small grou p communication (COMM 349), organizational commu nication communication (COMM 364), a nd leadership (COMM 330). The combination of desired 'sof t' skills and our increased focus on technical training in digital contexts prepares our gr aduates as successful contribut ors and decision makers in any number of occupations, organizations, and industries. Both stat e and national data suggest th at the employment outlook for communication graduates is positive. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The new Corporate and Organizati onal Communication program is d istinctive in its unique balance of theory and skill . Theoretical concepts forge a fou ndation of knowledge that is th en applied to and tested in realworld organizational contexts. The program proactiv ely responds to the skills needed by today's employers but a lso demonstrates forward thinking to address organization al trends toward increasing mul tinationalism and digital media. The Corporate and Organizational Communication program enjoys a strong reputation in the discipline , in large part to the faculty who are distinctive in b oth training and research. Core courses are primarily taught by faculty who earned Doctorates from Research 1 and Research 2 i nstitutions, including Arizona State University, Kent State, Pur due University, University of Kentucky, University of Kansas, a nd Wayne State. Faculty member s are also active researchers. A ccording to a recent article in the Journal of the Association for Communication Administration , when comparing Master's only institutions across Kentucky, we are second only to the University of Louisville in terms of total research cit ations (Allen et al., 2017). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Corporate and Organizational Communication program aligns w ith multiple objectives and strategies of both WKU's Strategic Plan and the Statewide Strategic Agenda. It addresses current workforce trends across the state and nation, and it has earned a strong reputation i n the communication discipline. It is uniquely designed to offer students' a solid foundation of skills most desired by employ ers, as well as unlimited oppor tunities to carve out their ow n career interests by adding another major, minor, and/or certificate. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) We have already begun to move th e Corporate and Organizational Communicationprogram forwar d by strategically revising the curriculum to streamline th e focus and reducing the require d hours. The program complements numerous other programs, enabling students to ta ilor their coursework toward t heir specific academic and p rofessional goals. After much discussion, we identified our cor e competencies based on facult y expertise and resources and th en packaged our offerings in a way that is both appealing and accessible to students. While many program improvements have been made, a review of emp loyment trends suggests a deficiency in our preparation of students to compe titively navigate careers in he alth organizational contexts . While we have some alumni working in healthcare, we see healthcare educ ation as a market for new students (both current and future healthcare professionals) who want to bolster their STEM+H training. A trained health communication professor would enhance the Corp orate and Organizational Communication program with courses in health campaigns, as well as add to the Communicatio n Studies program with interpersonal health courses and reignite graduate efforts toward p roviding a certificate in Com munication in Healthcare. A dedicated health communication line would provide the resources needed to make interdisciplina ry connections in areas, particularly the sciences, where we are currently lacking. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) According to the Nat ional Center for Edu cation Statistics, health professions and related programs conferred the second largest number of undergraduate degrees 20152016, second only to business . Communication and related programs conferred the eighth largest number of undergraduate degrees fo r that same time period. Both healthcare and communication have enjoyed a stea dy increase in student interes t since 2000, undoubtedly i n response to employment trends in the same areas. Our current program aligns well with national trends in both degree conferrals and workforce opportunity, particularly in the area of business. However, the Corporate and Organization al Communication program would be enhanced by additional resources to address the growin g trend in healthcare ed ucation and careers. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three yearsto increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) We spent 20172018 completely overhauling the Corporate and Org anizational Communication c urriculum. The previous program consisted of 54 hours, including 18 hours in other depa rtments. The new 36hour curriculum, effective Fall 2018, is more streamlined and focused on student outcomes, including a s olid set of core/required courses representing primary sub areas of the communication discip line. Elective courses were ca refully chosen to ensure students receive the necessary training to be successful in contemporary and future organizati ons. We also made efforts to address the following: 1. Revise course sequencing to ensure students receive a strong , core foundation earlier in the program and then have opportunity to choose advanced courses as electives in the area s most appealing to them; 2. Remove unnecessary pre/core quisites that might slow a stud ent's progress towards degree; 3. Continue to align courses with the SLOs guided by our nation al organization; 4. Add/create courses to address the increa sing need for studen ts' understanding and creation of digital texts 5. Align program requirements with current faculty expertise; 6. Create new recruitment materi als showcasing the program; and 7. Allocate faculty resources to meet expected course demand. The new revised curriculum pairs well with multiple other major s, allowing students to construct a combination of program areas that best fits their acade mic and professional goals. The new Corporate and Organizatio nal Communication program is focused on preparing students for organizational employment and leadership, yet flexible to enable students to pursue their own specific conte xts of interest. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) With the new 36hour curriculum, the Corporate and Organization al Communicationispoised to grow in the next 5 to 10 years as students learn of the e ase with which they can constru ct their academic studies to bes t fit their career aspirations. The curriculum does an excellent job of providing students with the kinds of skills desired by 21st century employers, namely, oral and written communication, cr itical thinking, problem solv ing, leadership, and teamwork. We tell our students that we are developing their \"tool box \"\u2014a plethora of skills that every graduate will need despite his/ her occupation or industry. When combined with another area of interest, albeit it accounti ng, law, medicine, educ ation, or any number of other fields, it is their communication and relat ed skills that will give them t he competitive advantage. The amount of growth , modest or exponent ial, will depend upon t he resources available. An added healthcare/campaigns line would allow us to attract student s who are increasingly interes ted in health related organizations and thus better respond to market trends and fut ure community and statewide nee ds. Impediments currently include the hiring freeze, as well as limited and outdated physi cal spaces where we can integ rate the kinds of technolo gybased training that we recognize as an important piece of our curriculum. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective adm ission. (maximum 200 words) The MA in Criminology is a fully online program currently (2019) ranked #16 by the U.S. News and World Report for \"Best Online Graduate CJ Programs.\" No accompanying program or certificate is required. The program introduces students to contemporary research, theories, and policies in the field of crime and crime control. It caters to a diverse array of students many of whom are current criminal justice professionals seeking education for professional growth. As such, the program provides knowledge-transfer an d professionalization impact on the region's criminal justice system and beyond. The program requires the completion of 30 credit hours of graduate work, i.e. 10 classes all of which are o ffered by the Department of Sociology, although a joint agreement with Eastern Kentucky Universi ty allows for some EKU graduate courses to count toward the WKU CRIM MA. Up to 12 credit hours may be completed outside the Department of Sociology. An oral examination as part of an applied research project is required for the degree but a thesis is not. Admission is selective, requiring a GAP score above 600, where the GAP is calculated as (undergraduate GPA x100) + (GRE total score), with a GRE Analytical Writing score of 3.5 or higher. 2.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/ college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The program contributes to the departmental an d university mission by professionalizing the region's criminal justice and by expanding st udents' understanding of social causes and consequences of human behavior in groups an d organizations using appropriate methodologies and analytical frameworks. Master of Arts in Cr iminology is not currently supporting any other program and is not involved in JUMP program . However, there is some ongoing discussion with the Political Science Department about the possibility of a joint master's degree or certificate in Criminal Justice Administration. These discussions are in the beginning stages, but would represent an area where regional dema nd for such a degree/certificate could be significant. The interaction between undergrad uate and graduate programs does happen but primarily in indirect ways - since the same professors teach in both programs, knowledge transfer about research and practice of Crimin ology goes in both ways, including fostering potential future allies and job contacts for Criminology undergraduates. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 201415 201516 201617 201718 17/18 Univ.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The general goals which guide the delivery of the program: Provide online courses that incorporate hi gh impact practices and adhere to ADA guidelines on online course delivery. Provide relevant courses that enhance knowledge of criminological phenomena from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Provide courses that improve writing and anal ytic skills that translate to careers in policing, the court system, probation and parole, law, organizational leadership, corrections, juvenile justice, and other private and public sector career fields related to human services. Abridged SLOs for core courses: Learn the intellectual history of major criminological theories Understand the key claims, concepts , and criticisms of each theory Gain knowledge of research findings' (i n)consistency with theoretical claims Learn to apply concepts, i.e. develop policy implications Learn about the history of punishme nt in pre-modern societies. Understand the social and theoretic chan ges which led to emergence of modern corrections. Understand contemporary theories of corre ctions and debates about their goals and validity. Explore major correctional issues and controversies in contemporary U.S. Learn statistical techniques that will enable you to read, understand, and critically evaluate research that uses these statistical methods. Identify which statistical techniques to us e for different levels of measurements. Learn how to compute and interpret various statistical techniques. Learn how to analyze and interpret da ta using Stata statistical software. Describe the research process and understand the components of research design. Compare and contrast different techniques of each stage of the research process (i.e., sampling techniques, research designs, primary or secondary data usage). Locate valid sources of research and document them properly. To date, these SLOs have not been comprehensively assessed. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Many, but not all, of our Criminology MA students are practitioners seeking career advancement through graduate education. Many of our students are interested in efficiently gaining skills that will create opportunities for job growth and advancement. In one recent effort to contact alumni, we created career profiles for graduates who work in local police and service agencies. The initial efforts at collecting alumni profile information revealed 18 graduates work for the Bowling Green Police Department. The Cr iminology MA degree supports career entry and career advancement in law enforcement, pr obation and parole, corrections, social work, public services, non-profit organization, juve nile system, and other human service oriented careers. According to the Bureau of Labor Stat istics there are 37,370 jobs in protective service occupations in Kentucky, which have median annual income of $35,000. Specific careers in criminal justice have strong median salaries and have experienced consistent job growth. BLS estimates salary and job growth for police an d detectives (Md = $62,960; 7% growth), probation and correctional treatment specialists (Md = $51,410; 6% growth), and Social and Human Service Assistants (Md = $33,120; 16% growth). We are cont inuing our alumni outreach by developing our website and highlighting the successes of our graduates. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The department consults research on high impact practices related to the delivery of online education for the purpose of preparing students for professional careers in criminology and criminal justice careers. Criminal justice agenci es require professionally trained graduates who understand the complex nature of crime contro l and prevention. The needs of employers in criminological career fields are not significantly different from those in other career fields. For example, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found employers seek graduates who have skills in leadership, communication, pr oblem solving, and analytic and quantitative reasoning. Many of our course offerings directly address these skills by exploring a wide range of topics related to criminology that expose studen ts to many of the hard questions that leaders in various criminal justice domains encounter. One example of our program's response to employer needs is the emphasis placed on resear ch by including three research-skill courses in the core of the program. Our courses in quan titative research methods, advanced social statistics, and applied research project focus on th e creation of skills that are highly marketable in data-driven human service agencies and organizations. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) Many of our students are criminal justice prac titioners seeking to advance in their respective career fields by enhancing their skills and gaining additional credentials. Our program contributes directly to the Univ ersity's mission by providing a service to local, regional, and global service providers who lead very busy and stressful day-to-days in a career field that routinely encounters crime, offenders, and victims. Our 100% online program ranks 6th nationally primarily because of the direct cont act between tenured faculty and students, and the flexibility of the program for people working full time jobs . 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, co nsider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporateuniversity partnerships, and economic development rela tionships with communities that generate additional support for the program, departm ent, college, and/or university . (maximum 200 words) The most relevant external reve nue stream for the CRIM MA progr am is its close affiliation with DELO. Coursework in the program is de livered exclusively through onli ne and On Demand formats, the revenue produced through the CRIM MA is substantial. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Overall, we expend very little faculty effort to teach the Crim inology MA program. To maintain the program, only 0.6 faculty member s are needed per semester compa red to a university median of 12. Student credit hour production ( 241) is higher than the univers ity median (128), but our production of student credit hours by effort of the faculty member (499) surp asses the university median (375). Thus, the Criminology MA program pro vides a positive revenue stream w ithout expending significant faculty time, which allows the university to offer a convenient, highq uality (ranked 16th nationally by US News and World Report), and 100% online program. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The CRIM MA at WKU is the only one of its kind in the state of Kentucky. Unlike Criminal Justice programs at other state universities (EKU, UofL) that emphasize study of the criminal justice system, the MA in Criminology Program empha sizes the empirical study of ind ependent variables that explain offending (crime, deviance, and delinquency) and victimization patterns at the individual and macro levels, which is a first step i n developing social programs to alleviate these social problems. Western Kentucky University encourage s \"applied research and public ser vice in support of economic development, quality of life, and improvement of education at a ll levels, especially elementary and secondary schools.\" Moreover, the University encourages WKU fa culty to contribute \"to the identification and solution of k ey social, economic, scientific , health, and environmental problems within its reach, but particularly throughout its primary service area .\" The Criminology MA helps educated a workforce that possesses strong t raining in a variety of resear ch methodologies, quantitative analysis skills, and criminological theory. These qualifications will b e assets to employers with local, state, and federal agencies and with variou s research organizations locate d in SouthCentral Kentucky, throughout the Commonwealth, and in other states as we reach distancelear ning students through the online web based curriculum. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) One objective in the statewide st rategic agenda is to improve t he education and skill levels of Kentucky Adult Education students to prep are them for careers and/or pos tsecondary education. An important aspect of this objective is strengthening partnership with work force partner agencies. The Criminology MA is designed to meet the needs o f people already employed in the Criminal Justice System who are looking to improve their educatio n, employment and advancement prospects. One proposal for transforming the CRIM MA is to cr eate a joint Criminal Justice Administration certificate, that would allow Criminology Masters student s to take some Public Administ ration courses as part of the CRIM MA, and thereby gain the education a nd credentials necessary to bec ome more viable as candidates for administration within the Criminal Justice System. But even wi thout the certificate, the CRIM MA is primarily geared toward those who are already in careers and lo oking to improve their prospects through higher education. The CRIM MA is also designed in such a way as to encourage the timely completion of the program for students at minimal cost, per obj ective #6. Coursework is offered frequently enough and always in an online format so that the de gree can be completed within two years. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Criminology Masters with the option for a Criminal Justice Administration certificate directly addresses a need for education a nd credentialing in the crimina l justice system. The MAlevel of education with the graduate cer tificate expands opportunities f or employment at higher levels of responsibility within the local and statewide government agenci es and some nongovernmental and nonprofit agencies. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The distinctiveness of the CRIM MA is that it is the only one o f its kind in the state of Kentucky. While other colleges and universities hav e criminal justice programs, the focus of the Criminology Masters is more broadbased in it scope. It is also a program that is ava ilable to students entirely through an online format, thus making it more appealing to those already f ulltime employed and who may live some distance from campus. Perha ps most noteworthy about the C riminology MA is that it has consistently been ranked in the t op 20 of crimerelated online masters programs around the country. Specifically, \"CollegeChoice.net \" ranked the program #5 in 2018 for \"Best Online Master's in Criminology Degrees,\" \"Best Colleges.com\" ran ked the program #10, and \"US N ews and World Report\" where it is currently ranked #16. The websi te \"onlinemasters.com\" recently featured the WKU Criminology MA as \"One of the Best Master's in Crim inology\" programs in America. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program ? (maximum 200 words) Per the discussions above, an important opportunity going forwa rd is the joint Criminal Justice Administration certificate curre ntly in the proposal stage, but representing an area where there is likely to be demand now and in the future. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National trends show continued a nd increasing demand for caree r and fulltime employed people to pursue education and graduate d egrees and/or certificates. The CRIM MA, by design, meets those needs well. Through its online delivery and flexibility, the C RIM MA will continue to help career oriented people to get the degrees and credentials needed for a dvancement with employment opportunities. c. What if any significant chang es has your program institutedw ithin the past three years to i ncrease productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The Crim MA program has continued to function as an efficient a nd effecting graduate program at WKU for the past three years. It is meeting the needs of the niche population with interest in a criminology based graduate degree . d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The program will continue to be a successful means of enabling career established and oriented people, particularly those employed in th e criminal justice system, to receive education and credentials for furthering their careers. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective adm ission. (maximum 200 words) The AB in Criminology requires 34 hours (22 hour core) and a se cond major/minor. There are no criteria for admission to keep the major open to all students. Though th e AB in Criminology has only existed for 4 years, it has grown to be the 12th largest major on campus. The majority of the major is de livered face to face (excluding capstone course), but can be obtained entirely at a dist ance through web/On Dem and offerings. The pro gram was created due to the high demand for bachelor's degree pr ograms in criminology, with the number of criminology graduates doubling nationwide between 1998 and 2008 and job growth being better than average from 2010 to 2020. The major provides graduates wi th detailed knowledge of the eti ology of criminal offending, victimization and societal react ions to crime. Graduates leave the program with the skill sets necessary for entry into a variety of fields: social services, victim advocac y, non-profit and governmental, public and private research institutions, a nd criminal justice agencies at the local, state, and national level. Though the program is new, graduates have already entered into many of these occupations. Employment outlook for criminology graduates is good a nd is discussed in section 3 (c). 2.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/ college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Like the Criminology minor, started in the mid-1980s, the Crimi nology major, is interdisciplinary with significant contributions from 9 academic departments. The majo r was created in order to allow our students to be more competitive in the marketplace with student s from other universiti es that have AB/BA programs. In service to the SOCL department, the majority of CR IM courses are electives in the Sociology major/minor. In additi on, two courses at the undergra duate level have been offered online with a 'G' component to serve the Criminology Master's program, maki ng more efficient use of faculty resources. To the university, CRI M 332 is also regularly offere d as an honors sec tion and a total of 17 courses are accepted across more than 20 other programs (mostly major programs). Beginning in the spring of 2019 the contribution to the colonnade program will i ncrease to 4 courses. F inally, to extend the reach of WKU and assist students who are fully at a distance an d those based at the regional campuses, the program offers both winter/su mmer web offerings and On Dema nd courses. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Though new, the program's enrollmen t is strong. At the start of fall 2018, there were 302 majors. Given the popularity of CRIM programs, c onsistent need for employees in the field, and appr opriate university support, the program expects t o grow these numbers. Specificall y, approximately 42% of majors are first- generation students (2017-2018), a portion greater than majors at the university (31.5%) and college (29.6%). Further, approximatel y 21% of criminology majors were underrepresented minorities during the previous academic year compare d to the university (15%) and col lege (16%). Perhaps most remarkable in program's produc tivity, its current SCHP (3,176 ) is three times that of the university median (991\u2014Table 2a). 3.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Below are abridged SLOs for the program. Students graduating fr om the program will: Have an in-depth understanding of t he fundamental aspects of cr ime and how it exists within broader social issues of diversity and ine quality in the criminal justi ce system and in society. Have a firm grasp of empiricall y demonstrated correlates of cri me, offending, and victimization at the individual, community, nationa l and internati onal level. Understand how criminologists conc eptualize deviant behavior an d how deviant labels are socially constructed. Be familiar with both community and institutional responses to crime and social control. Comprehend the cyclical nature of t he criminal justice system, the problems this presents for the individual and society, a nd potential solutions. Have learned quantitative techni ques used to analyze social phe nomena and apply statistics in 'real world' settings Learn methods utilized by social sc ientists to examine the comp lexities of the crime problem. Think critically, solve problem s creatively, and communicate ef fectively and intelligently both orally and in writing. Be able to meet the current need s of the field t hat has increas ingly begun to stress non-traditional solutions to the crime problem in response to national calls to reform the system and reduce the size of the prison population. To date, these SLOs have been a ssessed through the core courses in the program and the CRIM 499 capstone course. The majority of students are able to pass the comprehensive exam in CRIM 499 that covers the core courses. (See se ction 3(e).) A more qualitative assessment was attempted in the fall of 2017, but a poor sampling frame made assessment difficult. The program is new and the department intends to assess it aga in in the near future. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The program is only 4 years old and thus, graduates have only b egun to establish themselves in their careers. However, the departmen t has reached out to a number of graduates who found employment in occupations related to the fi eld. In the fall of 2017, a career panel series was cr eated through which a number of graduates have visited c ampus to meet with current st udents and begin a co llaborative process connecting our majors with employment opportunities. The depart ment has also focused on redeveloping its website to feature such graduates. Once completed, the webs ite will have pictur es and narratives of groups of graduates employed in dif ferent fields (i.e., law enf orcement, victim services, etc.). This will allow enrolled and prospective students to bridge the gap betwe en their studies and their future occupational potential. The fiel d is expected to have better th an average job growth between 2010 and 2020 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook) . The U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta tistics projects jobs for criminologists to increase at a faster than average pace betwee n 2012 and 2022. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the crimina l justice system alone employ ed 2.4 million people in 2012, not including occupational opportunities outsi de the traditional system. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The department has incorporate d feedback from employers pertain ing to their needs centrally through its internship program. Through inter nships, students have been pla ced with more than forty-five agencies (list available upon request). The se agencies fall within a var iety of potential career paths for our graduates, including social justice advocacy groups, youth corr ectional facilities, community-based organizations, local/state/feder al law enforcement agencies, vi ctim services, social service organizations, probation/parole, and agencies t hat focus on offender re-integr ation. Through this effort, the department has broadened its connections to a gencies in diverse fields tha t our graduates are ideally suited for and helped us to bridge the gap betw een what our students learn and how to translate it into employment. Our connections with these agencies has also better informed facult y as to what skills and knowledge employers desire, which is pa ssed on to students through advisi ng to meet those needs. The department has sponsored a number of career panels each semester that invi te representatives fro m various agencies to campus to inform students of how t o move into a specific occupa tion upon graduation. Informal feedback on these sessions from students has been positive and the depar tment plans to continue them. e. What else should evaluators know about the success o fstudents in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) The CRIM 499: Senior Seminar course is offered every spring/fal l as a 2nd semester bi-term, online course. The course consists of a 100 question multiple choice e xam covering the core of the program and is administered by a FTF beyond their normal course load. The d epartment feels that this is an inadequate measure for assessing the program . The department has been work ing to transform the course into a more meaningful assessment of SLOs , but has been limited in doing so with existing resources. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

(maximum 200 words) Courses (lower/upper division) a re offered every summer/winter term and On Demand, which greatly assists in generating DELO revenue. The program is available en tirely through On Demand, though the electives are limited. Still, the program can be completed enti rely at a distance, which helps to serve those at the regional campuses. Currently , 8.7% of students are 100% dis tance learners and an additional 31.8% took at least one distance course in Fall 2018. With additional mark eting and support, the distance component of the program could extend its reach further afield and attract s tudents from other states who prefer the flexibility of an online degree. Moreover, the On Demand availa bility of the program is ideal for students who are active duty military and would otherwise be prohibited from obtaining a college degree while serving and to whom a degree in criminology is particularly att ractive given the preference for military service among many federal crim inal justice agencies. Such stud ents have in the past and currently are enrolled in On Demand courses and the department would like to grow this opportunity. The AB in Criminology is ranked 8th on campus in terms of student c redit hour production making it a highly cost effective program. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The program consistently maintai ns high enrollment. During 2017 -2018, median course size for FTF courses was 45 (max. 80). Excluding On Demand, courses were enr olled at 89% and 94% capacity enrolled at 86% and 89%; exclud ing the regional campuses, courses were enrolled at 93% capacity. Courses rarely have low enrollment an d most spring 2019 courses are either completely full or over capacity. Note: These percentages dif fer from those provided by IR in Table 4a because they are numbers exclusive to the CRIM program instead of reflective of all u ndergraduate courses taught by the SOCL dept. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The following demonstrate that the program \"prepares students o f all backgrounds to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizen-leaders of a global s ociety.\" 42% of our majors are first gene ration students (PCAL-30%; Univ -31%) and 21% are Goals accessibility & diversity . We offer the degree both f2f and at a distance. In 2018 9% of our majors studied 100% at a distance, 59.5% 100% f2f a nd 31% hybrid of the two\u2014 Goals accessibility & diversity . Our SCH cost (Table 4a) is whi 42% rsity median ($128)\u2014 Goal affordability . Average time to degree (Table 3a) is 3.47 years versus 4.39 for the university. Despite these competitive numbers, we overhauled recruitment advising and ret ention efforts in 2017. Most notably, we implemented a peer mentoring program and have worke d closely with ACDC's CAP (designating faculty mentors, co- sponsoring several career work shops, etc.) to enhance our strengths\u2014 Goal completion & success . We are involved in HIPs includ ing study abroad opportunities, m entorship of undergraduate research, and service/community -based learning and coordination with regional employers to place a minimum of 20 students in internships annually\u2014 Goals success, global context, & regional economy/quality of life. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) In addition, to the a bove discussion of accessibility , diversity, affordabi lity, completion, and success achievements, the following demonstrate that the program ensure s that the state of Kentucky is strengthened by post-s econdary education. Enrollment in CRIM 101 dual cred it increased from 10 in the fir st offering (Fall 2014) to 76 (Fall 2018) enhancing capacity for citi zens of the commonwealth\u2014 Goal opportunity . Many occupations in criminal justice (i.e., law enforcement, co rrectional officer, court designated worker, etc.) do not require a college degree. However, knowle dge of social diversity, working collaboratively, and gathering a nd synthesizing information nec essary for evidenced-based decision making are high-demand skills for such occupations. As such, college-educated CJ professionals are paid more and ge nerate higher state revenue\u2014 Goal impact . Finally, the CRIM major collabor ates with academic programs suc h as sociology, forensic psychology, public health, and social work (via courses focusin g on psychology and the law, drug abuse, offender services, and t he intersection of diversity and deviance) to enhance the capacity of future employees to implement prevention and rehabilitation ser vices to at-risk populations. As such, our majors have the skills necessary to engage with the v ery social problems at the heart of criminality\u2014 Goal impact . c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Kentucky Future Skills Report (KCEWS) provides a wealth of inf ormation about employment trend s in the state of KY. Twenty-tw o general occupatio nal codes are presented in the report. In careful review, the following codes were determ ined to be associated with the A B in criminology\u2014Community & Social Service Occupations, Legal Occupa tions, Social Science Occupati ons, and Protective Service Occupations. Of the four, three w ere projected to be \"fast gro wing\" and the fourth described as \"growing.\" Within those general codes, 21 uniqu e jobs were evaluated: Pro bation/parole officer, rehabilitation counselor, substance abuse & be havioral disorder counselor, adm inistrative legal, judge, arbitrators/mediators, judicial l aw clerks, lawyers, social sci ence research assistants, social scientists, survey researchers, correctiona l officers/jailers, detective/cr iminal investigators, fish and ators, security guards, transpo rtation security screeners, and 1 st line supervisors of correctional o fficers, police/detectives, and pr otective services in general. Regarding expectations , 5 are forecasted to remain s table, 10 to grow, 5 to experienc e fast growth and one, substance abuse and behavioral disorder counseling, to experien ce \"very fast growth.\" In sum, based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistic s and the Kentucky Labor Market Information Office our students are pursuing a vibrant discipli ne in which job growth is expected. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) While EKU, NKU, and the Univers ity of Louisville offer BS degre es in criminal justice, the AB in Criminology at WKU is the only b achelor's degree program in cri minology in the commonwealth university system. By combining t he theoretical examination of various individual, social, and structural variables related to crime in s ociety with a firm understanding of basic research methodologies and data analysis, criminology graduates have the skills necessary to an alytically examine social problems with a firm understanding of issues of i nequality and diversity\u2014abilit ies that are increas ingly necessary in a changing society. Further, while changes in the cri minal justice system have trad itionally informed criminological research, criminology provides a critical e xamination of broader question s such as what biolog ical, psychological, and sociological factors affect criminal propensity and how the oretical knowledge ca n be directly applied to develop sound preventative polic ies and theoretically-inform ed solutions to the crime problem. Such an interdisciplinary process is necessary to address the multif aceted problem of crime, and, as a result, our graduates are strongly positioned to find employment in a varie ty of settings, serving a population as diverse as the problem itself e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The lines above have been writte n to summarize the state of the AB in criminology in its 5th year. In the final section of this self-asse ssment, we turn to a strong argu ment of enhancement so that the program can enrich the policies, strategie s, vision, goals, and objectives of the AB in crimi nology and the college, university, and state with whom it is aligned. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program ? (maximum 200 words) Given the scarcity of faculty res ources, we have been judicious in course offerings. These calculated decisions have resulted in succe ss as our courses average 90% c apacity with a median enrollment of 45 (university median = 19). Unfort unately, a number of courses r emain untaught even though such courses are cross-listed in support of multiple programs and/or in line with the mission of developing modern- global citizens. Further, in fall of 2018, 8.7% (29 m ajors) studied 100% at a di stance with an additional 106 taking at least one distance course. The capacity to offer more online c ourses, supported by increased marketing, would allow us to extend the re ach of a program already in high demand. In alignment with current reten tion and completion goals we hav e considered dedicating a CRIM 101 section for incoming freshman majors. This course would purpos efully blend content goals with those of assimilation into the disciplin e they have chosen to study. Finally, our CRIM 499 \"Senior Semin ar\" course requires signific ant overhaul. We have objections to its current form but lack the faculty r esources to make the experie nce a more meaningful capstone (it is currently a 1 hour pass/fail course ) with greater alignment to career readiness and transition. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Data from the National Center f or Education Statistics (NCES) a llow a ranking of degree fields, unfortunately the categories involved are overly broad. That c aution aside the \"liberal arts & sciences, general studies, and humanities\" category comprised the greates t portion of postsecondary degrees awarded in 2015-16 at 38%. More in \"s ocial and hist ory\" were the third greatest at 8% of all bachelor degrees awarded and increased by 29% between 2000-01 & 2015-16. Along with its status as a soc ial science, no doubt some of the degrees conferred in the category \"Homeland Security, Law Enforce ment, and Firefighting\" can be a ttributed to the d iscipline of criminology. This category experi enced a 143% increase in degr ee production from 2000-01 to 2015-16 more than doubling, 25,200-61,200, the number of degrees comple ted. These increases reflect the gr owing demand (as expressed in 5c) of professions relat ed to these degrees and the desire for states to prio ritize investment in revenue g enerating programs/occupations (as expressed in 5b). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) When the AB in Criminology was implemented in 2014, a number of significant changes were made to our departmental offerings i n both criminology and sociology wh ich demanded purposefulness and efficiency in planning. In 2015, we implemented a regular r otation of courses to provid e students transparency of when courses would be taught and where (i.e., a t a distance, at a regional c ampus, and on main campus). Since then, we have had some faculty changes a nd have added or deleted courses to reflect those changes. In 2017 & 18, we turned our attenti on toward student recruitmen t and advising. Our new advising mission statement, \"To help student s develop individual compete nce and purpose while strengthening connection to the community of sociology and criminology,\" cont ains four general goals (with at least two specific objectives in suppor t of each) and a plan for impl ementation. In addition to developing alumni profiles on our website, we have requested that Criminol ogy be added to our department's name. Once we receive final approva l to do so we look forward to deve loping marketing materials which will include strengthening relations hips with the surrounding commun ity colleges to develop 2+2 programs and/or provide a clear path f or dual enrolled students. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) When we proposed the AB in cri minology, we expected to add 70-8 0 majors per year. According to data in Table 2a, there were 287 majors at the start of the fall sem ester\u2014an average of 72 per year. We have accomplished this success wit h 3.5 faculty allocated solely to the program. We highlight the following future goals with the understanding that such goals necessitate adequate support. We will consider developing a scaffolding model of coursework. Scaffolding coursework outlines how development toward each goal is accomplished throughout a 100, 200, 300, and 400 level curriculum structure. This would allow progr essive skill development for all students, ensures a ll students have the capacity to speak about the skill s they are acquiring in relati on to employment demands, and allows students who demonstrate advanc ed potential unique support. Re vising the capstone to conclude such skill development with a data-d riven, evidence-based project is an ideal, but pres ently missing, piece toward ensuring career r eadiness and transition. Finally, our AB in sociology has f our concentrations which focu s skill building unique to different professions aligned with sociology. We will consider creating concentrations within criminology and/or certificates such as: Crime M apping, Victimology, Human Servic es in Criminal and Juvenile Justice, or Law Enforcement. Additional faculty would be necessary as cour ses within these concentrations would need to be developed for the marke table skills associated with each to be realized. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) WKU is an accredited member of th e National Association of Scho ols of Dance (NASD). The AB in Dance provides comprehensive training in performance, choreography, and dance pedagogy within the framework of a liberal arts education. All levels of technique are offere d in ballet, jazz, modern, an d tap. By integrating dance and general studies, we strive to create \"Thinking Art ists,\" individuals who work to achieve thei r highest potential as artists, technicians, and scholars. Students must audition for placement into the program and are i nitially classified as \"seekin g admission\" in the degree. Complete audition criteria can be found here. Full admittance is earn ed, typically in the 3rd semester, upon demonstrating proficient talent, commitment, a nd a reasonable likelihood of a chieving the required technique levels. Students must achieve an advanced level in one dance genre and an intermediate level in a secondary genre. Detailed criteria for technique advancement can be found in the Dance Program Handbook . The degree is offered through facetoface courses, which provide the individualized trainin g and coaching necessary for dance. Students are challenged not only in dance technique and performance, but also in dance theory coursework and resear chbased creative projects. Students are also required to pursue a second major or minor degree. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Dance Program is an important part of the cultural environm ent of the campus, community, and region. Perhaps most importantly, the program provides five topquality dance concer ts to an annual audience of approximately 2000 every year. This includes a special performan ce for area schools. These are often the only opportunities to see concert dance in the region. The program contributes to the Co lonnade experience through two courses, DANC 110: Dance Appreciation and DANC 360: Dance in Culture. Both engage WKU students in the arts, develop ing in them a lifelong apprecia tion for dance. The program also offers Honors sections of many classes. The Dance Program invites the campus community to enjoy open da nce classes on select Frid ay afternoons with \"Gotta Dance Fridays\". Students of all levels of ability are invited t o participate in these free classes. The Dance Program also provides significant support for the BFA in Performing Arts - Musical T heatre program. In fact, the Dance Program generates about an additional 190 SCHPs each seme ster for the BFA program that are not reflected in the table above. Dance faculty also choreograph musical theatre pro ductions and regularly collaborates with the WKU Symphony. Program students also collaborate on choreographic pr ojects with Gatton Academy students. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Dance Program regularly part icipates in regional and nation al dance festivals, such as the American College Dance Association South Conference, and the Tennessee Dance Festival. Students enjoy the additional performance experience and adjudication these activities br ing. In addition, faculty regul arly select student choreography for performance at these event s, which provides students with the opportunity to present their c reative activity. Finally, the dance faculty remain professionally active and often utilize WKU students to perform faculty research and choreography at national festivals and conferences. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student Learning Outcomes can be found here. The Dance Program follows the standards of the NASD, regardin g program learning outcomes, assessment, and periodic review. The program employs a comprehensive, developmental Advising/Assessment/Retention process for all of its majors. Da nce faculty periodically rev iew each individual student's overall growth and development as he or she progresses through our program. This process provides constructive, individualized criticism aimed a t maximizing each student's ful l potential for success after graduation and to assess the over all effectiveness of our program. Students are assessed against a s tandardized rubric at the end of their 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th semesters by the Dance Program faculty. They meet with and are assessed by the full Theatre & Dance department faculty at the end of their 1st, 4th, and 8th semesters, as well. The r esults of these assessments ar e compiled at the end of each semester and used to monitor the effectiveness of the program a nd identify areas for program improvement. Student scholarly and creative work are regularly adjudicated by facult y and are also frequently presented for adjudication at regiona l and national professional confer ences. Results of this adjudica tion process are also used to maintain the quality and effectiveness of the program. As a result of our NASD SelfStudy process, the program took a number of actions over the last three years to better connect the program to regional educatio nal and community organizations like SKyPAC and the WKU Symphony. The program also began offering \"Gotta Dance Fridays,\" and sponsoring a Toys for Tots collection site at WinterDance concerts. Most significantly, the Dance Program initiated a Summer Dance Inten sive beginning in 2016. This has been a very successful residential summer dance camp for high school students and danc e studio owners from around the state who come to campus for intensive dance training with WKU dance faculty and nationally known guest artists. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) As a smaller program where student s work closely with faculty f or long hours in the studio an d classroom, it is common for faculty and students t o stay in close contact for many years af ter graduation. The Dance Pr ogram utilizes a dance alumni Facebook group to connect with alumni and gather feedback and e mployment information. Fac ulty also communicate with alumni via email. The key areas o f professional opportunity for our graduates are performance in concert dance companies, theatre companies, cruise ships, theme parks, and commercial wo rk, teaching dance in the public and private sector, and choreographing for concert compa nies and private studios. Addit ionally, some alumni go on to w ork as arts administrators for a variety of companies. Of the 51 graduates since 2013/2014 , 20 have worked as professiona l dancers, 3 have gone on to graduate training in dance, 2 have gone on to graduate training in other fields, 18 are teaching and/or operating dance studios, 8 are employ ed in related profe ssional business and ad ministration fields. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Dance faculty gather feedback from dance studio owners and comp any directors inperson and vi a email. In 2017, the Dance Program distributed a survey to current and prospective student s, alumni, and dance studio owners. This survey provided beneficial information to ensure that the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employabilit y skills. We found that there i s a market for a BFA in Dance degree program at WKU. The addition of this degree program would attract a greater number of students to WKU and provide dance majors with a deeper level of training in preparation for performance and teaching careers. The Dance Program annually invites two to three nationallyknow n choreographers and teachers to campus as guest artists. These professionals ensure our students are learning the most c urrent techniques and at a level of skill expected in a professional setting. Ma ny of our graduates have since gone on to jobs working in the dance companies of these guest professionals. Our accrediting body, NASD, also provides a comprehensive source of national standards al igned with professional expectations and the most current data in the field. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) The Dance Program is proud that our students all go on to enjoy successful employment. W hile most students find employment within the dance field, others choose to begin caree rs in another field. Regardless of their career path, our students are prepared to be creat ive problem solvers, collabora tive in the work field, and able to think outside of the box with disciplined focus. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 2 12 Number of NTE Faculty .1 4 Dept. Cost per SCH* $108 $128 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 231 244 220 229 235 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 42.0 45.5 42.3 44.9 46.0 75.8 Median Class Size by Level 9 10 7 9 6 19 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 81.7 72.2 81.3 77.9 80.0 36.3 * On the advice of Academic Affairs, we are reporting the depar tment average cost per SCHP. This is due to t he fact that curriculum between all Theatre an d Dance degrees is so tightly interwoven. b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Dance Program offers 5 to 9 online courses annually, genera ting DELO revenue for the department. The Dance Program regularly applies for and receiv es Honors Faculty Engagement Gr ants each semester to support enhanced learning opportunities for honors sections of dance classes. Faculty app ly for and receive Quick Turn Around grants and Research and Creative Activity Project grants to support research and creati ve activity. Many of our student s apply for and receive Faculty Undergraduate Student Engagement Grants. The university current ly provides no funding to support dance concert production. The cost of costumes , lighting, sound, and venue re ntal are all covered through ticket sales. The Theatre & Dance Department also generated revenue through sponsorships by local businesses such as Servic e One Credit Union. Most significantly, though , is the revenue generated by the WKU Summ er Dance Intensive. This reve nue stream subsidizes guest artist residencies for the Dance Program, supports student trav el to dance conferences and festivals, funds select \"Gotta Dance Friday\" workshops. The Dance Program has been fortunate t o have recently received a significant philanthropic gift. The program is one of five to b e supported annually from the $1 0 million Jerry Bak er Endowment. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Please note, the department typically offers 25 practicums (pro duction labs, performance labs, ensemble performance courses) every semester, compr ising roughly 29% of the total nu mber of courses. These pract icums are not included in teaching loads and are taken by students as part of their parti cipation in productions. Enrollm ents in these are typically qui te small, 1 to 5 students, and signif icantly skew the median class size and underenrolled sections data above. NASD guidelines range from 12 to 20. After removing practicums from the equatio n, the average size of upper level courses in the Dance Program is 13. The program is also supported by technical theatre faculty and coursework. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) A sample of Strategic Plan objectives addressed by the Dance Pr ogram: \"recruit undergraduate students who are collegeready and who wa nt to be members of the WKU family\" The Dance Program very actively recruits at the regional and na tional level. Average ACT in Theatre & Dance is 25. 42.86% of incoming majors are from out of state. \"continue to expand offcampus and oncampus educational opport unities.\" The Dance Program recently instituted a very successful New Yor k Study Away program and is in the process of developing programs to Chicago and Cuba. \"Facilitate high impact practice s, immersive learning in differ ent cultures, processlearning practices, and collaborative learning and instructional opportunities.\" The Dance Program, following N ASD standards, ut ilizes best prac tices to provide immersive, processlearning practices, and an emphasis on lea rning by doing. The majority o f coursework in the program is done in the studio and onstage. Students develop extensive resumes of practical le arning, supported by inst ruction from professional guest artists. \"Align university priorities with communities, business and ind ustry, educational institutions, a nd others to create mutually beneficial cultural, environment al, scientific, and social oppo rtunities for all.\" The Dance Program plays a significant role in the campus and re gion providing educational and cultural opportunities. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Strategy 1.1., The program increases cultural competence among students, staff, and faculty at WKU through its many dance productions which focus on diver sity, inclusion, and world danc e styles. The Dance Program invites guest artists and a diversity of dance companies to perform, teach, and choregraph at WKU. Some recent examples include the Ailey II Dance Company, Deeply Rooted Dance Theater, and choreographers Endaly n Taylor and Cornelius Carter. Strategy 8.1, The program has developed an intensive and effect ive advising and jury process to ensure the steady progress of its majors toward graduation, and to continually measure the effectiveness of the p rogram's curriculum. Strategy 8.2, Program faculty are actively engaged in continual training as well as scholarly a nd professional work to ensure their teaching is effective, tim ely, and of the highest profess ional standards. Strategy 9.1., The program makes career development a priority by presenting its majors w ith numerous professional contacts, development of professio nal resumes, opportunities fo r professional apprenticesh ips and summer intensive training, and entrepreneurial opportunities to create their own dance productions. Strategy 10.5., The Dance Program helps foster an innovative, c reative and entrepreneurial cult ure at WKU and in the region through its many dance concert p roductions, pub lic dance worksh ops, scholarly presentations, and Summer Dance Intensive. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) KY Workforce data suggests a mod est increase in employment oppo rtunities for dancers and choreographers in the Commonwealth over the next five year. National data from the Bu reau of Statistics predicts a 2 .6% increase in choreographer demand nationally, and a 4.8% rise in demand for dancers over t he next 10 years. Because of th e current lack of employment opportunities in the field of dan ce within the region, many Dan ce Program graduates move to large metropolitan areas after graduation when pursing wok in t he field. Those who stay within the WKU service region tend to teach at, or open, dance studios. Of course, many of our graduates use their degree as a liberal arts foundation for a career outside dance and choreography. According to the A ssociation of American Colleges and Universities, \"4 out of 5 employers agree that all students should acquire broad kno wledge in the liberal arts and sciences.\" d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The WKU Dance Program is the only accredited dance program in t he state of Kentucky and one of only 79 in the nation. Our program offers significantly greater depth in technical trainin g and performance opportunities than other dance programs in the region. Over the last few years, the WKU Dance Program has been gaining national stature, and is now listed in the Dance Ma gazine College Guide. Distinguished alumn i from the program are now working at prestigious companies such as Elements Conte mporary Ballet, MOMIX, and the Radio City Rockettes Christma s Spectacular, performing on Broadway in Frozen, and pursuing professional crea ting and directing endeavors, s uch as Bellamoxi, a Kentuckybased dance convention/competition company, and teaching at private d ance studios in and outside of Kentucky. Recent WKU Distinguished Hall of Alumni indu ctee, Becky Ann Baker, was a d ance minor. Companies such as the Joffrey Ballet School and Deeply Rooted Dance Theatre now come annually to WKU to auditio n our students. The Dance Program sponsors student chapters of the National Dan ce Education Organization and the National Honor Society of Dance Arts, which create enhanced leadership and educational opportunities for students. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) WKU is currently one o f only 36 universitie s in the nation with accreditation in all four arts areas: Dance, Th eatre, Music, a nd Art and Design. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Dance Program recognizes the market for growth that a BFA i n Dance degree would bring to WKU. The addition of this degree program would attract new students and provide a deeper level of training and ed ucation for students. The Dance Program already demonstrates a great deal of interdis ciplinary opportunities for students. Dance classes are required in the BFA in Performing Arts degree and the BA in The atre degree. In fact, in the fall of 2018, 20% of the SCHP production in dance technique classes was with BFA or BA in The atre students. Nonmajors also take dance classes and are active in dance concerts. Please note that the Dance Program lost a fourth tenuretrack d ance line in 2015, increasin g its reliance on parttime instructors, particularly in cov ering larger, 100 and 200 level classes. To maintain program quality in the longterm and ensu re continued growth, the program would like to recapture this line . b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National enrollment trends in th e visual and performing arts ha ve fallen somewhat over the last 5 years, after rising to a pea k around 2012. Dance Program enrollments peaked in 2015/2016 and have declined slight ly since then. This aligns with WKU enrollment trends and statistics regarding high school graduate s in Kentucky. Signs of continuing strong enrollment are promising. The Dance Program has experienced the largest ever a ttendance at two fall 2018 recruiting events, Dance Auditions and Dance Days. Both events drew 31 prospective dance students to the campus. We anticipate similar numbers at spring 2019 recruiting events. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Following review by NASD, the Dance Program has proposed revisi ons to the dance technique level structure. By reducing the quantity of levels, we will prov ide a clearer path of progressi on for students and alleviate fa culty overload concerns. The Dance Program implemented the WK U Summer Dance In tensive in 201 6 to enhance recruitment. As a result, we have noticed a greater number of prospective students returning to v arious dance program events and/or enrolling as a dance major. Prime new markets in the field of dance that the dance program would like to pursue are commercial dance (cruise ship, industrial, video, hiphop) and m usical theatre dance. Our accr editors have recommended hirin g in this area in their most recent visit. We would like to a dd a fourth line in this field in order to meet this trend and support a BFA in Dance degree. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Over the last ten years, the Dance Program has grown significan tly in size, scope and prominence. Further growth in enrollment is anticipated; howev er, the program is reaching cap acity in regards to space and fa culty resources. This limitatio n affects both dance degree programs as well as the BFA in Perfor ming Arts Musical Theatre Program. The Dance Program recognizes the market need for a BFA in Dance degree, however, additional studio space and a fourth faculty line would be necessary. The addition of this professional degree program wou ld increase enrollment withi n the Dance Program. Most concerning is the quality of the current dance floor. The floor ing in GWH 200 A and B has outlas ted its lifespan and is thin, worn, and deteriorating, which is detrimental to dancer safety and recruitment efforts. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The major in diversity & community studies is a relatively new (2014) face to face program that requires a minor. The program provides graduates with a critical framework for understanding social systems and structural for ms of oppression at local and global scales. Students also gain practical skills of working w ith others to solve problems related to citizenship and activis m. Such knowledge and skills are necessary for a wide range of voc ations, ranging from social serv ices to governmental and non profit organizations, at all leve ls from local to international . Strategies for social change are among the most challenging to study and to implement, espe cially given the sense that consumeroriented systems are unstoppable. For this reason, lea rning how to problemsolve, take direct action, and identify positive ways of conflict resoluti on are key for students' succ ess in a wide range of vocations , ranging from social services to governmental and nonprofit organizations. This major is especi ally appealing to offices of div ersity in corporate or universi ty settings and to communitybased n onprofit organizations. The p rogram aims at transformat ive knowledge, changing consciousness, and shaping leaders who are less susceptible to shortterm answers at the expense of longterm sustainability of the environment and communities that must share the world. 2.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The University mission states tha t \"Western Kentucky University (WKU) prepares students of all backgrounds to be productive, engaged, socially res ponsible citizenleaders of a global society.\" The major provides graduates with a critical COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 framework for understanding social systems and structural forms of oppression at loc al and global scales. To that end, DCS contributes a great deal to the Colonnade program. All courses in the major, with the exception of the capstone, are included either in Explorations or Connections under the Colonnade. In a ddition, many programs (majors, m inors, and certificates) use DCS courses as electives. The major shares important affini ties to the three minors that we offer: Conceptual frameworks for unders tanding diverse communities, th eir histories and contem porary expressions, the structural challenges they face, and the contributions they off er to the fabric of American society; A commitment to working for socia l justice and equality of trea tment across differences; A record of working collaboratively servi ce projects as well as participatory research; An understanding that social systems are interconnected in perp etuating institutional oppression and dominate group privilege. A conviction that interdisciplin ary analysis and community expe rience are essential to addressing real world problems. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The DCS major is unique at WKU, in the region, and nationally, due to its interdisciplinary exam ination of themes of current local, regional, national, and global importance. It is designe d for students interested in the humanities and social sciences ; it is not a science degree, though s cientific exploration and solu tions are important to some of the courses at least (those relating to sustainability and public problemsolving, for inst ance). One unique aspect of the program is the focus on project based research and applied learning through community building projects design (HIPs) to teach students how to lead and solve realworld problem in a co mmunities rather than an academ ic setting. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data IR 201314 N % FirstYear Retention Rate 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4.51 (N=4) 4.25 (N=4) b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) We take assessment of our progra m seriously and use results to make improvements. We continually collect artifacts from all of our courses for assessment of program learning outcomes. Our departmental assessment plans are built around the LEAP out comes, and all final artifacts from courses in the DCS major are assessed using the LEAP Criti cal Thinking VALUE Rubric for evaluating all student capstone projects. The rubric is also aligned with WKU's SACSCOC Quality Enhancement Plan (evidenceg athering, sensemaking, and argumentation). For example, the following areas are rated on a scale of 14 (below average exemplary): Communicates introduction of issu e/problem effectively using th e language and terminology germane to social and structural forms of oppre ssion (evidencegathering). Demonstrates knowledge of issues pertaining to social equity/ju stice (evidencegathering). Applies knowledge, theories, and research to analyze problems p ertinent to social equity/j ustice (sensemaking). Integrates strategies to confron t issues of personal or public importance (i.e., race, sex ism, heterosexism) (sense making). Demonstrates knowledge of how co ncepts of social equity/justice shape the human experience (implications and consequences) (argumentation). For our first round of accessing the DCS major, we collected ar tifacts from the capstone course DCS 400 from 201617. It was clear that the design of the course and the final artifact were not conducive to assessing the progam learning outcomes. The course was redesigned and first taught in spring of 2018 by the program's department head. Bo th the course and the final articfact were developed wit h the above SLOs in mind. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We do not collect employment data on our graduates nor do we ha ve the resources to adequately track and collect this data. Students graduating from DCS programs seek employment in a wide range of fields due to the interdisciplinary nature of the degree. Because the DCS is a new major, we have had a relativel y small number of graduates and very little time to track and incorporate employment data. The student employment outcomes sc atterplot from Kentucky employment statistics, however, shows the 3 year employment outcomes (counting employe d in Kentucky by median wages) for multi/interdisciplinar y programs, WKU stude nts are earning, on average, $35,173/year, which is above the median income of $26,600 for all majors. Beginning in the spring of 2018, we began to survey our recent graduates. We would like to continue to contact students\u2014 using email, phone, and/or social media\u2014after graduation and on e year out. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) We have not collected data regard ing statisfaction from employe rs. Again, we are just beginning to graduate students. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 6 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH $168 $167 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 169 190 167 171 225 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 73.3% 74.5% 73.7% 68.3% 71.9% 76.8% Median Class Size by Level 9 11 11 11 9 8 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 54.5% 30.0% 36.4% 33.3% 54.5% 55.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Although the DCS program has not, to date, received much extern al revenue to significantly support the program, individual faculty members have received sm all external grants to support High Impact Practice projects. For example, one faculty member received a Kentucky Commonwealth Garden Initiative Grant ($10,000) and an International Grant, from the University of East London ($8,930.00 US$) to support projectba sed learning through community gardens in one of the core courses for the major, DCS 300: Public Problemsolving. This pr oject, as well as others, created opportunities for students to work in the community and develop relationships with key stakeh olders. The reported \"delivery cost\" in the Supplementary Data Tables, which feeds SCHP, is based on the average of all FTF salaries. In a small department, the department head salary skews the dat a. For instance, the mean salary shows $61,556, but only one faculty member (the DH) make s more than that . This results in an artificially high delivery cost. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The DCS major shares core course s with the minors in the progra m (AFAM, GWS, CSJ). The ONLY course completely unique to the major is the capstone course, DCS 400\u2014and that course has b een taught gratis the past t wo years (not part of the instructor's teaching load; once we have more graduating senior s, the course will move to inloa d). Since all faculty share in teaching courses across our prog rams as well, the program is ex tremely efficient. As noted in 4a., DCS operates with half the number of faculty as the university median. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The DCS major embodies the \"Regional Lighthouse\" notion spelled out in the WKU strategic plan; particularly to \"[e]nsure that WKU students graduate wit h skills to think critically, sol ve problems, and engage effectiv ely with others.\" The major is built on the foundations of diversity, community, and social ju stice. Though diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are addressed generally in the strategic plan, the university's DEI plan calls for WKU to create an infrastru cture conducive for learning for underserved populations. In terms of recruitment a nd retention, the DCS major \"ensure[s] access to WKU for underrepresented student populations through a targeted attrac tion and recruitment plan.\" DCS attracts and maintains students of color, women, and members of the LBGTQ+ community a nd \"support[s] and enhance[s] the Colonnade Program, to students' Personal and Profess ional Development Plans.\" DCS is a highly innovative major a nd breaks the traditional bou ndaries of discipline specific education by combining the humanities and social and nat ural sciences. According to Craig's (2017) contribution to Forbes.com, \"...access academic ces across multidiscip linary coursework pr oduces graduates who are better equipped to think critically, communicate more efficiently, translate soft into hard skills i n the workforce, creatively synt hesize information and work in teams with diverse colleagues.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Out of 26 majors, 14 a re listed as \"underre presented minorities .\" Objective #1 of the statewide strategic plan is to \"Improve the diversity and inclusiveness of Kentucky's campuses through the statewide diversity planning process and related initiatives.\" This includes (1.1) \"Increase cultural competence among students, staff and othe r postsecondary professionals so that everyone is welcomed, valued , supported, and accommodated\" and (1.4) \"Increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students , faculty, and staff.\" Also included in the statewide plan is to \"Increase participation in postsecondary education, particularly among traditionally under served populations\" (objective #3). The DCS major not only attracts underserved populatio ns but teaches skills necessary t o work in a diverse environments to all students. The major provides graduates with a critical framework for understanding social systems and structural for ms of oppression at local and global scales. Three of the core courses\u2014AFAM 190 The African A merican Experience, GWS 200 Introduction to Gender & Women's Studies, and CSJ 200 Int roduction to Social Justice\u2014all specifically address cultural diversity a nd help students face the challenges and importance of working with people from diffe rent backgrounds and who hold different worldviews. DCS accomplishes this through \"per spective taking\" in ways that are different from disciplin ary majors and that serve students in important ways: see 5a. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the Pew Research Center 2017 report The Future of Jobs and Job Training , \"a focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence (AI) and machines seem unab le to replicate\" will be importa nt. These skills include the ab ility to network with others, manage p ublic relations, display interc ultural sensitivity, marketing, creativity, and enough critical thinking to move outside the box. In addition, \"21st century le arning, trains students to be proficient in content mastery, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, an d other valuable abilities rather than merely being proficient in math, English, and social studies .\" As previously noted, our gr aduates leave WKU qualitifed t o be leaders and change agents in a wide range of occupations in Kentucky (and elsewhere). d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The DCS major aims at transformative knowledge, changing consci ousness and shaping leaders who are less susceptible to shortterm answers at the expens e of longterm sustainability o f the environment and communities that must share the world. There are no programs lie it in the state of Kentucky. E KU does offer a BS in Social Justice Studies, with no specific sub requirements. However, our DCS ma jor is a BA degree, with an em phasis on three subareas, in which students focus their electives (2 courses each): I) Formations of identity and narra tives of oppression; II) Advocac y and social cha nge; and III) Systems, Local to Global. This en sures that students' choices c over an appropriate range of issues central to our major. Key Attributes Themebased and problembased, interdisciplinary rather than disciplinebased Longterm solutions fo r community sustainability Process of societal change, with emphasis on issues of race, class equity and community health It is a flexible major, allowing for a range of choices, which students find extremely benefici al. The core is supported by t hree areas of emphasis that ensure that students get a strong, inter disciplinary training (in the cor e courses) and multidisciplina ry exposure (in the electives). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) We see one of the chief values of the DCS major\u2014in addition to its extremely lowcost\u2014in its record of attracting some of our most vulnerable students: students of color, students who i dentify in marginalized groups, and those who are first generation college students. Many of them have felt the bruises of social injustice and are keen to help change the world\u2014 their world\u2014for the better. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Department of Diversity & Community Studies, where the DCS major was created, housed, and grown was cut when University College was dismantled . Because our program has been \"unhomed\" and our facult y assigned to different departments, continuing \"as is\" is not possible. It is importan t to note that programs like the DCS major seem to be on the rise across the country among un iversities that are experiencin g growth rather than decline. Arizona State University (ASU) houses a School of Transdisciplinary studies, a plethora of onl ine programs, and boast that they are \"creating the New American University -a place where knowledge informs decisionm aking, research and study transcends academic disciplines, students learn from the world around them, and loc al solutions have global impact (https://schoolofsustainability.as u.edu/about/schoolofsustaina bility/).\" Since 2012, ASU enrollment has experience tremendous grwoth. The same is true for the University of Central Florida . The common denominators are their commitment to intermultitransdisciplinary and their multifaceted delive ry of instruction (online, hybri d, collaboration, face to face, weekend, etc.). While these mode ls may be different from WKU's, it is imperative that we don't sacrifice programs that will lead us to the future. The DCS major is part of the national trend of creating interdi sciplinary programs . Jacobs (2015)1 notes that the number of interdisciplinary college degrees (the merging two or more trad itional degrees) has risen signifi cantly over the last 40 years . This program is cutting edge and very few programs like it exis t, though these types of programs are beginning to show up across the United States. 1 Jacob, W. J. (2015). Interdisciplinary Trends in Higher Educati 15001 . doi: 10.1057/palcomms.2015.1 b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) It is difficult to align national trends with the DCS major bec ause there are very few programs like it in the United States. According to NCES data (linked above) the number of students re ceiving multi/interdisciplinary undergraduate degrees is continually rising. It is also imp ortant to note that in our cu rrent political, economic, ecolog ical, and social environment, jobs are constantly being created to help employers/companies naviga te our changing world. For e xample, it is standard for organizations to have sustainab ility coordinators, diversity of ficers, community organizers, e tc. on there crews. The DCS major trains students for a wide array of jobs and is commonly completed in addition to a se cond major. Also, it is well documented that employers are l ooking for employees who can wor k with diverse population and environments on creating solutions to complex problems. W hile many disciplines are stagn ant or trend downward in terms of enrollment, degrees like this one in the liberal arts/gene ral studies/humanities/multi a nd interdisciplinary fields are increasing steadily. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) We spent 20152018 implementing a fourpoint recruitment plan. The plan included broadcast advertising in print and online, attendance at W KU Admissions events including Head for the Hill, targeted recruitment via classroom presentations and letters of invitation, and increased social media presence. Our numbers have grown from 2 in our first year to 21 last year, a growth of over 100%. While the numbers are small, the g rowth nonetheless shows that as students learn about the major, they are drawn to it. Mar keting the major is important, since it does not fall in the cat egories that students are used to seeing (the disciplines). d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We have no easy predictions for 5 or 10 years down the road. Th e DCS major will move to an as yet undisclosed new departmental July 2019. With DCS faculty likely scattered to di fferent departments and those new home departments wanting to make use of the faculty for internal demands, WKU wi ll face the challenge of supporting nonconforming, innovative, interdisciplinary, and /or progressive programs. Thu s, the biggest impediments to the program are WKU's state budget cuts, the disman tlement of the department, and relocatio n of the faculty. In 5 years or less and with institutional (departmental, colleg e) support with marketing and ad vising, we believe that the DCS major is positioned to grow signif icantly as students learn of its value\u2014its focus on social ju stice, diversity, community, an d its flexibility. Since all but one of its courses are required in other programs, the major is inexpensive to run. These two points\u2014student need and institutional cost\u2014should be recognized as important reasons for supporting the DCS major. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The study of English language an d literature has developed into a range of complementary fields, and we have recently revised our program's core from a traditional focus on literary studies, especially British/A merican writers, to courses reflective of the changing field of English. Students now take, as part of the core, courses in TESL (Teachin g English as a Second Language), literature and college composition pedagogy, and an updated \"research tool\" course focused on literary/cultural theory & research methods. Students also take a dedicated writing course and one in literature. The program changes address the changing demands of the job market for grad uate students in English. Re cent graduates have been admitted to PhD programs, earned the terminal degree, and then gained employment at 4year universities\u2014the traditional path\u2014but some of our graduates s eek employment at 2year colleg es after they earn the MA degree. The training in composition pedagogy, the teachi ng of literature, and the basic s of TESL enhance our graduates' instruction at various levels: high school, community colleges, 4year universities and teachi ng English to nonna tive English speaker s in the USA and abroad. Most courses are facetoface (we offer a few online co urses), are writing intensive, and utilize a seminar format which fosters effective anal ysis and oral communication.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Our MA program contributes to WK U's mission in several ways. Fo remost, the proper use of ed ucation, as Wendell Berry argues in his essay \"T houghts in the Prese nce of Fear,\" is to \" enable citizens to live lives tha t are economically, politicall y, socially, and culturally respon sible.\" A wellread, broadly edu cated citizenry is good for our democracy and economy. Our program contributes to this missio n by 1) graduating students w ho are sharper at wr iting, analysis, and t eaching than they were when they entered the program and 2) our graduate students staff the WKU Writing Ce nter, which serves our undergraduate students with writing instruction, and they teach Introduction to College Writing in the second year of their program\u2014a very important respon sibility, as they have much face toface interaction with u ndergraduates. Our MA English students teach 44 students per se mester in two composition cour ses their second year\u2014adding up to 88 students for the year for each of our 7 MA students\u2014thus, our 7 graduate teachin g assistants instruct over 6 00 WKU undergra duates each year in exchange for a modest stipend and less than \u00bd tuition r emission. This is an economic boon for WKU, and it also enhances student retention to have motivated, smart, enthusiast ic teachers interacting with W KU's firstyear students. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) MA and MFA students interact with undergraduate students in 400 G courses in which graduat e students get teaching experience by modera ting discussions and by taking leadership r oles in projects. The MA in English and MFA in Creative Writing are complementary programs, as these students work toge ther in the Writing Center and take courses with each other. Combined, these teachers cholars in training instruct ov er 1,100 firstyear WKU students each year. In 201718, our GTAs in the MA program tutored in the WKU Writing Center for 19 50 hours as part of their assistantships; that is the equivalent of $23,400 worth of labor ($12/hour is the MA summer tutoring rate). 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 OneYear Persistence Rates 9 88.9% 4 100% 3.60(N=5) 4.39 (N=6) 2.56 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The following learning outcomes are assessed with written and o ral examinations: Students should Articulate an instructional philosophy of composition. Understand a variety of pedagogical approaches and articulate a historically and theoretic ally informed philosophy for teaching literature to develop syllabi, lesson plans, and a ssignments for effective literature courses. Understand research methods and theoretical approaches of schol arship in English languag e and literary studies. Understand the theoretical base s of adult and child secondlang uage acquisition, in addi tion to the pedagogical practices that best serve English language learners. These learning outcomes are rece nt revisions of former learning outcomes based on our former, traditional literarybased MA degree program. Assessment of 20142016 graduates revealed a solid level of desired sk ills in British and American literary study and also a desire of some students for a broader English education, especially the desire to study rhetoric and composition or TESL in more depth. We have revised the program accordingly, shifting the emph asis away from literary study for the core and allowing student s more choice in their electiv es. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The English Depar tment stays in regular c ontact with our gradua tes. We ask alumni to complete a survey on our web site to track their career work and gather feedback about our programs. We regularly invite alumni to return to campus to make presentations in our Introduction to Graduate Studies course to make current students aware of career preparation strategies and job prospects. We have also produced MA alumni profiles so graduates can explain the benefits of our programs to our constituents. Recently, our director of gradua te studies contacted recent graduates to add testimonials about our programs. According to the Postsecondary Feedback Report (PSFR) produced by the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCEWS), 29 WKU English MA gradua tes had employment in Kentucky three years after graduation (FY 1416). The data does not clarify specific f ields of study. We have no har d data on jobs acquired out of state. As part of the administrative t rend towards centralization, WKU should create a central clear inghouse to collect employment data across all programs to as sist departments with this labor intensive process. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In 2015 we polled our students to measure their satisfaction wi th the program and to suggest beneficial changes, and that feedback was instrumental in our new program design: shifting t he focus from a tradit ional English curricu lum of British and American literature to better a lign with trends in English stud ies and the demands of the mark et, as noted elsewhere in this document. We also plan to contact PhD programs where our gradua te students land so we may gain insight into how well prepared they are for the rigors of PhD study. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100words) Recent graduates' successes incl ude: admission to fullyfunded PhD programs in English at U Cincinnati and U Wisconsin Milwaukee; teaching high school English in Brecki nridge Co.; te aching English at Colora do Early Colleges; serving as literary outreach coordinator for WKU libra ries and organizer of the Sou thern Kentucky Book Festival; and employment at Data Concepts Inc. as an editor/technical writer for business and do cument development. Several recent graduates who are high school teachers earned Rank I/II with the MA. Another graduate earned a Fulbright English Tea ching Assistant honor at the University of Osijek, Croatia, i n 20152016, and then was emplo yed at Bowling Green High School in 20162018. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Faculty 1.25 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH* $290* $128 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 360 371 351 367 353 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 55.6% 54.2% 58.7% 60.0% 63.7% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 8 9 8 8 7 8 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level** 58.3% 63.6% 66.7% 81.3% 62.5% 58.2% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Over the past five years, the department has earned $225,655 th rough DELO (average of $45,131). We have supplemented professional development, update d classrooms, equipped computer labs, purchased projectors, funded student recruitment activities, and supported student travel. We have also generat ed over $28,500 through the WKU Foundation (average of $5700/year) to support faculty development, student travel, awa rds, etc. In 2016, we replaced the CLEP Literature Exam with an English 200 Departmen tal Exam. While the exam was created t o provide a better measure of students' achievement of learning outcomes in English 200 , over three years, it has also generated over $8600 (avera ge $2850/year) to support professional development. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) *To estimate costs, we combined SCHP for the MA program and the TESL Certificate since coursework supporting the programs is basically the same, w ith the number of credit hours for each program being the primary difference. **We disagree with data for med ian class size and underenrolle d sections because combined graduate and undergraduate courses don't appear to have been considered and WKU had been o perating at a significantly lower graduate course cap before the new number was retroactively put into place. As of FY 2020, the dep artment will be down four faculty who reg ularly contribute to the the MA program. The MA program provides significant efficiencies for our MFA pr ogram because MFA students complete a secondary concentration, which is mostly c omprised of courses from our MA program. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) We cultivate \"productive, engage d, and socially responsible cit izenleaders of a global society \" through rigorous training in critical thinking, problem solving, and effective engagement wi th others in seminar courses (Our Students, 5.12 and Our Community, 1.4). People who read and write well and understand rhetorical strategies and the theoretical tools of literary studies tend to be broadminded citizens with enhanced capacity for empathy. Our GTA training program \"supports innovative pedagogy and instruct ion and offers professional dev elopment and pedagogical tra ining\" (Our H ill). Our MA English graduates \"pro vide opportunities fo r people of the regi on to be educated, entertained, assisted, and inspired outside the classroom\"for example, one graduate enhances the lives of hundreds of people attending the SOKY Bookfest each spring, and a current student orchestrated a Young Adult Litera ture conference at WKU (Our Co mmunity 4.12). We \"promote and exemplify values that ensu re diversity, equality, and inclu sion for all citizens\"\u2014a habit built into our literary and lang uage studies DNA, which is especially true of cultural studies that provides a theoretical backbon e to many English courses (Our Community, 4.0). While doing so, we are \"improving the quality of life regionally\" by cultivating a thoughtful, wellread citizenry better prepared to live lives that are economically, politically, socially and culturally responsible. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) In our TESL and literature course s particularly, \"we increase c ultural competence among students so that everyone is welcomed, valued, supported, and accommodated\" (Str onger by Degrees, Objective 8.1). Such values are part of teaching English as a second lang uage, where one must be sensit ive to the language needs and cultural nuances of non native speakers, and also a sof t skill cultivated in courses in literary theory where students learn a variety of \"ways of seeing\"\u2014interpretative strategie s like feminist, Marxist, psych disability studies; gender studies; historical criti cism; and more. Our MA degrees eekers learn these soft skills a nd pass the knowledge on to the WKU undergrads they teach in Introduction to College Writing. S uch trickledown ethics make a more enlightened, compassionate citizenry. Furtherm ore, we \"promote the use of au thentic assessments to evaluate student learning and provide data to inform pedagog y, assignment design, and curricu lum review\" with our written and oral examinations based on students' core course work (S tronger by Degrees, Objective 8 .1). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Our MA alumni profiles show that graduates contribute to the workforce in many profes sions. According to the The Lane Report, \"employability skills\" tied to com munication, teamwork, proble msolving, analysis, and interpersonal relations and \"knowing how to learn\" are value d as highly as \"academic skills \"; with an emphasis on reading and writing, developing empathy through literary study, an abun dance of group activities, lite rary and rhetorical analysis assignments, and research projects, our students acquire t hese highvalue skills. Litera ry study stimulates creativity , another skill valu ed by employers. The 2017 revisions to our graduate program reflect our efforts to make our students more workforce ready. When we consider the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforc e Statistics (KCEWS) sectio n on Future Employment Demand, there appear to be over 30,000 jobs on the horizon for which our MA students could compete. Since 2014, six of our MA student s who are fulltime high schoo l teachers have earned Rank I or II with our MA degree; four more students are near completio n and will soon advance in rank . Four of our post2014 graduates are teaching parttime at regio nal community colleges and at WKU. Several others are teaching fulltime at Kentucky high schools (two in Breckinridg e Co., one in Hopkins Co, two in Hart Co.). d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Compared to two other regional MA offerings in English at Murra y State and EKU, our MA degree in English is distinctive for the pragmatism of the core courses geared towards making our gr aduates wellrounded teachers at various levels. Murray State's MA English core requires 12 hours of British and Americ an literature and a research methods course\u2014the same curriculum we offered in our \"old\" program. That is a tradition al English curriculum. Our new p rogram, effective fall 2017, requires a course in literature and pedagogy\u2014an innovative offe ring since few graduate programs, even at the PhD level, offer a dedicated course in the teaching of literature. Additio nally, we require a f undamentals of teachin g English as a secon d language course, Integrated TESL, with SLOs such as \"learning a bout the cognitive, social, an d emotional issues associated with bilingualism\" and \"learning methods and materials used to teach ESL\" (English as a Second Language). Our program requires 33 credits, while the comparable programs require 30 h ours. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) As noted already, we recently re vised our progra m with a goal o f enhancing student employment by shifting the focus from a traditional study of B ritish and American literature to pragmat ic skills of teaching English to nonnative speakers and qualit y literature instruction. Because o ur new program allows more fle xibility of choice in electiv es, students ca n choose from courses in Writing and Technology \u2014a growing trend in English st udies\u2014and the popular, useful blended course (undergraduates and graduates) E diting and Publishing. A probab le growth area is TESL. In the current English 5 66: Teaching and Testing ESL Grammar course, of the 10 enrolle d students, 6 are from programs (like Secondary Education) outside of the English Department. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) According to the most recent national data, the annual number o f students earning MAs in E nglish declined b y about 8% from academic years 201314 to 201516 (NCES). While the WKU m edian for MA program conferra ls decreased by 9% in that period, the number o f MA conferrals in Eng lish decreased by 54% . We do not have national numbers to compare conferrals from 201516 to 201718 (the CAP E review range); however, the W KU median for program conferrals increased by 5% while English conferrals were flat. One way to explain our dramatic decline is the addition of the MFA program. Considering the total number of conferrals in our programs, they would be flat from 201314 to 201718. In a ddition, one of our markets eroded when the state stopped re quiring high school teachers to earn MA degrees to earn rank certification. Another cause is the rise of cheap, l owquality, onlineon ly MA degrees in ou r region (i.e., U Cumb erlands). We also be lieve that our fundi ng package (which is not competitiv e nationally or regionally) has made it very difficult to compete. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) As noted before, we have built our MFA program to complement th e MA program and create scheduling efficiencies. We also revised our program (see 1A) for more of a generalist audience, to give students more options for electives, and to make our students more employable. In 2018, we instituted a twoyear course rotation to help stude nts plan for course offerings (semesters, days, and times). The department contacted affiliated programs to address scheduling conflicts that had occurred in the past to prevent future conflicts. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The English Departmen t has a solid cohort of graduate students in the MA and MFA programs. The MFA program is young (initiated fall 2015), and in three years, graduates have publi shed in prestigious national v enues, gained admission into quality PhD programs, and earned collegelevel teaching positio ns. The MFA program has brought diversity to WKU, especially geographical variety, bringing studen ts from Texas, Russia, California, and Arizona. W hile the high quality of our instruction that also allows stude nts to study in a noncreativ e writing area like TESL or comp osition is the primary reason f or student success, the attractive financial package offered to MF A students has a signif icant impact. MFAs receive full tuition plus a competitive stipend for t he twocalendaryear program. T he MA program has seen a corresponding decline in enrollment, since we no longer offer a creative writing focus i n the MA, but overall our number of graduate students has remained stable. We could grow our MA program by offering compe titive funding for graduate assistants. The current funding budget pays for less than \u00bd of graduate student tuition . Recently, potential MA students have chosen other schools because our MA funding is not competitive. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The English major prepares student s to be productive citizens b y developing strong writing, research, and critical thinking skills throughout its curriculum. The major allows students to specialize in concentrations de voted to literature, creative writing, or professional writing, with many stude nts opting to take courses in more than one of these areas. All concentrations require 42 semest er hours, with 27 hours in the core and 15 hours in a concentration. Students must take a course introducing them to the m ajor course (299), three litera ture courses (385 and either 381 and 392 OR 382 and 391), a language course (204), two writing courses (203, 306, 307, 401, or 410) AND (212, 301, or 412), and a capstone course (413, 414, or 416, depending on their concentration). A minor o r second major is required. English students are prepared to communicate, interpret, create , and research in multiple g enres and through multiple platforms, with the flexibility to apply these skills to the di verse circumstances required in today's professional environmen t. The nature of the material covered in this curriculum, includin g studying literary works by authors from highly diverse backgrounds from around the globe, ensures that our students wi ll be engaged and soc ially responsible.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The English major contributes to several programs across campus . English faculty teach cours es required or elective for majors including English for Secondary Teach ing, Computer Scien ce (ENG 307 required), Architectural Science, Theater, Film, Popular Culture, Accounting, Management, the GFCB Advanced Prof essionalism Certificate, Middl e School Edu cation and Language Arts, K12 En glish as a Second Lan guage, Foreign Langu age Education, and Diversity and Community Studies. In fall 2018, the English major offered at least 17 sections of upperd ivision courses serving these majors. The department also serves double majors and minors in a divers ity of fields. There are an av erage of 52 doublemajors in English each year in areas such a s Chinese, Psych ology, and His tory and our numerous English minors (125 i n AY 201819) have majors in fields like Film , Journalism, Diversity and Comm unity Studies, and International Affairs. English faculty regularly work wi th students in other majors, s erving as readers for capstone projects in Honors, supervising independent studies outside of the major, and teaching a capsto ne course in another major (PO P 482). English faculty have served Honors students in Film, Th eater, Accounting, Finance, B usiness, Elementary Educatio n, Anthropology, Philosophy, Religious Studies, and Math, and they have mentored research pr ojects for students in Psychology, History, Health and Human Services (HCA majors), Busin ess, PreDentistry, and Film. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Undergraduate English faculty int eract closely with graduate pr ograms in English by offe ring 400/G courses with undergraduate and graduate students - there were 15 such course s in 201718. Students in o ther programs, such as Educational Leadership, take our master'slevel TESOL courses. English faculty have served o n MA thesis committees for other departments, such as History. Undergraduate English majors work in the Writing Center to assi st all WKU students. On average , 8 majors and 1 nonEnglish major work 9 hours/week every semester. English faculty teach study abroa d courses through KIIS, CCSA, and WKU Facultyled programs, averaging four such courses annually. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Learning Outcomes fo r the English Major: 1. Understand explicitly the development and use of spoken and wri tten language [LANGUAGE] 2. Analyze, interpret, and critical ly discuss a diverse variety of texts [CLOSE READING] 3. Analyze argumentative and persuasive techniques in a variety of genres [RHETORIC] 4. Compose successfully in multiple genres, media, and formats [WR ITING] 5.

Convey the core values and compe tencies of the d iscipline of En glish to wider audiences [COMMUNICATION] 9. Participate in extracurricular activities and show awareness o f educational and professi onal opportunities after graduation [PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT] Each academic year, the department's Program Assessment Committ ee, in consultation with the faculty, selects one SLO for particular attention and assessmen t (in 20172018 it was Close Reading), while each concen tration within the major (literature, creative writing, and professional writing) assess es a second SLO. Faculty evaluate writing and other material gathered from students produced in Capstone courses for each co ncentration, and results are shared to the entire department. A significant portion of the annual departmental re treat is devoted to discussing a ssessment results and closing the loop. One finding from recent assessment that was used to improve the program was that students were not performing as well as we would like in incorporating digital media into their written work. In response, the department created a new course, ENG 212 (Intro to Digital Texts and Media), developed largely throu gh a course proposal by student s in the Professional Writing capstone course. Assessment of SLO #2 led the department to cre ate a Close Reading resource/d iscussion link on Blackboard available to all facu lty and applied dire ctly in English classr ooms. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The English Depar tment stays in regular c ontact with our gradua tes. We ask alumni to complet e a survey on our web site to track their career work and gather feedback about our programs. We regularly invite alumni to return to campus to make presentations in our introduction to the major and capstone cla sses to help make current students aware of career preparation strategies and job prospects. We have also produce d 60 alumni profiles so graduates can explain the benefits of our programs to our constituents . Recently, we formed a Profes sional Writing Club sponsored by Kirkpatrick Price which gives students an opp ortunity to learn ab out job acquisition st rategies; we consider the information gleaned through these processes as we revise our programs. According to the Postsecondary Feedback Report (PSFR) produced by the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCEWS), 1 46 WKU English majors had employment in Ke ntucky three years after graduation (FY 1416). The data does not clarify specific fields of study. We have no hard dat a on jobs acquired out of state. As part of the administrative t rend towards centralization, WKU should create a central clearinghouse to collect employment data across all programs to as sist departments with this labor intensive process. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) From 20142017, we addressed three central recommendations from the Association of Departments of English in our revised curriculum: \"addition of topics courses, development of courses related to students' employment concerns, and a restructuring that increased cu rricular cohesiveness.\" We adde d flexibility in the curriculum and emphasized close reading, careful writing, and analytica l thinking, all skills sought by employers ( \"Top Skills\" ). While the department plans to survey employers in the future, w e have gathered helpful information from employers who have actively hired our majors. KirkpatrickPrice , a company that employs seven B As in English from WKU, has bee n impressed by our graduates' technical kn owledge and writing skills but fe lt that their interview skills were comparatively weak. In response, the professional writin g capstone cours e now requires practice interviews through the WKU CCPD; our other capstones are exploring similar opportunities. KirkpatrickPrice has reported that English stu dents now arrive much more prepared than competitors they i nterview and are more comfortab le in the interview environment. In Introduction to English Studies and capstones we provide stu dents data on professional oppo rtunities for English majors from the US Bureau of Labor Stat istics and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as we ll as qualitative analysis of opportunities for majors from sources such as Forbes, Business Insider , and Inside Higher Education . e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Since 2015, eight English students have earned Fulbright scholarships (twelve since 2002). Recent graduates have been accepted into top graduate schools, such as Auburn U, U Birming ham (UK), U Cincinnati, George Mason U, U Iowa, U Kansas, U Kentucky, U Louisville, U of Maryland, U Memphis, U Mississip pi, New York U, U Notre Dame, Ohio U, U of Roehampton (UK), U Southern California, and Texas A&M U. Recent students have landed nationally competi tive internships at places such as Harper Collins Publishing, the Environmental Law Intern ship, and the Archipelagos Insti tute of Marine Conservation. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty .5 4 Cost per SCH* $129 $128 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 360 371 351 367 353 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 55.6% 54.2% 58.7% 60.0% 63.7% 75.8% Median Class Size by Level 20 21 21 21 21 19 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level** 11.7% 9.3% 12.1% 10.3% 14.2% 36.8% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Over the past five years, we hav e earned $225,6 55 through DELO (average of $45,131) . We have supplemented professional development, updated classrooms, equipped computer labs, purcha sed projectors, funded stude nt recruitment activities, and supported student travel. Over the past five years, we hav e generated over $28,500 through the WKU Foundation (average of $5700/year) to support faculty development, student travel, awards, etc. In 2016, we replaced the CLEP Literature Exam with an English 2 00 Departmental Exam. While t he exam was created to provide a better measure of students' achievement of learni ng outcomes in E nglish 200, over three years, it has also generated over $8600 (average $2850/year) to s upport professional development in the departme nt. We recently inaugurated a Profe ssional Writing Club that is spo nsored by KirkpatrickPrice , a local technology auditing firm. Many of our students la nd jobs with KP after graduation, and th e company has a vested interest in providing financial support to help us prepare students for employment there. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) *To estimate costs, we combined SCHP for English & EST majors a nd all five minors since c oursework supporting the programs is basically the same, w ith # of credit hours for each program being the primary di fference. Overall department Cost/SCH: $92. **We believe % underenenrolled courses is lower than data indi cate and that some combined courses (HEEC and ITV) are ernouneously counted. By FY 2020, the depart ment will be down eight FTE due to depart ures/retirements; also only 4 of 11 of our NTE lines from FY 18 are continuing. Departmental operating costs ($7 6,103 for FY1418) are remarkab ly low considering that we st aff three Colonnade courses on top of eleven major/minor/certificate programs. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The English major prepares student s to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizen leaders by developing strong writing, research, and critical thinking skills throughout its curriculum (\"Our Students\" Goal 5.12). English majors take a co re of classes that emphasize oral a nd written communication, caref ul and critical reading of texts, and analytical research skill s (see 3b). The English major featu res a robust internship progra m (\"Our Community\" Goal 4.14), offers several study abroad courses, and has run an undergraduate student research conference for nearly two decades (\"Our Students\" Goals 4.11 & 5.12). Faculty in th e English Department engage in innovative p edagogy through offering classes on multiple platforms (face toface, IVS, online), through faculty development groups (on t opics such as close re ading and diversity), and by mentoring students who participate in depar tmental conferences, REACH wee k, C/ET projects, FUSE grants, and RCAPs (\"Our Hill\" Goals 3.10 & 3.11). The department's advisors work with majors to ens ure steady and successful progress toward graduation (\"Our Students\" Goal 3.8). The departm ent brings in alumni guest spea kers to classes and clubs and m aintains a database of alumni profiles on our webpage (\"Our Community\" goals 6.18 & 6.19) Eng lish students are prepared t o apply their skills to the diverse circumstances required in today's professional environm ent (\"Our Community\" Goal 1.4). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The English major prepares student s to create and apply new kno wledge and excel in a glo bal economy and culture in several ways. Emphasis on cultu ral competence and empathy (s trategy 1.1) is built into the very nature of the English curriculum, such as the requirement to study literary works by authors from diverse backgroun ds and nations. The English department conducts authentic assessment (strategy 8.1) of SLOs and uses results to improve individual assignments (i.e., close reading) and the entire c urriculum (revised 2016-see 3b a lopment (strategy 8.2-see 5a) and has given particular attention to career development (strat egy 9.1) in Introduction to English Studies and capstone courses (see 3c and 3d). The int ernship program places 1012 st udents in competitive professional internsh ips each semester, while courses such as ENG 402 and ENG 414 require students to c omplete client projects with a rea businesses and services (strategy 9.3). The major promot es undergraduate research (stra tegy 10.4) through departmental conferences and publications (see 5d) and also p romotes student success and pro fessional development through the Writing Center, staffed by English Department graduate and undergraduate students. The Writing Center conducts ove r 2000 tutoring sessions a year, contributing to significant learning for both the tutors and clients. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Our 60 alumni profiles and English Careers Web Page show that English gradu ates contribute to t he workforce in man y professions. According to the Lane Report , \"employability skills\" tied to co mmunication, teamwork, proble msolving, analysis, and interpersonal relations and \"knowing how to learn\" are valu ed as highly as \"academic skills\"; with an emphasis on reading and writing, developing empathy through literary study, an abund ance of group activities, lite rary and rhetorical analysis assignments, and resear ch projects, our students acqui re these highvalue skills. Creat ive writing and literary stud y stimulate creativity , another skill valued by employ ers. Required Introduction to English Studies and capstone courses inform students about local and national employment trends (see 3d) an d require students to build resumes and other materials targeted to professional opportunities. The Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCE WS) section on Future Employment Demand suggests that there are over 30,000 jobs on the horizon for which our majors could compete. Nationally, Me lissa Korn notes that English majors are more likely to land jobs requiring college degrees t han are majors in business, b iomedical sciences, homeland security, and law enforcement (WSJ). For more on the increasing value of the English major, see \"Hot Jobs,\" \"28 High Paying Jobs\" and \"Employers Want Liberal Arts Grads .\" d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The WKU English major offers seve ral distinct features. Its cur riculum combines several core co urses and allows students to select specialized classes in one of three concen trations. Outs ide of the classroom it offers numerous opportunities for students to present their academic work and enhance their profe ssional credentials: a departmen tal scholarly conference (15 students each year); formal and \"open mic\" readings for creativ e writing students (30 students); The Student Research Conference (10 students); The Si gma Tau Delta (E nglish Honors S ociety) national conference (7 students have won awards in the past five years). The depart ment publishes two peerreviewe d journals for undergraduate writing: The Ashen Egg (scholarly work) and Zephyrus (creative writing). It offers p rograms for its students in bot h Study Away and Study Abroad, including a longstanding partnership with Harlaxton College. I t has an active internship program, offering around a dozen opportunities each semester. In 2017, our faculty began a regular dialogue about integrating more diversity in our courses that has yielded a set of pedagogies, teaching strategies, and book group to improve our practices. Our department has worked hard to serve students at regional campuses by offering ENG100, 200, and 300 at Glasgow and regularly beaming a number of courses to all campuses. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The program has an active speake r's bureau that sends faculty t o area high schools, hosts several public readings/lectures, and sponsors essay contests for high school students who come t o campus. Faculty regularly present lectures on campus, introduce film screenings, and pa rticipate in other campuswide activities. For the larger pu blic and scholarly community, th e English program hosts the Cente r for Robert Penn Warren Studies , which publishes a peerreviewed academic journal (hosted by TopScholar), hosts th e annual Warren Circle conferen ce (attracting national and international scholars), and presents the BrooksWarren award for the best book of literary criticism (with the winner invited to give a public lecture at WKU). 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Both quantitative and qualitative evidence show that the demand for skills that are at the co re of the English major is increasing (see data and links in 3d and 5c). To ensure that we reach as many students as po ssible and make them aware of this emerging trend, the English Department has implemented a t horough and consistent recrui tment strategy that will be followed by all stakeholders. Th is strategy encompasses persona l contact with prospective students and majors (recruitment events, our high school speakers bureau , high school essay contests that bring students to camp us), creative use of social media (Facebook, Instagram, acti vely updated web page, video), and making Cherry Hall an attr active space that will draw prospective and current students to the major (bulletin boards highlighting opportunities in En glish, fun and creative display s, \"bling\" like buttons an d stickers). The department is also maki ng more systematic use of th e Admissions' CRM system to market the major to interested students, to students with 27+ A CT English scores/AP E nglish background, and to track better what strategies have worked. We have also created a convenient web interface for all facult y to provide information on students with whom they interact so that the department can sen d recruitment material. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) According to the most recent national data, the annual number o f students earning BAs in English declin ed by 15.2% from academic years 201314 to 201516 (NCES). During the same peri od, while the WKU median for program conferrals decreased by 5%, the number of BA conferrals in English increas ed by 32.6%. We do not have national numbers to compare conferrals from 201314 to 201718 (the CAPE review range); how ever, the WKU median for pro gram conferrals increased by 10% while English conferrals were flat. In light of the nation al trends and the over all enrollment declines at WKU, we feel relatively good about trends of conferrals for the English majo r. However, as we note in 6c, we have not been complacent and have made efforts to increase enrollments and conferrals by making curricular, structural, and marketing changes. As noted in 5c, we make students aware of local and national em ployment data and trends (see 3d) as well as require students to build resumes, cover letters, other materials targe ted to appropriate professional opportunities. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) From 20142017, the department revised our curricula to create more coherence within the major and to provide more flexibility for students in all co ncentrations. We formulated g oals based on the positive wo rk we were already doing and created learning outcomes to help all English majors be even mo re successful after graduation, not just on the job market, but as human beings. In 2018, we instituted a twoyear course rotation to help stude nts plan for course offerings (s emesters, days of the week, and often times of day). The departm ent contacted affiliated progra ms to address scheduling conflicts that had occurred in the past to prevent fu ture conflicts. Since fall of 2015, we have devel oped a comprehensive recruitme nt plan which includes a redesign of our web site, addition of a Why English? Page, and 60 alumni profiles ; creation of a video to laud our programs; increased social media presence on Facebook and Twitter; oldschool marketing with bulle tin and sandwich boards and fl yers for each program; expanded outreach to high schools with a speakers bureau and essay contest; development o f electronic recruitment with WKU's content relationship manag ement system; an expanded department visit system for prospective students; and better tracking of interactions to dete rmine effective recruitment str ategies. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We are confident, given local and national trends, that the Eng lish major will experience moderat e growth during this time. To maximize this growth and to i ncrease the quality of our prog ram, the major will ensure that ou r courses are taught by full time faculty with expertise in their areas and that faculty wil l remain active in professional development and scholarly/creative work. To ensu re this, WKU needs to commit to fill faculty lines and provi de adequate monetary and logistical support for faculty development and scholarly/creati ve activity. The major will also nurture and promote the qualit y and quantity of student success, which we feel is the greatest strength of our program. We will continue to increase and promote opportunities for student s to succeed within and beyond the classroom through the initiatives mentioned in this document, especially in sections 5 and 6. Our students' success in national scholarships, s tudy abroad, internships, publications, and research will continue to generate attention to our department, and we will rely on the institution to continue to support and nurture such opportunities especially i n the Humanities. But more t han that, these \"gold star\" accomplishments will provide the foundation and incentive for u s to make every single student's experience in the English major positive, productive, and enriching. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The EST major leads to state cer tification for teaching grades 812. In addition to Colonnade courses and core courses for English majors, student s complete 21 hours of restricted electi ves and 34 hours of professional education courses, including 2 semesters of clinical studies a nd a semester of student teachin g. A 2.75 GPA, both overall and in professional education and other major courses, is requir ed for admission in to the teacher education program. All major coursework is offered faceto face with several courses also available online (ENG 204, 301, and 401). No second major or minor is required; however, students often choose a second ma jor in literature or a TESOL m inor because they bring a competitive advantage for employment. The major emphasizes well as content knowledge acr oss the areas of literatur e, allied language arts, and linguistics. Restricted electiv es allow for flexibility and cu stomization yet are clustered to ensure breadth of knowledge. O ne course in diversity literature is required. Courses in the maj or are writing intensive, requiri ng timeconsuming feedback and oneonone conferencing. Course requirements focus on presentat ion and performance skills, par ticularly in ENG 410 and 476, literature and composition pedagogy, to support students i n their intensive clinical sem esters. EST majors currently enjoy excellent job placement rates. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) English and EST faculty teach courses that are required or elec tive for majors including Co mputer Science (ENG 307 is required in that major), Architectural Science, Theater, Film, Popular Culture, Accounting, Management, the Advanced Professionalism Certificate in GF CB, Middle School Education an d Language Arts, K12 English a s a Second Language, Foreign Language Education, and Diversity and Community Studies. In the fall of 2018 the Eng lish major offered at l east 17 sections of upperdivision courses that served these other majors. Since fall 2013, an average of 15 EST majors have carried double majors in other areas, most fre quently in literature but also i n 12 other areas, with Social St udies, Spanish, and History bei ng top choices and including Chinese, Computer Information Technol ogy, and Marketing in 2018. English faculty regularly work wi th students in Honors, study a broad, and independent studies. We also interact closely with the MA and MFA programs in English by offering 400/G courses wi th a mix of undergraduate and graduate students - there were 15 such courses in AY 201718. Students in other programs such as Educational Leadership take courses in our master's level TESOL courses. Students in Educational Leadership take E NG 597 as well. EST faculty serve on the university Professional Education Committee. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Through the Writing Project summer institute and outreach p rograms housed in the English d epartment, EST faculty contribute to the professional de velopment of teachers in the G reen River district42 school d istricts across south central Kentucky. EST faculty also frequently partner with School of T eacher Education faculty in pr ogram development, including creating the WKU clinical teacher preparation program in 2012 and revising STE's core curriculum in fall 2018. The EST major contributes to the university m ission by providing citizen lead ers to teach literacy and comm unication skills the work force needs in a complex world. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Learning Outcomes for EST Majors: 1. Understand explicitly the development and use of spoken and wri tten language [LANGUAGE] 2. Analyze, interpret, and critical ly discuss a diverse variety of texts [CLOSE READING] 3. Analyze argumentative and persuasive techniques in a variety of genres [RHETORIC] 4. Compose successfully in multiple genres, media, and formats [WR ITING] 5. Demonstrate a strong understanding of the history and developme nt of literature in the En glish language in a global context [LITERATURE] 6. Analyze a diverse variety of tex ts through multiple theories an d histories [THEORY] 7. Conduct academic research and document it appropriately [RESEAR CH] 8. Convey the core values and compe tencies of the d iscipline of En glish to wider audiences [COMMUNICATION] 9. Participate in extracurricular activities and show awareness o f educational and professi onal opportunities after graduation [PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT] Each year the department's Program Assessment Committee selects one SLO for particular attention and assessment, while each concentration within the major assesses a second SLO. Asse ssment is carried out through e valuating writing and other material gathered from students produced in Capstone courses fo r each concentration, and resu lts are shared to the entire department during our annual re treat to discuss assessment resu lts and closin g the loop. One finding from recent assessment was used to improve the prog ram was that students needed to improve on incorporating digital media into their written work. In respons e, the department created a new course, ENG 212 (Intro to Digital Texts and Media), developed largely through a course pr oposal by students in the Pro fessional Writing capstone course. Assessment of SLO #2 led the department to create a Clo se Reading resource/discussion link on Blackboard available to all faculty and applied di rectly in English classrooms. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The English Depar tment stays in regular c ontact with our gradua tes. We ask alumni to complete a survey on our web site to track their career work and gather feedback about our programs. We regularly invite alumni to return to campus to make presentations in our introduction to the major and capstone cla sses to help make current students aware of career preparation strategies and job prospects. We have also produce d 60 alumni profiles so graduates can explain the benefits of our programs to our constituents. According to the Postsecondary Feedback Report (PSFR) produced by the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCEWS), 1 46 WKU English majors had employment in Ke ntucky three years after graduation (FY 1416). The data does not clarify specific fields of study. We have no hard dat a on jobs acquired out of state. To the best of our EST adviso rs' knowledge, all of our majors who wish to become secondary Engli sh teachers have found employment. As part of the administrative t rend towards centralization, WKU should create a central clear inghouse to collect employment data across all programs to as sist departments with this labor intensive process. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) From 20142017, we addressed three recommendations from the Association of Departments of English in our revised curriculum: \"the addition of topics courses, the development of courses related to students' employment concerns, and a restructuring that increased cu rricular cohesiveness.\" We adde d flexibility in the curriculum to emphasize close reading, careful writing, and analytica l thinking, all skills that emplo yers seek from effective employees ( \"Top Skills\" ). In developing the Clinical Exper iences in the Practice of Teach ing program for EST majors in 2012, faculty from Education and English worked with adm inistrators and faculty from Bowling Gre en and Warren County to develop curriculum to enhance English and social studies teacher preparation. E ST faculty co taught CEPT classes in 2012 2014, revising the curriculum based on our initial launch and taking into consideration feedb ack from faculty at our two partner high schools. The CEPT program is in its sixth year wi th high levels of approval from students and faculty. In Introduction to English Studies and capstone courses, we pro vide students national data on p rofessional opportunities for English and EST majors from the U nited States Bur eau of Labor S tatistics and the American Aca demy of Arts and Sciences as well as qualitative analysis of opportunities for English degre es from sources such as Forbes and Business Insider. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Since 2015, eight English students have earned Fulbright scholarships (twelve since 2002). Recent graduates have been accepted into top graduate schoo ls such as U Birmingham (UK), U Cincinnati, George Mason U, U Iowa, U Kansas, U Kentucky, U Louisville, U Memphis, U Mississi ppi, New York U, U Notre Dam e, U Southern California, and Texas A&M U. A number of recent students have landed nati onally competitive internships at places such as Harp er Collins Publishing, Through its summer education prog rams, the Writing Project deve lops teacher leaders for the region, who currently hold positions as principals, assistan t principals, and education ef fectiveness coaches. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Over the past five years, the department has earned $225,655 th rough DELO (average $45,131). We have supplemented professional development, update d classrooms, equipped computer labs, purchased projectors, funded student recruitment activities, and supported student travel. Over the past five y ears, we have generated over $28,500 through the WKU Foundation (average $5700/year) to support faculty development, student travel, awards, etc. In 2016, we replaced the CLEP Literature Exam with an English 2 00 Departmental Exam. While t he exam was created to provide a better measure of students' achievement of learni ng outcomes in E nglish 200, over three years, it has also generated over $8600 (average $2850/year) to suppor t departmental professional development. Between 2013 and 2017, the WKU Writing Project received $162,40 0 in grants from the Kentucky Department of Education, $35,000 from the National Writing Project, and $26,800 in suppo rting funds from PCAL. Despite significant changes in funding streams, we have maintained/adapted WP programs as we l ook for new sources of funding. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) *To estimate costs, we combined SCHP for English & EST majors a nd all five minors since c oursework supporting the programs is basically the same, w ith # of credit hours for each program being the primary difference. Overall department Cost/SCH: $92. **We believe % underenrolled co urses is lower than data indica te and that some combined courses (HEEC and ITV) are erroneously counted. By FY 2020, the depart ment will be down eight FTE due to depart ures/retirements; also only 4 of 11 of our NTE lines from FY 18 are continuing. Departmental operating costs ($7 6,103 for FY1418) are remarkab ly low considering that we st aff three Colonnade courses on top of eleven major/minor/certificate programs. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) EST students' CEPTClinical Exper iences in the Practice of Tea ching\u2014curriculum, developed in 2012, incorporates high impact practices (5.12, p. 7, 3.11, p. 10) based on research in teacher preparat ion. The program combines offcampus and oncampus educational opportunities (4.11, p. 7). Required upperlevel EST classes are scheduled to accommodate t he CEPT TuesdayThursday commitment. Through the clinical program, we engage with the community we serve to be a resource and a partner (1.1 & 1.2, p. 13) for better teacher preparation. Our studen ts gain experience through apprenticeship with English teachers in our service a rea and then man y take their p laces in classrooms where the children of the region are instructed. Students pursuing a TESOL minor complete a field service projec t in conjunction with ESLI. Students volunteer as language tutors and conversation partners with adult ESL students in ord er to a) apply grammar concepts learned in class, b) gain experience in crosscultural co mmunication, and c) develop empa thy for language learning. To further develop empathy, students get an immersion experi ence in Korean for one classroo m period after completing the field experience. To further lifelong learning and retraining (3.9, p. 13), the Writing Project provides opportunities for c urrent and future teachers to conduct research and develop teaching strategies th at they then test in their classrooms, refine, and present in workshops available to the local teaching community. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Through the Writing Project, the EST program furthers state obj ective 2.2 by working with teacher preparation programs and key partners to provide highquality professional developme nt opportunities. We offer a summer institute and two conferences a year. The most recent conferenceusing young ad ult literature to teach writingwas attended by teacher candidates, student teachers, graduate students, and public sch ool teachers from our region. We also maintain a website and a library of writing pedago gy resources for teachers. Clinical models of teacher preparation were nationally recommen ded as highimpact educational practices (state objective 6.1) by the 2010 NCATE Blue Ribbon Report on Clinical Teacher P reparation. Our EST majors benefit from clinical training in partnerships with two local high schools. EST students also en hance instruction at the partner high schools by demonstrating current pedagogical practices. As part of our charge to prepare Kentucky postsecondary student s for 21st century challenges (state objective 8.4), ENG 104, 204, and 302 prepare teache rs to address linguistic divers ity in classrooms. Students le arn to recognize features of Appalachian and Afri can American English and develop profession al language to discuss linguistic diversity. Students learn to foster codeswitching and bidial ectalism through deeper knowled ge of Standard American En glish grammar conventions. c. How and to what extent does the program directlyaddress work force needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to kystats.ky.gov, dem and for secondary teachers in t he state was projected to grow over the period 201721 with a total projected 5year demand of 1757. In the South Cen tral region alone, it is projec ted that there will be 870 job openings during that p eriod. Currently, there are 191 high sch ools in the state, so the outl ook would seem to favor EST graduates. Of the ten Educational Cooperativ e regions in Kentucky, nine li st English as a Second Lan guage and/or English and Communications as critical shorta ge instructional areas. The K entucky Educator Placement Service currently has posted 17 openings for high school English teachers, a significant number for this point (November) in the school year, as most vacancies are posted late in the spring semester. Our EST majo rs are developing the skills to a chieve certification to meet those needs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, projected growth i n employment for high school teachers is expected to be around 8% between 20162026. Although the statistics are not b roken down by subject area, the Occupational Outlook Handbook does note that high schools are currently reporting a shortage of English as a Second Language teachers. Consequently, EST majors with a minor in TESOL should have espe cially good job prospects moving forward. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The current EST major was designed using feedback from principa ls, department chairs, and alumni; a distinctive feature includes the cluster arrangement of electives, with one of the clusters devoted to allied lang uage arts (theater, speech, journalism). Further, our EST p rogram is unique in the state i n that teacher candidates receive a full 2 semesters of embedded instruction and practice before their final semester o f student teaching. During the two clinical semesters, students spend 7 hours a day 2 days a week working with both un iversity faculty and a cooperating teacher in high school classrooms. EST majors from our p rogram are frequently request ed by principals when they have openings. Our EST students also benefit from the department's opportuniti es for presenting their academic work (the Student Research Conference and the Sigm a Tau Delta national conference ). They publish in the depa rtment's two peerreviewed journals for undergraduate writing and participant in Study Awa y, Study Abroad, and the department's internship program. Several students each year take advantage of the Teach Abroad s emester. In addition to ENG 100, 200, and 300, all offered at Glasgow, t he department beams courses that specifically serve EST majors, such as ENG 301 and 40 1, to all campuses via IVS. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) For the larger public and scholar ly community, th e English prog ram hosts the Center for Robert Penn Warren Studies which publishes a peerreviewed academi c journal (hoste d by TopSchola r), hosts the annual Warren Cir cle conference (attracting national and international schol ars), and presents the BrooksW arren award for the best book o f literary criticism (with the winner invited to give a public lecture at WKU). In the coming years, we hope to refine the focus of the RPW Center to emphasize teaching more and to create workshop opportunities fo r teachers in our region. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The teaching profession is experi encing challenges regarding sa laries and benefits, resulting in teacher shortages in many areas. In 2016 the Kentucky Sch ool Boards Association predicte d a teacher shortage in middle and high schools within the next few years as almost 15,000 public school teachers become e ligible to retire. Consequently , the EST majo r who will re locate has an excellent chance of finding a job. Since we know that many students become English teachers becaus e of the influence of thei r own high school English teachers, we believe that streng thening our rela tionships with public school teachers will be advantageous. The English department has started a Speakers Bureau t o place WKU English p rofessors as guest speake rs in high school English classrooms. Our new High School Writing Contest also brings st udents, their parents, and teachers to campus. In 2018, the department's Writing Project connected with organizers of the Y oung Adult Literature conference and advertised its own YAL conference to draw future EST majors. EST is currently working with the School of Teacher Education o n redesigning their Core Curriculum to make the education major more attractive by stream lining course offerings and maki ng the program more cohesive. The new plan is expected to be implemented in 2019. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Nationally, the number of stude nts earning BAs in English decli ned by 15.2% from academic years 201314 to 201516 (NCES)\u2014the latest year with ava ilable numbers. During the same period, while the WKU median for program conferrals decreased by 5%, the number of E nglish for Secondary Teachers ( EST) conferrals increa sed by 15.4%. There are no national numbers to compare from 201314 to 201718, but the WKU median for program conferrals increased by 10% while EST conferrals dropped by 61.5%. The EST major has suffered because of a 2014 statemandated cha nge requiring future teaches increasing field hours by 120% and overall GPA by .25 inc rease. The legislature's recent attacks of salary, benefits, and cultural valuation of public school teachers has contributed to this decline. In reaction t o the overall decline in teacher education majors, EST faculty recently partnered with the School of Teacher Education to rede sign their core curriculum to streamline the degree and attract majors. The program addresses national t rends by making students aware of data and opportunities wi thin the curriculum. The required Intro to English Studies and English Capstone courses introduce local and national employment data and trends (3d) as well as require students to build resumes, cover letters, st atements of purpose and other material targeted to appropriate professional opportunities. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) From 20142017, the department revised our curricula to create more coherence within both majors and to provide mor e flexibility for students in all co ncentrations. We formulated g oals based on the positive wo rk we were already doing and created learning outcomes to help all English majors be even mo re successful after graduation, not just on the job market, but as human beings. In 2018, we instituted a twoyear course rotation to help stude nts plan for course offerings (s emesters, days of the week, and often times of day). The departm ent contacted affiliated progra ms to address scheduling conflicts that had occurred in the past to prevent fu ture conflicts. Since fall of 2015, we have devel oped a comprehensive recruitme nt plan which includes a redesign of our web site, addition of a Why English? Page, and 60 alumni profiles ; creation of a video to laud our programs; increased social media presence on Facebook and Twitter; old school marketing with bulle tin and sandwich boards and fl yers for each program; expanded outreach to high schools with a speakers bureau and essay contest; development o f electronic recruitment with WKU's content relationship manag ement system; an expanded department visit system for prospective students; and better tracking of interactions to dete rmine effective recruitment str ategies. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The EST program should maintain its current level of enrollment by extending relationships with teachers in our region, who then become aides in recruiting future English teachers. We pl an to do this through the outr each efforts of the Writing Project and partnering in the recruitment efforts of the depart ment as a whole. There is reason to believe that, based on current and expected teacher shortages, more students might con sider the EST major as a route to not only a degree but employment. This is pa rtly dependent on th e state legislature' s support of teachers and teacher education; therefore, EST majors should learn how to posit ively influence education in Ke ntucky through their educator organizations. We think that creating a Writing certificate would be a way to attract new students from the ranks of already employed teachers in multiple content areas. This could be done through the Writing Project summer institute. Incorporating some course work already included in the EST major would make earnin g the certificate feasible i n terms of credit hours. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The 42hour, inperson, Major in Film (A.B.) provides undergrad uates a strong found ation in both film p roduction and film studies. This combination allows s tudents to gain the practical skills necessary to su cceed on a film set i n both technical an d creative roles, to experience th e mechanics of film production in industry and indepe ndent settings, and t o develop facility i n critical and analytical thinking through the study of global fi lm culture, history, and aesthetics. Prospective majors may take no m ore than 12 hours in the major before admission. Students must meet the following requirements before they can be admitted: 1. Completion of a minimum of 24 hours of coursework applicable to a baccalaureate degree; 2. A minimum overall grad e point average of 2.5; 3. Completion of ENG 100 with a grade of \"C\" or higher and 9 ad ditional hours in general education; 4. Completion of the following courses with a grade of \"C\" or h igher: FILM 100, FIL M 201, FILM 202. In addition to meeting institutio nal requirements for graduatio n, the film major must have a minor or second major outside of the School of Jour nalism & Broadcasting and the Film Studies minor that is approved by th e major faculty advisor.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The film major was introduced in 2010 as an inte rdisciplinary u ndergraduate degree comprise d of preexisting film production courses in the School of Journalism & Broadcasting ( SJB) and film studies courses in the Department o f English. In 2014, the film major underwent a comprehensive curriculum revis ion, yet it remains integrat ed with SJB and English and supports Potter College's mission for students \"to succeed in a workforce that requires bright t eam players and global thinkers who are inquisitive, ana lytical and creative with exce llent communication, interpersona l and leadership skills.\" (See Section 3) Courses like Intro to Cinema (also a Colonnade IIAH course), Screenwriting , Cinematography , and Film Sound are popular electives in the Broadcasting, J ournalism, and Photojournalism majors. Film Adaptation serves as an elective in the Creative Writing and Literature majors, and Film Genres, Film Theory, and Feature Screenwriting also offer Gsections for graduate credit in English. Most film studies courses are taught in the Department of English, except Intro to Cinema , which is also taught in SJB, and film courses originating in other department s, such as Politics in Film. The major offers a 3credit Study Away program (Sundance Film F estival) and a 6credit Study Abroad program (London and Edinburgh International Film Festival). c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Being an interdisciplinary prog ram, instructional assignments c reate peculiarities in the SCHP data. Film production courses are taught by facu lty in SJB; film studies courses are taught by faculty in English. The universityprovi ded SCHP data only accounts for film major classes ta ught by SJB faculty, not film major classes taught by English f aculty. It should be noted th e film major is housed in SJB while the film studies minor is in English. Enrolled students dro pped as anticipated when new major admissi on requirements were est ablished in 2014. These requirements were deemed necessa ry to increase the likelihood o f students successfully c ompleting the major. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means o fassessment. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) 1. BelowtheLine (BTL) Skills technical skills essential for film production: camera, ligh ting, grip, sound, script supervising, assistant directing. 2. AbovetheLine (ATL) Skills creative skills essential fo r visual storytelling: writing, directing, producing, cinematography, production design, editing. 3. Critical Thinking/Problem Solving Skills ability to critically evaluate a film or solve a production p roblem in an organized, coherent fashion. 4. Communication Skills ability to communicate effectively, orally and through the w ritten word. 5. Teamwork/Leadership Skills ability to func tion as part of a team, or as a team leader. Production Courses SLO Assessments Quizzes and exams are administ ered, but emphasis is given to ha ndson exercises and film proje cts. Projects are assessed by peerreview and faculty feedback with rubrics provided by facul ty in advance. Technic al skills are evaluated by timed practica l exams. 100 and 200level course s emphasize foundational BTL Ski lls and Teamwork (SLOs 1, 5). 300 and 400level courses emphasize ATL Skills, Problem Solvi ng, Communication, and Leade rship Skills (SLOs 2, 3, 4, 5). Film Studies Courses SLO Assessments Quizzes and exams are administ ered, but emphasis is given to an alytical papers and multimed ia presentations. Since the world of film criticism has embraced forms like the video essay , students are now required to present analytical work in a variety of mediums. Rubrics are provided by facu lty in advance. Film studies courses emphasize Critical Thinking and Communication skills (SLOs 3, 4). ClosingtheLoop After evaluating student assessmen t measures in the previous in troductory production class, it was determined a new introductory course be created t o \"bridge the gap\" between high school and undergraduate film c oursework in fall 2017. This new course, Film Industry & Aesthetics , created a common foundation re gardless of previous experience , helping students who progressed in the major sco re higher overall in assessment measures in successive production courses. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a ndincorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The film alumni database incl udes 87 of 115 graduates since 201 3. 58.62% of film major alumni have found work in the film industry or videorelated jobs, 22.99% management/professional work, 14.71% retail/other. Sin ce the major is only in its eighth year, it has just begun s ystematically gathering alumni feedback. Methods include alumni surveys and social media groups, as well as an exit questionnaire completed by graduatin g seniors in their capstone course. The Kentucky Occupational Outlook to 2026 lists an 8.3% projecte d employment growth for Producers and Di rectors and 17.4% for Film and Video Editors. While Standard Occupational C lassification (SOC) codes neglec t a multitude of filmrelated jobs, there is a clear demand fo r video and storytelling skills that cuts across professions . Currently, students wishing to pursue a career in the film industry have two options: 1) stayl ocal and offer video production services such as music videos or commercial work while pursuin g personal projects on the side or 2) move to a production hub outofstate (e.g., Atlanta, Los Angeles) to work in an estab lished market. Kentucky film in dustry advocacy groups are attempting to attract film production to Kentucky, which would allow alumni to stay local and work on professional films. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) As of date, the film major has not conducted a systematic surve y of potential employers, in part due to the transient nature of the freelance film employee. However, the film major has bee n working with the Kentucky Film Association, a trade organization representing Kentuc ky's nascent film industry, and the Southern Kentucky Film C ommission, an organization attracting films to the region, to provide employees to Kentuck y film productions. Students and alumni working on recent professional films received perfo rmance feedback like \"I would like him on ALL of my crews,\" \"thankful she has been a part of the show,\" and \"...is a bo rn director/producer.\" In addition, the film major is in the process of creating a pro fessional advisory board of alum ni and \"friends of the program\" to advise on curriculum and em ployability skills. In the past, John Carpenter ( Halloween ) and Rob & Deb Spera ( Criminal Minds, Army Wives ) have functioned in this capa city unofficially and will certai nly be invited to join the advisory board once officially formed. Deb Spera, a WKU alumna, has been pivotal in the early years of the prog ram, advising on curriculum matters and serving on a successful faculty search committee as an industry professional. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) As a relatively new program (2010), our alumni are just now sta rting to make impressions in th e field. For example, some alumni have found success direct ing music videos (Max Moore, Co dy Duncum). Others have pursued documentary and freelance work in Nashville (Andr ew Yontz, Ben Bell). Others ha ve found work in major pro duction hubs like Atlanta (MaryEllen Hendrick) and Los Ange les (Alina Verenich). While th e first eight years have seen som e alumni success stories, the film major is reaching maturity and a more systematic approach to alumni relations will now be undertaken through alumni surveys and employer feedback. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) While the film major is not eligib le to participant in the Hear st Journalism Awards like its colleagues in Broadcasting, Journalism, and Photojournalism, it is certainly a beneficiary of SJB's success in the Hearst program. Over the years, SJB has ranked very high in the Hearst Awards, including first place ov erall in 2018, which comes with substantial cash awards that help offset the cost of equipment and essential services for th e school. In 2013, SJB also received a $100,000 grant from the Hearst Foundation that allowed SJB to build a multimedia lab, a s well as purchase cameras and other equipment. The film major has worked closel y with Philanthropy & Alumni En gagement to court alumni and \"friends of the program\" donors, as well as initiating an alumni social event at the Nas hville Film Festival in 2018 to keep supporters informed of accomplishments and needs of the p rogram. With the encouragemen t of the Southern Kentucky Film Commission, the film major has worked with DELO to ex plore revenuegenerating certif icate programs to retrain pot ential film crew not looking for an undergraduate degree. Finally, the film faculty are expl oring funding opportunities such as the WKU Sisterhood Grant and SpiritFunder to offset the cost of student films. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) *As mentioned in 2c, the provided SCHP data only accounts for S JB film faculty, not English faculty who regularly teach courses in the major. The Deliv ery Cost also lists SJB's mean s alary at $62,759, substantially higher than the $51,199 mean salary of the three SJB film fac ulty. These factors diminish th e major's total SCH while inflati ng the perceived cost per SCH. The adjusted film Co st per SCH would be $122 (excluding English ). Production courses are capped at 20 due to equipment limits and handson instruction, yet only 23.07% of 17/18 upper division FILM courses were under enrolled, much lo wer than depa rtment/university levels. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) A Culture of Innovation The film major prepares students to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizen s through its twopronged emphasis on film product ion and film studies . In produ ction courses, students use the latest technology in a collaborative, immersive environment to learn technical and creative skills ne cessary to tell stories in a v isual medium, skills that will ma ke them employable should they choos e to pursue filmmaking as a pr ofession. A Regional Lighthouse In addition, students learn esse ntial problemsolving, teamwork , and leadership skills necessit ated by the collaborative process of filmmaking. No team can succeed without clear goals, structure, and communication, and our production courses emphasize these \"soft skills\" as strongly as technical skills. Film majors interact with the co mmunity through location filmin g around Bowling Green and public showcases of student work on ca mpus. Global Learning Film studies courses, including r equired courses in world cinem a, expose students to cultures and filmmakers from diverse backgrounds from around the world while encouraging students to be engaged and aware of how their own films contribute to the cultural conversation. Students develop strong writing, research, and critical thinkin g skills, while engaging with an art form that crosses cultures and national boundaries. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Career Readiness and Employability (Objective 9) Careerreadiness in an everchang ing industry has been the prim ary focus of the film major since its inception. Through its emphasis on technical a nd creative skills, professional practic es and equipment, as well as critical thinking and problem solving, the film major ensures students are prepared and attra ctive to potential employers. As more film productions choose to film in Kentucky due to its co mpetitive tax incentives, it i s imperative the state have a lo cal workforce ready to greet th em. The film major at WKU is design ed to build such a workforce. Increase Persistence and Timely Completion (Objective 6) By design, students who enroll i n the film major as freshmen wi ll complete the film major withi n four years, as evidenced in the 3.88 year average time to completion over the past five yea rs, 20132018 (figure 3a). Th is timely completion is made possible by the major's \"stairs tep\" production curriculum, whi ch ensures classes are taken in a logical progression and at th e optimal time in the student's undergraduate career. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) As mentioned in 3c, the Kentucky Occupational Outlook to 2026 lists an 8.3% projec ted employment growth for Producers and Directors and 17.4% for Film and Video Editors. These are c onsidered \"high skill\" jobs, sk ills which the WKU film major provides through its rigorous cu rriculum. And while the SOC cod es neglect a multitude of filmrelated jobs, there is a clear demand for video and storyt elling skills that cuts across professions . The film major prepares workforc eready filmmakers with strong leadership, communication, and critical thinking skills in a number of ways. The heart of the film major curriculum is the w orkshop courses, which produce 2023 short films per year. These films give students experi ence working on set in both cre w (BTL) and creative/administra tive (ATL) positions. It is a rigorous and demanding schedule which allows students to experi ence the responsibilities and cr eativity of a film set in a very tangible way. The films made in these workshop courses fol low industry standard divisio ns of labor as much as is practical in an educational setting. Film studies courses culmi nate in a capstone course, which along with career preparation, includes discussions with industry professionals. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The film major is uniquely positio ned in the Commonwealth as th e only comprehensive 4year f ilm curriculum, focused on narrative (scripted) storytellin g, offered at a public institut ion. The only similar program in the state is offered by Asbury University, a small, private university. UofL and UK only offer film minors, which gives WKU an eightyear head start. Although many programs in the st ate focus on traditional broadc asting or documentary models, none provide the breadth or depth of filmmaking technique found in WKU's film curriculum. T he film major is also uniquely p ositioned in the region with its proximity to major (and grow ing) production hubs, such as N ashville, Louisville, and Atlanta. As a sign of the film major's growing stature and reputation, a current film student, Tori M ills, recently received the program's first Student Producti on Award for Best Short FormFi ction from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, Ohio Valley Chapter. A second student was awarded Hon orable Mention. All film faculty, production and studies, have terminal degrees (MFA or PhD) from institutions such as Florida State Universit y, University of Southern California, Duke, Chapman, MTSU, Univers ity of Miami, and University of Minnesota. All faculty are filmmakers and/or productive p ublishers of scholarly film resea rch. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) While the film major may lack th e physical facilities of some a spirational programs, it prides itself on the professionalqual ity equipment it provides to its students, equipment that most Kent ucky programs lack. The f ilm program now boasts two complete camera, sound, grip, and lighting packages, containing the same equipment used on professional film sets. Students shoot their short films in 4K RA W, futureproofing their work f or the foreseeable future. The newly updated and renovated editing labs boast topofthelin e computers, complete with pro fessional editing software. Incl uded with this upgrade were two new finishing suites with pr ofessional color grading and so und mixing stations. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The film faculty want WKU to be the destination of choice for h igh school (or transfer) stude nts seeking a degree in film in Kentucky and the Southeast/Midwest region. WKU has a unique opp ortunity to be competitive w ith programs at much larger schools, like Florida State and North Carolina School of the Ar ts, at a much more affordable price, even for outofstate students. Being a new program, the curriculum was designed for the film industry as it exists now, not as it might have existed 30 years ago, which gives us a nimble, \"startup\" mental ity for addressing programmatic issues. In order to attract talented students, the major has increased its presence online and on social media, but a much more concerted effort will need to be made toward publicity and recr uitment. Getting the student work into festivals and online is one of the most effective ways t o show the quality of education a student can receive at WKU. Another area for growth is targeting and visiting specific h igh schools with media program s. Building relationships with t hese programs, as well as the Governor School of the Arts, will go a long way toward fosterin g students and ensuring the pr ogram's longterm viability. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) According to the Natio nal Center for Educa tion Statistics, unde rgraduate degrees in \"Communication, journalism, and related programs\" (CIP Code 09) have seen 23.76% growth nationally over the last ten years. While WKU's film major has seen a 14% decrease in enrollment over the last five years, it is still ne arly 1.5x the univer sity median and frankly now at a level manageable with current staffing. This decrease can be attribut ed to the introduction of ad mission requirements to the major in 2014, which caused numbers to slowly decline as studen ts not making the cutoff pursue d other majors. Despite this slight dip, the film major has e xceeded initial enrollment numb ers expected by both the department head and the dean at the time of the film major's inception (50 majors were expected at the time of the major's proposal in 2010). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In 2014 the film major was revise d and expanded to provide a mo re effective film education acr oss the areas of production and film studies. As part of this revision, admissions requirem ents were added to the film major for the first time, bringing it in line with other SJB majors. S tudents must now complete 24 ho urs of undergraduate coursew ork, complete introductory film courses with a C or better, and maintain at least a 2.5 ov erall GPA in order to be admitted into the film major and continue on with their film courses. All film courses must be c ompleted with a C or better to be counted toward the major. The film faculty see the major's curriculum as a workinprogre ss rather than a fixed document. The film faculty meet on a semiannual basis to review student learning outcomes and cours ecorrect, like introducing workshop courses to spread out student workload, a new study abroad program, and a new introdu ctory course to better prepare incoming students for success. Increased communication with alumni and our advisory b oard (see 3d) will provide a dditional feedback to ensure our program maximizes student success during and after their ti me at WKU. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) 5 Year Goal After our recent Student Producti on Award at the regional level , the film major's goal for a national Student Emmy nomination is now a more realistic goal than ever. The major is in its second year of offering a thesis film class, and soon t his course will produce Emmycaliber films. By placing in this comp etition, as well as nationallyr ecognized film festivals, WKU will be wellpoised as a potential film student's destination o f choice. 10 Year Goal The film faculty have discussed for years the natural evolution of the major toward a BFA in Film, and with it, accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. In fact, the 2014 curriculum rev isions were made with this possibility in mind. With the late st film hire in SJB, this pla n is closer to being realized, an d curriculum options are being drafted. A BFA will require CPE a pproval, but it offers a signi ficant recruiting tool against h ighlyrespected film programs i n the region, such as FS U and NC School of the Arts. While \"maint aining\" the major ensures it will remain a successful, signature program, \"enhancing\" it will create a true destinatio n major for students in our service region and beyond. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The program began in 1972, was the first academic program to tr ain folklore students to work in the public sector, and has since been a national leader in preparation for government and nonprofit employment and doctorate programs. The program provides students with theoretical and methodological t raining in elevating communities through the documentation, promotion, and preservation of diverse tradition al arts (oral, material, and customary) and cultures. Curriculum is delivered through f acetoface seminars and ethno graphic fieldwork and applied projects, often in partnership with the departmentbased Kentucky Folklife Program (KFP). Adm ission requires a minimum 3.0 GP A, reference letters, and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Said one graduate surve yed (discussed below), \"I have a network of public folklorist s across the country from my time at WKU, experience developi ng exhibits,...understanding of t he infrastructure of public fol klore on a national level, an understanding of the cultural and theoretical history of the fi eld of folklore, experience doin g fieldwork, and respect from folklorist colleagues for having a degree from one of the premi ere folk studies graduate programs in the country.\" Even with a recent enrollment dip, in the evaluation period we averaged 2 1 enrolled students, above the PCAL median of 18.5 and in the top four of ten PCAL MA programs. (There is an undergraduat e folklore minor but no major.) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 8 January 2019 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The program directly support s the university mission to \" prepare students of all backgrounds to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizen leaders of a global society ,\" as students engage i n applied research that impacts communit ies in the WKU service region and beyond through coursework, internshi ps, and thesis/capstone proje cts. Folk Studies graduate courses support other programs by serving as electives in progr ams including GWS and SRSC. Opportunities for interaction be tween undergraduate and graduat e programs include TAs in Colonnade and minor classes and 400/400G courses that include applied research projects. Fo r instance, FLK470/470G stude nts regularly research and build an exhibit presented at the Kentucky Museum (most recentl y in support of IYO South Korea); in fall 2018, FLK464/464G students worked collaboratively to document and present online the construction of the Cultural Enhancement Committee's Stickwork project. In fall 2017, graduate students in FLK585 co llaborated with KFP and Bosnian community members to present demonstrations of Bosnian food traditions in support of IYO Bosnia and the Kentucky Museum exhibit \"A Culture Carried: Bosnians in Bowling Green\" attended by students in FSA Colonnade courses. The implementation of a JUMP program in spring 2019 will enhanc e opportunities for interaction between undergraduate and graduate programs. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Additional examples: Each year, students work with the KFP and faculty members to present n arrative stages\u2014onstage interviews with community tradition barriers\u2014at the Horse Cave Heritage Festival. Folk Studies faculty have collaborated with the KFP (with RCAP funding) to develop and implem ent \"Dress to Express,\" which uses dress and adornment to explo re cultural diversity and iden tity. Dress to Express classes ha ve been held at Bowling Green High School, with the \"Upward Bound\" program for disadvantaged high school students, and with the Intercultural Student Engagement Center Acad emy at WKU and will co ntinue thr ough a cu rriculum available to educators online. 3.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The program achieves the s trategic plan's call to \" provide [students] with a dynamic and challenging educational e nvironment that facilitates their growth as scholars and individuals .\" 6085% of students graduate within three years following entry; those who graduate typically do so in under two years. FS students completing the MA will : develop employment skills and qu alities which will allow them t o successfully compete in the professional world display competency in the history, methods, and theory of the d iscipline of folklore be capable of presenting professio nal presentations, programs, and exhibits and/or publish ing professional papers serve as responsible citizens in a global society through regio nal stewardship and community engagement activities All students must pass a rigorous written comprehensive exam. Thesis students are required to write an extended monograph based on primary r esearch that must be approved by a committee of three faculty member s and must be orally defended to graduate faculty and students. The defense is evaluated by the student's committee based on 1) the successful presentat ion of a summary of the methods used and conclusions drawn and 2) effectively responding to questions. Nonthesis students must complete an internship or capstone and a webbased portfo lio of their graduate work that demonstrates, to faculty and employers, the breadth and impact of their education, skills, and e xperience attained through coursework, research, projects, internships, professional prese ntations, assistantships, and other experiences. An oral defense of the portfolio is required following the completion o f exams, and passage of this fina l stage of degree completion in contingent on approval of graduate faculty. Based on student feedback, in fall 2017 the faculty improved po rtfolio guidelines and requirements and initiated an annual professional development workshop to more fully engage students with the purpose and expectations of the portfolio. The faculty also updated recommended platforms in order to ensure a ccessibility to potential employers. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Our graduates become colleagues in the field. Alumni recruit po tential students and make fin ancial contributions to our program (some on a monthly basis) . We have an active alumni Fac ebook page, hold an annual alu mni advisory dinner during the American Folklore Society (A FS) conference, and host a bien nial roundtable in which alumni share their realworld experiences with students in group and oneonone settings. Our analysis of the list of presen ters at the 2018 AFS conferen ce found that 18 graduates from the evaluation period presented their research at the conference. We conducted a survey of 201318 graduates in fall 2018. Of the 44 for whom we had contact information, 41 responded (93%); 29 (71%) are employed in a related field (museums, histo ric sites, libraries, archives, as well as education, nonprofi ts, government) and seven (17%) are in doctorate programs. We will adapt and conduct this survey annually. Our primary professional organiza tion, AFS, reported that betwe en May 2017 and May 2018, 44% of folklorerelated job postings were \"public folklore an d related\" as compared to 31% academic jobs; in addition to public folklore jobs there are positions in museums, archives, and others jobs that our studen ts are uniquely prepared for and regularly land, unlike graduates of most folklore programs. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Our faculty are engaged leaders in the field with regular conta ct with employers and actively engaged in service to professional organizations and on state/national grants panels. In fall 2018, we requested feedba ck from several supervisors; comments public fol klorist\" and \"her degree from you r institution was one of the strongest elements that landed her the interview.\" Comments fro m doctoral advisors included, \"the WKU students are so wellprepared that we actually ha d a discussion ab out that in r elation to our PhD program recently.\" According to our recent survey, 83% of those employed had recei ved a positive evaluation from their employers and 41% had received a new position with mor e responsibility/pay since init ial employment. Of those in doctoral programs, 71% had received a positive evaluation f rom their supervisors and 57% h ad received an award. We identified the need to increase student research presentatio ns at conferences for career development. We therefore began 1) requiring firstyear students to present at the WKU Re search Conference, 2) providing travel support to the AFS conference contingent on presentations, and 3) encouraging addi tional conference presentations. As a result, in 201718, 11 of 17 students made 25 presentat ions (20 at regional/national c onferences including the Appalachian Studies Association and AFS conferences). e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Our timetodegree rate is exce ptional, rising when an occasion al thesis student completes l ate. Recent student awards include the 2018 Minton (the second FS winner since its 2002 in ception) and awards from the AFS Cultural Diversity Committee and the Public Programs and Women's Sections. Of thos e currently employed, 48% were hired 13 months after receipt of their degree; 30% in 36 months. One graduate commen ted, \"I am more wellrounded and prepared than others in similar positions. I entered my job with experience in grantw riting, public programming, and communitybased fieldwork and projects, which allowed for an almost seamless transition i nto my present position.\" 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Folk Studies has a history of funding from the National Park Se rvice, National Endowment for the Arts, Laura Goad Turner Charitable Foundation, and others. In this period, FS received grants totaling $545,153, 29% of total PCAL extramural funding. In 201415, FS brought in 86% of the PCAL total. MA students pa rticipated in both paid (GAs, on contract) and unpaid (through coursework) roles. FSA averaged $13,955.81 in DELO distributions, through summer a nd web courses (undergraduate). Charitable giving includes month ly contributions by all program FTF, as well as alumni and frie nds, to support student travel and professional development. Our students benefit fr om the annual dispersal of the CollinsB ramham Guest Artist Endowment that supports our Public Folklore Workshop, bringing a prominent public folklorist to ca mpus for 23 days to provide skillsenhancing workshops, scholarly presentations, and oneonone time with students. Faculty members in the program currently edit the Journal of American Folklore , the leading journal in our field. Along with prestige, this brings funding, most of which supports summer pa y for a graduate editorial assistant. Faculty and students seek outsid e funding to support research/c onference travel, with awards from sources including AFS and its interest sections, Ameri can Folklife Center, Kentucky O ral History Comm ission, and ZSEIFS. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Graduate courses are taught almost exclusively by four FTF who also teach Colonnade and minor courses. As our graduate enrollment has dipped, we are work ing to best balance teaching schedules (G/UG) to improve SCHP (which excludes independent studies, thesis commi ttees, and advising). Even tho ugh our enrollments have dipped, we remain among the highest average faculty:student ratios of MA programs. In 2017, our faculty:student ratio of 1:8.5 placed us #22 (top 41%) of 54 MA programs; we were #5 (top 28%) of 18 facetoface MA prog rams. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) WKU aims to \" enroll a diverse body of regional and global ... students .\" In the review period, 13 of our students came from Kentucky, 14 from other states, 3 from Iran, and one from India ; 9 were firstgeneration co llege students. We encourage nontraditional student applican ts such as professionals seeking additional job skills. WKU aims to \" Facilitate high impact practices ...\" (The Hill). 100% of our stude nts participate in highimpact practices including internships, capstone p rojects, communitybased learn ing, collaborative projects, and/or electronic portfolios. One graduate wrote: \"My job requires understanding the cultural val ues of a variety of diverse communities...creating connections between those communities and cultural and natural resources...collaborating directly with community members and other partner organizations...developing interpretive media...and handling contentious topics in a public space. I am the only person in my current workplace who can say they g ained experience in all of the above and more in one place.\" As highlighted through out this selfstudy, we are particularly proud of our role as \" a regional lighthouse \" (Our Community and Beyond) through student and faculty efforts to elevate comm unities through creation of cultural opportunities, and of our success ensuring \" that WKU students graduate with sk ills to think critically, sol ve problems, and engage effectively with others.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The FS MA is a distinct ive program availabl e nowhere else in th e state, and we uniquely support the statewide strategic agenda which seeks to \" advance social, artistic, cultural, and environmental progress .\" Of particular relevance: Objective 2: \"Partner with Kentucky's P12 system...\" We are the only folklore progra m in the U.S. to offer a gradua te class in Folklore & Education, a growing a rea of the field. Students in this course have, among other things, trained students in area high schools to conduct oral hist ory interviews and created a \" traveling trunk\" on Bowling Gr een Bosnian culture, now available to schools from the Kentucky Museum. Objective 9: \"Improv e the career re adiness and employability...\" From our survey, 28% of those employed work in Kentucky, including positions with museums, archives, and universities. Objective 11: \"Expand regional partnerships, outreach and publi c service...\" The graduate program sust ains partnerships with a wide range of organizations an d communities including area sc hools and museums, City of H orse Cave, National Park Service, Kentucky Arts Council, a nd Kentucky Historical Society . Although regional partnerships, outreach, and public service have long been central to our program, the movement of the Kent ucky Folklife Program to the department in 2012 has expanded opportunities for student/community engagement. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Although many of the job categor ies our students enter are not listed in the Kentucky Future Skills Report, those that are included and are held by our grad uates working in Kentucky (arc hivists, art directors, curators, museum technicians and conservators) are all predicte d to grow between 20172021. From the early days of the program to the present, our graduate s have been hired upon graduation by agencies such as the Kentucky Arts Council and Histor ical Society as well as numerou s local organizations, museums, and educational institutions. Kentucky employers of graduates in the period under evaluation include the Downing Museum, the National Corvette Museum, the Muhammad Ali Center, the Kentucky Folklife Program, Hindman Settlement School, and the Sisters of Loretto Heritage Center. Out of 12 Folklife Specialists em ployed by the KFP since it was founded in 1989 by one of our graduates, 11 were alumni of our program. There is a large ne twork of folklorists in the Com monwealth (many our graduates), and one graduate surveyed listed access to this network as one \"unique advantage\" our pro gram provided. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) In 2017, we celebrated 100 years of folklore study at WKU, begi nning when Gordon Wilson esta blished a folklore library. There is no other folklore graduate program in Kentucky. Unlike any other program in the nation, we have been known since the 1970s for training public folklorists. S aid one graduate: \" The Folk Studies program at WKU is recognized by my folklore peers across the country... as bein g one of the premiere schools for graduate level training in folklore, and as THE premiere school for training in public fol klore. Graduates go on to supp ort folk and traditional arts an d artists across the country in a wide variety of rural, underserv ed, minority communities.\" Grad uates pursuing doctoral degrees also recognize the importance of the job skills; sai d one: \"my time at WKU helped me develop a set of practical-an d marketable-skills related to historic preservation, and to fieldwork more broadly. This back ground has allowed me to part icipate in, and be hired to conduct, field and communitybased projects through my doctora l institution.\" Awards received include Preservation Kentucky's 2016 Bingham Preservation Education Award and Kentucky Historical Society's 2018 Community Impact Award for the Bosnians in Bowli ng Green exhibit, a joint project of FS, KFP, and the Kentucky Museum. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) According to one gradu ate: \"While it is, qua ntitatively, a smal l program, Western's folk studi es program is, qualitatively, everything a prospective student (or proud alumni) could hope f or. What it might lack in numbers, the program makes up for in reputation-in terms of rigor, respectability, and prestige-i n the field of folklore studies. The program is known (and laud ed within the field) for its public facing focus which affords the unique opportunity in a degree program that blends academic research, community engagement, and preparation for the job mar ket and/or further study.\" 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) In 2013, with strong support of university administration and t he discipline, we proposed a doctorate of applied practice to meet employment needs. The CPE vetoed the proposal, stating tha t it \"would fall outside the intent of the legislation allowing comprehensive universit ies to offer advanced practice doctorates.\" Our program is undergoing transition with the retirement of one and optional r etirement of a second full prof essor, and we have hired junio r faculty with expertise in applied folklore. This is the opportune time to incorporate aspects of the proposed doctoral program at the MA level. We are launching a JUMP program in Spring 2019 and anticipate an increase of 12 WKU students completing the program per year. We plan to propose a museums concentration , strengthened by the longstanding relationship with the Kentuc ky Museum and with potential connections with Art and History. According to the KY Statewide Occupational Employment Outlook, jobs in museums are predicated to rise in Kentucky by 13.515.1%. Na tionally, the BLS predicts that jobs in archives and museums will \"grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the averag e for all occupations.\" An incre asing number of our graduates are hired by museums, and a conc entration will attract addition al applicants seeking museum careers. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) As mentioned, the AFS analyzed posts on their online career cen ter between May 201718 and found that 44% were public folklore and related humanities jobs as compared to 31% academi c jobs; the remaining jobs included museums, archives, and other jobs that our students are uniquely prepared for and get. In addition, we have tracked academic positions and found that an increasing number empha size specializatio n in public fo lklore/public humanities, and o ur degree therefore provides unique qualifications for students who go on to pursue a doctor ate. Our program aligns with national trends of declin ing enrollment s in humanities programs; ho wever, we are ahead of the curve on training our graduates for employment outside of acade mia. We also led the way in the movement of public folklore programs from state arts councils (since the 1970s) to u niversities; the KFP was among the first to d o so, as WKU recognized the opp ortunities for student/community engagement. Our program has the potential to grow our impact on other progr ams, as our faculty ha ve expertise in folklore and education, folklore and health, folklore a nd journalism, and other employm ent categories with a growing de sire to train culturally aware and competent professionals wit h the skills necessary to commun icate with diverse populations. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Because our graduates are highly successful, we have made recruitment our priority . For many years our enrollment was near capacity based on the number of graduate faculty, and ther e was no systematic plan for recruitment. As we have seen our numbers dip in recent years, and with the change in program leadership, we began a systematic plan for recruitment. The faculty have reviewed the undergraduate institutions of rec ent students and have identi fied targets including the University of Kentucky, Indiana University, and Berea College. Faculty will make recruitment v isits to two of these universiti es in winter 2019. Over the last two years, department faculty fully redesigned th e website and made it more navigable for potential applicants, and in 2018 we produced the first department newsletter in memo ry. We have produced items such as a 3x5 recruitment card and plan to produce additio nal materials, having heard fro m potential students who want physical, in addition to web based, materials. In the last two years, we have used social me dia with recruitment in mind; for instance, we have posted a series of \"spotlights\" on the su ccesses of exemplary alumni. Th ough our alumni have long been active recruiters, we are creating materials to assist them in doing so systematically. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) While the lack of CPE support set us back from an opportunity t o provide leadership in our fi eld at the doctoral level, we remain among the strongest and most respected folklore programs in the nation. We are confident that through program changes and the implementation of a strategic recruitment plan we will return to our previous enrollment within the next five years; within ten, if we can grow our faculty beyond the i mpediment of four FTFs, we hav e serious potential to grow. Our greatest impediment is the declining support for assistants hips, previously a key factor in our ability to attract top students. Stipends are stagnant and our ability to offer full t uition waivers has plummeted. We continue to offer one or two full waivers per year but doing s o reduces the partial waivers offered to other candidates to between $2000 and $3700, which is not competitive. In addition to growing the numbers of students pursuing an MA i n Folk Studies, there is potential to grow our support of other programs. For instance, ou r existing collaborations with programs in the Department of Community and Diversity Studies may be grown with recent university reorganization. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) GWS has grown from two courses in 1990 to a vibrant program off ering anundergraduate minor, a graduate certificate, and a robust activities calendar that serves our students and the c ampus and community. GWS has engaged in collaboration, e.g., Women & Kids Learning Together Summer Camp, 20062012, and the At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago , when Chicago came to WKU for a s emester to lead team of student s and community members, whic h resulted in a sixmonth exhibit, cosponsored with the Art Department and Folk Studies, 20012002. For 20 years, GWS has hosted the studentrun Vagina Monologues that raise s funds for Hope Harbor. The Graduate Certificate require s students to explore links bet ween their chosen field of study and the interdisciplinary examination of gender and of women's experiences and contributi ons. The certificate requires 15 or 18 credit hours, for those wishing to teach GWS at the secondary level. One reason for the certificate 's success is that all courses ca n be taken online (local student s also have the option to take some electives f2f)\u2014it went on line in 1998. Anot her is the exce llence of faculty and course o ptions. Admission is somewhat selective, including a review of a statement of intent and prev ious academic performance. 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

(ma ximum 200 words) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 The GWS Graduate Certificate a ligns with WKU's mission in three ways. Completion of the 1518 credit hours of coursework \"prepares students of all backgrounds to be citizenleaders of a gl obal society\" through an interdisciplinary examination of gender, race, and class the in fluences of policies, programs and discourses. As an online certificate, it offers accessible \"lifelong learning opportunit ies for its students, f aculty, and other constituents.\" Finally , the graduate certificate \"enriches the quality of life for those wi thin its reach,\" providing oppo rtunities for professionals to enhance their areas of expertise. GWS graduate courses count as electives in the MA in Social Res ponsibility & Sustainable Communi ties; several of them also count in the MA in Organizationa l Leadership. Students may purs ue the certificate alone. However, the GWS Graduate Certificate is most commonly soug ht along with a master's (or a fter the MA or PhD was earned). We also support the WKU mission an d other programs through outr each events. For instance, foundationsupported genderations luncheon series supports the work of faculty across campus. Si nce 2002, approximately 110 faculty and community members, from over 23 disciplines, have presented the ir work. See 4b for more information on our foundations. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) For more than 25 years the WKU GWS Program has organized and su pported a significant amount of programming on WKU's campus. The academic minor is but one small part of what makes up the program. GWS has the first and longestrunning film series on campus (The Gender Ima ges Film Series), provides spac e for faculty and students t o share their research and community work through the genderations luncheons, and has brought (or helped to bring) internationall y known speakers to campus including Gloria Steine m, Katha Pollitt, Ntozake Shan ge, and Allan Johnson. These efforts require a significant amount of time and planning and a re an integral part of the GWS mission. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student Learning Outcomes: 1. Analyze intersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality in feminist theory; 2. Examine the impact of policies, p rograms, and discourses on wom en across the globe; 3. Explain strategies for collectiv e action as a vehicle for chang ing social structures, pub lic policies, and ways of thinking; 4. Produce written work investigati ng issues concerning women from crosscultural and global perspectives. The GWS Program runs an assessment cycle for the GWS graduate c ertificate that has resulted in aligning the certificate's core courses to the student learn ing outcomes. Th e results are always very positive. In 201415 we assessed the final papers for the two core courses (GWS 545 and GWS 555). From that repor t: \"Overall results from this assessment indicate that the GWS Graduate Certificate Program is wellorganized, outcome dri ven, and successful. Results from the assessment indicate that the overall mean score from the final papers in both GWS 5 45 and GWS 555 was at target.\" Additionally, we decided to revise program outcomes as a res ult of the assessment, deleting the one that is specific to only one of the core courses, rather than suitable for both. As one student stated, \"The GWS Program at WKU is one other sch ools should model! The courses are well chosen and thoughtfully present ed by true professionals. The strong belie f of GWS leaders in the importance of this program is apparent not only through the courses but also through the speakers and other programs that are presented throughout the year. I am grateful for the opportunity to attend the programit has been life changing!\" In termsof constructive feedback, one student mentioned that including class es dealing with sexuality/queer s tudies would augment the programs electives courses. Unfortunately, we have not had the resources to offer such a co urse, though sexuality integrates significantly in core courses and electives. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We do not have a systematic process for getting feedback from g raduates. We have conducted in formal satisfaction surveys and rely on continued mentoring relationships with students. Many of our students enter the program as working professionals and for them our certificate offers a means for professional advancement within their organiz ation. According to the linked employment statistics, 21% of graduates are in the field of education\u2014our percentage is probably higher. Several students have reported that they chose the certificate program at the behest of their employer or institution. We have some data that suggest student success based on employabil ity and promotion. In June 2018 we contacted graduates by phone and con ducted a short interview addressing this issue, among others. According to 11 responses out of 45 attempted, 9 students reported a direct correlation between the certificate and advancement in their career goals. Two students reported positive respon ses from employers. An executi ve administrator at a nonpro fit stated, \"I became the gender and sexuality person\"; and a teacher in Bowling Green sc hools stated, \"With th e certificate the principal listens to me about things we need related to this.\" d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gatheran d incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The WKU GWS Program does not hav e a mechanism in place to measu re employer satisfaction with graduates of the certificate program. Anecdotal e vidence from graduates indicate s that they often become the \"goto\" person for issues related to gender. As a wholly online program, the certificate is accessible to in dividuals throughout the state, the U.S. and globally. Students comment that they attend this pro gram because of the online acc essibility. In the 2018 phone sur vey mentioned above, 4 out 11 students who respo nded to our calls indi cated that they teac h in the Kentucky public sch ool system. This is not an exhaustive survey but does show that the online GWS certificate is contributing to Kentucky students' employability and professional development. An info rmal review of students' Black board introductions in two courses shows that 18 of 37 within the period of review are in education (K12 or higher edu cation). Of those, 12 are teaching in Kentucky. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) We abide by the academic standard s established by the National Women's Studies Association . Established i n 1977, the National Women's Studies Associa tion has as one of its primary objectives promoting and supporting the production and distribution of knowledge about women and gender through teachi ng, learning, research and service in academic and other settings. As an academic field, GWS has pushed for curricula tr ansformation in higher education that has resulted in students who learn multiple perspectives and demonstrate the application of knowledge in pursuit of a more equitable society. 4.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The GWS Program has seven Founda tion accounts. The Ward Visitin g, the Ward, and the Ward Scholarship were all endowed many years ago by the first GWS director, Catherine Coogan Ward . These accounts support the special events calendar, our awards, and one of two scholarsh ips. The Gail Martin Lecture & Faculty Development account pays for our genderations luncheon series, which supports the work of faculty across camp us. We provide free soups and breads and students are invited (sometimes who classes attend). The Grace O'Neill Fund was created by an employee in honor of his mother and is designated for student travel, and the Esther Fund, endowed by another former employee provides a $1,000 scholarship per year to a graduate student seeking the GWS certificate. The GWS DELO distribution for 20122018 was $23,430, with most years between ($2,000$4,000). These funds covered a range of student and faculty opportunities (travel primarily, b ut also guest speakers or cosponsorship, equipment and office furniture). c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) First, our students are a \"a diverse body\" including nontraditi onal students who have \"access through a targeted attraction and recruitment plan.\" Online delivery attracts older students, many of whom are currently working but seek to enhance their career options, whether th ey are committed to higher educ ation or working in nonprofits in service of women. We have worked with DELO on recruitment (though more needs to be d one). Second, in \"preparation for the global stage,\" the GWS certificate uses the most current pedagogical techniques to offer a highly engaged onlin e experience that addresses global problems (e.g., GWS 555 G lobal & Crosscultural Perspect ives on Women and GWS 575 Gender, Justice, & Sustainability). This po int also speaks to t he \"culture of inno vation\" and the insistence that ou r teaching scholars be keen o n learning \"current teaching methodologies\" and integrating \"best practices.\" For instance, several of our courses employ \"live\" discussions where students meet in small groups to discu ss facetoface topics for the week or to work on group projects. Since our courses are usually heavily dependent on wr itten discussion boards, this \"break\" from the intensive writing helps to build community, thus speaking again to our ef forts to attract and retain students\u2014almost no one wants an atomized learning experience. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The GWS Graduate Certificate alig ns as follows: 1.1 Increase cu lture competence, 8.4 strength en learning outcomes (LEAP), and 9.1 Make career development a state and institutional prior ity and a key strategy for student success. The program enhances cultural competency through indepth analyses of gende r, race, and class; systemic oppression; feminist theory; and policies, actions, and discou rses that maintain and challen ge dominant ideologies (1.1, 8.4 ). Given the appalling statisti cs and wrenching personal stories of individuals\u2014many of them our students\u2014who suffer violence at the hands of individuals or groups as a result of being a girl, or a woman, or trans, or gay, or queer, or a boy, or a man, we stand by our certificate as one of the best ways to raise a wareness about gendered historie s and practices and to provide our students (and future GWS teachers) with the knowledge for preventing and combating gende red injustices. The program's assessment plan use s features of the LEAP outcome s (8.4). The program is offe red wholly online giving professionals the opportunity to p ursue advanced specialization in asynchronous environment (9.1). As noted above, a large number of our students earn the GWS certificate as part of thei r professional development in the field of education. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the Pew Research Center 2017 report \"The Future of Jobs and Job Training,\" \"a focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial inte lligence (AI) and machines see m unable to replicate\" will be important. These skills include the ability to network with others, manage public relations, displa y intercultural sensitivity, mar keting, creativity, and enough critical thinking to move outsid e the box. The WKU GWS Program is essential in developing these skills in students. As stated above, an informal rev iew of students' Blackboard int roductions in two courses show s that 18 of 37 within the period of review are in educatio n (K12 or higher education). Of those, 12 are teaching in Kentucky. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The GWS Certificate is fully online, drawing students from arou nd the country. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Faculty members in GWS experienc e service obligations that are heavier than normal. They are called upon to provide expertise for many other academic units or to cosponsor guest speakers and other events. Representatives of the media and other individuals from the campus community and outside telepho ne or drop in with requests for advice or information about virtually anything having to do with women. Frequent call s come in from the media, women's organizations, businesses, and government agen cies for expertise on issues con cerning women. Because of these facts, WKU GWS forms an important link between the University and the community. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) As noted in 5b, the plethora of individuals' accounts\u2014many of t hem our students\u2014who suffer violence at the hands of individuals or groups as a result of being a girl, or a woman, or trans, or gay, or queer, or a boy, or a man\u2014provide ample evidence that GWS should be protected and grown. The reality is far more troubling than the sta tistics suggest, as is frequent noted in studies and discussions regarding rape and sexual assa ult. While educating about violen ce is only a small portion of the material GWS covers, it is i ndicative of the importance of raising awareness and helpin g all our students\u2014men and women\u2014learn how \"individual\" problems are often systemic and ca n only be challenged effectively from that understanding. Since GWS faculty are highly sk illed in working across the disc iplines with students and colleag ues, we see an opportunity to model progressive and responsive academic programming. We are a lso eager to work with others to grow our certificate, despite concerns about disciplinar y homes that merely tolerate interdisciplinarity. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Two organizational models are co mmon: 1) selfgoverning academi c departments and faculty, 2) shared facultyacross departments. Both models are inst itutionally specific. The data collected in national trends linked above groups GWS with \"area, ethnic, cultural, and group studies\" and measures bachel or's degrees conferred. Current trends indicate that the number of GWS faculty who hold a PhD in women's and gender stud ies will continue to increase as demand for gender and women's studies curricula continue s to grow in hig her education . According to the NWSA statement \"What Programs Need: Essential Resources for Women's Stud ies Programs\" (January 2000), the minimum requirements for a GWS Program are: 1. Instr uctional staff\u2014Faculty lines in GWS; 2. Administrative and support staff\u2014Administrative staff should include a department head or director and an assistant director. Support staff should be sufficient to keep the office open throughout the ent ire day and to meet the other demands on GWS program; 3. Teaching loads for GWS faculty m embers with joint appointments should be the same for both departments; 4. Operating budgets should be at le ast equivalent to th ose established for other academic units; 5. Space in order to foster within the GWS program intellectual exchange , collegiality, identification with the GWS office by GWS faculty. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) For the past three years, we have worked with DELO, which has a llotted funds to help promote the GWS certificate\u2014 marketing on Facebook, for instance, or printing flyers. How su ccessful these efforts have been varies year to year. It's difficult to track the effectiven ess of Fb marketing\u2014so many cl icks per week: what does this le ad to? Our numbers have been fairly steady year to year. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We have no easy predictions for 5 or 10 years down the road. Th e GWS Program (undergraduate, graduate, schedule of events) will move to an as yet un disclosed new departmental hom e in 2019. Given the institu tion's downsizing, however, one danger is that d epartments will close ranks, unwilling to e ncourage students to pursue an i nterdisciplinary minor such as GWS\u2014or for that matter, any minor that does not accrue to the d epartmental home. With GWS faculty likely scattered to different departments and those new home departments wanting to make use of the faculty for internal demands, WKU will face the challenge of supporting nonconforming, innovative, in terdisciplinary, and/or prog ressive programs; GWS is one such program, and it holds one o f the longest histories on camp us. GWS holds a great deal of colle ctive and historical wisdom and is ready to help with that endeavor. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The German major at WKU is desi gned to bring students to the Ad vanced level of proficien cy on the ACTFL scale while providing a solid foundation in cultural knowledge and co mmunicative skills for the workplace. Students complete core courses that begin with German 102 and then custo mize their skill set by choosing from among electives in German culture, bus iness, translation, film and li terature. A minor is required. Many students in fact have a second major. About half of the students who earn this m ajor start at a level hi gher than 102 based on knowledge from high school. For these students, the typical sta rting point is the 3rd or 5th semester of the curriculum. The department has a number of ways of awarding low cost credit for previou s knowledge or waiving courses prior to the first cours e the student completes at WKU. Study abroad is strongly encouraged. The majority of students study abroad for a su mmer (6 credits) or a semester (1215 credits). Some earn internship credit. There is no selective admission, however only courses in which a student earns a C or better count for the major.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Strategic Plan : The WKU strategic plan indicate s that we want to \"prepare WKU graduates to enter a competitive global workforce\" (p. 9 and multiple references). German course s at all levels help fulfill this priority. General education : For the reporting period of 20132018, the program was very a ctive in serving the language requirement at WKU. Students who chose to take a course rather than demonstrate proficiency could enroll in German and take two semesters. An instructor hired to help serv e this requirement taught 720 student credit hours in service to general educ ation per year. German language courses remain an opti on for students who come to WKU without the precollege curriculum of two units of a world language. The initial exposure to language and culture that occurred in 100level language course s motivated students to consider majoring. Other programs : International Affairs and Inte rnational Business majors must take intermediate level language courses. As the language of a po werful nation in Europe, German is a very compelling op tion for them. The 300 level Business German course is an elective toward the Internat ional Business major. About half of the German majors are double majors in Ge rman and one of these areas. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) General education : Now that WKU does not have a language requirement, the progra m wishes to offer Colonnade courses that contribute to students' global competenc y. The WKU strategic plan (p. 2) states that cultural competency and global citizenry should be developed th rough Colonnade. Study abroad : Early and positive learning ab out another culture helps stude nts feel more comfortable choosing to study abroad while at WKU. Graduat es with international experie nce are more competitive for jobs. Institutional prestige : The program has been a strong producer of Fulbright Scholars. Fulbright recipients indicate that their Fulbright experience benefited them in more ways tha n they ever anticipated. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The program has two primary SLOs . First, it is designed to brin g majors to at least the Advanced Low level of proficiency on the ACTFL scale. The advanced level is necessary to function well in a work environment. To attain this goal, the program set profi ciency targets for the end of t he first year, second year, and the exit of the program. An external assessment is administered each spring to provide feedback for both students and to faculty. The tool currently used is the STAMP Assessment, a pro duct of Avant Assessment. A s a result of testing, the faculty member who teaches upper level German made key chan ges. To support development the key workplace skills of interpretive listening and interpersonal sp eaking, she integrated mor e authentic sources from current German media. Cultural knowledge is an additional SLO f or the program. This is measured through integrated performance assessmen ts in the core course on contem porary Germany. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Program Coordinator encourag es majors to create a LinkedIn profile well before they go on the job market. She connects to them directly and messages them to gather feedb ack on how the program helped them in their careers. Graduates of the progra m tend to work in the field of their other major and have enhanced opportunities there because of their language a nd culture skills. Examples: R ecent graduate Jarred Jo hnson, a double major in German and English, is Communications Officer for the German Re search and Innovation Center in New York City. Katie Simpson, a double major in German and photojournalism, is a photographer in Berlin. Angelika Masero, a double major in German and Englis h, credits teaching experience gained on her Fulbright in Germany with helping her get a TAship for an MBA pro gram. Emily Harper, a double ma jor in German and French , is pursuing an MA in Translation. The Program Coordinator has developed strong alumn i ties through connections on LinkedIn and Facebook, often passing along job opportunities as they arise. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Indicators from professional organizations and employers : The program has taken to heart the ACTFL guideline recommending at least Advanced level proficiency for the workpl ace. Modern Languages Advisory Board members, who typically represent local and regional employers, have indicated that specific levels of proficiency of specific languages are needed . They also want to see these i n combination with certa in majors (like business and engineering), and they find international experience very d esirable. Guidelines for state translation agencies also indicate Advance d level is required for success. Because so many graduates use Ge rman as a secondary career skil l, and they may be the only employee in their workplace with that skill, it is hard to obtain acrosstheboar d objective data on the pr ogram from employers. Career success : Some graduates benefit from Ger man in ways they never anticip ated. Graduate Dawn Reinhardt was homeschooled before coming t o WKU, took German at WKU, and eventually studied abroad. After graduation, she spent a year on a Fulbright Scholarship in Muni ch. She now works for a transportation agency outside of Washington, D.C. She credits her Fulbright experienc e with getting her where she is today. None of that would have happened without her having taken German at WKU. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Heritage speakers : A littleknown benefit of the German Program at WKU is that i t helps heritage speakers of German bring their skills to a pr ofessional level. A heritage s peaker is someone who grew up speaking the language at home, typically beca use they have a German parent. Their skills are typically very conversational, but not yet at a professional level. Recent program participants in this category are Jose ph Jones, Andrew Jones, Crystal Belcher, and Emily Corne lius. Emily is a major in Germa n and International Business who developed her reading and writing abilities while at WKU. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) DELO: The German Program offers Dual Credit through high schools in Bowling Green, Elizabethtown and Paris, Kentucky. In 201718, SCHP was at 90. Gifts: A German Work and Cultural Experience Scholarship was created by Laura McGee and Heike Armbrust. It makes 12 annual awards of $500 - 800 each for study abroad. Corporateuniversity partnerships : The German Program has cultivated a relationship with Bilstei n Cold Rolled Steel, a new Germanowned plant at the Kentucky Transpark. From this emerged an a greement with the Technical University Dortmund, and a student intern in Germany will be sponsored by Bilstein. Workforce development : The German Program Coordinator served as a resource to German investors in the region, most recently offering la nguage and cultural training t o large groups of new hires at Bilstein (Bowling Green) and Fritz Winter (Franklin). c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Program staffing : Most programs in the department have a tenure eligible facult y member who serves as program coordinator. The German Program is different in that it is served by one instructor who teaches lower division, and the department hea d, who teaches upper division c ourses, and also serves as Program Coordinator. Thus, the staffing is about 1.2 positions total. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) \"Preparing students for career and life in a global context\" (p . 6): The German Program provides communication and culture skills that prepare students for careers. At whatev er level majors and nonmajors take courses, they are enhancing their global competence. They learn to communicat e effectively in diverse work environments both at home and abroad. Students who complete the major become an a sset to their chosen employer. They can help US companies excel in their abilit y to sell abroad, and/or they can help German companies locate and thrive right here in Kentucky. They aid the U S in its cultural diplomacy and foster peace and international understanding. WKU is committed to \"providing a global context to the WKU Expe rience, both on the Hill and throughout the world (p. 8).\" A strong German Program offers structured skills development and integrated study abroad to prepare \"WKU graduates to enter a competitive global workforce\" (p. 9). WKU graduates across a wide variety of fields compete with others educa ted here and abroad who are bi and trilingual. This makes language and cultural training an essential part of the WKU experience, and it contributes to re gional prosperity. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The German Program addresses many of the six points in Objectiv e 9 when it connects to r egional employers to gather workforce needs information and to offer internships. It helps develop a globally competitive workforce (Impact, p. 7). The experience o f the German Pro gram has shown that German investors in Kentucky are more satisfied and more successful when they have cultural and langu age expertise available. Example: German and business major Alex Miller coled workforce training for US emp loyees hired by Bilstein. Graduates of the program find enhanced opportunities in their chosen career fields. Mich ael Bryant, a German m ajor with a minor in Computer Science, had a job befo re graduation with a computer c ompany that wanted to add his German to the company's skill set. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Kentucky Future Skills data shows projected growth in demand in management, architecture/engineering, production and transportation/log istics - many of the fields in which German majors intend to work. The Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce wants v ery much to attract investment in light industrial and manufacturing. At least four German and Austrian c ompanies have built in the Kent ucky Transpark and the region, and the intent is to bring in more. These companie s need employees at all areas - in management, human resources, sales, and manufacturing - all of whom need to be prepared to function wel l in a global workplace. These examples represent the foreign investment here. There are many more comp anies who manufacture h ere and want to sell in Europe. They also need German language and cultural expertis e to help them market effectively. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Program distinctiveness : The program is one of only a f ew postsecondary institutions i n Kentucky at which one can develop advanced level profic iency in German. German Progra ms have either been eliminated or transformed into a German Studies major at ma ny state institutions, making WKU almost unique. Th e German Program at WKU has an excellent reputation in the state due to the engagem ent of the German Program Coordinator in state professional organizations. These are the Kentucky World Langua ges Association and the Kentucky Chapter of the American Association of Teachers of German. WKU is known among high school German teachers and their students in Kentucky as a topqua lity destination for those who want to continue German in college. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) External assessment : The program is distinct for th e diversity of content areas in its upper division curriculum, and for its internal and external measurement of proficiency de velopment. Few, if any, other programs graduate students with a nationallyreco gnized assessment of proficiency in hand. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are potential newmarkets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The program sees an opportunity t o transform in multiple ways. It needs a more careeroriented approach to course content and the curriculum, new types of courses, establ ished collaborations with other programs, and more direct routes to career readiness. Major/minor : The program will realign these to lead more directly to caree r readiness. Opportunities for transformation include : (1) Further developing what is already a focus on communicati on over grammar to optimize proficiency outcomes, (2) Including more pr ofessionrelated communicative tasks at all levels, (3) expanding the current onesemester \"Business German \" course into a twosemester \"German for the Professions\" course pair that in clude site visits, shadowing, m iniinternships, and projec ts related to students' \"other\" major to develop dom ainspecific competency. New markets : (1) The program leadership w ill revamp its recruitment and re tention to include more and richer relationships with feeder high school programs and highpotenti al notyetfeeder programs in the state/region. (2) The program sees the opport unity to develop collaborations at WKU that lead to dual degrees (or tracks) for specific fields, for instance In ternational Engineering. The pr ogram has made contact w ith Engineering and will explore this. (3) The program w ill prepare students for careers through certificates in loca lization and translation. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) NCES data shows a slight downwar d trend in the number of foreig n languages, literatures and linguistics majors. The German Program at WKU has dr opped to a similar degree in th e same time frame. National trends in program design have included a focus on proficiency development and ass essment. In this area, the German Program is ahead of national trends. In addition, the program has made a s hift away from a primarily literaturebased curriculum to one that favors s kills development in a range of content areas, including culture, business, media, translation, and film. Only one literature course is in the reg ular upper division rotation on main campus, and it is required for teacher certificatio n. Graduates go into a wide ra nge of fields, and the program accordingly prepares them to communicate on a broad ra nge of professional and academ ic topics. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In its lower division courses, t he program has adopted opensou rce textbooks and textbooks published in Germany in order to lower cost for students. The program has ad justed the pace of its curriculum to focus more on skills development and less on \"covering\" content. It adjust ed scheduling, use of biterms, and sequencing of the rotation to foster the most productive outcomes. The Progra m Coordinator has begun advising, uses degree pathways, shares the multiyear course rotation, and integrates study abroad and car eer advising into the process. The recruiting plan includes (1) Dual credit and profe ssional development for teachers, (2) service by German faculty as National German exam administrators, (3) stat e level networking by the program coordinator, (4) internships in high schools German programs, (5) a freshman fora day experience, (6) letters to outstanding students, (7) club activities supported by both faculty members , and (8) contacts with alumni who return as guest speakers, skype in, or send career advice. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) (1) Offer Colonnade courses leadi ng to global com petency, to in clude communication skills and cultural content for diverse careers. (2) Include relevant Colonnade co urses among the major/minor el ectives. (3) Change Business German to a twocourse series on German for the Professions. (4) Establish direct rou tes to internships. (5) Create and market dual degrees/tracks, for example with Eng ineering. (6) Create localization and/or translation certificate(s). (7) Provide professional develop ment to teachers to help them b ecome qualified to offer Dual Credit German. Double the number of dual cred it relationships and SCHP. (8) Develop relationships with G erman companies in the region f or academic and philanthropic purposes. Within 610 years : The program will have stronger enrollments, greater student c redit hour production, and more graduates. What it will take: Program leade rship will need to: create new courses and revise the major, establish collaborations and dual degree(s), create a new minor or certif icate. It will need to have a robust recruiting plan. It will market a wellestablished path to careers that emerges fro m the productive synergy of strong learning outcomes, study abroad experiences, and internships. The progra m still runs on a languagerequirement staffing model. Now it needs its own TE l ine to lead these initiatives a nd foster a strong program. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The WKU Master of Arts in History program offers: Training in theory, practical skills, and objective content rel ated to the study of history. Flexibility to fit busy career sch edules with classes offered o nline as well as on campus Affordability to help professi onals advance their careers Various course options in U.S., European, and World History The Master of Arts in History is designed to prepare students: to teach history on the junio r and senior college level to enhance the preparation of secondary teachers of history who desire to meet certification requirements to provide the initial graduate work for those who intend to pu rsue a doctoral degree. In the past decade, this degree has served individuals who wish ed to begin or advance in fields such as education, government, and military. The MA program is a hy brid program. A mino rity of students (10 15%) attend courses oncampus and supplement these with online coursework. The great majo rity of students (8590%) are fully online since the y are working professionals who are not able to attend oncampus classes. The program offers both a the sis track (30 credit hours) and nonthesis track (36 credits). Courses are offered on a rotatin g basis and set up to allow ful ltime students to complete the M.A. in as little as two years. A parttime, nonthesis student who is balancing career and gradu ate work can complete the program in three years.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possib le. (maximum 200 words) The MA History program's curriculu m plays an important role in supplementing the core cu rricula of a number of WKU graduate programs. In the past f ive years, stude nts in the foll owing programs have enrolle d in our graduatelevel Grades, MAO rganizational MAEA dult Education, MAESecondary Ed. Teacher Leadership, and MATMiddle Grade s Ed. Approximately 17% of our enrollment every semester consists of students in other programs who chose our cla sses as their electives. Anothe r 8% are nondegree seeking students who are enrolled either because of personal inter est (mostly retirees) or becaus e they're considering switching careers. The department is also making th e steps necessary to offer its most advanced undergraduate students the JUMP option. As an increasing number of our undergraduates are applying to M A and Ph.D. programs, we have reason to believe that we have a \"builtin\" audience for a robust JUMP recruitment. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) History's MA program enrolls the most students (tied with Crimi nology) and generates the thirdhighest SCHP of any PCAL graduate program. The program confers the secondhighest n umber of degrees in PCAL (tied with English). 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data by IR 201314 Rate 7 85.7% 9 (N=3) 4.60 (N=5) 2.56 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Our graduates can: Apply a depth and breadth of subject matter expertise to curren t roles to become more k nowledgeable teachers and public historians. Conduct historical research thro ugh several resources such as c ourse papers and theses. Demonstrate a familiarity with mo re than one historiographic tr adition and the ability to s ynthesize different types of historical knowledge. The program's capstone requirement is a comprehensive examinati on that consists of a w ritten essay exam in three fields of concentration, followed by an oral exam. All students must comp lete successfully this capsto ne requirement to earn a degree. A panel of three faculty members in the student's field s of concentration assesses each student's performance. As part of our program assessment, the students' written and oral responses are assessed for evid ence the student's ability to synthesize historiography, histor ical theories, and evidence to make sound historical arguments. Faculty look for the student's ability to identify and discuss the vari ous and compe ting interpretations of major historical events and periods; an d the students' ability to make va lid general points about the pa st and support those points with specific information that was both accurate and relevant. The pass rate for the comprehensive examination is 90%. Based on our most recent round of assessment of completed compr ehensive exams, we have deci ded to design a onecredit mandatory course whose sole purpose would be to more intentiona lly prepare students to more effectively complete their written and oral exams. Both the adhoc review committee and th e department as a whole agreed that this onecredit course would equip graduate students with the skills necessary to perf orm as well in their capston e exams as they do in their coursework. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The History Department surveys its current students and alumni regularly. In 87% of the case s, MA students already are working professionals, and, in alm ost all cases, are KY educato rs who are seeking to move from Rank III to Rank II or are military personnel who are earnin g a degree and seeking a promo tion in rank. The remaining 13% are students seeking ad mission to nationally competitive Ph.D. programs or are between careers. In the past five years, 87% of students who have sought to advance the ir graduate education at the doctoral level have been successfully placed. Examples of P h.D. programs to which our al umni have been accepted include, Temple University, Loyola University, UNCChapel Hill, Ohi o State University, and North T exas University. The remaining 13% of our alums have either secured privatesector employment (such as Challenger Components ) or obtained employment in university libraries (WKU BG), community colleges (WKUG lasgow), and national parks. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Because students enrolled in the program are, in 90% of cases, already employed, the department does not systematically gather feedback from employers re garding the MA p rogram (school districts in particular). The department will laun ch a survey of alumn i, who work in a nu mber of different professions, in the spring 2019 semester. The History Department has also d esigned and will launch in 201 9 a survey of alumni of its undergraduate programs in History and Social Studies. Given that many of History's underg raduate alumni return to WKU to enroll in our MA program, we anticipate that the new sur vey will generate data that will help us to align even further our MA program's curriculum with the needs of working professionals. e. What else should evaluators know about thesuccess of studen ts in this program?(opti onal, maximum 100 words) As of this year, the graduate pro gram boasts four James Madison Fellows. The Madison Fellowships are nationally competitive awards that fund graduate education for teachers wh o will teach US Constitutional History and Government in secondaryschool classrooms. The James Madison Foundation award s only one fellowship per year per state. The fact that we have attracted four Madison Fello ws in two years speaks to the regional and national reputation of the MA progr am. Also, one of our graduate students has won a Fulbright Scholarship an d spent the year in Spain. All of the students who have applied to Ph.D. programs after h aving completed the MA program in the past five years have been accepted to nationally compe titive programs with full fund ing. 4.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The MA program is very cost effi cient since we offer, at most, 7 graduate courses per academic year (including summer). Since the standard course load in the History Department is a 4 3, the program's yearly course offerings equate to (no more than) one faculty member's standard course load. Since we offer five online graduate courses over the course of the fall, spring, and summer seme sters, all of which enroll, on average, no fewer than 10 graduate students, the History MA pro gram contributes to the department's overall DELO revenue, which adds up to approximately $2025K per year. Finally, history faculty with g raduate status consistently win prestigious, lucrative external grants and fellowships. In just the past two years, History faculty have won approximately $175K in external funding for research . Two of the recent awards (an ACLS Fellowship and a Rome Prize) provided fullyear research l eave buyouts for tw o faculty members. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) 1 The statistic related to the number of underenrolled sections does not provide an accurate picture of our course enrollments as it includes independent studies, thesiswriting hours, and maintain matriculation \"courses.\" As the numbers on the median class size indicate, our courses almost always en roll upwards of 10 graduate students and are generally above the university median. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Master of Arts in History is key to the \"Regional Lighthous e\" aspect of WKU's strategic plan. The MA program serves as a training ground that offers professi onal development to Kentucky s chool teachers. As such, the History MA helps align university priorities with educational i nstitutions in southcentral Kentucky to create mutually beneficial opportunities. The program's central purpose is to o ffer multiple pathways for i ndividuals to complete their graduate education as well as o ffer a quality graduate educatio n with the aim of fac ilitating lifelong lear ning and retraining . Dozens of working teachers in WKU's service area, many of whom are WKU undergrad alumni, have benefited from this training in the past five years. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The History MA is integral to pr oviding additional training for educators employed in Kentuck y's middle and high schools. Thus, the program advances Strategic Agenda Objective 4.1 which specifies that WKU ought to attract, retain, and prepare highly effective adult educators. The program advances Strategic Agenda Objective 6.1 and 6.2 because of its focu s on increasing persistence and timely completion for all enrolled graduate students. In fact, Dr. Plu mmer won the 2015 Potter College Award for Excellence in Advising. Our advising focuses on effective, researchbased pra ctices that increase retention and graduation. The individualized attention our stude nts receive remains the hallm ark our program as the gradu ate advisor reaches out to students individually at least th ree times a year to offer pers onalized advice and help. Our persistence and retention rates have kept up with university medians in large part because of o ur individualized approach. Our retention/graduation figures would be even higher if not for the fact that many of our stude nt's financial, personal, and pr ofessional context change over the course of the two or three years they advance in their MA c oursework. They are not always able to complete the program because of financial or personal problems or because th ey change career tracks. Strategic Agenda Objective 11.2 advocates strengthening communication and planning between high er education and regional/community leaders to id entify priorities and challenge s and align resources and programs to address them. As a department, we are dedicated to becoming a partner to local and regional school dist ricts in helping public school educators advance professionally. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Since the MA program's primary audience are social studies teac hers employed in the Bluegrass State, the department has a builtin market for recruitment and we're developing a plan to efficiently market our services to KY educators. Moreover, in the next five years, the 5Year Projected Demand b y Local Workforce Area shows that another 2,000 social studies teachers at the high sc hool level will be needed to mee t KY needs. The program will fo cus its recruitment effort to become one of the top choices for teachers wishing you advance in their careers. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference uniqueaspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The MA program in History is consistently ranked among the top twenty MA Online Programs in the country . The MA program is taught entirely with f ulltime, tenureeligible facu lty, which makes the program d istinctive compared to similar programs in Kentucky and nationally.

Prior to Augu st, 2018, teachers were requi red to earn Rank II through a boardapproved master's degree program in their first ten years of teaching. The Board made th is decision with the expectati on that most educators will continue to pursue MA degrees in order to advance professionall y and attain a higher rank. Since this kind of change ultimately creates more autonomy for individual educators and l ocal schools to innovate and i mprove, the department will reach out to local school districts to brainstorm ideas for ho w the WKU History MA might bes t serve KY educators as they continue to seek promotion from Rank III to Rank II. Moreover, we are currently exploring ways of creating more intentional partnerships with the MAE and MAT programs in the spirit of fos tering new interdisciplinary connections. this change to regulations will be a great oppor tunity for the History departm ent to draw more interested teachers into its MA program\u2014 particularly those who are interested in honing the content ele ment of their coursework. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National trends indicate that builtin demand for the History M A will continue and national statistic s offer the History department good reason to be optimistic about the future of its MA program. According to the most recent figures from NAES, MAs in History an d Social Sciences are the seventh most f requently awarded master's degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions. Moreo ver, since the early 2000s, th e number of History and Social Science Master's degrees has remained strikingly stable, rang ing between 18,000 and 20,000 n ationally. Therefore, based on national trends, it is more than likely that a builtin national demand for an MA in Histor y will remain constant. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) As a department, we have implemented the following changes in t he past three years: 1. We have streamlined the program requirements and no longer requ ire a language proficien cy skill as part of the degree unless knowledge of the l anguage is directly applicable to the student's thesis re search area. Since the majority of our students are not writing master's theses, this change has enhanced students' progress toward earning their MA degree. 2. We have cut down the number of o nline courses offered in order to ensure a robust enrollm ent for each class we offer. Currently we offer two co urses in the Fall and Spring se mester and one course in the Summer. This has allowed us to make the online graduate course rotation more pre dictable and efficient. 3. We have initiated the procedure to join the JUMP program, which should reflect positively on our enrollments and help us hone our recruiting strategy. 4. We are in the process of revising our marketing plan, and targe ting KY educators specific ally, making our program the # 1 destination for KY educat ors to earn their MA credentia ls. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Impediments: Since the program started, the number of institutions that off er an online MA in history has increased. Currently, there are approximately 30 such programs. As our enr ollments have stabilized sin ce 2015, we ar e devising a marketing plan that would allow us to continue to compete natio nally while tapping more intent ionally into the SOKY market. Our most obvious disadvantage is our high price point relative to other Online MA program. For instance, Indiana State University offers Indiana residen ts a percredit rate of $412 w hile WKU's resident rate is $60 7. Moreover, Online MA History programs in IN (Indiana State U.) and PA (Pittsburgh State U.) offer reduced precredit rates to students from neighboring states. The fact that we do not offer similar financial incenti ves, places us at a disadvantage. Proposed solution: Since we cannot, at this point, compete on price point, we are planning to A. implement a more robust marketing program focused on a KY audie nce and B. more aggressively recruit from the most natural target populati on/profession: KY middle and high school educators. By emphasizing the personalized nature of our instruction and a dvising, the quality of our pedagogy, and th e variety of our courseofferings, we can conti nue to build on our stable and co nsistent enrollments. The idea is to posit ion ourselves as the destination for those KY educators driven to earn a History MA and boost their professional credentials. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The History program (33 hours) e ducates WKU's undergraduate stu dents, both majors and nonmajors, about the value of history and a lib eral arts education. History students master an inte llectual skillset and develop a broad knowledge of American and world history from premodern times to the present. The skillset includes cri tical thinking, research and data analysis/synthesis, creative problem solving, and wri tten and oral argument and com munication. History is interdisciplinary by design: students must complete a second major or minor, and the program accepts up to 6 credit hours from related disciplines. Mastering the History skillset pr epares students for lifelong l earning and success in a w ide array of professions, including teaching, business, government, and law. The History program is integral to the WKU educational mission. Its two World History c ore courses (HIST 101 and 102) are also required core cours es in Colonnade \"Foundations,\" and all WKU students must complete one of them. Upperlevel courses are a Colonnade \"Connections\" mainsta y, as well. History offers more Colonnade courses than any other departm ent and generated 1182 hours of S CHP in \"Connections\" in the 201718 AY. For all that it provides, Histor y's delivery costs are low, its revenues generated hi gh (12,615 SCHP for the department last year), and the la rge majority of instruction is delivered by tenuretrack faculty. History program coursework is delivered to students in all avai lable modes and is ta ught on all campuses. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The History faculty has committed itself to teaching all WKU st udents, majors and nonmajors alike. This commitment is integral to the H istory Department's mission and has shaped the History program's curriculum, pedagogy, and staffing strategy for several decades. The depart ment devotes its best talent to advancing this mission: tenuretrack faculty members teach the large majority of the courses offered at every level. The History faculty performs an enormous volume of undergraduat e service teaching, especially in the Colonnade Program. Colonnade includes 23 History courses, more than any o ther department at WKU. Because of its prominent place in WKU's general education program, History is integral to the university's educational mission. World History courses (HIST 101 an d 102) are required core cour ses in Colonnade \"Foundations,\" and all WKU students must complete one of t hem. HIST 101/102 generated 9,54 1 SCHP last year. Upperlevel history courses are a \"Connections\" mainstay. Hi story generated 1182 hours of S CHP in \"Connections\" last year. WKU alumni account for a significant portion of the History dep artment's graduate student body. The Social Studies major depends on History program offerings. Social Studies students must take 27 hours of History coursework, and nearly all of them doublemajor in Hist ory. All social studies tea chers in Tennessee must major in History. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The History program's enrollments and degree conferrals have st abilized in the past two yea rs. History is the third largest program in Potter College and is significantly larger t han the WKU average. The History program generates an enormous volume of SCHP very e fficiently, using mostly tenuretrack faculty. Over the last five years, Histor y program faculty members' aver age annual SCHP is 41% hig her than the university average. Staffing shortages have forced Hi story to reduce upperlevel co urse offerings, resulting in student course enrollment and graduation bottlenecks. The History department's tenuretrack faculty shrank from 20 to 17 members between 2016 and 2018. Thi s staffing gap has been fille d partially, but with temporary instructors. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 Rate 38 73.7% 27 77.8% 71.4% program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The History faculty sy stematically assesses the research papers in the program's capstone course, HIST 498: Senior Seminar, to evaluate the ability of History students to engage in advanced undergraduate historical research, critical thinking, dat a analysis/synthesis, creative problem solving, and written and oral argument and communication. History students have perform ed well in the caps tone, and the department does not plan to change the program curriculum. History's statistical indicators of student success over the pa st five years are solid. Th e fiveyear averages of students' first year retention rate, progression, graduation ra te, and time to degree compare favorably to the university averages. To keep up with national trends i n the field, the History Depar tment changed the curriculum's core courses beginning in Fall 2014. History s tudents, who had previously be en required to take two core courses focusing on the history of Western Civilizatio n, now must complete a core c ourse in World History. Department faculty members met regularly for two years during implementation to de velop a common syllabus, refine the course structure, and workshop teaching strategies. The department als o changed the curriculum in 2017 to allow for up to six credit hours from other d isciplines to count toward the History major, thereby promoting greater interdisciplinarity and flexibility for students. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Employers value the skills that History students master - criti cal thinking, research and data analysis/synthesis, creative problem solving, and wri tten and oral argument and com munication. National surveys show that most History majors find work in busin ess or management fields (80% of graduates, according to glassdoor.com). They earn as much as or more than business, life sciences, and many STEM majors over the course of their professional lives (according to Pay Scale.com and the American Academy of Ar ts and Sciences). WKU History majors are required to major or minor in ano ther academic discipline and w ork in a wide variety of fields after graduation, including teaching, government, and law, or go o n to graduate s chool. Around half of WKU's History majo rs also major in Social Studie s, which prepares them to teach social studies in secondary schools. The Commonwea lth identifies secondary school social studies as a \"Critical Shortage Instructional Area and Subject,\" and lists WKU's service area ( and other Kentucky regions) as critically short of trained social studies teachers. Tennessee also cites social st udies teaching as a critica l shortage area. The CEBS 20172020 Strategic Plan cites Soci al Studies as a strategic gr owth opportunity field because of these shortages. State employment statistics show that most WKU Social Studies g raduates find teaching jobs in the Commonwealth. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Because the program prepares st udents for a wide array of possi ble professional futures, the department does not systematically gather feedback from employers regarding the History curriculum. The department surveys students in the capstone course regardin g their plans and their feedback on how well the History major has prepared them for postgraduation life. Stude nts report satisfaction with the History major and the quality of the program's faculty. In 2018, the department designed a survey of alumni, who work i n dozens of different professions. The alumni survey will launch in the spring 2019 semester. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) The successes of our awardwinning alumni highlight how well th e History program trains students for professional life. The Kentucky Department of Education named a lumnus Ron Skillern the 2017 \"Kentucky Teacher of the Year.\" In the past three years, three alumni, Jesse Brewer, Kendrick B ryan, and Claire Bellar, won James Madison Fellowships, nationallycompetiti ve awards that fund graduate e ducation for teachers who will teach US Constitutional History and Gover nment in secondaryschool class rooms. The James Madison Foundation awards only one fellowship per year per state. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

Under Enrolled Sections *** 38.0% 30.4% 41.3% 46.7% 31.1% 36.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) History faculty consistently win prestigious, lucrative externa l grants and fellowships. In just the past two years, History faculty have won approx imately $175K in external fundin g for research. Two of t he recent awards (an ACLS Fellowship and a Rome Prize) provided fullyear research l eave buyouts for two faculty members. Through online, winter term, and summer term teaching, the Hist ory program generates a significant volume of DELO revenue, approximately $2025K per year. The program generates significant philanthropic interest, and H istory's alumni and friends are very faithful donors. History holds one of onl y three endowed professorships in Potter College (The Frockt Family Professorship in History). Alu mni and supporters donate $1530K per year to the department. History has amassed a foundation account tot aling $150K, which is used to s upport programming, student scholarships and awards, faculty research, and st rategic initiatives and purchas es. The History Departme nt awarded approximately $22K in donorsupported scholarsh ips to History students in 201 718. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) History program faculty members are very productive and average d 528 SCHP/FTF per year over the past five years, 41% higher than WKU's ave rage. The History department's total SCHP last year (12, 615) equaled 44 percent of the total undergrad SCHP of University College and 55 percen t of CEBS' undergraduate SCHP. Service teaching of History's core courses, HIS T 101/102, accounts for approxima tely 70 percent (9,541) of the department's SCHP. To estimate costs, SCH P for the History and Social Studies majo rs were combined, since coursework offered by the History Department to support these majors is the same, wit h the only difference being the number of History credit hours each program requir es. Also, nonprogramrelated f aculty effort (HIST 101/102 service teaching and MA program teaching) was taken out of the equation. *** DATA NOTES: For the History program, the median class sizes are higher and the % upperdi vision sections underenrolled ar e lower than the data indicate. WKU dat a erroneously count HEEC section s, ITV sections, and teamtaught , interdisciplinary course sect ions as free standing course sections, when th ey are not. Data also count in ternships and independent studi es as \"low enrollment\" sections, when they are not. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) History offers most of its curri culum concurrently in Colonnade and is deeply integrated into Colonnade's HIPs, thus ensuring \"preparation for c areer and life in a global cont ext\" and \"that WKU students graduate with skills to think critically, solve problems , and engage effectively with o thers.\" Every WKU student must take a World History course, which provides a n effective \"shared intellectua l experience\" for all students and teaches global outlooks and cultural competencie s, a key strategic goal of WKU 's educational mission. History's tenuretrack faculty p erforms the large majority of t he teaching, from the 100 level to the most advanced undergraduate courses. Assessments in all classes inco rporate analytical essay writing, which hones many intellectual skills and requi res intensive, timeconsuming mentoring and grading by the History faculty. Every student at the university benefits from this rigorous ped agogy delivered by History' s talented, experienced, permanent faculty. Students are prepared to succeed at WKU and in a wide array of postgraduation professions. History's average firstyear rete ntion rate is significantly hi gher than the university average, serving to \"significantly increase first to second year retention.\" Scores of History alumni teach in area schools and serve as exc ellent \"Alumni Ambassadors.\" They recruit WKU students constantly, thus ng the strategy, \"Incorporate alumni into undergraduate recruitment activities.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The program's courses are core c omponents of and instrumental t o the delivery of the Colonnade Program, which is WKU's primary response to Str ategic Agenda Objective 8.4 (Cu rriculum should meet learning outcomes as articulated in AACU's LEAP initiative). The History program is integral to the Social Studies major, wh ich trains students to teach in Kentucky's secondary schools. Thus, the program advances Strategic Agenda Objective 4.1 (Attract, retain, and prepare highly effective adult educators). The History program advances Stra tegic Agenda Objective 2.5 (pr ovide dual credit exper iences for secondary school students). History overs ees the delivery of dozens of se ctions of dual credit HIS T 101/102 instruction each year, many of which are staffed by History program alumni who t each in the Commonwealt h's secondary schools. History's curriculum delivers cu ltural competencies and global perspectives to all WKU students, which advances the Strategic Agenda's objective t o \"advance social, artistic, cultural, and environmen tal progress\" in order to \"increase happiness and wellbein g and make Kentucky an attract ive place to live and work.\" Finally, it is notable that the History program's first year re tention and progression rates are higher than the WKU average, thus advancing the Str ategic Agenda's goal of graduati ng students quickly. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) There are no historyspecific ca tegories in the state workforce statistics other than teach ing history at universities (a shrinking employment sector, for sure!). However, employers value the skills that Hi story students master, including critical thinking, res earch and data analysis/synthes is, creative problem solving, and written and oral argument and communication. Natio nal surveys indicate that the most History majors find work in business or management fields (80% of gra duates, according to glassdoor.com ), and that they earn as much as business, life sciences, and many STEM majors o ver the course of their profess ional lives (according to PayScale.com and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences). As explained earlier in this eval uation, around half of History 's majors also major in Soci al Studies, which prepares them to teach social studies in secondary schools. Both Kentuck y and Tennessee are experiencing critical shortages of social studies teach ers. WKU can fill this void by training more social studies teachers. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The History Department teaches t he History curriculum almost en tirely with fulltime, tenureeligible faculty, which makes the program distinct ive, and higherquality, compar ed to others in Kentucky. The History faculty distinguishes itself through innovative, hi ghquality teaching and mentorship of students. In the last three years, History fa culty members Marko Dumani, P atti Minter, and Beth Plummer have won college and/or university awards for tea ching, advising, and public ser vice (see the next section on History's distinctive philosophy of public service). The History program is one of WK U's most visible and publiclyi nfluential programs. Its faculty plays a critical role in campus leadership, governanc e, and public service and includ e a ProvostEmeritus, a Representative to the Kentucky House of Representatives, two former Faculty Regents, and three past chairs of the University Senate. Its alumni include current KY S upreme Court Chief Justice John Minton, Jr., whose fathe r, former WKU President John Minton, Sr., was a member of the History Department facult y. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The History Department's faculty prides itself in training WKU students - majors and nonmajors - to be engaged citizens who understand the histo rical context of today's most difficult problems, and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to help solve them. WKU's historians are p ublic intellectuals who model public service and engaged citizenship for their st udents and the broader communit y beyond the University. Our History students, many of whom go on to teach in Kentucky's public schools, also carry out this mission when they graduate and become engaged citizens of the Commonwealth. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) WKU should exploit the tremendous opportunities that could be r ealized by expanding History and its sister program, Social Studies, to meet a critical workforce need in W KU's service area, throughout the Commonwealth, and in neighboring states. Kentucky and Tennessee need many more social studies teachers. The Commonwealth identifies secondarylevel (grades 712) social studies as a \"Critical Shortage Instructio nal Area and Subject,\" and lis ts WKU's service area as one that is in dire need of more social studies teachers. Tenne ssee school districts are issuing more and more social studies \"outoffield\" te aching waivers, an indication t hat too few qualified teache rs are available to staff classrooms. State employment statistics indicate that social st udies teaching is a highdemand profession and that teaching one of the largest emplo yment sectors for college grad uates in Kentucky. For t hese reasons, CEBS' 2017 2020 strategic plan indicates tha t social studies teaching is a strategic growth opportuni ty. The History faculty agrees. The department revised the Histo ry program in 2017 to allow for up to 6 credit hours of c oursework from related disciplines to count toward the major. This will help to increa se interdisciplinary connections between history and related disciplines, as well as p otentially allow students to g raduate more quickly. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The program's enrollments have sta bilized over the past two yea rs. The History program' s enrollment trends align with national trends. The progra m experienced a sharp, unpreced ented, upward spike in enrollments in the wake of the Great Recession, followed by a decline th at continued to 2016. The Commonwealth's identification of social studies teaching as a \"critical need,\" high demand job mirrors national trends, as well. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) History wants students to gradua te more quickly. To that end, H istory revised the program to allow students to count 6 hours of relevant, nonHistory coursework toward the ma jor. History proposed more courses for Colonnade \"Connections\" and now offers more Colonnade courses ( 23) than any other department at WKU, thus benefiting all WKU students. We have changed scheduling for upp er level History coursework, and offered more courses online, to accommodate So cial Studies majors who are en gaged in required student teaching internships. History has implemented two initiatives to enhance Colonnade te aching and student recruiting. First, the History faculty now facilitates pedagogic al collaboration among HIST 10 1/102 instructors at any K entucky institution, including high schools and community colleges that are unaffili ated with WKU but that offer the courses for WKU credit. We expect th is initiative to imp rove HIST 101/102 pedag ogy and build stronger bonds with teachers, alumni, and students in our region. Second, the faculty is piloting a new pedagogy that will be imp lemented throughout our m ajor and will serve as a useful new \"HIP\" for HIST 101/102. The method, use d at hundreds of colleges, immerses students in collaborative, scenariobased gam e playing revolving around tur ning point moments such as the French and American Revolutions. Students take on roles of historical char acters and, in the process, engage in \"deep learning\" about the subject matte r and acquire critical thinkin g and other skills that th ey do not acquire in traditional classrooms. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The natural stable enrollment le vel for the History program app ears to be 225275 students, given the program's historical enrollment trends (see past Academic Program Reviews for context) and the high demand for social studies teachers in the region. As explained earlier in this evaluation, the department remains shortstaffed and cannot offer enough upperlevel courses to satisfy students' dem and. Because of this situation, students are finding it more difficult to register for required coursework and complete the major's requirements quick ly. Furthermore, it is not possible for the department to reassign faculty me mbers to teach more upperleve l courses. The department is obligated to offer a large number of Colonnade \"Foundations\" sections ( HIST 101/102 ) and does not have a budget for additional staff. The department could meet current demand and expand the History program with three additional tenuretrack faculty lines and a permanent budget for parttime instructors and graduate assistants . These faculty lines and GAs would also serve the Social Studies program. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)?

(maximum 200 words) The International Affairs major is an interdisciplinary major w ith a Political Science core that is designed to provide studen ts with the knowledge and skills to s ucceed in a variety of career choices. The program requires seven core courses across four disciplines, an additional 12 hour s of Political Science electi ves, and 12 nonPolitic al Science electives. Apart from the se nior seminar, the core courses are offered as face to face classes a nd through online delivery. The electives are designed to provide flexibility for students to focus on particular regions or themes and allows them to ta ilor their course of study to meet their future ac ademic and professional goals. The major p rovides a coherent program of international study as opposed to isolated course offerings across campus culminating in a senior seminar. The major serves not only as an attractive primary major but also as a useful secondary major t o complement other programs of study to provide additional skills and a global perspective t o improve graduates' competiti ve edge in the marketplace. The major requires a minor or additional major. Students must also satisfy a modern foreign language requirement at the sophomore level for the major.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The IA program provides required courses and elective for sever al other majors (Political Sci ence, International Business, Social Studies, Arabic, Asian Re ligions and Cultures, Chinese F lagship) as well as several m inors and certificates. The International Affairs major provides courses in the Colonna de Program at both the Explorations (PS250, PS260) and Connections levels (six courses ). During the 1718 academic ye ar, the program offered 4 Honors sections and has 8 scheduled this year. The IA major is interdisciplinar y with students required to tak e core courses in History, Geography and Economics and 12 hours of approved nonPolitical S cience electives. Nearly eigh ty percent of majors have a second major, ten percent a third major and more than twenty percent have more than one minor as IA provides an important contribution to prepare WKU students for the global stage w ith the necessary skills to meet the demands of the workplace whether in south central Kentucky or beyond. Over fifty percent of majors have particip ated in a study abroad program or internship. All of the departmental IA faculty offer study abroad programs, partner with other units to brin g in speakers and participate in events and have taken leadership positions in WKU initiative s such as 'the Year of.' c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The IA major is relatively new program and first enrolled stude nts in 2009. The program has seen fairly steady growth and reached a high of 90 students in 2017. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The following learning outcomes are used in the International A ffairs major. Outcome 1. Students w ill demonstrate knowle dge of the dynamics of the international political and economic system and an understanding of the causes of change and mechanisms to manage change. Outcome 2. Students will acquire knowledge and me thods needed for critical assessment of int ernational processes and the complex relationship between dom estic and international issues. Outcome 3. Students will develo p an understanding of diverse r egions, cultures and countries and demonstrate the ability to perceive events from more than one cultural viewpoint. These outcomes are reviewed by t he assessment committee through random selection of research papers and examinations in PS250, PS260 and PS497. Init ial targets were established at 70% or higher for meeting basic expectations. The yearly average is over 80% meeting these requirements. Outcome 4. Students will recogniz e cultural differences and de monstrate an ability to interact effectively and appropriately in international and/or multicultural contexts. The major also encourages study abroad and internship opportuni ties. The department sponsors several faculty led programs. Students also have th e opportunity to participate in the Model United Nations (PS300) and Soliya program (a virtual exchange program with students in the Middle East). The senior seminar (PS497) is a capstone experience for our maj ors where students are able to demonstrate their knowledge of important subject areas within the major, conduct and presen t their research and write a portfolio (literature review and policy prescriptions) on a key issue and re gion of their choice . The Department noticed a g ap in skills between students engaged in FUSE grants and Honor s thesis and those not so invol ved and revised the curriculum to include PS301 (research methods) to better prepare all st udents for the rigors of gradu ate study and to encourage more majors to apply for research scholarships. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We aggregate data from a number of sources and maintain a sprea dsheetto track postgraduate success of our students. Sources of data include exit interviews, social media, and ong oing communication between students and faculty mentors. For the 2016, 2017, 2018 academic years, we have been able to t rack the post graduate success for over 85% of our graduates. Out of these student s, slightly over half (53%) are employed in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors. Employers include Air Force Int elligence, DHS, Hogan Lovells (L ouisville Law Firm), Brookings In stitution, and Peace Corps. Approximately 41% are attending graduate school while two (6%) are currently completing fellowships abroad (Fulbright and Princeton in Asia). For IA majo rs pursuing advanced degrees, i nternational affairs/studies, p ublic policy, and law school are the three most common fields. Schools attended include UPenn S chool of Law, UK, Vanderbilt, and WKU. Four graduates are currently pursuing graduates degrees overseas. Overall, at least 1/3 of IA graduates have some kind of interna tional experience immediately after graduation. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Due to the nature of the career paths of our graduates, the bes t source for how well the program has prepared them for graduate school or employment often comes from the students the mselves. We have a fairly high percentage of graduates who stay in touch with faculty. Feedback from these students p rovides insight on what seems to work and identifies where additional improvement can be ma de. Two common themes from alu mni were 1) they wish they had engaged in research and 2) those attending graduate school either appreciated havin g been introduced to data anal ysis or wished they had taken a research methods course to be tter prepare them for graduate s chool. Based on this feedback, we have made an effort to inform students of and encourage them to participate in researc h opportunities. We also added PS 301 (Research Methods) as an elective to the IA major. If students express an interes t in graduate school during advising sessio ns, faculty encourag e students to take research methods and explore research opportun ities while at WKU. Multiple students who have pursued employment in the private and public sectors have also emphasiz ed the benefits of experienc e with quantitative data analysis. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Our students have been awarded prestigious internships and scho larships setting the stage for future career options. From 20162019 IA students have been placed in the following interns hips and earned the awards highlighted below. Internships: State Department: United States Foreign Service Internship (4 r ecipients) and Virtual Student Fo reign Service Internship (2); State Department internships in Beijing, Oslo, Ottawa Institute of Internation al Education Internship Awards (Scholarships & Fellowships): Critical Language Schola rships (7 recipients) Gilman Scholarship (9) Boren Scholarship (5) Rangel Fellowship Fulbright ETA (2) FreemanASIA (2) Global Rotary Grant Truman 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) External research grants include those from the Academy of Kore an Studies (AKS), the Chiang ChiangKuo Foundation, the Global Taiwan Institute, the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy an d the Association of Asian Studies. The program has received at least one external grant each year for the years un der consideration. These grants have led not only to course buyouts but also to the enhancement of student research opportu nities through the hiring of undergraduate research assistants and coauthored and so loauthored publications. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) For academic years 1314, 1516, and 1718, the % of underenro lled sections is inflated becau se of courses (PS 490, 491, 492, 493) offered off load as pa rt of the Kentuc ky Legislative Research Internship program. They typically have between 13 students enrolled in them. The inclusion of these courses also lowers the median class sizes i n those years. Additionally, there are additional internship sections offered every semester that would have similar impact. Our connections with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Represent ative Office have frequently resulted in language scholarships for students to intensively study Chinese in Taiwa n over the summer. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Examples of how the IA program c ontributes to the WKU strategic plan: Our Students Objective 4 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategy 2 - Work...to expand offcampus and on campus educationa l opportunities Objective 5 - Preparation for the Global Stage Strategy 1 provide...highimpact practices 50% of IA students participate in Study Abroad programs. IA fac ulty lead at least two study abroad programs annually. IA/PS faculty emphasize undergraduate r esearch (FUSE, Honors theses, and conference presentations). Objective 3 Completion and Success Past three years, program has exceeded University averages for retention, progression and graduation rates. Time to completion is less than WKU average. Our Hill Objective 3 - A Culture of Innovation Strategy 1 Support and Enhance the Colonnade Program Program offers two Exploration courses and six Connections cour ses in Colonnade.

Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Objective 8. Strategy 4. Prepare Kentucky students by strengthening essential learning o utcomes associated with AACU LEAP initiative. The IA curriculum aligns closely with many components of the LE AP campaign. This includes understanding human cultures the intellectual and practical skills emphasize in our courses. This skills include Inquiry and analysis, Critical and creati ve thinking, Written and oral communication, and more recently Qua ntitative literacy. Objective 9. Improve career readiness and em ployability of pos tsecondary edu cation graduates. Data indicate our graduates are well prepared for graduate stud ies and postgraduat e employment. In ad dition to soft skills and an introduction to data ana lysis that employers are looking for, the IA major helps dev elop language skills that are becoming increasingly important in the job market. The IA majo r requires foreign language through the intermediate level (203), but more of our majors are now pursuing a 2nd major in a foreign language. Objective 10. Strategy 4. Increase opportunities for under graduate to conduct or assist i n research. Promoting undergraduate is a priority for the program. IA facu lty have supervised 23 FUSE projects, advised Honors theses, and utilized undergraduate resea rch assistants. S tudent have p resented at regional, national, and international conferences and coauthored several publications with faculty. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Since our IA graduates enter a wide range of fields, it is diff icult to find directly applicable numbers using KCES and other national data. Looking more gen erally at fields related to whe re our graduates are employed, there is general growth in many of those fields. This incl udes the legal profession, busi ness, lobbying/politics, n onprofits, and public relations/marketing. According to Burning G lass and the New Amer ican Economy, there is increased demand for employees who can speak multiple languages. In particul ar, employers are looking for s tudents who can speak Chinese, Spanish, or Arabic. As highlighted elsewhere, IA majors m ust attain at least intermedi ate proficiency in a language. The program has seen an increase in students who choose Chinese or Arabic for their lan guage. When compared with other college graduates, Hamilton Project da ta indicate that IA/IR majors do well professionally. After 10 years, the median income for International Relations (the fi eld closest to IA in their study) majors is roughly 14% higher than for all majors. Likewise, projected lifetime earnings for the median IR major is 13% greater than the median lifetime earnings for all majors. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The International Affairs major at WKU is an interdisciplinary degree with a core in Political Science. This contrasts to International Studies majors (e.g . University of Kentucky) whic h are simply an aggregate of co urses with an international dimension. Our major is designed to provide students knowledge and skills to compete suc cessfully in the global marketplace. A key and fairly unique component of the program is the language requirement t hat all graduates must pass the intermediate level of a language. The reputation of the program ca n be illustrated by the high GP A and ACT scores of entering students, the number of students receiving competitive sc holarships, student research, and participation in study abroad and internship opportunities. The program participates in university sponsore d recruitment efforts through the Department of Political Science, including min ority recruitment e fforts. It also recru its students through the Honors Program and other unique offerings such as the Chinese Fl agship program. Students in ot her majors, seeking particular international and/or regional skills choose IA as a second major to enhance their major. Req uired core political science cou rses are offered face to face, online, and, in the case of PS250, on demand. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Several possibilities exist to e nhance and strengthen the progr am going forward. We are current ly exploring opportunities to develop relationships with unive rsities in East Asia. If these relationships come to fruit ion, there will likely be more opportunities for exchange prog rams and student research. A subtle change that can help improve career opportunities for IA grads is to continue to work closely and perhaps even expand the relationship with the Chinese and Arabic programs. Both languages expand employment opportunities for our graduates. By developing stro ng language skills, IA majors can further differientiate them selves from other majors. There is also likely an opportuni ty to modify the curriculum to increase student exposure to research methods and data analysis. This would help stude nts develop technical skills th at will serve them well in gradua te school and in the pursuit o f employment and career opportunities. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) It is difficult to find a direct e quivalent using NCES data. O ne related category is Social Sci ences and History which has se en a decline in students of about 10% form 201112 to 201516. A se cond possible category related to the IA program is multi or interdisciplinary studies which ha s seen an increase of 7% duri ng the same time. For the five years covered in this study, th e number of students enrolled in the IA major has increased from 64 to 89. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The IA program has made the following changes to strengthen the major. The major was modif ied to require 12 hours of political science electives and 12 hours of electives from othe r disciplines. At th e same time, Research Methods was added as an elective to the major. The goals of these changes was to encourage students to develop skills rela ted to quantitative data analysis and to r eflect an increase in political science o fferings that are appropriate to serve as electives for the maj or. Another change that has been made to the program is to add more upper levels courses into Colonnade. The program now has six courses in Connections. The impact of this change does not show up in the data presented here, but is reflected in enrollments for Spring 2019. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We are confident that this progra m will continue to recruit str ong students and produce high quality graduates. The anticipation is th e program will remain at about 80100 stu dents, but there is some potential to strategically grow the program. The biggest challenge to do so is the ability to incr ease the program's exposure to potential students. As we wrap up the first decade of the program, we also anticipa te taking a closer look at the program to see if it is time to make some changes to the curriculum to enhance the learning exp erience for students. The biggest challenge facing the program is the availability of adequate and predictable resources to promote high impact learning practices for students. It is particularly important that adequate resources are avai lable to support and promote faculty and undergraduate research. Continued institutional su pport for facultyled study abroad courses is also important for IA students. Historically, we have also offer ed a wide range of other engage ment opportunities for students. Despite tightening budgets, we have been able to continue pa rticipation in Model UN and Sol iya. Both are good opportunities for student engagement and would offer marketing opportunities if stable funding is fo und to support both programs. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Journalism Major ( 736), previously the News/Editorial Journalism Major(716): prepares students for professional careers in the media; instills in student s a high degree of professiona lism, which consists principally o f practical competence and ethical understanding; develops analytical thinking and writing skills; and enhances s tudents' understandin g of the role of th e news media in a democratic socie ty. The program's accreditation , through the Accrediting Counsel for the Education of Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC), requires a minor ou tside the School of Journa lism & Broadcasting and a minimum of 72 hours of baccalaur eate degree work outside the ma jor, which includes Colonnade requirements and minor course requirements. Major admission requirements are: 1. Completion of a minimum of 24 hours of course work applicabl e to a baccalaureate degree. 2. A minimum overall grad e point average of 2.5. 3. Completion of ENG 100 with a grade of \"C\" or better and nine additional hours in the Colonnade Program. 4.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 The WKU Mission states: \"Western Kentucky University prepares students of all backgroun ds to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizenl eaders of a global society.\" Few programs contribute more t o this mission than the Journali sm Major. Students in Journalism g raduate prepared for work at any news m edia outlet or for any p osition in professional communications. Along the way, they get oneonone academic and career advising from the jou rnalism faculty \u2014 and the knowledge and skills to m ake a difference. The Journalism multimedia curriculum offers students the opportunity to pursu e a wide range of careers including: news reporting and editing for all media; public information officers; corporate communications; nonprofit communi cations. Law schools recruit h eavily from journalism sch ools, particularly the SJB Journalism major, becaus e the core courses develop interpersona l communication skills, resea rch and writing. These same skills are widely sought in the business sector. The Journalism program offers an array of courses for students in all majors who seek a better understanding of and competency in professional media standards. For example, the JO UR 202 News Writing Course is required for PR and Public Communication majors. The JOUR 3 01 Press Law class draws studen ts from Political Science, H istory and Legal Studies. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communicat ion (ACEJMC) is the accredit ing body for Broadcasting, Journalism and Photojournalism. It sets standards concerning cl ass size, number of courses in each major, and diversity in the classroom. SJ&B meets these standa rds by limiting classrooms si zes to 20 students, regularly a ssessing our course offerings, and offering courses in diversity. Being an accredited program allows our students to enter the William Randolph Hearst competition. Journalism's fulltime faculty frequently teach overloads or in dependent study classes to make sure students are able to graduate in four years. Addition ally, faculty coordinate multip le student internships throughout the full academic year. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The Journalism Major uses a vari ety of assessment measures incl uding: direct measures such as senior portfolio reviews by industry professionals and faculty, cap stone projects, internship evaluations and First Amendment exams provide the bulk of asses sment information. Feedback from professionals rev iewing senior portfolios provi des the impetus for the major' s curriculum changes and skills and competencies taught within the core courses. The major uses indirect measures including employment data an d student awards. The major has a LinkedIn Alumni Group and a Facebook page. Informal senior exit interview s with the major coordinator an d director have also provided feedback that led to change. The SJ&B faculty approved a revised assessment plan as part o f its reaccreditation that went into effect in 2015. The plan is meant to better serve the major and its students by providing i nformation more appropriate to industry changes and to the new curriculum. As a result of reaccreditation and feedback from the major's Professional Advisory Committee and research on Journalism programs, the major has added a diversity course requirement, s kills courses in software use and added emphasis on ethical social media use in repo rting in core courses. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a ndincorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Journalism Major graduates ar e extremely successful in a ra nge of professional media areas. A survey of majors done for reaccreditation in 201 5 showed all the graduates (approximately 45 respondents) employed. Approximately 50 percent were in traditional news media jobs, primarily in Kentucky and the r egion. Others worked in a variet y of fields, onlineonly specia lty news publications, public information, corporate communications , nonprofit communications, h igh school teaching (media and English), and web content production. The information gathered for ACE JMC reaccreditation selfstudy provides the school information on our graduates' career pursuits and success. Other means include informal surveys, con tacts through social media, etc. Individual Journal Major faculty also maintain strong relationships with graduates, part icularly those who they advised and/or who worked in student media. Information on shifting industry standards is gleaned fr om the Journalism Major Profe ssional Advisory Committee and by faculty returning to newsroom work during summer breaks and through their freelance and consulting work. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Journalism Majors program us es: input from its Professional Advisory Committee \u2014some of them former students; multiple evaluations from intern ship and fellowship grantors fo r internships done for academic credit and an employer evaluation for students doing in ternships not for credit; facul ty research and creative/profe ssional work tied to industry standards; and relevant contempo rary research on the profession al media industry. As a result of the ACEJMC reaccreditation process, feedback fr om the Journalism's Professiona l Advisory Committee, and research on Journalism progr ams, the major has added: a diversity course requirement skills courses in software use and an emphasis on ethical social medi a use in reporting in all cor e courses e.

What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Journalism major aligns with the WKU Strate gic plan by: focusing on Community Impact and Service emphasizing digital media technolo gy and responsible social med ia integration embracing the spirit of Innovati on, collaboration and diversity . In recent years, media technology has fundamentally altered the ways in which the world communicates. Both the School of Journalism and Broadcasting and the Journalism major are respon ding to these changes through new approaches to educating our students. Communica tion platforms are becoming ev er more mobile. Audiences increasingly engage and interact with media, and information producers now work, indivi dually and in teams, across mult iple platforms. At the same time, strong storytelling skills a nd ethical decisionmaking re main touchstones of the mass media industry, and commitments to diversity and community engagement continue to be top priori ties. The SJ&B and its Journalism major have a strategic plan the ess entially mirrors that of WKU. Our programs' graduates are socially responsible, prof essional communicators. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The Journalism major promotes \"i nclusive excellence\"by integrat ing diversity efforts into the c ore elements of its curriculum. It strengthens partnerships with the professional media industr y through its internships and by utilizing the expertise of our Professional Advisory Committee. I t makes instruction relevant, rigorous, and engaging wh ile accommodating diverse learning styles and involving a ll students in undergraduate res earch, student media, handson learning, study abroad programs, and other practices that increase quality and engagem ent. The statewide strategic agenda states that career development and internships are a crucial part in preparing stu dents for their futures. Journalism already offers a strong internship component in its curriculum. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Journalism students are regularly hired at Kentucky publication s including The CourierJournal, The Lexington HeraldLeader, Kentucky New Era, The Daily News, The MessengerInquirer as wel l as independent publications and companies like Leo magazine, Kentucky Mon thly Magazine and Lo uisville Magazine. Gr aduates of SJ&B are also working at multimedia companies like Kertis Creative and Yellowberri Creative. Although many of our graduates find positions in Kentucky, the Journalism major prepares and encourages students to seek the best opportunities in profe ssional communications anywhere in the world. \"The Bloomberg Recruiter Report: Job Skills Companies Want but Can't Get\" identifies the fo llowing skills in the employer \"sweet spot\": strategic thinking creative problem solving leadership skills communication skills All of these skills are at the c ore of the Journalism major. It produces students with excellent communication skills and the ability to analyze and assess data , find relevant and reliable sources, and deal with the public institutions and governmental agencies that serve the public. F ilm/video editors, bloggers an d web producers are among th e top 10 jobs in professional media. The Journalism major's mul timedia curriculum prepares st udents for any of these jobs. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The School of Journalism and Bro adcasting consistently receives national recognition for its pr ograms. The Journalism major makes an important contribution to the schools success. Our maj ors produce state, regional, and national awardwinning work, and the unit is frequently contacted by employers andinst itutions offering internships seeking applicants from the Journalism major. In 2018, the School of Journalism and Broadcasting received awa rd money totaling $75,000 ($40,000 for the programs, $35,000 in student scholarships). These awards recognized the e xcellent work of majors in three of SJ&B's programs: Journalism, Photojournalism , and Broadcasting. Western Kentucky University reco gnizes our programs' reputation and uses it in its recruiting e fforts. As it states on WKU's website: \"Western Kentucky University also maintains a long his tory of being a top school f or journalism. WKU won the Hearst Intercollegiate Overall Aw ard in 2018 and several years prior. In 2018, WKU also won fir st place for multimedia and photojournalism along with individual student awards.\" There is no other school in our region and very few in the enti re country that can match this record of excellence. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Students in both the J ournalism Major and the Journalism Writin g Minor gain personal experience through participation with the \"College Heights Herald\", th e student run newspaper, and th e \"Talisman\", which h as recently transformed itself into a digital and print maga zine. Journalism stude nts also have the c hance to work with the WKU Sport Media Department. These opportunities provide students wi th valuable field experience a nd professional feedback. Addi tionally, Journalism Majors and Journalism Writing Minors are invited to participate during the weeklong WKU Moun tain Workshop in the fall semester each year. This allows students to w ork closely with professional jo urnalists from across the United States. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) For several years, the accepted wisdom was that \"journalism is dead,\" having been killed o ff by various social media platforms. This view contributed to the decline in the number o f students interested in pursuing a career in journalism. As so often the case, however, the conventional wisdom was wrong. In the past few years there has been a growing realization that journalism is adapting to th e new media environment and th at the fundamental skills of professional journalists are needed now more than ever. Growing student interest in our prog ram reflects this new atti tude to the importance of professional journalism. Journalism is a strong program t hat can take adv antage of this renewed interest but only if it has adequate resources. Budget cuts over the past three years have significantly weakened many of WKU's academic programs. J ournalism, like any program, can only thrive if it has the re sources necessary to hire and k eep talented faculty. In addition, it needs adequate resources to invest in student scholarships, classroom equipment, and studen t research and travel. The potential for growth is there, but without the restoration of the l ost lines and resources, it wil l be difficult for Journalism to increase significantly its num ber of majors. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Enrollment in the Journalism pro gram has ebbed and flowed throu gh the years.However, as the \"national trends\"data shows, there has been a steady increase in degrees conferred in communications disciplines through the past decade. And recent data shows a sharp incr ease in Journalism School enrollm ent in the past two years. A big part of this trend is related to the transferable nature of Jou rnalism School skills and an incr eased interest within the coming generation of college students in responsible reporting and quality news production, and the v alue of a free and independent news media with regard to the maintenance of democracy. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) As required by our accrediting a gency, Journalism is constantly reviewing and, when necessary, revising it s curriculum. In the past two years the program has shifted course schedules to matc h the days/times that best suit student needs, enhanced its academic advising, paired facult y with the classes they can tea ch most effectively, and institu ted a mentoring program for junior faculty. To help students earn their degrees in a timely fashion, Journalism faculty hav e agreed to teach overloads. Every semester the program coordinator visits journalism progra ms at area high schools. The p resentations are designed to attract student intere st to the profession and WKU's program. T o build upon these efforts, S J&B is compiling a list of all regional high schools with Journalism classes and/or yearbooks. The teachers in these programs are sent recruiting materials and offers for school visits. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Realistically, Journalism has the potential to expand its numbe r of majors by 20% over the next 5 years. To achieve this goal, however, it must have adequate faculty and classroom resources. In addition, the major will need to achieve greater flexibility in the way it deals with transfer students. Current ly students who transfer to WKU after their second year find it difficult to complete the major in less than three additional y ears. Journalism needs to consider ways to better accommodate these transfer students. In addi tion, Journalism needs to devel op more online courses and pr ogramming. This will provide students with more ways in whic h to complete the major. Journalism majors and faculty woul d also benefit if the program strengthens its international dimension. Current SJ&B faculty have a strong interest in inte rnational journalism. This intere st should be used to establish more international partnerships that could strengthen our recruitment of international students for the major. e.

Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The interdisciplinary Latin American Studies minor program comb ines courses from History, Geography, Anthropology/Folk Studies, Spanis h, and Political Science to pr ovide undergraduate students with an understanding of Latin America a nd its diverse peoples and cult ures from multiple perspectives. Students have added it alongside multiple majo rs in different colleges, altho ugh it most directly appe als to students taking Spanish language courses. It also encourages and rewards WKU st udents who study abroad in Latin America, since such classes can normally be counted for credit. The minor courses, which can be taken as traditional classes, v ia ITV, and at the Eliz abethtown and Glasgow campuses, are offered as part of the Colonnade curriculum or re spective departments' existing programs; most are led by tenured faculty. Apart from advanced Spanish classes , they have no prerequisites, and the minor requirement of a year of Spanis h (or Portuguese) can be waived for already proficient students. The minor adds substantial value f or WKU students by broadening their global perspectives and allowing them to acquire and demonstrate cultural competence. While only a few s tudents tend to take the minor at any given time, the costs are zero, as all departments and instructors in volved would offer these classes in any case.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Latin American Studies minor consists entirely of courses o ffered as part of the Colonnade curriculum and other departments' major programs. It is a relatively easy majo r to add for students who have already completed required courses in programs such as Spanish, Anthropology & Fo lk Studies, or Histo ry, and may indeed encourage students who are taking courses out of an interest in Latin America to add one of the related majors. Participating faculty members ar e also able to offer Latin Amer icarelated courses that serve other program needs (such as the HIST 615/Latin Amer icaU.S. Relations graduate sem inar in Fall 2018). Again, enrollments in the minor have been fairly low for quite some time now, and so this minor program serves only a handful of students each year, but it offers a unique op portunity for these student s that is not apparent in a purely quantitative summary. S ince these courses will continu e to be offered, the minor provides students with an opportunity to explore mater ial that is unfamiliar to most i ncoming students, develop international awareness, and build relationships with facu lty members who are deeply int erested in Latin America. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Among the LAS minor courses, thr ee (GEOG/HIST/PS/ SPAN 200, HIST 364, and HIST 365) contribute toward the \"Connections\" category of the Co lonnade Program, while a furthe r nine courses in Spanish satisfy the language requirement. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 (N=2) 5.00 (N=2) 4.20 * no data provided b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Since the Latin American Studies minor serves a small number of students, participating fa culty are usually able to assess program learning outcomes on a personal level. For stude nts who have taken the minor, an increased awareness of Latin American affairs over the course of several years is readily apparent; the two instructors in the Latin America Past & Present foundations course frequently have LAS minor students visi t to chat about current events in subsequent semesters. Assessment of related skills, i ncluding basic knowledge about the geography, history, culture, or politics of Latin America, critical analys is and synthesis of evidence, or oral and written communication, is performed at the course level. The only program improvements that have been necessary in the p ast few years have been to update the minor requirements to reflect a longterm decline in the number of fa culty members from different departments specializing in Latin America; fo r example, there are no longer Latin Americarelated eco nomics courses available for WKU students. Howe ver, all participating faculty members ar e actively interested in continuing existing course offerings and developing new minor eligible course in their are as of interest. These faculty and affiliated colleagues maintain a mailing lis t to facilitate communication, and periodically meet to discuss both the minor and Latin Americarelated events occurring on campus or in the Bowling Green community. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Again, because there are a limited number of Latin American Stu dies minor students, success of graduates is usually assessed through personal communication with former stu dents. Since most graduates seek careers based on their major programs of study rather than the minor - subseq uent careers have included primary and secondary education, financial sector employment, or further gr aduate studies - it is diffi cult to generalize about the employment paths of LAS mino rs. However, in many cases facu lty members have been informed that both language skills and a general cultural awareness of Latin Ameri ca have distinguished LAS minors from their peers and brought concrete benefits in obtaining employment or openin g new opportunities once employed. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Latin American Studies minor faculty does not formally surv ey school administrators or employers about curriculum, since decisions about the minor courses are typical ly made in their respective departments. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Anecdotally, a number of past Latin American Studies students h ave reported to participating faculty that they were pursuing or considering career or life opportunities relat ed to Latin America or Latin Americans that they would not otherwise have been in terested in or suited for befor e taking the minor. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Latin American Studies minor does not generate independent, external revenue streams. However, individual faculty members have won a variety of external grants and fello wships for research projects in recent years, such as an ACLS Collaborative Research Fellowship that provided a fu ll year of salary buyout an d research funding for a colleague in History. (A few students in the minor have also ap plied for and received national grants like the Fulbright.) An annual award in honor of Dr. Richard Salisbury, a former pro fessor in the History Department, is given to an outstanding student in Latin American Studies. The Salisbury Aw ard fund has amassed more than $10K in principal and will be endowed, wh ich will allow the LAS program to award approxim ately $300 per year. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) There are no program costs for the Latin American Studies minor , as all courses are o ffered as part of the Colonnade curriculum and existing major programs in each depart ment, so that the minor effectively uses current resources to deliver a unique and valuable experience to intere sted students. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The Latin American Studies minor directly contributes to many o f the goals outlined in WKU's strategic plan, by appealing to a diverse group of s tudents, fostering shared valu es of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and equipping students with an understanding of a dynamic region of the world that is directly relevant to a variety of potential employers. Indeed, the following sentence perfectly applies to LAS: \"From our Hill in Kentucky, our reach will be international in scope, ensuring that our students and the regi on are fully prepared an d able to compete in a global market.\" (14) Furthermore, the minor encourages students to pursue opportunit ies for research and creat ive activities in Latin America during their time at WKU, and strengthens our diverse s tudent body in Kentucky. As a number of non traditional students have added the minor, it helps support con tinuing education, while information from former students indicates that their awareness and understanding of La tin American issues makes them excellent alumni ambassadors. Finally, the LAS mi nor is a model of budget sustai nability in that it repurpo ses existing resources and draws on the strengths and interests of faculty members acr oss departments to offer students a marketable set of skills and intern ational perspectives. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Beyond fostering academic excel lence across WKU's curriculum, t he Latin American Studies minor meets goals in Kentucky's strategic agenda in many of the same ways it does fo r WKU's strategic plan. In particular, it helps foster diversity and inclusivene ss, appeals to underserved stud ent populations in Kentuck y, prepares students for community and international part nerships, and trains graduates to be globally competitive in their future career paths. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) In addition to building vital universitylevel skills like crit ical thinking, information analysis and synthesis, and written and oral argument and communication, the Latin American Studies minor adds value for just about any potential employer in Kentucky t hat has interests in Latin Amer ica itself, serves Latino clie nts locally, regionally, or internationally, or counts Latino employees among its workforce . d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Latin American Studies minor program offers students a uniq ue chance to experience multiple disciplinary perspectives and work across depa rtmental divisions to pursue s tudies that combine a general knowledge of the region with a personalized set o f interests. Practically speaki ng there are no other options for similar studies in the WKU service region, and so the LAS minor gives our students an opportunity that is ge nerally only available at flagship or distant universiti es - while ULL and Vanderbilt hav e major and minor progra ms in related areas and UK, NKU, and Transylvania University have similar minor program s, EKU, and Murray and Morehead State have nothing comparable. The minor also appeals to specific student groups at WKU and in the community, like the Hilltopper Organization of Latin American Students (HOL@ S) and the Hispanic Organizatio n for the Promotion of E ducation (HOPE), and faculty members are able to part icipate in and take advantage o f campuswide events like the current International Year of Cuba (or t he previous International Year of Ecuador), in addition t o organizing other Latin Americarelated campus and community events each year. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Even for students who do not end up adding the Latin American S tudies minor, the existence of a connected body of coursework related to Latin A merica sustained by the minor o ffers a chance for students in related fields, such as International Relations, to in corporate this material in the ir programs of study and to draw on the expertise of associated faculty members for thesis committees and FUSE proje cts. LAS faculty have also taken a leading role in the \"International Year Of\" prog rams, two of which have focused on Latin American countries (Cuba and Ecuador). 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Latin American Studies minor program should be maintained, although increased faculty efforts to raise awareness of the program and recr uit more students would allow it to provide bigger benefits with no additional demand on existing resources. Ba sed on previous discussions dur ing informal interest meetings, faculty members participating in the LAS minor are interested in expanding cour se offerings and incorporating new faculty and departments whenever possible, a lthough these decisions are not directly driven by the needs of the minor. Despite serving a small group of students, the LAS minor progra m is not currently in need of revision since it is already fundamentally interdisciplinary by nature. (However, in creased financial aid for Latino students would likely have a complementary effect of raising the number of min ors, as well as meeting university and state goals of reaching underserved population groups.) b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) WKU's Latin American Studies cu rriculum resembles curricula of comparable programs across the nation. American universities continue t o offer Latin American and Lati no Studies programs like WKU's, reflecting the everdeepening interdependence of the United States and Latin A merica, as well as the growing importance of Latinos in the U.S. Trends like the rising percentage of the La tino population of the U.S. (nearly a fifth of the current total population) or the expansion of Chinese investmen t in Latin America suggest that these programs will only increase in relevance a cross the nation in coming yea rs. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Several LAS minor courses have been reorganized in recent years to meet the goals of th e \"Connections\" section of the Colonnade program, since the material is a natural fit f or the program's aims. The core minor course, Latin America Past & Present, cotaugh t by the main program advisors Dr. Marc Eagle (History) and Dr. David Keeling (Geography & Geology), has also been streamlined in order to of fset the retirement of a member of the Political Science Department, while preserving recent innovations like sp ecial topical discussion sessions to better engage students with current Latin Ameri can affairs. These changes are in line with the general feeling among participating faculty that we wo uld like to get as much usefuln ess as possible fo r our students out of courses that we are teaching for our respecti ve departments, based on our de ep and abiding interest in the region. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Over the next few years we would like to see an increase in min ors (although no one among the participating faculty feels that this is nece ssary to justify continuing the program). It would be ideal to have a group of about 20 minors per academic year given the current number of qualified faculty members and course offerings. The main obstacles to increasing numbers have historically been limited awareness of the program and a general lack of even basic knowledge about Latin America among many incoming st udents that tends to intimidate them from choosing Latin Americarelated courses. Greater student recruit ment efforts can help in this regard, both among specific campus groups like HOL@ S and in the surrounding commun ity, as can publiciz ing the minor in conjunction with campus and community events like the Internati onal Year of Cuba or the \"Tracing the Unexplored\" speaker and event se ries organized through the Span ish department. e.

Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Music also offers an AB, BM, and a minor - students in all four programs sh are courses and artistic exper iences (including large/chamber performance ensemb les, stage produ ctions, tours/c onferences, university spec ial events, and community service). Music provides required courses for programs in the S chool of Teacher Education (BS in Special Education and BS in Elementary Education) and the Department of Theatre and Dance ( BFA in Music Theatre and minors). Each spring the Departments of Music and Theatre/Dance collaborate on an Opera or Musical Theatre productio n. Music contributes to the Colonnade Core Curriculum (six di fferent course options in thre e different categories) and offers over twenty performance ensembles (open to all students) . Music graduate and undergradu ate programs are directly linked as those students conduct and perform with each other throughout their programs. The athl etic bands are an invaluable part of the game day experience for Football, Volleyba ll, and Men's/Women's Basketba ll (over sixty events each y ear) and most notably the department presents over 100 diverse music concerts and recital s each year that attract stude nts, faculty/staff, parents, alumni, donors, and community mem bers to campus.

In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The department conducts an alumn i survey every two years regard ing career satisfaction. In 2018, 83.33% of respondents selected \"good\" or \"outstanding\" when asked how well WKU prepar ed them for their current po sition. The department also keeps track of PRAXIS test pass rates specific to music student s and the music content portion o f that teaching certification exam. Department faculty are highly engaged in personal/profess ional relationships with reg ional colleagues and school officials as well as through ass ociation with KM EA (the state m usic education association) - we are in constant communication regarding area teaching and performance needs as well as student success. While the information gathered through these relationships is a necdotal it is a vital, and hig hly informative, source of information - arguably much more so than data driven surveys. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In addition to their diploma, mu sic education students also hav e KentuckyState Teaching Certification. State Certification standards and requirements are defined by the Kentucky Board of Education and reflect the current expectations and demands of educators who teach in the Kentucky public schools. As noted above, department faculty are highly engaged in personal/professional relationsh ips with regional colleagues an d school officials as well as t hrough association with KMEA. Personal relationships with colle agues at graduate institutions also provides a means for feedback regarding student preparation for additional/docto ral graduate level music study. In 2015 we found, through internal review and anecdotal conversation, that our students in the MM Pedagogy track could benefit from a stronger background in individual development on their primary ins trument. As a result the applie d lessons content of the program was enhanced providing students with sustained individual instruction over multiple se mesters. The department also con siders state and national databases/reso urces through KMEA, the College Music Society (CMS), and NASM as needed and appropriate. While not always specific to em ployability, these organizatio ns regularly track student enrollment/engagement /success, faculty/personnel, program offer ings, financial/facility/libra ry resources, and diversity. These organizations are also strong advocates for the arts/musi c in state and national convers ations regarding standards, assessment, and graduation requirements. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of studen ts in this program?(opti onal, maximum 100 words) Our healthy relationsh ip with schooldistri cts and their teache rs provides an opportunity for recruitment that goes beyond the discipline. Successful graduates are employed in schools, r emain in touch with the program, and ultimately recommend new students to WKU. Th ese students may or may not go into musi c, but they consider WKU because of the highly valued and influential studentteacher relationship they have with the ir school music teachers. This relationship is one that goes beyond test scores and grades and it is one we constantly model at the highest level within the program.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) In addition to personnel, scholar ship, and operating budgets th e Department of Music has six nonendowed accounts through the University Foundation specific to performance areas within the department (band, choir, orchestra, jazz) where spending is generally reflective of annual gifts. Music also ha s seven endowed accounts (including a professorship) that generate funds based on annual rates of return. The music DELO distribution has been roughly $13,000 for the past few years and goes directly towards studen t travel for invited performanc es at state, regional, a nd national events. There are many opportunities for donor involvement through perf ormance ensembles, special eve nts, and student activities as well as instrument acquisitio n and travel. Community members and donors are very supportive of the department and in many cases are dedicated support ers of specific ensembles and/o r faculty. Annual giving is generally in the $100500 range with occasional larger gifts dep ending on the specific need/eve nt (new uniforms, Carnegie Hall performance etc.). The department reaches out and engages the community and potential donors as best as possible; however, the department alone does not have the dedicate d staff, or expertise, needed t o communicate with donors (pa rticularly outside Bowling Green) towards the high level of financial return required for major purchases and internat ional student experiences. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The university median above (at $128/SCH) is the same reported for undergraduate level programs - this is potentially a reporting error as graduate progr ams naturally hav e higher cost rates. The numbers above reflect a very rough estimate of teaching specific to the MM as some teaching with other program s in the department (ensembles ) is shared. Therefore, the SCHP numbers provided by IR may also not be accurate. A Departm ent of Music of our size and scope has unique and significant costs, revenue avenues, and efficiency options; how ever, the defined word count does not allow for further explanation. The following is offered as an example of a unique financial aspect of the department: A fundamental aspect of college music programs is applied study through oneonone instruction. Most of the above fulltime faculty teach multiple sections of applied lessons. As these ar e individual and at different lev els a single class may only ha ve 2 4 students enrolled. In addition, and as defined by NASM, appli ed faculty receive .66 load cred it for each individual student; therefore, 18 students is equivalent to a full 12hr teaching lo ad (18x.66=12hrs). Naturally this negatively effects relative S CH costs and median class size numbers. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) From the 201828 Climbing to Greater Heights Strategic Plan: 1. Our Students A Diverse Body of Students: the department actively engages in extensive recruiting activi ties both on and off campus, personally v isiting schools throughout the s tate/region and bringing hundreds if not thousands of students to campus for festivals, auditions, KMEA events, an d competitions. Completion & Success: The department successfully advises all music majors with specialis t advisors who are activel y involved in weekly and even daily student engagement. T he department enjoys a natural peer mentoring atmosphere through applied studios, ensemble participation, and leadership opportunities. Scholarship opportunitie s specifically towards recruitment and retention are available for music majors and ma rching band students (from across campus). Preparation for th e Global Stage: HighImpact Practices, that dev elop hard and soft skills towar ds productive citizenship, are a regular and essential part of being a music major including concert presentations, stage productions, collaborative event s, athletic bands, hosting fest ivals, touring, guest art ist classes, and engagement with study abroad tours, courses, and experiences. 2. Our Community and Beyond - Quality of Life: The department offers roughly 100 musical events each year tha t are open to the entire campus and regional community, and faculty r egularly share/exchange recital programs with other academic institutions. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Assuming this question refers to the KY Council on Postsecondar y Education 20162021 Strategic Agenda Stronger by Degrees, many of the objectives are alrea dy established in the departmen t and program - samples below (objective #): 2a - College Readiness: while this objective centers on reading and math, music studen ts must equally be proficient on their respective instrument and be flu ent with music literacy. These proficiencies are met through an entrance audition prior to entrance to the program. Music faculty regularly communicate an d collaborate with public school teachers giving potential students a clear understanding of what is expected for music ma jor \"college readiness\". 5 - Financial Access : Graduate students can apply for and receive competitive gradu ate assistantships that provide both stipends and tuition a ssistance to attend WKU. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The MM in music specifically addr esses workforce needs in schoo l music teaching. The MM Teac her Leader tracks include Kentucky Rank II Certif ication and most, if not all, graduates immediately gain employment in Kentucky public schools after graduation (or were employed dur ing attendance). As recognized through conversations with KMEA administration, WKU has a very strong music teaching reputation throughout the state. I n some cases public school officials seek out WKU music graduates knowing our strength i n providing quality teachers to the region. Faculty are in constant communication with school officials, and current music teachers, and are generally aware early of potential open positions - which are then shared with qualified students in additional to our making reco mmendations to the individual dist ricts. As a result potential students continue to see WKU as a prime avenue for career readi ness particularly in music t eaching. Students in the Pedagogy track have successfully built private studios both in Kentucky and in Texas. MM pedagogy graduates need to be proactive and build/develop their own individual career based o n local needs and the regional market as it applies to their specific skills and interests. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) See 5c above. The Master of Mu sic is a common g raduatemusic deg ree. The defined standards, from both NASM and state certification, are very specific and require teacher preparatio n programs to have similar, if not exactly the same, content. Most Kentucky Universities (UK, U of L, Murray State, Morehead, EKU, and NKU) have Master of Music degree programs but the Master of Music Teacher Leader programs are unique to WKU. This designation is a strong incen tive, and qualifier, for teachers in Kentucky who are int erested in earning their Master 's degree. Beyond the defined curriculum, institutional differences are recognized in performance opportunities, ensemb le quality, and faculty exper tise. WKU faculty are well respected within their individua l disciplines and performances ensembles are highly competitive in the state and region (with multiple invitations to KMEA, AC DA, ASTA, and CBDNA). The depar tment also offers music education courses at the regional campuses (as required for Teacher Education programs) and multi ple colonnade courses through DELO during the winter and summer sessions. Due to proactive and diverse scheduling, summe r/winter enrollments have doubled since 2015. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) It is vitally important that high er education is not solely a v ehicle towards workforce dem ands and employability. Our fundamental philosophy should be driven by a commitment towards graduating students who are not only competent in their chosen field, but who one day might change the world in w hich we live. We must train our students to be creative, curious, intelligent, and critical thinkers who embrace the bea uty and passion of the world and our place in it - constantly engaging fellow citizens in purs uing a higher quality of life. This is what arts programs, like the BM, distinctly bring to ou r strategic alignment, the campus, and our regional community. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The MM is currently designed to assist teachers, conductors,and artists directly associated wit h teaching, leadership, and pedagogy. The MM is attractive to regional and statewide music teachers and we expect that market to always be present. The pedagogy track has the most potential for wider student mar kets - traditionally \"pedago gy\" in music degrees has centered around strings and piano (and at times voice); however , we are seeing a new market of students interested in pedagogy specific to a much wide r range of specialties includin g the areas above as well as w inds and percussion. Individual instruments require individual uni que instruction, but the pote ntial for a broad and diverse student/instrument population is exciting and potentially unique to WKU. Considering a Performance trac k is also a possibility moving fo rward. A Performance MM option is common in higher education music programs and something that, coupled with the P edagogy track, might additionally attract a broader range of interested students (especially if there are corresponding g raduate assistant positions i n specific instruments). b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) As noted in 5c and 5d, the MM is a common music graduate degree option. The WKU program is consistent with programs at other institutions and as define d by NASM standards. National t rends continue to push for \"hi practices\", \"living learning communities\", and \"proj ect based learning\". These type s of experiences and learning environments have existed in music for many years as music and the arts are defined by exper iential learning through facetoface group instruction, preparation/presentation, and performance. While major news out lets continue to report on cu ts to the arts (in schools, professional organizations, and t he NEA) we are e ncouraged that enrollment in the MM is healthy and that our students at WKU have found great success in the classroom and on the stage. National trends also appear to prioritize STEM disciplines as the vehicle to improve our quality of life - but it is impor tant to remember that music and arts are what make that life worth living. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The MM is still relatively new to WKU, but since its inception in 2012we have worked towards additional on line/hybrid course options, specifically for fulltime teachers, and we hav e enhanced the applied lessons content of the Pedagogy track as noted in 3d. Almost all of the Music Education track is now offered online or through hybrid courses. The department greatly values the facetoface experience; however, we also re cognize the importance of offering out students options that work with their current life/ca reer needs. These offerings are at times a double edged sword because while they help distance students they are a dra wback for our re sident students who are looking for facetoface interaction. The department does not have the personnel to o ffer multiple sections of gradu ate courses for the multiple needs of our students. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect the MM to remain a viable option for many years tocom e; however, there are serious impediments that currently exist limiting our ability to mai ntain the current level of suc cess as well as consider future growth. In addition to budget a nd state certification concerns the following are noted as WKU fac ulty and graduate assistant numbers are well below comparable NASM programs: Faculty -when the MM was introduced in 2012 a new faculty membe r was expected; howeve r, that position was never realized. Program coordination has been shared by faculty in other areas and recently our two most qualified/credentialed faculty for the MM (specifically in Musi c Education) have retired from WKU. We are in dire need of dedicated and properly credentialed faculty to coordina te this program. Graduate Assistants - WKU is not competitive with GA positions comparable to similar programs. At least twelve fifteen graduate assist ant positions (instea d of six) are neede d to elevate WKU to comparable norms. These positions are cost effective as they assist with overworked fac ulty, core and method courses, applied lessons, and departmental administration. GA's also bring a highlevel of mu sical expertise to all en sembles, courses, and experiences that enhances the overall department for all consti tuents. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The MPA is a professional graduate degree in the field of publi c administration.The MPA Program was first accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Polic y, Affairs, and Administratio n (NASPAA) in 2009, and reaccredited in 2016. The MPA program prepares students from diverse backgrounds to be produc tive leaders and managers in public service by sharing knowledge, encouraging excellence in research and practice, and fostering an environment of professionalism within the communities it serves. The progra m recruits students who are fu ll and parttime as well as pre and midcareer. A minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.75, a GRE score (for applican ts with less than a 3.0 GPA), and two letters of recommendation are required for consideration of admission. Adm itted students are currently required to complete 18 core hours offered by the Department of Political Science, 18 electi ve hours (selected across depart ments in consult ation with an advisor) and a three hour profe ssional experience. Classes are delivered facetoface, online, and via IVS to students at the main and regional campuses. Rece nt graduates have found employm ent in the public (national, st ate and local government), nonprofit, and private sectors.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The MPA supplements and enhances several undergraduate and grad uate programs at WKU. In 2017 the MPA Program launched a JUMP program. To date we have had 8 JUMP students, o ne finished his undergraduate degree and matriculated into the MPA program while the others are still undergraduates. The JUMP program offers significant potential for program growth. Last year the Department develop ed a graduate certificate in Lo cal Government Administration taught by MPA faculty. In addition to being available to MPA students, the certificate wi ll attract midcareer professionals looking to earn a professional credential. The certificate will also be availabl e for students pursuing a mast er's degree in other graduate programs (e.g. MA in Organ izational Leadership). MPA faculty are in conversations with Criminology (M.A.) facult y to create a graduate certi ficate in Criminal Justice Administration. The interdisciplin ary certificate would serve a s a credential for those interested in the intersection of criminology and public administration. Students from other graduate programs often enroll in MPA cours es. More specifically, there were approximately 50 enrollments during AY18 from Organizational Leadership students . 22 Leadership students enrolled in Elements of Public Administration offered in the Fa ll and Winter. MPA courses supp lement these students' understanding of challenges related to leadership in public organizations. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Historically, the MPA program attracted a significant number of international students. The program has seen a steady decline in international student applications and enrollments. This decrease in international enrollment coincided with a slight decrease in domestic enro llments. Some of this decrease is explained with the counter cyclical relationship between graduate education and stronger economic conditions. Although e nrollments have decreased in r ecent years we have seen a stabilization in enrollments and a re developing marketing plans to recruit more incareer students. To this end, we are in conversations with DELO to inc rease program visibility to milit ary and civilian personnel at Ft. Knox. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Gra duates from 20132015 were surveyed in 2016. Survey data wer e used to inform curriculum ch anges. As students expressed interest and alumni chose careers in the nonprofit sector, we created PS 554 CrossSector Collaboration & Conflict, PS 5 64 Nonprofits & Public Policy, and PS 566 Environmental Politic s and Public Po licy; PS 550 Cul tural Competencies for PA, PS 526 Local Government Administration and PS 528 Civic Engagement and EGovernance pro vide options for our students seeking careers in local government, and were created in response to student/graduate fe edback. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Our accrediting body (NASPAA) requires that we annually report job placement statistics for our recent graduates. We maintain contact with our students postgraduation to track the ir status by employment sector , based on the 13 categories established by our accreditor. In 201617, we had 15 graduates and knew the employment status of 14 of them. Within six months of graduation, 4 were employed with domestic nonprofits, 3 in state government, 2 in local government, 2 in international government, 2 were pursuing further education, an d 1 was employed in the forprofit sector. According to data NASPAA compiled from the annual reports of 23 5 MPA/MPP programs (http://www.naspaa.org/stude nts/careers/salary.asp ), alumni were employed in a wid e variety of employment sectors within six months of earning their graduate degrees - 27% in domestic or international nonprofits, 20% in the private sector, 17% in local government, 15% in state government, 11% in the U.S. fede ral government, 5% in inte rnational government, 4% pursuing further education, and 1% military service. These data reflect the broad applicability of the MPA across multiple employment options. Government employees comprise more than 15% of Kentucky's workforce and approximately 14% tor.htm); https://www.councilofnonprofits.or g/sites/default/files/documen ts/2017FastFactsAboutthe NonprofitSector.pdf ). d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) We administer a survey to alumni of our program every two years , and administer an exit survey to each of our students after they complete their comprehensiv e examinations (3 times per yea r). The students' exit survey includes questions about satisfaction with elective cours e offerings, particularly the r ole of electives in helping stud ents master essential knowledge , skills, and values. Alumni are ask ed questions de signed to dete rmine which skills are most perti nent to their jobs and how well the WKU MPA program prepared them in those areas; alumni a re also asked to identify their current employment sector. Survey data as well as input from the MPA Advisory Comm ittee (which has traditionally included program alumni as well as area employers) have been used to inform content change s in our core courses as well as inform changes to program curriculum. For example, student response data from Fall 2011 t o Spring 2015, as well as data from student enrollment across course offerings were analy zed by faculty, resulting in development of five new elective courses with content designed to relate specifically to the ca reer fields and interests ident ified by respondents to our alumni and student exit surveys. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) For more than 40 years the WKU MPA program has been preparing s tudents from across Kentucky and beyond to be productive leaders and managers in public service. Our alumni w ork in a wide range of public , private, and nonprofit organizations across the Commonwealth, and our survey data indi cate they are quite satisfied with the preparation they received in our program. The pro gram was initially accredited b y NASPAA (the international accrediting body for MPA programs) in 2009; in 2016, the WKU MPA program achieved reaccr editation through August 31, 2023, with no monitoring provisions attached. 4.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Primarily through their associatio n with the Center for Local G overnments (CLG), MPA faculty offer research assistance and other services to local governme nts and related organizations. Faculty have completed projects for the BG Police Department, IBM Center for The Business of Government, and the International City/County Management Association. Recently, an agreemen t was reached to com plete a salary/classif ication study for Area Deve lopment Districts across Kentucky. MPA faculty occasionally offer training workshops on and off ca mpus. Last year, a workshop training on the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace was held for over 100 attend ees in Bowling Green and Owensboro. While this programming was offered withou t charge, there is a possibility to charge for similar workshops across our service region in the future. Through cooperation with DELO, the MPA program has had two diff erent cohorts of international students. The most recent cohort consisted of 10 students from the UAE. Significant fundi ng was brought into the University, College, Department and program through this cohort. Pri or to the international cohort s, the MPA was offered to a cohort of police officers and fire fighters from Owensboro. While w e do not have a current cohort agreement in place, we are open to exploring opportunities for future cohorts. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) As a graduate program, cost per SCH produced is higher than for the department as a whole. Changes to course scheduling has increased median class size for Fall 2018. We actively seek to connect our student s to public service o rganizations in our communities through internships. Internships provide valuable f ield experience while provi ding organizations with administrative assistance. Inter nships create relationships wh ich provide the opportunity for a pplied research projects to be contracted with the CLG which brings in fees for services upon completion of these projects. We have a particularly close relationship with BRADD which we hope to continue to grow and e xpand. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The mission of the MPA program clo sely aligns itself with WKU's strategic plan. The program mission is to prepare graduate students from diverse backgrounds to be productive leaders and managers in public service by sharing knowledge, encouraging excellence in research and practice, and fostering an environment of professional ism within the communities we serve.

How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The Kentucky Future Skills Report projects significant growth ( 1520%) in fields related to the degree including management and community & social service oc cupations. As a professional d egree, the MPA degree attracts students who engage in public service and are seeking sk ills and certification for pro fessional development and promot ion. The degree also assists students seeking a master's degr ee before entering the workforc e. Common starting jobs for graduates include policy analysts, program managers, gran t writers, researchers, and bud get analysts. As their experienc e grows, many graduates rise to upperlevel positions in government, nonprofit, and business organizations. Public administ ration professionals see an unmet need to promote professiona lization in local/state govern ment. This need will become more pronounced as more local, state, and federal employ ees move toward retirement. Acc ording to a 2012 International City/County Management Association survey, more than 63% of local government managers were over the age of 51, up from 8% in 1974, and 58% of city managers and senior level managers in city departments are eligible to retire. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports tha t 37% of the entire local governmen t workforce are at least age 5 0, in contrast to 28% of the private sector who are at least age 50. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Recently, several MPA programs in the Commonwealth have moved t o an online format. Although the MPA program at WKU offers some electives online, a ll required courses are offered either facetoface or via IVS at Owensboro and Fort Knox. WKU is the only university that can d eliver the MPA degree faceto face or via IVS to the Ft. Knox Army Post. Active recruitment events at Fort Knox have been conducted in the past and we are in conversation with DELO and the Ft. Knox campus about how to better market the program to military and civilian perso nnel stationed on or near the installation. To this end, the program will be represented at an upcoming open house at the Ft . Knox campus. Three of the core MPA faculty ha ve public sector experience whi ch helps us emphasize the pr actitioner side of public administration. The public secto r experience translates into r ealworld connectedness and applications for our students. This expertise also led to the de velopment of the Local Governm ent Certificate that MPA students can earn through their elective coursework. The certificate is the only one of its ki nd in Kentucky. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The program has traditionally been made up of midcareer profes sionals with an occasional influx of international students. While serving midcareer students continues to be a priority, w e have made a strategic decisio n to increase the emphasis on precareer students. Recent changes such as the JUMP program, changes in admission requireme nts and curriculum also reflect this shift in our vision. The increased focus on preca reer students differentiates our program from those offered by other institutions in the Commonwealth. The development of the Local Government Administra tion certificate allows students to earn credentials to supplement the MPA. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The MPA is in the midst of a tran sformation which helps positio n the program for future success. The creation of the JUMP program will provide a strong fou ndation of precareer students upon which incareer students can be added. A more balanced number of precareer an d incareer students will allow the program to maintain enr ollments during shifts in economic conditions. The program has had recent success placing graduates in the Nashville met ro area. While we have had modest success in recruiting st udents from the Nashville market , we believe that there is significant untapped potential to recruit additional students from the area. One trend in the discipline is the increased emphasis on gradua te certificates to supplement and enhance the more traditional MPA. The development of the Local Government Admin istration certificate (approved Spring 2018) was the first step to address this trend. The e xpectation is that this certi ficate will provide benefits for MPA students, g raduate student s from other programs, and employees working in public sector tha t are looking for professiona l development opportunities. We have begun discussions with Cr iminology faculty on creating a certificate in Criminal Ju stice Administration. The interdisciplinary certificate woul d provide benefits for studen ts of both programs while utiliz ing preexisting resources. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Governments at all levels are faci ng increased demandfor servic es, but have limited resources to meet these demands. Increased professionalism and effi ciency will play a central ro le in the ability of lo cal and state governments and officials to address these challenges. There was an 18% surge in public empl oyee retirements in Kentucky and a 30% increase in state government employee retirements in fiscal year 2018. Scholars a nd professionals expect public sector retirements to increase in coming years. The MP A degree allows midcareer publ ic servants to update their skills to better perform their current jobs as well as to qualif y for promotions. The degree a lso provides precareer students the opportunity to gain the qualifications necessary for pub lic sector jobs. The MPA progra m provides the skills and trai ning needed to increase the responsiveness and effectiveness of government employees. Estim ates in the size of salary incr eases related to receiving an MPA typically fall between $12,000 and $18,000. Over the past 10 years, enrollment has increa sed in the fie lds of public administration and social servic es nationally which highlights growth potential for the program. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Over the past couple of years, the MPA program began a transfor mation process to promote student success and ensure the long term sustainability of the p rogram. Changes that have alre ady been implemented include: the creation of the MPA JUMP program, updating the program curriculum and course offeri ngs, modifying the application requirements, making adjustments to course scheduling, and implementing a graduate c ertificate in Local Government Administration to complement the MPA degree. We have just started overhauling our marketing material and need to implement a more effective recruitment strategy. Another initiative in the earl y stages is working on possible cohort agreements with local governments and area development districts. Since some changes just went into effect this Fall, there has n ot been an opportunity to see their full benefits. Early retur ns seem positive. Early enrollment numbers for the JUMP program ar e good and enrollment in the MPA program has stabilized. New and revised courses allow us to better meet the needs of ou r students. Adjustments to course scheduling, including an online course on egovernance, helped increase median class siz e to 11 for Fall 18. Despite lim ited marketing efforts, severa l students have expressed interest a nd have signed up for the Loc al Government certificate. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We expect to complete the transf ormation outlined above (5.c.) and see the benefits of changes being made to the program. Once changes are fully implemented, we expect the MPA program t o grow to 3040 students over the next few years. The strategy is to cultivate a healthy balance of pre and midcare er students. We see the program becoming more collaborative. Certificates that are part of th e MPA program (e.g. Local Gover nment Administration) are cred entials that can be earned by students in other programs. Addi tionally, potential exists to develop interdisciplinar y certificate programs that can bridge two programs to better meet the needs of students and community . The potential partner ship with Criminology is promising. Other possible partner s include NonProfit Administr ation, Organizational Leadersh ip, and Social Responsibility & Sustainable Communities. We are well positioned in terms o f faculty resources and expert ise for growth. With an incr eased focus on precareer students, financial support for graduate students will help us recruit and retain high quality students. Two areas where additional support will be helpful to ensure gr owth are 1) developing and implementing an effective marketing and outreach strategy and 2) flexibility/expertise in developing agreements with lo cal governments and ADDs that are mutually beneficial to WKU and the partner organization. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Master of Arts in Organizati onal Communication is a 33 cred it hourprogram focused on communication theory, practice, and problembased research. Ou r mission is to provide graduate students with an engaging, c hallenging, and wellrounded curriculum, including coursework in interpersonal, health, and intercultural communication. The program prepares students for a variety of careers and pursuits in which advanced communi cation study is helpful, esp ecially management, human resources, public relations, mark eting, healthcar e and educatio n. A major program revision in Fall 2012 streamlined the curriculum and aligned it with pr ogram learning outcomes. The revision included a new com prehensive exam/capstone option. The old masters (#109) a nd certificate (#175) programs were phased out and we introduced the newly revamped Masters (#0012) and Certificate (#0471) programs in Organizatio nal Communication, and a new Certificate in Communicating in Healthcare (#0475). Also, a ne w certificate in Strategic Spo rt Communications will begin in F all 2019. All program courses are offered at night, online, or on weekends to serve workinga ge adults in pursuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials while maintaining fu lltime employment. Admission t o our program requires a minimum undergraduate GPA of 2.75 and GRE scores of 139 verbal, 139 quantitative, and 3.5 an alytical writing.

(ma ximum 200 words) The Master of Arts in Organizati onal (#0012) cont ributes to programs auniver sity mission throughproviding opportunities for students to engage in applied research and li felong learning. The program supports the Communicating in Organizations (#0471) and the Communicating (2017/2018). Both require 12 credit hours to completion, all of which can be taken online. The latter certificate is a collaborative endeavo r between the Department of Communication and the Department of Public Health. A third certificate, Strategic Sport Communications, was added in AY 19. Over the past 5 years, over 50% of students enrolled in the Mas ter's and certificate prog rams were WKU graduates. Approximately 50% of students en rolled in our certificate progr ams were workingage adults pursuing jobenhancing credentials. We also had 3 ALLEX Program (international) students , who teach their native language for Modern Languages while pursuing our MA. Since the creation of the JUMP program i n Fall 2016, 12 JUMP students (not accounted for in the data provided above) are taking graduate courses. Other than Co mmunication students, others from Masters or Doctoral Degree programs, such as Nursing and Leadership, take our gradu ate classes. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The data provided suggests that since 2016, our program's produ ctivity seems to have decrea sed. However, this is not the case, because the data does not reflect JUMP student numbers in our Master's program count until they officially graduate with their BA. In 201617, 3 JUMP students joined our graduate program, so the enrolled student number was actually 16 instead of 13. When 5 more joined in 201718, the actual number of enrolled students was actually 21 students for 2017 18, higher than the university median. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The learning outcomes of the pro gram are as follows: (1) Resear ch Mastery, (2) Writin g Mastery, (3) Explanation of Theories and Concepts, (4) Identification of Distinct Communication Prac tices of Culturally Diverse G roups, and (5) Ability to Apply Communication Concepts in Organiz ational Contexts. Within cours es, these learning outcomes are indirectly assessed through multiple tools such as ex ams, application papers, prese ntations, research proposals, a nd qualitative, quantitative, and rhetorically grounded primary research studies. Our program conducts direct assessment o f student learning outcomes through the student capstone ex perience (thesis or comprehensiv e exams). A committee of t hree professors assesses student achievement in the caps tone experience. Thesis work enc apsulates all 5 learning outcomes. Comprehensive examinations test stude nts in the areas of: communication conce pts and theories, research methodology, and application to a communication problem or case study. For each area, a rubric is used to assess student pro ficiency in conceptual knowledge, the use of literature, explanatory skill, research d esign and procedure, and writing skills. Students have to score a minimum of 13 out of 20 maximum points in each of the 3 areas t o pass their comprehe nsive examination. As an example of how we used asse ssment to close the loop, in 2 012, the entire program was revised to reflect all five learning outcomes. Each course is aligned with the others to fo cus on the learning outcomes, pa rticularly applied research in organizational contexts. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Since summer 2011, we have been gathering information about the success of our graduates one year after graduation. Based on response rates of 83100%, all graduates were employed in outside of Kentucky or outside o f Kentucky, and/or had gone on to graduate/professional schools . In terms of our international graduates, many have returned t o their home countries and resumed their jobs in the foreign service, foreig n language teaching, and international business. The most common sectors our graduates found employment one year after gr aduation were in education (20%) and business (20%), which matches the findings in the 2018 Postsecondary Feedback R eport on \"Student Employment outcomes (FFY 1116)\" prepared by KCEWS. While the range of jobs of our graduates is broad (from information techno logy, consulting, to sales), the most common jobs of our graduates are in teaching and instruction, educati on admissions/advising and adm inistration, and marketing/PR/advertising and HR . For those who sought graduate/professional school 90% attained entry to top doctoral programs, such as at Texas A&M University, University of Texas - Austin, Purdue University, Arizona State University, Kansas University, U niversity of Missouri, Universi ty of California Santa Barbara, and University of Colorado Boulder. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In 2013, our department establish ed an Advisory Council compris ed of leaders in their respect ive professions. The council, which offers biannual feedback to our program, has been instru mental in helping the depart ment identify the skills and competencies our students need t o achieve career success. Our p rogram also has plans to conduct employee surveys of our MA graduates every three years starting in the summer of 2019 f or students graduating from 20172019 to systematically assess employer needs and/or sat isfaction. We plan to contact t hese students' employers directl y via email and request that the appropriate supervisor complete our online survey. We have started and maintain a list (vi a excel spreadsheet) of MA graduates' careers and employers that we intend to update yearl y so that contacting employers will be easily achieved for future surveys. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) In the last 5 years, 9 faculty publications were coauthored wi th students, over 56 student papers were presented at state, regional, national, and international conferences. Of those, 35 were soleauthored papers based on work generated in graduate courses, and 19 of them were coauthored with at least one of our graduate faculty members. Moreover, our program is known for producing high quality doctoral school can didates while at the same tim e preparing students who chose careers outside of the aca demy for advancement in their c hosen field. Altogether, this contributes to the university mission, especially on supporting research activities that prom ote student learning and expan d the university outreach (see 20182028 WKU Strategic Plan: Our Hill Goal 4 ), which helps to attract students to our program. 4.

(maximum 2 00 words) Our major external revenue strea m is through DELO monies genera ted by teaching online. Further, the department enjoys modest donor support. These combined resources are used to supp ort student travel to conferences and student research costs, such as small reward s for survey recipients. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Communication Studies and Corp orate and Organizational Comm unication faculty members wh o hold graduate status (7 tenure/track and 1 nontenure track as of AY 18) all teach in t he graduate program, so all are included in the calculations above. In AY 18, when the percen tage of faculty effort in all t he courses taught in the grad program are added up, the total comes to 1.14. Since the work of the program is spread across 8 people, it is high ly cost effective. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program focuses on applied organizational communication and integrates communication theory, practice, and problem based research in dealing with r ealworld problems. This addres ses the WKU Mission, Experience, and S trategic Plan in several ways. Our program provid es research and lifelong learni ng opportunities to our graduate students and working professionals wanting to enhance their skills and abilities to be productive workers and engaged citizens, as well as to enric h the quality of life for those wi thin their reach. Our program h as effectively woven in highimpa ct practices throughout as it is writingintensive, encourages co llaborative learning, explores \"difficult differences,\" and internships to culminat e with a capstone projec t. Not surprisingly, our program's retention and gra duation rates (85.7% and 100% re spectively) are consequently higher than the ave rages of other graduate level p rograms (73.6% and 81.2% respectively). During 2012 2015, our entire program was revised, JUMP program created, 8 c ourses put online, and 2 graduate certificates created to match job market opportunities so that our course rotation sche dule would maximize student progression and completion (see Our Hill - G.3: Strat.12 ) and be more accessible for workingage adu lts in the pursuit of jobenhancing postsecondary credentials on the other (see Our Community and Beyond - G.3: Strat.9 & 10 ). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Our program aligns with the stat ewide strategic agenda to incre ase the education and skill leve ls of employees to catalyze state economic development.

How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Based on 2016 alumni survey data, our graduatesare employed in a range of occupations(see sect ion 3.c in this report),but the greatest number of our students were employed in the educat ion sector, in marketing/adver tising/public relations, and administrative and manageme nt positions, that is, the very sectors our program prepares ou r students to enter . According to the KCEWS Statewide Skills Data on 201721 KY w orkforce dema nd, the projected number of job openings for the following occupations which tradi tionally employ our graduates will increase significantly: (1 ) Office and Administrative Support at 15% (48,000 openings), (2) Education, Training, and Library at 18% (20,809 openings), (3) Management at 18% (10,804 openings), and (4) Business and Financial Operations at 16% (13,638 openings). In fact, all occupations are projected to grow significantly. The highquality postsecondary Ma ster's degree and certificates our program offers not only align with the workforce needs in KY, but will help prepare the skilled an d employable workforce to meet the needs of those occupations and to help the state to meet its goal to raise Ken tucky's educational attainment level to 58% by the year 2025 from its current level of 45%. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Our program is one of three Master of Arts in Communication off ered in the state of KY. Our pro gram is distinctive in that it emphasizes Organizational Communication, has more stringent admission standards, provid es greater flexibility and choice for our students, and is documented as having higher levels of publishing pro ductivity than our competitors. In a 2017 study published by the Journal of the Association for Communication Administration (Vol. 36(2), 2017), our program was ranked 54th out of 134 Master's degree prog rams listed on the website of t he largest and oldest national association, the National Communication Association. The ran king was determined by the to tal citations of faculty res earch available in Google Scholar. Among schools in Kentucky that have a Master's degree in communication, our program came well above Northern Kentucky (72nd) and Murray State (92nd). Unlike the other two programs in the state of KY, our program requires a GRE score for admission while offering a more competitive assistantship package . This allows us to not onl y recruit students with a higher capacity to do research but also admit high quality st udents that have a high probability of completing their program in a timely fashion. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) In the past 5 years, our p rogram has graduated 6 AfricanAmerican (11%) and 12 International students (20%) out of a total of 54 conferred students (see Our Students - G.2: Strat.4 & 5 ). To help diversify course offerings, we have hosted two Minority PostDoctoral Faculty Fellows in 201214 and 201517, a compet itive university fellowship (s ee Our Students - G.4: Strat.10). Finally, to encourage student research activities which prom ote student learning and expand the university outreach (see Our Hill Goal 4 ), the department has supported over 56 student paper presentations at state, regional, national, and international conferences. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The program has highly skilled fa culty that are d edicated to st udent success, as well as strong research production and collaboration. The department mer ged with Advert ising and Publi c Relations in July 2017, bring ing with it faculty who teach classes in sport, media and bra nding with concentration in Stra tegic Sport Communications. W e also successfully hired a digital communication professor . The range of s kills among our faculty will allow us to add a wider array of research applicationsbased courses to our program in the future and att ract students who are corporat e minded or dig itally savvy. The major opportunity for us, based on trends in the discipline of Communication and in workforce needs, is in Healthcare Communication . Our MA program and certificate s in Healthcare and Organizatio ns would both benefit tremendously from a hire in Healthcare Communicati on. This hire would also allow interdisciplinary connections with the Medical School, Nursing, and Physical Therapy. Further, healthcare as an area holds man y collaborative grant opportunities. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Over the last 5 years, the confe rral numbers for our Master's d egree program dipped slightly, while nationally the number of Master's degrees conferred in the field of communication, journ alism, and related program remained the same. This decrease owes to a combination of factors, some outside of our control and some which the faculty initiated. First, the number in applications fluctuated during this period, cost of g raduate tuition increased, and the state economy faced hardships. Despite our efforts to advocate for new and better a ssistantships, we were given fewer due to tightening university budget. W e then had less attr active assistantship p ackages compared to other to p, nonKentucky programs. Second, our program rev ision brought with it greater rigor in an effort to increase research productivity among our stude nts. We did have a record number of student research projects despit e smaller numbers of students! Nevertheless, our program has been growing since Fall 2017 . There were 4 J UMP students wh o joined our program in Fall 2017, and 4 more in Fall 2018. Their numbers are not reflected in the Master's program count u ntil they officially gradu ate with their BA. Also , our Master's degree enrollment increased to 18 students in Fall 2018 from 13 last year. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Over the last few years, fac ulty have been working hard to diversify the delivery of their classes so tha t the 2 certificate programs (#0471, #0475) can be taken completely online . As a result, enrollment in the two certificate programs has increased significantly. In Fall 2019, our program will be addi ng a new fully online graduate ce rtificate, Strategic Sport Communications , with an estimated annual enrollment of 15 students . Our Master's degree and certificate programs align with occupations projected to grow in KY and beyond (see 5.a). In terms of implementing a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, we have taken part in Honors Conferences and in Graduate Fairs at regional and national conferences. We have also sent targeted email to graduating WKU seniors from th e Honors Collegeand Marketing, Leadership and Human Resources programs. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We see great potential for our co re program, especially because it supportsand complements our certificate programs. Among the complementary programs that our core program supports , the graduate certificate in Healthcare Communication needs a tenuretrack hire to help grow and expand the still fledgling program. There are exciting developments within the region, such as the new UK Medical Scho ol at the Medical Center, the Center for Applied Science in Health and Aging, and other healthrelated programs here at WKU which call for further interd isciplinary collaboration. This certificate is ideal for graduate students employed in the heal th professions or studying for adv anced health degrees, such as nursing, nursing administration, health care administration, pu blic health, and physic al therapy. The KCEWS anticipates rising workforce needs in the healthcar e sector in the next five years due to unprecedented demographic shift in the country. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Traditionally, an associate's de gree from WKU's Paralegal Progr amhas beenthe entry level degree to most paralegal positions. Graduates are employed in private/public law practi ce, human resources, court services and property management. There are 12 hours of prerequ isites for admission: PLS 190 (I ntro. to Paralegal Profession) ; PS 110 (Amer ican National Government); OST 220 (Word Proce ssing); and ENG 100 (College Wr iting). Upon admission, students must complete Colonnade courses as required by WKU; accounting; business comm unication; and 33 hours of lega l specialty courses. Legal specialty courses are employment focused, combin ing instruction in hard and soft sk ills, legal theory and service learning. Courses are offered face to face (day and night), online and hy brid (60% face to face, 40% onlin e). Face to face courses are transmitted to WKU Regional Campuses via IVS technology.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Program provides an affordable and efficient resource for w orkforce transition and student s seeking a second degree. Its mission statement is reflective o f the University, College and Department statements in that it focuses on academic quality, access and student engagement wh ile providing practical and mar ketable skills that will tran sition the student to the workplace - regionally and natio nally. The parale gal curriculum and pedagogy empha size critical analysis, research, legal writing, technology, time managem ent and organization. It is a pproved by the American Bar Association and delivered by faculty who are licensed practitioners. Graduates of the Program demonstrate an understanding of the pa ralegal profession and the ethi cal restrictions of practice; communicate effectively within the standards of practice; apply concepts of substantive law and procedure; execute effective legal research strategies; criti cally construct legal argument; practice with sensit ivity and recognition of cultural and socioeconomic differences; and, understand the importance of pu blic service and community engagement. The Program has developed 2+2 ag reements with various departmen ts at WKU by which students may transfer the associate degree credits as a minor int o a bachelor's degree. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional,maximum 100 words) Enrollment in the Program has dec lined significantly since the approval of the bachelor's degre e in paralegal studies. While the associate's degree is still re cognized as the entry level c redential for certain paralegal positions, many jurisdictions - including Kentucky metropolitan areas - now require a bachelor' s degree. Legal specialty course requireme nts are shared between the asso ciate and bachelor's degrees, and the co st of maintaining the associate degree option is minimal. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Upon graduation, students should be able to: 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the paralegal profession an d the ethical restrictions of practice; 2. Communicate effectively within the standards of practice; 3. Apply concepts of substantive law and procedure; 4. Develop and execute effective legal research strategies; 5. Critically approach and construct legal argument; 6. Practice with sensitivity and recognition of cultural and s ocioeconomic differences; and, 7. Understand the importance of public service and community e ngagement in the legal field. Student learning is assessed ut ilizing the following tools: 1. InClass Performance Indicators (by instructors, service pa rtners, intern supervisors): cla ss participation, oral argumen t, examinations (including an exit e xam administered during the la st semester), exercises/projects, courtroom experiences, presentations, and legal research and writing; 2. Surveys: graduates, employers, bar associations, paralegal associations; 3. Consultation: advisory board , American Bar A ssociation; an d 4. Program Reviews: Institution, American Bar Association. As part of the ABA Site Visit in 2010, the ABA re commended that a second, fulltime faculty member be added to the Program ranks and that a bachelor's degree option be considered . A second fulltime faculty person was hired in 2011 and again in 2015 (first hire return ed to private practice), and a bachelor's degree option which was already in development was fully approved in 2014 for first offering in spring 2015. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Program surveys the followin g on curriculum, employment rea diness, market demand/trends, continued education, and state/national certification exa m attempts/pass rates: 1) pro gram graduates (within 6 months, then every 4 years); 2) employers (every 4 years); 3) r egional bar association (period ically, fall 2018); 4) Southern Kentucky Paralegal Association (periodically, fall 2018). The Program consults with the following experts on curriculum, pedagogy, employment readiness, market demand/trends, state/national certification exa m attempts/pass rates: 1) adv isory board (meets 2 times pe r year); 2) American Bar Association (interim reports, reapproval reports, site visits) ; 3) Kentucky Paralegal Associa tion (every year); 4) National Association of Legal Assistants (every year). Information from surveys and/or consultations is evaluated and revisions to curriculum and pe dagogy are mad e as required for improved student success. Paralegals have a plethora of opportunities in today's market o ver and above private law practice. Graduates from the program have found employment in court services, property manag ement and human resources. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Program surveys the followin g on curriculum, employment rea diness and market demand/trends: 1) program graduates (within 6 months, then every 4 years); 2) employers (every 4 y ears); 3) regional bar associat ion (periodically, fall 2018); 4) Southern Kentucky Paralegal Asso ciation (periodically, fall 201 8). The Program consults with the following experts on curriculum, pedagogy, employment readiness and market demand/trends: 1) advisory board (meets 2 times per year); 2) American Bar Association (i nterim reports, reapproval reports, site visits); 3) Americ an Association for Paralegal E ducation (annual conference). Information from surveys and/or consultations is evaluated and revisions to curriculum and pe dagogy are mad e as required for improved employment readiness. In the most recent employer surv ey, 4 employers scored current employees \"3\" in the following categories: communication skills (2), writing skills (1), a nd research skills (1). Facul ty reformulated projects to mirro r writing assignments that wou ld be given in small, general practice firms. More time is spent on e diting as students are allotted individual tutorial times for l arger projects such as trial briefs and appellate briefs. Students ar e graded on tutorial participation as well, including but not limited to their ability to addre ss criticism. Overall, 84% of employers surveyed believed PLS graduates are more than adequately prepared for practice. e.

How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) 1. Demand: a. Occupational Information Network: \"bright outlook\" with projected growth 15% or higher and the addition of 34,700 positions (in Kentucky, that growth is expected to be 13% or hi gher); b. The Occupational Outlook Han dbook (U.S. Dept. of Labor): projected growth for the paral egal profession through 2026 is 15% which is much faster than average; and c. Kentucky Career Profiles: paralegal profession will exper ience fast growth through 2024. 2. Workforce Needs: Paralegals draft documents, provide litig ation support, conduct fact/lega l research, analyze legal issue s and interact with clients, attorn eys, judges, and court staff. To best prepare students for the workplace, the Program focuse s its curriculum as follows: a. Knowledge: substantive law, procedure, government, languag e; b. Skills: reading comprehensio n, active listening, oral/writ ten communication, critical thinking, time management; and c. Technology: recog nition and use of artificial intelligence ; analytics; efiling; research, case management, word processi ng software and other technology typically used in legal support. Notably, while the associate's degree is still re cognized as th e entry level credential by some employment publications, many jurisdictions - includ ing Kentucky metropolitan areas - now req uire a bachelor's degree. Further, students interested in graduate or law school must co mplete a bachelor's degree. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) 1. The Program is approved by the American Bar Association via rigorous reporting and site in vestigation procedures. Only about 25% of the paralegal progr ams nationwide have this approv al status. 2. The Program provides both app lied and theoretical instructi on from a practitioner perspecti ve and incorporates electives from multiple disciplines. 3. Internal and external partners: a. DELO: to develop and improve online instruction; b. Community: to cultivate oppo rtunities for service learning and networking; c. Regional Campuses of WKU: to improve access, advising, cur riculum, and pedagogy. All le gal specialty courses are available to regional campus s tudents online or via IVS. 4.

It provides students an opportunity ov er and above the required internship to work in an office setting managing case files, condu cting client intake interview s, and completing fact and legal research projects. 5. Top Paralegal Scholar and Dig ital Badging: Program faculty have developed standards to award and document outstanding performance to enhance graduate resumes and social media presence in an effort to increase employment opportunities. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 1. The Program is approved by the American Bar Association via rigorous reporting and site in vestigation procedures. Only about 25% of the paralegal progr ams nationwide have this approv al status. 2. The Program is efficient. Students can complete the degree in four semesters of fulltime enrollment. Courses are offered according to a published rotatio n and delivery modalities vary to accommodate student schedules and learning styles. 3. The curriculum is relevant and prepares graduates for emplo yment in a variety of settings, not just traditional paralegal practice. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Program intends to phase out this degree option in lieu of certificate programs. The National Center for Education Statistics found fr om 2000-01 to 2015-16, the number of certificates below the associate's level conferred by public institutions increased by 99 percent (from 310,000 to 615,000). A general certificate could serv e as a pipeline for students to the bachelor's degree in Paralegal Studies. It allows students to have the skills to ob tain an entrylevel position a s a paralegal. Should th ey wish to enhance their knowledge and improve their skills , they could continue the edu cation in the BA program. Additionally, for non traditional students seeking a ch ange or advancement in career, the certificate would be a less time consuming, and less expensive, option to o btain career success. The profe ssion will grow quickly through 2026 as projected by state and national employment experts, and a certificate wou ld help meet this employment growth projection in an expedient fashion and may overcome barriers to higher edu cation for the nontraditional student population. A specialty certificate in areas such as legal technology, heal th care, or elder law woul d allow practitioners to continue their education in an effort to advance in their caree rs. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The existence of a major option i n paralegal studies is aligned with state and nati onal trends for employability. The U.S. Department of Labor has projected the job outlook for the paral egal profession through 2026 to be 15% which is much faster than average. The Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet also anticipates fas t growth within the state through 2024. U.S. News reports that the paralegal prof ession is ranked in the top twe nty best social service jobs and top one hundred best overall jobs. Further, Yahoo!\u00ae Education has chose n the paralegal profession as its number two \"encore\" career for individuals looking to switch career tracks. As demand continues to grow, the trend in many jurisdictions -i ncluding the WKU service regio n, Louisville, Lexington, and Nashville is the requirement of a bachelor's degree as the en try level academic credential; t hus, in 2015, WK U offered its first bachelor's degree option t o students. Dec line in enrollm ent in the associate's degree is consistent with other fouryea r postsecondary institutions - in Kentucky and other states. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) 1. Marketing plan targets stude nts at high sch ools with strong programs in law/government, p lacebound students served by WKU Regional campuses, and nontraditional students without col lege backgrounds or who are seeking to change careers. Activities include: school visit s, updating print and online P rogram materials, maintaining an active presence on social medi a and engaging in educational and service activities on campus an d within the community. 2. Student Success: a. Addition of AB program option in 2015; b. Course Plan/Advising: A 2ye ar course plan including deliv ery modality; regular and meaningful communication with students regarding graduation requirements and employment; c. Rewarding Student Performance: Top Paralegal Scholars, Dig ital Badging, Local and State Association Scholarships document outstanding performance in the Program; and d. Exit Exam: Measures student learning and is used to revise curriculum, pedagogy and performance measures. 3. Efficiency: a. In 2015, a second fulltime faculty member was hired reduci ng use of parttime faculty; and b. Program faculty teach a 4/4 load and may teach in the winte r/summer as demand grows. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The Program intends to transitio n the associate's degree in par alegal studies to certificate pr ograms of 15\u201418 hours each. These certificate programs will be developed in consultation wi th the advisory board and the American Bar Association and will be reflective of market trends for practice specialties. The creation of these certificates is currently hampered by the curriculum freeze imposed by Academic Affairs.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Program mission statement is reflective of the University, Collegeand Departmentstatements in that it focuses on academic quality, access, inter disciplinary study and student e ngagement while providi ng practical and marketable skills that will transition the st udent to the workplace - regionally and n ationally. The paralegal curri culum and pedagogy emphasize critical analysis, research, legal writing, technology, time ma nagement and organization. It is approved by the American Bar Association and delivered by facu lty who are licensed practitio ners. Graduates of the Program demonstrate an understanding of the pa ralegal profession and the ethi cal restrictions of practice; communicate effectively within the standards of practice; apply concepts of substantive law and procedure; execute effective legal research strategies; criti cally construct legal argument; practice with sensit ivity and recognition of cultural and socioeconomic differences; and, understand the importance of pu blic service and community engagement. These skills uniquely prepare students for postbaccalaureate work in progra ms such as Human Resourc es, Criminology, Public Administration or Leadership a s well as law school. Of progra m graduates, 38% are pursuin g law degrees and 25% are pursuing master's degrees or certificates. The Program has two courses included in Colonnade program/Conne ctions category: PLS 324 (Women and the Law); and PLS 375 (Comparative Legal Systems). c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Only three years old, the Progra m has 41 enrolled studentseven though it has had no marketing budget or other significant financial support (internal or external) during that time; was housed in University College whi ch was finally dissolved in Jun e, 2018, after years of criticism a nd speculation; and is challeng ed by brand confusion within the institution regarding majors appropriate for the legal profession. Of the nine new majors approved by WKU since 2013, the bachelor 's degree in paralegal studies ranks fifth in enrollment. Compared to other preprofessiona l degrees, the bachelor's degr ee in paralegal studies ran ks third in enrollment. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Upon graduation, students should be able to: 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the paralegal profession an d the ethical restrict ions of practice; 2. Communicate effectively within the standards of practice; 3. Apply concepts of substantive law and procedure; 4. Develop and execute effective legal research strategies; 5. Critically approach and construct legal argument; 6. Practice with sensitivity and recognition of cultural and s ocioeconomic differences; and, 7. Understand the importance of public service and community e ngagement in the legal field. Student learning is assessed ut ilizing the following tools: 1. InClass Performance Indicators (by instructors, service pa rtners, intern supervisors): cla ss participation, oral argumen t, examinations (including an exit e xam administered during the la st semester), exercises/projects, courtroom experiences, presentations, and legal research and writing ; 2. Surveys: graduates, employers, bar associations, paralegal associations; 3. Consultation: advisory board , American Bar A ssociation; an d 4. Program Reviews: Instituti on, American Bar Association. As part of the 2017 site visit, th e ABA recommended that the Pr ogram actively recruit more diverse faculty to vary the instructional perspective and en rich the student experience. T he Program recruited an African American male attorney to teach parttime in the area of business transact ions and debtor /creditor relations begi nning in spring 2019. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Program surveys the followin g on curriculum, employment rea diness, market demand/trends, continued education, and state/national certification exa m attempts/pass rates: 1) pro gram graduates (within 6 months, then every 4 years); 2) employers (every 4 years); 3) r egional bar association (period ically, fall 2018); 4) Southern Kentucky Paralegal Association (periodically, fall 2018). The Program consults with the following experts on curriculum, pedagogy, employment readiness, market demand/trends, state/national certification exa m attempts/pass rates: 1) adv isory board (meets 2 times pe r year); 2) American Bar Association (interim reports, reapproval reports, site visits) ; 3) Kentucky Paralegal Associa tion (every year); 4) National Association of Legal Assistants (every year). Information from surveys and/or consultations is evaluated and revisions to curriculum and pe dagogy are mad e as required for improved student success. Paralegals have a plethora of opportunities in today's market o ver and above private law practice. Graduates from the program have found employment in court services, corporate lega l departments, mortgage and title companies, legal education, government and politic al offices, nonprofit organiz ations, law enforcement/corre ctions, real estate sales, property management and human resources. The state of Washingto n (other states soon to fo llow) have authorized via statute the limited practice of l aw by paralegals who have obta ined the status of a limited license legal technician. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Program surveys the followin g on curriculum, employment rea dinessand market demand/tren ds: 1) program graduates (within 6 months, then every 4 years); 2) employers (every 4 y ears); 3) regional bar associat ion (periodically, fall 2018); 4) Southern Kentucky Paralegal Asso ciation (periodically, fall 201 8). The Program consults with the following experts on curriculum, pedagogy, employment readiness and market demand/trends: 1) advisory board (meets 2 times per year); 2) American Bar Association (i nterim reports, reapproval reports, site visits); 3) Americ an Association for Paralegal E ducation (annual conference). Information from surveys and/or consultations is evaluated and revisions to curriculum and pe dagogy are mad e as required for improved employment readiness. In the most recent employer surv ey, 4 employers scored current employees \"3\" in the following categories: communication skills (2), writing skills (1 ), and research skills (1). Faculty reformulated projects to mirror writing assignments tha t would be given in small, general practice firms. More time is spent on e diting as students are allotted individual tutorial times for l arger projects such as trial briefs and appellate briefs. Students ar e graded on tutorial participation as well, including but not limited to their ability to addre ss criticism. Overall, 84% of employers surveyed believed PLS graduates are more than adequately prepared for practice. e.

Prior to the 201819 AY, DELO revenue was distributed to th e home department to be used for professional development, course materials and/or physical plant updates. The Student Government Association has committed to funding a p ortion of the WKU Student Legal Services clinic operations. For the past 3 years, it has paid the legal malpr actice insurance premium that is required for attorneys (parale gal faculty and community partners) d onating legal services to the Clinic. The Clinic provides free or scaled pay legal services to WKU students. It is also used to educate and train paralegals by providing supervised experien ce with criminal and civil case intake, litigation and re solution practices. Philanthropic opportunities exist to create a Center for Law an d Justice that would house the Paralegal Program and the WKU Student Legal Services as well a s other lawrelated academic an d/or extracurricular programs. c.

Demand: The three major employment publications agree that the paralegal profession w ill experience fast growth through 2026. a. Occupational Information Network (O*NET): \"bright outlook\" with projected growth 15% or higher and the addition of 34,700 positions ( in Kentucky, that growth is expected to be 13 % or higher); b. The Occupational Outlook Han dbook (U.S. Dept. of Labor): projected growth for the paral egal profession through 2026 is 15% which is much faster than average; and c. Kentucky Career Profiles: paralegal profession will exper ience fast growth through 2024. 2. Workforce Needs: Paralegals draft documents, provide litig ation support, conduct fact/lega l research, analyze legal issue s and interact with clients, attorn eys, judges, and court staff.

Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) 1. The Program is approved by the American Bar Association via rigorous reporting and site investigation procedures. Only about 25% of the paralegal progr ams nationwide have this approv al status. 2. The Program provides both app lied and theoretical instructi on from a practitioner perspecti ve and incorporates electives from multiple disciplines. 3. Internal and external partners: a. DELO: to develop and improve online instruction and to mar ket the Program in the regions serviced by WKU's regional campuses; b. Community: to cultivate oppo rtunities for service learning and networking; and c. Regional Campuses of WKU: to improve access, advising, cur riculum, and pedagogy. All le gal specialty courses are available to regional campus s tudents online or via IVS. 4. WKU Student Legal Services: This legal clinic is unique in the state and the nation in that it staffs undergraduate stude nt workers and volunteers. It provides students an opportunity ov er and above the required internship to work in an office setting managing case files, condu cting client intake interview s, and completing fact and legal research projects. 5. Top Paralegal Scholar and Dig ital Badging: Program faculty have developed standards to award and document outstanding performance to enhance graduate resumes and social media presence in an effort to increase employment opportunities. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Two of the taglines used to promote the Program are \"Student Ce ntered\" and \"Job Ready.\" The P rogram is distinctive in its continuous focus on employment p rospects and providing multiple networking opportunities within the profession. Graduates have an excellent job placement rate, and several hav e gone on to continue their education in graduate or law school. A curriculum plan included as part of the intrusive ad vising process has been created t o ensure successful retention and completion rates for students. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) 1. As a result of institutional changes, new markets are openi ng up in Louisville and northe rn Tennessee. Further, articulation agreements pending between WKU Regional a nd OCTC, ECTC and SKYCTC should increase placebound student access to the major in the regions served by those camp uses. 2. The Program prepares graduate s for a wide variety of jobs a s well as continuing education, including law school; but, the \"paralegal studies\" title is limit ing. Many paralegal programs use the title \"Legal Studies,\" including Morehead State University. Currently, negotiat ions are underway at WKU to cre ate a legal studies major to include courses in political science, history and paralegal st udies. At a minimum, the Prog ram would benefit from centr alized prelaw advising. 3. The Limited License Legal Tec hnician movement in Washington , Utah and Oregon allows paral egals to practice law in family law cases in an attempt to narrow the access to justice gap. Other states are consider ing similar statutory authority for paralegals. 4. The creation of legal special ty certificates in areas such as technology, elder law and heal th law are part of a national trend, and the Program intends to move forward with the develop ment of certificate opti ons as allowed by WKU. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The U.S. Department of Labor has projected the job outlook for the paralegal profession thro ugh 2026 to be 15% which is much faster than average. The Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet also ant icipates fast growth within the state through 2024. U.S. News reports that the paralegal prof ession is ranked in the top twe nty best social service jobs and top one hundred best overall jobs. Further, Yahoo!\u00ae Educati on has chosen the paralegal profession as i ts number two \"encore\" career for individuals looking to switch career tracks . As demand continues to grow, the trend within many jurisdiction s is the requirement of a bachelor's degree as the entry level academic credential; t hus, in 2015, WKU offered its first bache lor's degree option to students. The curriculum, delivery modality and performance measures have been adapted to address varied learning styles and are centered on jo b readiness. Further, the legal profession is growing more dep endent on technology to communicate, to cre ate and to litigate. The Program has therefore developed a standalone legal technology course and incorporates techn ology instruction in other legal specialty course s such as evid ence, civil procedure, rese arch/writing, real est ate, and criminal law. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) 1. Marketing plan targets stude nts at high sch ools with strong programs in law/government, p lacebound students served by WKU Regional campuses, and nontraditional students without col lege backgrounds or who are seeking to change careers. Activities include: school visit s, updating print and online P rogram materials, maintaining an active presence on social medi a and engaging in educational and service activities on campus an d within the community. The Program has also developed and delivered 1 Colonnade/Connections course (PLS 324) for the last 2 AYs, and plans to add a second Colonnade/Connections course (PLS 375) in the upcoming AY. Also , a study abroad course (PLS 400) was approved for delivery in Winter 2020. 2. Student Success: a. Course Plan/Advising: A 2ye ar course plan including deliv ery modality; regular and meaningful communication with students regarding graduation requirements and employment; b. Rewarding Student Performance: Top Paralegal Scholars, Dig ital Badging, Local and State Association Scholarships document outstanding performance in the Program; and c. Exit Exam: Measures student learning and is used to revise curriculum, pedagogy and performance measures 3. Efficiency: a. In 2015, a second fulltime faculty member was hired reduci ng use of parttime faculty; and b. Program faculty teach a 4/4 load and may teach in the winte r/summer as demand grows. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The Program is practical and the demand is high. To meet the e mployment growth potential, both statewide and on a national level, the program shou ld continue its recruiting effo rts as outlined above. Further , curriculum must include a balance of theory and application and must be delivered from a practitioner perspective. After reasonable opportunity is provided, enrollment will grow a s the Program w ill directly ben efit from the stabilit y and support of Potter College and the Department of Political Science. Within 10 years, the hope is to create a Center for Law and Jus tice to house similarlyfocused academic and extracurricular programs with private support. The Center would include an off ice suite for WKU Stud ent Legal Services, a legal advising and career center and a mock trial courtroom. Impediments to greater Program success in the past: 1. Dissolution of University College; 2. Lack of marketing support/funding; 3. Lack of professional developm ent funding for Program facult y who are evaluated for promotion and tenure based on pedagogical innovation; and 4. The confusion cre ated by prelaw adv ising and the existence of the legal studies minor ca using confusion for students interested in the legal profession. e.

PJ 131 Introduction to Digital Photography, which is a require d class for Journalism majors, h as always been open to any faculty, staff, and students within the university and to members o f the local community. This cour se is often the first to fill dur ing registration. It has just been approved as a Colonnade course, so more sections will be offere d, including during the summer term. PJ 261 Introduction to Multimedia is also a required cl ass for Journalism majors, but anyone within the university or beyond who has completed PJ 131 can take this course (there are plans in place to apply for Colonnade status for this course as well). PJ 390 Cultural His tory of Photography is offered as an elective within SJB but is open to anyone within the universit y. This class has just been approved as a Colonnade course. In addition, the Photojournalis m minor was created for the primary purpose of servicing the broad appeal of photography and its usefulness as a supplementa ry skill in various professions. Now in its third year, there are already 34 minors in the pro gram representing disciplines f rom across the university. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Photojournalism students and facu lty engage in ac tivities outsi de of the program that are designed to enrich their classroom experience and benefit the unive rsity, the surrounding communit y, the state of Kentucky, and beyond. For instance, the program's students mak e up the visual staffs of the university publications and sports informat ion services. Photojournalism students and a faculty member recently made portraits for refug ees, partnering with the Warren County Services Fair.

Conduct research on social issues and dev elop oral and writte n proposals that effectively out line how these stories will be presented in a visual narrative form. Examine journalistic writing t echniques and apply them to wri ting captions, story proposals, and stories. Develop, build, and deploy a n effective online portfolio. Apply best business practices and strategies for successfully working in the photojournalism profession, especially as it applies to freelance photography. The SLO's are assessed through we ekly handson assignments and longterm projects, along wi th professional internships, that over the course of four years enable students to gain prac tical experience to master these objectives. Recent assessments revealed that students were lacking in techn ical skills that were affect ing the quality of their photography, so a freshman course was created to close the loop on this inefficiency, giving stu dents an additional semester of technical training through communitybased projects, resulti ng in a significant improvement in the students' skills in preparation for the more advanced courses. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Photojournalism has an extensive alumni base that regularly eng ages with faculty an d students. Graduates have been willing to express their feelings about their education and subsequent work experience. There is an open Facebook alumni group and Instagram account, a closed Facebook alumni group, and a Mo untain Workshops Facebook group. Alumni feedback provides the faculty with an idea of how graduates are performi ng in the industry, and these graduates in turn provide concrete ideas and solutions when it comes to improving the edu cation of current students. Graduates are also tracked through an internal blog at www.wkupj.com . Though the Employment Statistic s link above does not address em ployment trends in the pho tojournalism industry, in the past two years the program has engaged alumni with a Google sur vey on job placement one year after graduation. The key areas of placement for graduate s cover a wide array ofopportuni ties. Alumniare working in the visual industry in a variety of photography, video, and editing positions, from newspaper and p rint magazines to online j ournalism blogs, reviews, nonprofit organizations, political campaigns, video production houses, and public relations firms. They are engaged in traditional brick and mortar pub lications as much as they are e ngaged in the digital media environment. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Photojournalism program engag es in three major events durin g the academic year that offer a structur ed analysis of the curriculum and how it aligns itself with the industry: The Mountain Workshops takes p lace in a different community e ach year in Kentucky. This is an intensive fiveday workshop where nationally renow ned visual professionals from ac ross the country engage with students and the Photojournalism program faculty. This exchange has resulted in several adjustments to the curriculum. WKU PJ Career Day attracts visual professionals from across t he country who interact with students in a job interview environment. This event also gives the faculty the opportunity to interact with the professiona ls to get their f eedback about student performance and receive curriculum advice. The Photojournalism program's Professional Advisory Committee comes to campus to review sen ior projects and portfolios and formally assess the performa nce of the Photojournalism prog ram. These assessments are used in academic program reviews and have resulted in sev eral significant changes in the curriculum. As early as 2005, professionals p articipating in WKU PJ Career Day have emphasized t he need for still phot ographers to learn video skills. This advice has pla yed a large part in the Photoj ournalism program's move to incl ude videospecific courses to the curriculum. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) The Photojournalism program con tinues to a leading visual journ alism institute in the countr y. Students consistently win awards in national and international competitions, including th e Hearst Journalism Awards, often referred to as the Pulitzers of college journalism; students ha ve won 24 Intercollegiate Pho tojournalism national champion ships in the past 29 years of and have won seven national championships in the Multimedia Com petition. Strong recognition such as this, along with close ties to the industry, enable students to obtain over 25 interns hips a year at prestigious organizations such as The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, TIME, the Chicago Tribune, The Washin gton Post, Kertis Creative, and Apple. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Photojournalism program has the following funding sources: Scholarships (the following amounts are approximate yearly payo uts from interest) George Tames Scholarship Fund $8,000 Michael L. Morse Endowment Fund $1,500 Larry Powell Endowment Fund $1,500 Kodak Professional Photogra phy Scholarship Fund $800 Photojournalism 9/11 Sc holarship Fund $800 Chester Earl Johnson Scholarship Fund $500 Lynn Delaney Saunders Scholarship Fund $500 David Cooper Scholarship Fund $500 Revenue sources through the Mountain Workshops that also benefi t the Photojournalism Program: Charles Mason Ralph Sony $3,000 Tamron $1,000 What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Though not a guaranteed revenue stream, student awards in the H earst Photojournalism and Multimedia competitions have brought in over $250,000 since the 20112012 academic year. In addition, the program's firstplace Intercollegiate wins in both Photojournalism and Multimed ia played a key role in the Sc hool of Journalism and Broadca sting winning the $25,000 firstplace Intercollegiate Over all award this past year. This revenue has helped with funding muchneeded equipment and other purchases within the Photo journalism program and SJB as a whole, especially crucial given the university budget cuts in recent years. However, this revenue cannot be counted on in fut ure years, given its source. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Global Learning: WKU's partnership with the Danish School of Media and Journal ism has brought several international students from Denmark to study in the Photojou rnalism program at WKU. In retu rn, several students from the Photojournalism program have spent a semester studying at the Danish School. Two faculty members have partnered with students through the FUSE program. Both involved projects conducted by students working abroad. One proj ect about a migrant worker tra veling from Mexico to work in the U.S. resulted in national recognition in the Hearst Jo urnalism Awards competition. A Culture of Innovation: Two Photojournalism program cla sses, PJ 131 Introduction to D igital Photography, and PJ 390 Cultural History of Photography, have just been approved as Colonnade courses. A Regional Lighthouse The focus of the Photojournalism program is to prepare a dive rse student body to meet the challenges of the highly competitive media profession by i mmersing students in diverse c ommunities. Students are required to go out into their community to interact with and document people who are differen t from them. These projects ultimately serve to strengthen students' interperson al skills and foster a greater understanding of and sensitiv ity to those who are being documented. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Opportunity - Objective 2 Through a partnership with Dataseam, a Kentucky nonprofit organ ization funded by the state that provides media education to coalcounty schools, K12 teachers participate in the Mounta in Workshops, learning a longside participants and professionals from across the coun try. They then t ake that know ledge back to their classrooms. The following is a link to information about this partnership: http://www.kydataseam.com/learnin glibrary?pid=WKU+Mountain+Work shop. Dataseam estimates that as a result of the program, thousands o f students have benefited from this teacher training. The following is a link to a teacher testimonial: http://www.kydataseam.com/projectreview?pid=1159 . Impact - Objective 9 Internships at professional media publications pro vide one of t he most valuable educational experiences outside of the classroom. Though internships are not required to graduate, mos t students complete at least one internship before they graduate, and many complete two or more. These internships prov ide students with practical e xperience that supplements classroom learning, preparing the m to be competitive members of the workforce. The follow ing is a link to student internships since 2016: http://wkupj.com/internships/. To supplement classroom instruction and critique, professionals are brought in either in pe rson or through Skype to demonstrate techniques, critique portfolios, and inspire the st udents to excel in th eir future profession. The following link shows a list of these guests: http://wkupj.com/guests/ . c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Photojournalism program graduate s fill key positions in traditi onal Kentucky publications, su ch as the Daily News, The CourierJournal, the Lexington HeraldLeader, the MessengerEnq uirer, and several smaller newspapers in the state. But there is no doubt that traditional photojou rnalism employment o pportunities in the state have shrunk, as outlined in Kentucky Occupational Outlook to 202 6. That is why the programhas for the past 15 years placed such a n emphasis on students supplementing their st ill photography experience with video, editing, design, and writ ing skills. This has resulted i n students branching out into other visual fields. For instance, several graduates are currently working for Kertis Creative, a multimedia production agency b ased in Louisville. In addition, storytelling in the style of docu mentary photojournalism is in great demand in fields like adve rtising, business, nonprofits, and public relations, so student s are graduating with a skillse t that positions them for employment that goes far beyond the tra ditional photojournalism path. The Photojournalism program remai ns the only one of its kind in the state of Kentucky. WKU Photojournalism also has a national reputation; it is regarded as one of the top programs in the country. As a result, graduates can be found working across the state and throughout the country. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Mountain Workshops is the mo st important educational missio n for the Photojournalism p rogram beyond classroom instruction. Every year between 3040 students are mentored by the top professionals in the p hotojournalism industry. They also serve the communities they cover by their documentation of these Kentucky counties. Please see https://mountainworkshops.org/ . In 2017 the Mountain Workshops was given the Media Award in t he Kentucky Governor's Awards in the Arts program. Reflective of student competitive ness at a global level, Photoj ournalism students have consisten tly won numerous awards at the international, national, and state levels. These awards not only bring recognit ion to the Photojour nalism program but to the School of Journalism and Bro adcasting and the university. S ee http://wkupj.com/recognition/ for a list of awards earned since the 20112012 school year. Faculty members in Photojourna lism have participated in numerou s direct and indirect recruitment activities for prospective students, including several colle ge information days scheduled throughout the year; oncampus photography workshops for high school students in Kentucky ; representation at the last tw o National High School Journ alism conventions; and the Mountain Workshops. In addition, every year a faculty member ju dges the national Quill and Sc roll high school publications contest, giving him an opportunity to identify emerging talent from across the nation. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) All photojournalism faculty membe rs actively pursue documentary projects regionally, nation ally, and internationally, keeping them current in the fiel d and inspiring their students. Faculty also share their knowledge beyond the university, teaching high school students in the Kentucky High School Media Institute and in the Governor's Scholars Program, as well as conducting photography workshops at the Interscholastic League Press Conference in Austin, Te xas. These activities inspire new generations of journalists an d draw attention to WKU when i t comes to these students ma king college choices. In addition, a faculty member has t aught in the Harlaxton College study abroad program. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Photojournalism is constantly cha nging, especially with the rol es that professionals play in newsrooms and beyond. WKU Photojournalism is preparing stude nts to enter this highly comp etitive profession by teaching foundational skills in ethical decisionmaking and strong stor ytelling through still photograp hy, video, design, editing, and writing. Flexibility and adaptability to change are also e mphasized, as well as critical interpersonal communication ski lls. As publicat ions like The Washington Post pass one million online subscriptions, students need tools and skills that allo w them to meet the demands of these publications as new job descriptions are created in th ese environments. As the faculty continues to stay current with the profession and connect their students to it, there is a nee d to emphasize skill sets using the latest developments in camera technology and software . The curriculum currently offere d by the Photojournalism maj or accomplishes these goals, based on outside professional revi ews and by positive results i n national contests and successful job placement. But there is always room for further developme nt, especially in terms of acc ommodating transfer students who want to experience WKU's nationally renowned program but need to graduate in a tim ely manner, as well as to dr aw more interdisciplinary interest in the major through the quickly expanding Photojourna lism minor. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The link above does not specify statistics for photojournalism, so it is difficult to determine trends beyond WKU's statistics . Institutional statistics show an initial enrollment drop in the Photojournalism program, but thi s has actually leveled off in recent years, with conferrals fluctuating from year to year. Sh arp increases in tuition have significantly affected student enrollment; since the program has always attracted a large numb er of outofstate students due to its national reputation, these increases have hit the P hotojournalism program especially hard. Despite these trends, and the relative lack of resources compared to competing institutions such as the Univer sity of North Carolina and Syracuse University, the Photojournalism program continue s to excel, consistently winnin g international, national, a nd statewide competitions, obtaining internships and career enrichment through programs li ke the Mountain Workshops and WKU PJ Career Day, and securing jobs after graduation a t publications like The New Yor k Times, TIME, and The Washington Post. In addition, support from Nikon, Canon, Sony, and Tamron provides equipment to stude nts and faculty for use in enhancing learning and instruction. These sponsors prov ide equipment for only a few se lect schools nationwide, demonstrating that WKU's Photojournalism program is consid ered a toptier program in the country. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Photojournalism instituted a core curriculum change in 2015. Th is has resulted in a program that gives students an even stronger foundation in still photo graphy compared to the previo us curriculum and establishing a video class in the second year of the program to better prepare students for the advanced video courses. This has prod uced positive results while maintaining the program's rigorous schedule and high expectatio ns; both are necessary for students to be not just average, but exceptional photojournalists, which is a necessary quality to compete in the demanding photojournalism profession. At the same time, this ne eds to be balanced with offering some fle xibility in course schedules for transfer student s, minors, and even freshman students entering the university with 12 or more credits. As a companion to t hese curriculum changes, recruitment has ramped up in ord er to increase enrollment. To t his end, a Photojournalism program faculty member has recruited potential students at two national high school confer ences and plans are in place for more recruitment at a state and local level. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Three major areas where Photojou rnalism needs to expand in the next 510 years: 1. Develop a program that incor porates online design, programmi ng,and data visualization to help recruit a new kind of student who does not want to be a \"hunter/gatherer\" of journali stic content but one who produces work created by other journalists and effectively pres ents it online. This would also help retain students who no longer want to gather content but still want to be a part of visual journalims; currently these s tudents are lost to other majo rs. This will require a new hire with specialized skills, which is a di fficult proposal in the curren t economic climate. 2. Develop more overseas educatio nal opportunities like the pro gram's partnership with the Danish School of Media and Journalism (see section 5a), for both studen ts and faculty. Ass istance in finding funding would make these opportunities more feasible. 3. Develop an online curriculum to extend the reach of the prog ram beyond the oncampus experience. This would not only increase enrollment numbers, it would aid in recruitment. This possibility is already being ex plored, but it will require extensive curriculum changes/appr oaches to convert these visual classes that are dependent on classroom interaction into successful courses in the online environment. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Philosophy and Religion Name: Philosophy Reference 745 Type (AB, BS, etc.): BA STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 31 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Philosophy prepares students for a variety of postgraduate pro grams and careers, including hum anities and STEM fields; law and medical school; public administration and government servic e; economics, MBA, and intern ational business programs; and service/volunteer opportunities (Fulbright, Teach for Ameri ca, GAP Year). It is a flexible, highly regarded co/major for many postbaccalaureate fields a nd endeavors. Moreover, it is a standard component of undergraduate GenEd through Colonnade. Delivery modes include ld (100200) lecture/discuss ion classes, intensive ud and seminar offerings (300400), and focused seniorseminar and directedstudy groups (496, 499) . All these are typically offered facetoface, though select courses (102, 214, 320, 426) are also presented online and ond emand (102, 341). Caps and enrolments typically, and successfully, follow college/unive rsity guidelines, with expect ed adjustment lags whenever these are retroactively altered. Philosophy requires students to h ave a second major or a minor in another discipline, but there are no prerequisites or co requirements in other areas. Admission criteria follow college and university standards. Sin ce philosophy is not included among social science qualifications for secondary education cer tification, and is therefore se ldom taught before college, recruitment occurs almost exclu sively through lowerdivision Ge nEd classes. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programs or areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Particular philosophy courses at all levels (not just Colonnade ) are part of nineteen other university majors, minors, and certificates (incl. PreLaw, Psychology, Gerontology). Moreover, philosophy is central to the university's mission. CGH emphasizes (4) the following competencies in students: \"[beside making a good living,] more i mportantly, ... the capacity to make a good life,\" th e abilities to \"make informed decisions,\" use \"critical thinking skills, \" and \"exhibit respect and responsibility toward others.\" It wants students to \"grow as sc holars and individuals,\" to \"pursue meaningful careers and lives,\" and to \"promote a culture of education beyond high scho ol.\" It promotes (6) and being \"responsible citizens and steward s of place\" (98). Also stressed ar e \"[linking] theory and practic e\" (10), having a \"world al issues\" (15), and to lve problems and engage effe ctively with others\" (15) - espe cially those who disagree with us. Though other disciplines may indirectly foster these values and skills, philosophy promotes th em directly, explicitly, and continuously. Without philosophy, CGH could not achieve its goals. Nor could the BA degree (59), whi ch demands \"... examination of historical, social, religious and political contexts; analysis of ideas ; ... ; [and] knowledge of philosophical theories ....\" In sum, in both specific and mor e general ways, Philosophy is d eeply laced into the wide r fabric of university education. (Also see 5e below.) c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) There was a gradual decrease of majors until last year, but num bers are now rebounding due to the revised (from fall 2018) major/minor requirements which have made the program more user friendly to students. This wa s necessary, esp. given the faculty turnover and losses of t he past few years. It has also begun to pay off: since the fa ll 2018 census date, Philosophy has added 7 more majors (for a total of 31 majors; 2 below our high est figure during the past 5 years). Moreover, with the increase in philosophy courses that count toward Colonnade, Phi losophy faculty are teaching about 100 more students overall during the current academic year. 3.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) NOTE: Our student learning outcomes (SLO) were instituted some year s ago and need to be revisited , particularly in view of last year's comprehensive revisio n of the major/minor programs. The current SLO is simple: \"Students will be able to read, interpret, and evaluate effectiv ely a text in the discipline.\" The logic behind this approach is that instead of testing for information or specific content - which emphasizes memory and m ay vary among individual students based on course work - it is more fruitful to evaluat e philosophical ability as an act ive competence visavis differe nt texts from the disciplinary literature. P ROCEDURE: Representative papers from graduating senior students are col lected each term and distributed (without identification) to all Philosoph y faculty, who individually sco re them according to the following rublic. RUBRIC: There are three separate categ ories (read, interpret, and eva luate philosophical arguments ), and each is scored as (i) excellent, (ii) a dequate, or (iii) ina dequate. These partic ular assessments (also unidentif ied) are then tabulated, distri buted, and jointly discussed by the faculty. R ESPONSE: Collective scores in each categ ory should go up each year. If not, or if there is a decline, discussion turns to possible reasons for this, and to specific classroom exercises and assig nments (and, possible course revisions) that may remedy deficiencies. Implementation is left to individual faculty memb ers until SLO are revisited the following term. The exercise is ongoing, cumulative, and responsive to both patterns and contin gencies. EXAMPLE: One specific, collective respon se under the previous major/mi nor program was the cr eation of PHIL 299: Philosophical Writing Workshop (1 cr), which majors took twice and minors once before graduat ing. This was an 'overload' obligation which faculty taught in turns each semester. Unfortu nately, staffing problems have le d to its elimination from the new curriculum, creating the need for a new, feasible alternati ve. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Philosophy regularly conducts exit interviews,and postgradu ation surveys (with varying feedback). Such data indicate that ca. 28% of our students work in the field of education, 13% in business, 11% in research, 7% in management or social services, and 6% in health care. A relatively smaller number pu rsue philosophy graduate study, but then in highlyrated Ph.D. programs (and mostly with funding ) such as Miami of Ohio, Memph is, Emory, Villanova, Marquette , UK, The New School, and London School of Economics. Many more enter law, medicine, jour nalism, and other professio nal programs. Philosophy majors are consistently among the highest achievers on national exams like the GRE and LSAT. Our survey data suggests that all graduates fr om our program are employed. In fact, opport unities for philosophically trained individuals are legion, and there is a growing literatu re about leaders in business, industry, and technology who tout the value of their own philosoph y training. Employer surveys also indicate that longterm career success is a function of crosscutting abilities such as oral and written communi cation, teamwork, ethical jud gment and decisionmaking, critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and problemsolving (Hart, 2015 , p.4). As for income, national surveys show that the earnings of philosophy graduates may be m odest right after graduation bu t rise near the top of salary sc ales about twenty years out. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Philosophy is not staffed to gathe r data from employers, esp. g iven our graduates' diverse employment settings. We do attend to professional trends thr ough information provided by t he American Philosophical Association and other humanities organizations and publications. This material concerns curricul ar effectiveness, funding opportunities, and postbaccalaureate programs. We also share with students information about nontea ching careers, including advice from previous philosophy candidates now otherwise occupied . We strongly encourage our ma jors to add a second major, or a minor, in fields offering more 'practical' employment prospects, and that is often where they actually begin. After that, it is difficult to assign spec ific credit for their continued succ ess. See again the comments in 3c above: according to these , any improvement in our curriculum will have a favorable i mpact on students' employment prospects. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude ntsin this program?(opti onal, maximum 100 words) Our students are successful in a number of ways: they graduate in four years -well below the university average; they apply for and receive various national and international grants (see 5d); they present at professional conferences with their teachers, and publish w ith them; they initi ate local programs w hile still at WKU (Students Teac hing Students, Teaching in Juvenile Detention Facility); and they serve in various capacit ies on campus (PCAL Dean's Cou ncil, SGA officers, Society for Lifelong Learning). Also, our re tention rate is quite high, no t only because students major la ter in Philosophy than in other disciplines, but also because st udents are satisfied. It is rar e for us to lose majors, and whe n we do they typically drop to a minor. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) DELO teaching yields around $7500 per year. Faculty and student s regularly apply for andreceive FUSE grants. Individual faculty receive outside fellowshi ps from various prestigious in stitutions (NEH, Harvard/Loeb 5d] - during the past few years alone). Also, seven WKU students were fully funded by Princeton University la st year as participants in the first KentuckyPrinceton Summer Institute (fac ilitated by Philosophy) , which involved co llaborative work with Princeton students in two settings (Louisville and New Jersey). We ar e planning to pursue another collaborative arrangement whereb y a shared faculty position in biomedical ethics might be av ailable as a common resource to Philosophy, the BG Medical School, and The Medical Center. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) We have a significant and growing Colonnade presence. Many majo r/minor courses overlap with Colonnade; those that do not are not offered as frequently. Thus, the SCHP/FTF has gone up significantly of late, as we are teaching over 100 more students this academic year (2018 19). As for underenrolled s ections, if we consider the fig ures just for Philosophy, the percentage is closer to 11.85; moreover, given that two of the three underenrolled sections this past year were taught as uncompensated overloads, the total percentage of underenrolled courses in Philosophy becomes even lower. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Philosophy classes uniquely address CGH's stated goal of teachingstudents to \"make informed decisions using critical thinking skills, and exhibit resp ect and responsibility toward others and the environment\" (4). As the traditional home of logic, all Philosophy classes trai n students to think clearly, reflect critically, and argue co nsciously and well. Ethics clas ses not only teach respect for others as a foundational principle but e valuate positions that might be used to compromise this respect (such as efficiency dem ands). By discussing difficult i ssues and listening to others, s tudents learn to assess their o wn convictions regarding \"diversity, cultural competency, and glob al citizenry for all\" (6). Our program contributes several popular classes to Colonnade and is currently adding others (7) . Students work directly with faculty (10) on academic research projects, field work su ch as highschool teaching and prison education, and in our popular and wellattended (even by nonmajors) Philosophy Club. We evaluate student achievement through inclass presentations and debates, studentled classroom exercises, and position papers and problemoriented e ssays. Capstone projects for majors prompt reflection on their philosophy experience as a whole, and a final opportunity to articulate a rigorous and informed philosophical perspective. (Also see 2b.) And we graduate our students on time. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Aspects of SBD addressed by Philosophy include our emphasis on diversity and inclusiveness (1.1): s tudents engage many schools of thought and interact with diverse cultural tradition s. We also stress open ness and respect, not only in principle b ut in the interactive classroom and in public: e.g., we have colle ctively supported students criti cized in a local newspaper for their gender advocacy work. (1.3) The program itself (faculty, students) has gender balance, offers PHIL 212 in Colonnade, and collaborates with Gender & Women's Studies in other ways. Individual st udent advising facilitates student s' actual career interests (2.7, 9.1), assists mino rity students (1 .4), and ensu res timely graduation for all (6.1 ); it also interacts with Stu dent Affairs by referrals to the (ac ademic and clinic al) Advising Ce nter (6.4). Philosophy has seen a recent increase in majors/minors supported by the Kelly Autism Center, indicating the ability of faculty to facilit ate such students' best work; we also host Gatton Academy students interested in exploring no nSTEM disciplines (1.3, 1.4, 6.4). We welcome student collaboration in faculty research (10.4) via FUSE grants, provi de coteaching opportunities, and support on and offcampus student initiatives. We work flex ibly with majors/minors toward graduation by making appropriate adjustments to program requirements and offering (as overloads) directed studies cours es. (6.1, 6.2) c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) As noted in the Hart Report , employers benefit from the mental nimbleness and critical thi nking skills acquired from the study of logic and argumentation . Insights and peopleskills gained in ethics discussion courses are valuable to any career (education, business, service i ndustries, the military from w hich we also draw majors) wher e respectful engagement with diverse populations is increasing ly vital. The (p roposed) PPE m ajor (see 6a) brings together disparat e elements of the social, political and economic landscapes in ways that allow 'oversight ' in an increasingly fractured world, helping students find interdisciplinary solutions to a pparently isolated problems. Philosophy majors are consisten tly among the highest perform ers on the verbal and critical t hinking sections of the GRE, LSAT, and other grad uate/professional test ing mechanisms. And t hey easily elude the litany of c omplaints found in successive reports (e.g. Bloomberg, 2015, NACE 216, AACU 2018) that too many university graduates cannot communicate well, thi nk clearly and critically , interact productively with others, thin k out of the box, or tackle complex, unforseen problems as they arise. It is often noted, too, that most of the jobs of the fut ure have not yet been invented; i f so, then philosophy majors a re among those best suited to lea rn, adapt, and master them. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) Our program advocates and embodies significant diversity ( 5ab). Close to half of our majors are women, and some are from underrepresented populations. Despite our modest size, faculty have received a host of college and university awards in teaching, research, service, adv ising and UDP. Our faculty coll ectively (along with RELS and ARC) know more ancient and modern languages (Eastern and Western) than most other units, s ince we use them(e.g., Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Pali, Sanskrit, literary Chinese, etc.) actively in our research and (sometimes ) our teaching. Our faculty have served as officers and committee members for professiona l associations on both state a nd national levels; and w e have hosted regional ( KY Philos Assn) and national ( Soc for Value Inquiry ) philosophy conferences at WKU. We involve our students in the se activities. Faculty have a steady record of local su ccess in garnering sabbaticals, FUSE grants, and QT AG awards for their research. Moreover, they have received many prestigi ous national and international awards: NEH, DAAD, MWK, Ha rvard/Loeb, Thyssen/CEU, Quinn/NHC (within just the past few years). Our students have been equally successful, not only in consi stently applying for but also in receiving major grants: Fulbri ght, LSE, Rotary, Truman, HumanityinAction, etc.: we encourage and support such initiative. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) For decades, Philosophy has collaborated with Greenview Regional Hospita land The Medical Center through their hospital ethics committees, which engage in ad hoc moral conflict resolution, polic y drafting, and ongoing staff education. Philosophy has contributed to several NSFfunded summer REU ( Research Experience for Undergraduates ) programs in Ogden College (Biology, Chemistry). And we have created or pursued specific i nitiatives to further student learning, including the Kentucky Princeton Summer Institute (KPSI), prison teaching program s copopulated by select inmate s and philosophy students, Students Teaching Students (STS), and coordination with the Society for Lifelong Learning , to name but a few. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Recently, Philosophy has been working with the Politics and Economics departments to devise a combined PPE major - which already exists in many othe r institutions and attracts st udents for both intellectual and employment reasons. This new major, which doesn't require any additional resources, was read y for proposal but halted by the current freeze. Moreover, the recently established physicia ntraining program at The Medi cal Center (with which Philosophy has been actively collaborating for many years thro ugh its Hospital Ethics Commit tee) offers new opportunities for joint work. In particular, it seems advantageous to consider j oint staffing arrangements: hir ing someone to teach certain philosophy courses on campus (to premeds, nursing and health admin students, etc.), but who would also teach ethics to g raduate medical students and serve as ethics consultant on the hospital floor. Diverse pract ical arrangement are possible wit h the requisite interest and support of the relevant institutions. Philosophy already embodies many interdisciplinary approache s and serves diverse constitue ncies. Courses like PHIL 211 (criminology, sociology, psychol ogy), PHIL 322 (scientific rese arch, biological sciences, health care practice and administrat ion and policy ), PHIL 323 (economics , politics, social sciences), PHIL 332 (neurology, psycholog y, penology, law), PHIL 334 (linguistics, communications, l anguages), PHIL 344 and 346 (lit erature, history), and PHIL 426 (nursing, gerontology) reach beyond narrow disciplinary confines and make wider connections. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National figures since 20082009 indicate a slight downward tre nd in philosophymajors. However, our own program enrollment has remained relativel y constant by comparison. Inde ed, the slippage of the past few years, which was related to decreased staffing and program structure, has been remedied by the recent revision of our major /minor, so that now we are on the upswing again and close to regaining our fiveyear high (of 201314). We are optimistic that we can continue to increase our numbers with our more flexible and userfriendly n ew programs, especially if the initiatives described above ( 6a) can also be pursued. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) (i) We are suspending the interdisciplinary Classical Studies Minor program, which is housed i n Philosophy. (ii) Also, as mentioned before ( 2c, 3b, 6b), the Philosophy major/minor were both proactively revised dur ing the past two years, improving scheduling flexibility, course rotation, availability /attractiveness to students, and ease of completion - even for 'late' majors. (iii) Several new courses have been added (also to Colonnade), categories have been simplified, and options have increased. Our numbers may only gradually reflect this str eamlined road to graduation, given some faculty losses, but we expect it to continue. One go od sign is that we already pick ed up seven new majors this fa ll, after the census date. It remains for us now to market our new major/minor successfully, not only in introductory cla sses but also online, through newsletters, on Facebook, and via our new Twitter account. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) (i) Philosophy will continue to be an important part of Colonna de, solong as there is such a p rogram. (ii) Since the major overlaps significantly with existing and planned Colonnade cour ses, it can easily continue to g row apace. Moreo ver, both (iii) the proposed interdisciplinary PPE major, and (iv) the biomedic al ethics initiati ves noted above ( 6a) could greatly increase both our numbers and our on and offcampus involvements with o ther programs and institutio ns. They would also generate opportunities for widening public awareness of the program, and possibly more public uses thereof (through lectures, presentations, consultations). A s for impediments or challenge s (at least such as co st money), staffing l osses are surely on other lists beside ours, and the y are difficult to remedy solel y by our own initiative. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Potter College of Arts & Letters College: Potter College of Arts & Letters Program Name: Political Communication Reference Number: 192 CIP Code: Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): Certificate STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 18 List Concentrations (if any): N/A 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) This certificate allows for explor ation of the role that commun ication plays in political systems by combining studies in the fields of communication and political science. T he certificate is designed for students seeking preparation for careers as legislative aides, political consult ants, campaign managers, speech writers, or lobbyists. Students who complete the certif icate will have a solid foundat ion of communication skills and theory with a working knowledge of the political system. The program was red esigned last year and includes 9 hours from Communication and 9 hours from Political Science.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) This certificate is meant to be c omplementary to the PS and/or Communication majors but can also complement other majors as well. The program is explicitly designed to pr ovide skills and knowledge t o better prepare students for jobs and careers directly related to political communicatio n. The major requires 18 hours - 9 from each discipline. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Because of personnel changes the Political Communication certif icate was dormant for several years. Recent interest from students led Comm and PS to revisit the certifica te. The certificate require ments were revised and updated last year to better meet the needs of students. Market ing of the revised certificate has been delayed due to the CAPE process. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 n/a b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Explicit learning outcomes have not been developed for the cert ificate but it is designed explicitly to enhance the professional skills of students enrolled in the program. Since the certificate had largel y been placed on the back burner until renewed interest from students last year, it was s tudent feedback that drove recent revisions to the program. Courses that make up the certifi cate are assessed by the partic ipating departments as part of their normal assessment process. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We have been in contact with recent certificate recipients. St udents who earned the certificate generally put it to immediate use. For example, two of last year's graduates worke d as political campaign operatives for the 2018 cycle. The third is enrolled in graduate school at WKU and int erned with the University's Director of Government and Community Relations this Fall. Feedback on the student has been very positive and the Director would like to have the student continue worki ng in the office after the inter nship is complete. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) From contact with students and pe ople in the field we have a cl ear idea of how the program can be structured to meet the career goals of students. This feedback and informati on was used in restructuring the program last year. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) All indications are that students who recently completed the pr ogram were able to put the ir lessons to good use and the content was directly relevan t to their positions this past Fall. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by 12 Number of NTE Faculty n/a 4 Cost per SCHP/FTF by Dept. n/a n/a n/a n/a 36.3%* b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) At this point there are no direct revenue streams related to th e certificate. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) There are essentially no additiona l instructional costs for the program. We do hope to make some small investments in marketing materials for the certificate but thos e will be minimal. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) As is required by the by WKU's strategic plan, our students dev elop critical thinking skills and learn the professional skills needed to gain employment quickly after gra duation. Generally speaking, the certificate addresses the strategic plan in ma ny of the same ways that the majors in Communication and Political Science do. The course work in many of the courses that make up the certifi cate emphasize high impact practices including project- and community-based l earning (SP 3.10 & 3.11) b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) As is the case with WKU's strategic plan, the certificate also addresses key aspects of the statewide agenda in some of the same ways that the progr ams in Communication and Politic al Science do. Two particular examples of where the program addresses the stra tegic agenda are in the implementation of high impact practices (Objective 6.3) and Objective 9 where the goal is to improve the career readiness of our graduates. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) The certificate is a concrete cre dential that will enhance empl oyment options for students in related fields including government relations, public a dvocacy, electoral politics, and public relations. State and national data project growth in public relations and similar fields. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Political Communication certificate is the only one of its kind offered in Kentucky. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) This is a discrete credential explicitly designed to enhance th e employment options of students who complete the program. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The Political Communication certificate is a value added option for our students that includes only the bare minimum costs to administrate. The certificate will be another qualification that our graduates will be able to include on their resumes to distinguish themselves from other a pplicants. Both department s have plans to increase the visibility of the certificate which will increase enrollmen t in the program and likely will offer some recruitment benefits for other programs in the departments b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Since the certificate was largel y dormant for several years the re has not been much of a trend to review. Updating and promoting the certificate is consistent with national trend s that place increased value on certificate programs. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Over the past couple of years, several students expressed inter est or asked about the certificate. This led to faculty from PS & Comm to sitting down to revise and update the certifi cate. The certificate was increased from 15 to 18 hours and the curriculum was modified to better meet the needs of students. The next step is for the two Departments to increase the visibility of the certificate. The se efforts have been delayed by the CAPE process. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The certificate will be one way that students can enhance and c ustomize their academic experience. Based on unprompted interest from students , there is reason to believe t hat there is an untapped mark et for the program. It is realistic to expect about 5 to 10 students in the program at an y given time with the potential for even more than that. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Political Science (GOVT) College: Potter College of Arts & Letter Program Name: Political Science Reference Number: 686 CIP Code: (AB, STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 33 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Political Science major con sists of course o fferings in Ame rican politics, international rel ations, comparative politics, political theory, public law, an d public administration. The m ajor enhances awareness and understanding of complex political concepts, assists in dev eloping critical thinking and analytical abilities, written and oral communication, and generally helps create a more knowledgeable citizen. Completio n of the major prepares stude nts for a variety of career fields, including but not limited to government service, politi cs, business, teaching, research in political science and polic y, and entry into law and other graduate schools. The major consists of 33 hours. The 18 core hours consist of the following requirements: 110 - American National Government 499 - Senior Seminar 250 - International Relations or 260 - Comparative Politics. 3 of the following: 220 - Concepts of Political Science, 250, 260, 301 - Research M ethods, 330 - Political Theory, or 435 - American Political Thought Students also complete 15 hours of electives. A minor or 2 nd major is required. The major is primarily offered fa ce to face, but there are cour ses offered online, via IVS, ondemand, study away, and study abroad.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programs or areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Political Science major is on e of three bachelor degrees of fered by the Department. Courses in international relations and comparative politics count for both the PS and Internationa l Affairs major. The program makes significant contributions to Honors and Colon nade. We are on pace to offer over 15 Honors sections for this academic year. Since 2012, we have had over a dozen stude nts complete Honors theses. For Colonnade, we offer 3 Explorations courses and 14 Connections classes. The Department recently launched a JUMP program for the MPA deg ree. Up to 12 hours of the MPA JUMP program can be applied for the PS undergraduate requirements. Lower and upper level PS courses are required or serve as elect ives for many majors, minors, and certificates. Programs requiring PS courses include Soci al Studies, Social Work, Polit ical Communication, and Legal St udies. Programs that include PS courses as electives include C riminology, International Busi ness, Pop Culture, Paralegal St udies, Film, Organizational Leadership, and Nonprof it Administration. Department faculty participate in faculty led study abroad/away programs on an annual basis and are active with \"In Year Of\" activities. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The decline in enrolle d students between AY 2014 and following years coincides with the growth of the Department's International Affairs major. The IA major was first offered in 2009 and grew to its current number of students in FY 2016. Prior to the development of the IA major, students interested i n international relations and co mparative politics would have majored in political science and focused their coursework on th ose two areas of study. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 Rate 30 73.3% 32 81.3% 26 73.1% 29 37 61 4.69 4.06 4.17 4.62 4.34 4.39 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The learning outcomes for the d egree call for st udents to demo nstrate 1) proficiency in the knowledge of the core content of political s cience gained in required co urses including American National Government, the require d course in either Internationa l Relations or Comparative Politics, and three required courses chosen from International Relations, Comparati ve Politics, Concepts in Po litical Science, Research Methodology, and Political Theory. 2) an understanding of how formal political institutions function at international, federal, state, and local levels. 3) the ability to critically analyze how institutions and behavior influence each other to produce political and policy outcomes. Two primary mechanism s help assess whether students fulfill the student learning outcomes. The first is through successful completion of the capstone Senior Seminar (PS 499) course. Sen ior Seminar is designed to require students to critically analyze and evaluate how institutions and behavior shape politi cal outcomes. Students must d emonstrate a basic ability to successfully complete this critic al analysis to pass the course and meet the requirements for the major. The second mechanism for assessing these outcomes is through th e department assessment committee. The committee is designed to evaluate the effectiv eness of meeting the stated le arning objectives for political science classes. Each academic year, the committee will collect a random selection of research papers and examinations wit h all identify ing student information removed. Initial targets were established at 70% or higher for meeting basic expectations. A recent change to the program that resulted from the assessmen t process involves the Senior Seminar course itself. It was determined that for the Senior S eminar course to more effective ly assess program learning obje ctives, the course should be redesigned from a one credit to a three credit hour course. It was also decided that the course should have a more substantive writing component to better assess the analytical p erformance of students. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We aggregate data from several sources to track the postgradua te success of our students. Sources include exit interviews, social media, and ongoing communication between students and f aculty mentors. For the past two academic years, we have been able to track the postgraduate success for 81% of our 86 PS graduates. About half the students pursue e mployment options, while the ot her half pursues graduate studies. Law school is the most common de stination (60%) for graduates c ontinuing their education. Recent alums have attended the following law schools: UPenn, UK, Chase, UL, Tennessee, Ohio St ate, Indiana, Alabama, Memphis, Belmont, Emory, and George Washington. Fields for t he other 40% of students vary, but the majority attend some va riation of public policy or public administration programs. Schools include: WKU, UNC, UK, Ohio State, Vanderbilt, and Indiana. Graduates pursuing employment options are distributed broadly b etween jobs in po litics and the public , private, and non profit sectors. Within politics, graduates find themselves in one of three types of jobs - 1) campaign/party, 2) advocacy/interest groups, or 3) government agency or staff posi tions in DC or Frankfort. Private sector jobs vary widely, but the most common positions are in some variation of public relat ions and marketing. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Due to the nature of the discipline and the importance of inter nships and professional experien ce for job placement, we are in regular contact with alumni and potential employers. This i s particularly true with alumni and departmental contacts working in and around Kentucky politics. In addition to seekin g information on opportunities available to our students, we ask about trends in their profe ssion, what our st udents need to learn, and, if applicable, how students are performing in thei r current positions (fulltime and internship). Aggregate feedback on our students and alumni is favorable. We find that our students are well prepared for professional opportunities and receive positiv e reviews from current employe rs. We supplement information from current and potential employers with feedback f rom recent graduates. On the positive side, students i ndicate that they benefit from courses that introduce them to data analysis a nd engagement opportunities/internships. More importantly, we gather advice from employers and alumni on how we can better prepare them for the job market. One recent suggestion emphasized the importance of writing; not just In terms of quality, but the process of producing content. One faculty member has already c hanged his courses to incor porate that suggestion. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) Feedback from recent alumni who are attending law/graduate scho ol express the belief that t hey are well prepared for graduate studies. In particular, they highlight the benefits o f being introduced to the research process and quantitative dat a analysis. Political science majors have been awarded dozens of FUSE grant s over the past six years and have presented research at state, regional, and n ational conferences. The University Ogden Award winners from Fall 16 and Spring 17 w ere political science majors a nd are excelling in law school at UK and Alabama. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Political science faculty have co mpleted several fee for servic e contracts where they have done survey research for a number of clients. Previously , this work was done through the Social Science Research Center, but i t is possible that similar servic es can be offered through the Department's Center for Local Govern ments. For each of the years covered in this review, IA/PS faculty hav e been award grants to support research on East Asia. The grants have supported faculty research travel and provided fund ing for undergraduate resear ch assistants. Both IA and PS majors have served as research assistants. The Department's Center for Local Governments (run by MPA/PS fa culty) has completed a couple of small contracted research projects during the years covered. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) For academic years 1314, 1516, and 1718, the % of underenro lled sections is inflated becau se of courses (PS 490, 491, 492, 493) offered as part of the Kentucky Legisla tive Research Internship program. They typically have between 13 students enrolled in them. The inclusion o f these courses also lowers t he median class sizes in those y ears. Additionally, there are additional internship sections offered every semester that woul d have similar impact on those two measures. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Examples of contributions to strategic plan: Our Students Objective 2 - A Diverse Body of Students Strategy 1 - Work with K12 Educational Systems...through outreac h Faculty presentations at regional high schools.

What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Objective 8. Strategy 4. Prepare Kentucky students by strengthening essential learning o utcomes associated with AACU LEAP initiative. The PS curriculum aligns closely with many components of the LE AP campaign. This includes understanding human cultures the intellectual and practical skills emphasize in our courses. This skills include Inquiry and analysis, critical and creati ve thinking, written and oral comm unication, and more recently qua ntitative literacy. Objective 9. Improve career readiness and em ployability of pos tsecondary edu cation graduates. Data indicate our graduates are well prepared for graduate stud ies and postgraduat e employment. In ad dition to soft skills that rank high on employers list of desirable attributes, we en courage students to sharpen ha rd skills with a particularly emphasis on data analysis. Objective 10. Strategy 4. Increase opportunities for under graduate to conduct or assist i n research. Promoting undergraduate is a priority for the program. Departm ent faculty have supervised 20+ FUSE projects, advised Honors theses, and utilized unde rgraduate research assistants. Students have presented at state, regional, and national conferences and coauthored several publications with faculty. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Since political science graduates enter a wide range of fields, it is difficult to find a singl e set of applicable numbers usi ng KCES and other national data. Looking more generally at fields related where our graduates are working, there is general growth in many of those fields. This includes the legal profes sion, business, lobbying/politi cs, nonprofits, and public relations/marketing. A plurality of majors pursue car eers as lawyers. There is a pr ojected statewide demand for 477 lawyers between 201721 with national projected growth a t 8% between 201626.. Related fields have similar levels of projected job growth at the national level - public relations (9%), social scientists (10%) , and urban & regional planners (10%). When compared with other college graduates, Hamilton Project da ta indicate that political science majors do well professionally. After 10 years, t he median income for politica l science majors is roughly 10.5 %% higher than for all majors. Likewise, projected lifetime earn ings for the median political science major is 8% gre ater than the median lifetime earnings for all majors. Together the above data supports the idea that political scienc e majors acquire skills that emplo yers value and that they have reasonably favorable career prospects. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU's Political Science program distinguishes itself from other programs across the state with i ts strong emphasis on politica l and civic engagement, political internships, and undergraduate research. To enhance student learning, the program sponsors field trips a nd study away opportunities to sites such as the Civil Rights Trail in Alabama, Washington, DC , presidential nominating conve ntions and inauguration, pre sidential libraries, and the Freedom Museum in Cincinnati. The Department has also provided students the opportunity to pa rticipate in Model UN, Mock Trial, College YMCA Campus, and related programs. PS faculty have developed strong relationships with local, stat e and regional government agencies, law firms, and nonprofit organizations that create valuable intern opportunities for stu dents. Department faculty actively promote student research. 2/3 of f aculty members have mentored FUSE students and students have presented original research at state, regional, and nation al conferences. Finally, the Department plays an active role in promoting diver sity on campus. In particular, Saundra Ardrey has played a central role in a number of diversity efforts and has served on a number of University committees. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The program has long been committed to promoting political and civic engagement. For example, program faculty have traveled with students to presidential inaugurations for almost 30 years. Building on WKU's past involvement in the American Democracy Project, the Department remains committed to promoting high impact participatory practices and provide valuable opportunities to our students. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The PS major continues to serve most of our students well and p repares them for graduate studies and careers in related fields. The program has traditi onally and continues to develop students' ability to think cri tically and other soft skills th at are critical for professional succe ss. Going forward, it is import ant to look for opportunities to integrate specific hard skills into the program's curriculum. Hard/ technical skills would compleme nt the skills that are already b eing developed in the program and better prepare students for an evolving workforce. We are interested in strengtheni ng interdisciplinary collaborat ion to enhance student learning. This can range from more intentional advising when pairing second majors and/or minors w ith the political science major or can be done more formally through the development of innovative interdisciplinary program s. A specific example that we believe offers potential is a collaboration between Political S cience, Economics, and Philoso phy. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) In 2017, the Department had 169 Political Science majors and 89 International Affairs majors. The enrollment for PS majors has been stable since 2014. The number of PS majors from 2014 17 represent a decline from previous years. The primary reason for the decline in PS majo rs at that time was the develo pment and growth of the IA major which enrolled its first students in 2009. If you aggregate the number of PS and IA maj ors over the 10 year period, the total number of Department undergraduate enrollments has been quite stable over the past 1 0 years. The aggregate enro llment for PS/I A in 2017 was 258 (169/89) and was only exceeded in 2013 with a combined enro llment of 267 (204/63). According to data collected by the American Political Science Assoc iation, national political scie nce enrollment peaked in 2012 and has declined since. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The program has developed a four semester rotation so students and advisors have abetter id ea of when courses will be offered so they can plan accord ingly. The goal is for all cour ses to be offered at least once every four semesters. At the same time, we have worked to be more intentional in sche duling courses to limit the num ber of low enrolled courses. These changes seem to have had a positive impact this Fall and upcoming Spring. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) All things being equal, the expe ctation is that enrollment will remain steady for the political science major and that it will continue to attract strong students. The assumption, however, is that all things will not rema in equal. The most likely change that will disrupt the statu s quo would be increased coll aboration with complementary d isciplines that develop skills to supplement those already being developed by coursework in th e PS major. One possible ou tcome of interdisciplinary collaboration is the development of a new program that will enh ance student learning and pr ofessional opportunities. From a curriculum standpoint, it is anticipated that the progra m will work to incorporate hard/tech skills. One obvious area of evolution is to strengthen the coverage of data analytics an d quantitative analysis. Strategically, there is an opportunity to continue to position the major as one that promotes student engagement. This is appealing to students and can lead to growth opportunities for the program. Unfortunately, uncertain funding over the past few years has limited our abilit y to market these opportunities (e.g. Mock Trial, Campus Y MCA Congress) to potential students. Stable and adequate f unding will allow the Departmen t to make decisions that will a llow us to effectively position itself to maintain a str ong, vibrant program. e. What recommendation would you p ut forward for t he program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or important complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teach-out may be required) Department/School: Communication College: Potter Program Name: Pop Culture Studies Reference Number: 758 CIP Code: 302601 Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): BA STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 31 List Concentrations (if any): N/A 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) This program is one o f only two in the entire country that allows undergraduate students to major in Popular Culture Studies. The 31 hour Popular Culture Studies program is composed of thre e levels of required courses (History and Folk Studies, Media Studies, and Social Scienc es) plus electives and is desig ned to ensure that students gain an interdisciplinary perspective on the subject of po pular culture but still have th e opportunity to pursue their particular interests. A minor, certificate, or second major in another discipline is required. No more than 6 hours in the Popular Culture Studies major may count towards a student's minor. Classes are offered across multiple disciplines within the Univ ersity and are taught within the departments . Current student majors take s econd majors in Journalism, Comm unication, Broadcast Communication, History, and Folklore Studies. Students must earn a grade of \"C\" or better in all required non elective courses applied to the Popular Culture Studies major. Students are encouraged to include at least one course in popul ar culture outside the United S tates and to participate in relevant study abroad opportunities. A 2.0 GPA in completed uni versity coursework is required. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The introductory course, POP 201, is a part of Colonnade and students in the fall, 2018 semester have said it is one of the most popular classes to take . Additionally, Popular Culture Studies provides a feasible se cond major to be combined with any major across the university. At 31 hours, it is reasonable for students to double major in Popular Culture Studies, especially when many of the electives count toward other humani ty and Communication major requirements. Dr. Tony Harkins built up this major to be accessible and accommodating to students. Beyond this, now that the Popular Culture Studies program is a part of the Department of Communication, it is now a contributor to one of the top SCHP departments across campus. F urther, since most of the coursework is drawn from other university departments, it contributes to SCHP within those dep artments. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Dr. Anthony Harkins (History) v oluntarily built and maintained the Popular Culture Studies program. This program has cost the university virtually nothing. AY 19 is the first year that there has been a formal appointment of a program coordina tor, and it is also the first year the Popular Culture Studies program has had an official departmental home . This program is in its infancy and has excellent opportunity for growth . Dr. Joseph Hoffwell, an AY 2019 hire in Communication, promotes the program aggressively. Wi thin WKU, Dr. Hoffswell has started a weekly Popular Culture Club. Outside of WKU, he is ge tting the word out about the program through large popular culture conferences. In the fall of 2018, students from POP 201 attended SuperCon ( https://louisvillesupercon.com/ ) in Louisville, a large popular cultu re convention a ttended by over 20,000 people. The WKU Popul ar Culture Studies program was given an hour long panel to promote the major. It included Dr. Joseph Hoffswell, Dr. Guy Jordan, and Dr. Scott Harris as well as alumni. Dr. Hoffswell is p lanning a field trip to Super Con events in Lexington (sprin g) or Louisville (fall) for each POP 201 class. Attendance provides a ' twofer' of publicizing the p rogram throughout the state and promoting student interest within WKU. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) 1. To provide a thorough and rigoro us grounding in the study of po pular culture from a variety of disciplinary perspectives (includ ing but not limit ed to Art His tory, English, Film Studies, Folk Studies and Anthropology, History, Journalis m and Broadcast Communications, Philosophy and Religion, Political Science, Sociology, and Communication). 2. To help students make connections between everyday popular cul ture and cultural forms more traditionally studied in these a nd other liberal arts disciplin es. 3. To develop the skills essential for students to become informe d consumers and engaged participants in the global community in an age in which cultural industries pla y a central role in shaping the international social, political, and economic landscape. 4. To prepare students for a wide variety of careers in media and culture industries, in the analysis, promotion, or preservation of the se productions, or for graduat e studies in a range of liberal arts disciplines, business, or law. 5. To promote students' internation al engagement by studying and r eporting on the ways popular culture shapes and is shaped by communiti es on the local, national, and global level. Every Popular Culture Studies s tudent major must complete a senior seminar where they demonstrate their ability to research, understand, criticize and analyze popular culture. Every year, these projects serve as a demonstration that the students have achieved the SLOs for the program. The Popular Culture Studies program is slated for full review by the Department of Communiction in AY 19 . It is anticipated that the program's s tructure and reliance on univer sitywide coursework will continue. Assessment of the program by the PCAL Dean's o ffice, Dr. Anthony Harkins (His tory, former program dir ector), and Dr. Helen Sterk, Communication department head, informed by the Communica tion Advisory Council, determined that the major program offers a distinctive, low c ost curricular edge , not only within the state, but also nationally. When Dr. Harkins decided to transitio n out of directly the program, Communication was deemed its logical home. Communication's solid infrastruct ure in program oversight and f aculty governance combin ed with Dr. Hoffswell's research expertise in multiple areas of popular culture, partic ularly video gaming will lead to a sustainable growth trajectory for Popular Culture Studies. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Till now, the Popular Culture St udies program, due to lack of d epartmental ownership until AY 19, did not track information and feedback from graduates. However, since the program is now a part of the Communication department, it will be able to utilize those resources to gathe r information. Informally, the program has a Facebook page that is connected to the majority of alumni. Through Facebook, Dr. Hoffswell reached out to alumn i to join the discussion panel at Louisville SuperCon, where they detailed their career succe sses thanks to majoring in Popu lar Culture Studies. One beca me an admissions officer at University of Louisville, another became a social media manager for a local company, and said the reason that they were hired was because the hiring personnel saw that they were a Pop ular Culture Studies major and knew they would be a perfect fit. Through LinkedIn, Dr. Hoffswell ascertained graduates have gone on to become lawyers, work in state government, web designers, graphic designers, re tail management, and profession al writers. Further, one graduate has gone on to pursue a PhD in English and Cultural Literacy. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best examplewhere the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The Department of Communication's Advisory Council endorsed the addition of Popular Culture Studies to the department, seeing it as a natural complemen t to content developed in Adver tising, Communication Studies, User Experience, and Public Relations. Since Dr. Hoffswell is a social s cientist, he plans on creating a survey instrument to distribute to Popular Culture Studies graduates. This will allow Dr. Hoffswell to assess the success of graduates of the program. He plans on creating this in Spri ng 2019 and distributing it for t he first time in Fall 2019. In his role as the new program coordinator of Popular Culture S tudies, Dr. Hoffswell will estab lish and develop relationships with employers of POP graduates. He already in AY 19 is suppor ting student internships in POP; a student will be interning at Disney World in th e spring of 2019. Through using LinkedIn, Facebook , surveys, as well as tapping t he department's resources and connections, Dr . Hoffswell will gather and use employerbased information to shape the future o f the POP major. e. What else should evaluators know about the success o fstudents in this program?(op tional, maximum 100 words) Although Dr. Hoffswell is new to l eading the program, all of th e alumni that he has interacte d with have had very positive memories about the program. They greatly enjoyed it and have made it clear that majoring in Popular Culture Studies made their college experience memorable . Alumni were more than happy t o come to the panel at Louisvil le SuperCon to talk about how the program helped them develop their career paths . During Dr. Hoffswell's firs t semester, three students have declared Popular Culture Studies as their major, and three others have met with him to d iscuss adding Popular Culture Studies as a second major. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or pro vide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corpora teuniversity partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additi onal support for the program, d epartment, college, and/or university. (maximum 200 words) Popular Culture Studies benefits from departmental revenue stre ams. POP students can tap into any financial support available to other Communication student majors. DELO revenue has been a significant source of support for the D epartment of Communication. Because of DELO, the department routinely supports undergraduate enhanced experiences, such as studying abroad or competing in national competitio ns and routinely supports resea rch productivity by sending program faculty members and graduate and undergraduate students to multiple con ferences every year. Dr. Hoffswell will develop POP 20 1 as an online course for summ er and winter terms. This will add DELO revenue to the Popular Culture Studies m ajor and provide more DELO fun ds to the Department of Communication. Overall, the Department of Communication has received modest ph ilanthropic support in the past, with the exception of the most rece nt gift establishing the Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Distinguished Lecture Series in Communication, an annual lecture series designed to address con temporary issues of communication in society. Students across the Un iversity will benefit from schol arly presentations educating audiences about the ways in which communication i nfluences the world. Popular C ulture topics, such as sport communication, are included in the lecture series. Dr. Kell also established the Dr. Carl L. and Mary Anne Kell Internship Scholarship to support students completing unpaid su mmer internships. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially fro m that of the progra m, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The program has come at little cost to the university since its inception . It was created by Dr. Anthony Harkins in History. He did not receive any extra compensation for being director of the major nor did he receive any extra compensation for developing the major . The only cost to the university was a small stipend for a student worker to support Dr. Harkins. Further, the cost to the Department of Communication will be minimal, requiring only a one course commitment per semester. Dr. H offswell was a planned tenure tr ack hire and teaching POP 201 and the senior seminar is only a fract ion of his responsibilities. This Popular Culture Studies program puts little financial burden on the department, Potter College, and the university and hold s the potential for solid gains. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The popular culture studies major addresses all 5 major parts of WKU's strategic plan. 1. Popular culture is completely a ccessible to students from all w alks of life. The material is relatable and applicable to students' lives. Additionally, the Department of Communication has a cost per SCH much lower than the university median. ( Student affordabili ty and accessibility ) 2. Popular Culture Studies majors are diverse, and talking about t he major at fan/comic/anime conventions will hopefully expand to interest those who are nontraditional coll ege students as well as hig h schoolers who want to pursue their pop culture passion. ( Student diversity ) 3. The reduction of required credit hours, and the flexibility of the major requirements ensures students will be successful and that they will comp lete their degree in a timely fashion. ( Completion and Success ) 4. Popular Culture Studies includes all and strives to demonstrate diversity, equity, and inclu sion across all the classes offered in the major. ( Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ) 5. In POP 201, students are shown examples of international pop cu lture in order to ensure that they are exposed to global pop culture. Pop culture is not solely an American pheno menon; it is international which allows students to explore a plethora of pop culture across the globe. ( Preparation for the Global Stage ) 6. Dr. Hoffswell will be teaching an online version of POP 201 tha t incorporates the best on line teaching practices. ( A culture of Innovation ). Additionally, Popular Culture Studies supports Colonnade with one course, POP 201, in the Explorations category. b. What aspects of the statewide strateg ic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The Popular Culture Studies majo r is inclusive, with content ap pealing to diverse student audiences (SSA objective 1) . Through Dr. Hoffswell's involvem ent with SuperCon, he can reach K12 students. Dr. Hoffswell is also interested in creating partnerships with local schools and creating Pop Culture clubs to allow students to d iscuss and interrogate their favorite pop culture artifacts. ( SSA Objective 2 ). Dr. Hoffswell and the Department of Communication sees the Popu lar Culture Studies program h as having the ability to reach underserved populations in the state of Kentucky. Since people consume popular culture on a daily ba sis to escape and relax, the major appeals to all types of individuals and ma y encourage them to seek a postsecondary education ( SSA Objective 3 ). Through advising all POP ma jors, Dr. Hoffswell fulfills SSA 6.1 and 6.2 . Through its low number of hours (31) and ability to partner with other majors, POP fulfills SSA 6.2. Through encouraging undergraduate research in the POP senior se minar course, POP serves SSA 10.4. Through subject matter and online delivery of POP 201 in the ne ar future, POP serves SSA 10.5. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Alumni of Popular Culture Studies are just the ones needed jobs that will be emerge more a nd more as the job market evolves. Some alumni are social media managers for companies, a nd that is not listed on the Ke ntucky demand website. The Popular Culture Studies major is relevant to the workforce beca use beyond talking about traditional forms of pop culture such as tv, movies, and music, it explores how the internet, vi deo games, and social media affect society as a whole. Understanding how our society changes when new technology is in troduced is essential for su ccess when entering the work force. Graduates of the program can help employers move forwar d with our digital world and help grow new businesses. One alum of 2016 was given a job solely due to the fact that sh e had popular culture studies listed under her education, and is now the social media manager o f a sports club outside of Bow ling Green. Tech companies are leaning towar d humanities hires for their al ternative thinking styles (see: https://www.fastcompany. com/40440952/whyth istechceokeepshi ringhumanitiesmajors ) The Harvard Business Review published an article in the past year about how liberal arts g raduates continue to be employed in the tech industry and how attitudes are moving away between the concept of STEM vs Arts and moving towards STEAM (see: https://hbr.org/2017/07/lib eralartsinthedataage ) Inside Higher Ed noted Arts and Humanities graduates are finding jobs that they are satisfied with and have plenty of opportunity for advancement (see: https://www.insidehighered.com/ne ws/2018/02/07/st udyfindshuma nitiesmajorsland jobsandarehappythem ). d. In what is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The only comparison for the pr ogram is to Bowling Green State U niversity, which is a benchmark institutionfor WKU. No other institution offers a Popular Culture Studies program for undergraduate student s. In comparing, it is clear that Popular Culture Studies can grow, because at BGSU they operate out of a department of Popular Culture and offer a B.A, M.A, and Ph.D. Also, BGSU has roughly 3000 fewer students than WKU per y ear. That's 3000 more potential Popular Culture Studies majors that can grow the program, and allow WKU to surpass the undergraduate program at Bowling Green State University. What makes Popular Culture St udies unique is th e flexibility of the program. No matter what a student's pop culture medium of choice is, they can find cla sses to suit their needs. Stude nts leaving WKU with a Popular Culture Studies degree have a greater media literacy and understanding of how pop culture is made, distributed, and impacts their lives. They will be less likely to fall victim to viral st ories with no facts to support their claims or engag e in petty internet arguments. They will be well informed of the issues facing the worl d because those issu es often are translated into pop culture artifacts. Media literacy is important to employers , not only those who are, but also those who have yet to become media literate. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Popular Cultur e Studies major is the only one of its kind in the state of Kentucky and is the 2nd of its kind in the entire country, which should be a continued emphasis. The purpose of the Supe rCon convention panel was to get the word out to future college students interest ed in this area of study. This first convention experience ha s helped Dr. Hoffswell create new strategies to reach out to attendees of popular culture convent ions. When WKU's Popular Culture Studies program has a real presence at cultural events such as SuperCon, its reach extends to tens of thousands of people who attend these events. Finally, as the word gets out around campus about the ease of d ouble majoring in Popular Culture Studies, there is likely to be a steady increase in majors. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) A significant new market for st udents is found in the Louisvill e and Lexington SuperCon conferences. In the fall of 2018, WKU presented a panel on the major at the Louisville SuperCon. In t he future, program promotional materials will be distributed at both Kentucky SuperCons. This is a brand new market that colleg es generally do not tap. Dr. Hoffswell believes that many of the attendees of these fan conven tions have no idea that they c an go to college to learn more about the things that they love and cosplay. Tens of thousands of people attend these conferen ces every year. One emerging trend that can be taken advantage of and shown to potential majors is that tec h companies are now seeking out Popular Culture Studies majors and Communication majors bec ause they want employees who bring diverse content and thinking to the table. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Over the last 5 years tech compa nies have been hiring more and more humanities graduates to complement their STEM graduate employees. Newer tech companies are looking for bette r communicators and graduates who think outside of the box. They have been recruiting humanities graduates to provide new perspectives to the problems they face. This puts Popular Culture Studies graduates in excellent positions for jo b opportunities. Understanding popular culture is important when looking at social trends with technology use. Pop culture is one of the first areas t o integrate and welcome new technology. For years, science fiction movies have predicted t he technologies that would become a part of our lives, and now popular culture studies majors can apply what they learned from analyzing those films to the real world due to our advances in technology. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The Popular Culture Studies prog ram has been given resources th at will allow it to grow. As of AY 19, the program has a coordinator, Dr. Hoffswell, who is located in a department that devotes resources of his time and the department's money to the program's success. That had not been the case previously. Secondarily, the major requir ements have been reduced to 31 credit hours . This makes it easier for students to double major as opposed to doing a minor. Allowing students the opportunity to obtain a dual degree will open them up to more opportunities postgraduation. Additionally, the program will add more Communication, Advertis ing and Public Relatio ns courses to its el ectives now that it is part of the Communication department. This further expands the diversity of coursework afforded to students who join the major. Adding these courses will enhance degree completion because the courses are standa rd, offered yearly, which is not the case for many other courses counted in the major. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In tenyears? W hat would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) In five years, the program will be offering more dedicated POP courses within the major. Ideally, there would be one POP course available to each of the three required categories that are a part of the major. The number of student majors will grow to a more robust number, predicted to be between 2535, wi th the goal of graduating each of them. Dr. Hoffswell will continue to build the program's relationships with KY and TN fa n conventions to the point where students may obtain internships with the organizations that plan them. In ten years , the goal is to enroll 50+ majors a year. The Department of Communication intends to promote and grow the program to the p oint that it is more wellknown than the undergraduate program at Bowling Green State University. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: Communication College: Potter Relations (PR) Reference 763 Code: Type (AB, STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 36 List Concentrations (if any): None 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The goal of the PR (PR) program is to produce graduates with th e skills, knowledge and acumen ne cessary for PR practitioners in a technologydriven, multicul tural, and global profession so that they are fully employable upon graduation. Pedagogical experiences in the PR program include a combination of lecture and lab classes with an understanding of application, study abroad opportunities, service learning proje cts and internships, both on an d offcampus, including online and ondemand. The PR program requires a minimum of 36 semester hours and lead s to a Bachelor of Arts Degree. In addition to general education requirements of the Un iversity and 36 h ours in the ma jor, students must select an appropriate minor or second major. Effective Fall 2017, students wanting to enter the PR program i nitially are admitted as majors seeking admission. Prospective majors may take no more than 15 hours in the program before adm ission. Students must complete a minimum of 24 hours of coursework applicable to a baccala ureate degree; earn a minimum overall grade point average of 2.3; and complete COMM 200 with a grade of \"C\" or better.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The PR program offers students many opportunities for off and oncampus educational opportunities. One frequent on campus internship opportunity available to PR students is Image west, a studentrun advertising and public rel ations agency that provides realworld, agency experience in the acquiring an d servicing of clients. Service learning opportunities are also a key component to the WKU PR student's classroom experience. Through service learning projects students inte ract with PR professionals as th ey apply and develop their PR skills. Classes within the major, PR 255 and PR 354, are open to students in ot her colleges and majors. PR 255 includes students from other majors in the Department of Communication as well as the colleges of Business, Hea lth and Human Services, and Education and Behavioral Sciences. PR 255 is under review departmentally for Colonnade. PR 354 is an elective in International Business and Broadcasting. Public Relations is a program that complements many other areas of study on WKU's campus . Depending on a PR student's goals, he/she can match the major with varied areas of study in cluding Marketing; Sales; Advertising; Communication; Political Science; Tourism; Environmental Scienc e; Agriculture; English; and Creative Writing. The PR program faculty serve graduate education through teachin g the Sport Media and Branding track in the Kinesiology, Recreation and Sport MA program. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The program is one of only two programs across the state that are credentialed by the Public R elations Society of America . The Certifiction in Public Relations, CEPR, \" is 'the global standard in pub lic relations education ,' as close to 40 academic programs in Canada, Europe, New Zealand, South America and the U.S. have the distinction of PRSA endorsement\" (http://apps.prsa.org/Learning/C alendar/display/5375/Certificat ion_in_Education_for_Public_Relations_Be) For the past 15 years, just two faculty members have been providing most of the required PR classes with some support from adjunct faculty. Because there is limited opportunity to a ccommodate new classes while m aintaining the major's current campus footprint, it is difficult to expand the academi c offerings for majors and other students. However, all classes are reviewed annually to ensure that indus tryspecific needs are offered . And the program has exceeded the university's median graduation rate for the past t hree years. . SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Rate 11 72.7% 17 88.2% 82.6% 3.75 (N=35) 3.80 (N=35) 4.39 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student learning outcomes of the PR program include: Develop skills required for entrylevel positions in public rel ations Become ethical, critical and creative thinkers Foster positive multicultural relationships and communities Build a strong foundation in liber al arts and social sciences f or lifelong learning Learning outcomes are assessed in three ways - portfolio review , capstone classroom experienc e, and internsh ip feedback. PORTFOLIO REVIEW PR majors enrolled in capstone co urses are required to present a portfolio represent ing the work they have accomplished while in the major. Portfolios have been used to evaluate writing and st rategic thinking skills and technological acumen. PR faculty review portfolios to ensure a standard level of prof iciency is achieved. CAPSTONE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE The specific output of the capstone course, PR 456, is complet ion of a service learning/community engagement project either oncampus or in th e local community. The output of the class has been institutionalized in the PR progr am to represent the student's progress toward achieving the cu rriculum cornerstones for the PR program. Faculty review the c ampaign experiences annually an d recommendations to pedagogy are made. The 456 students often participate in the Public Relations Student Soci ety of America's (PRSSA's) n ational Bateman Competition further described in 3c of this report. http://prssa.prsa.org/scholarshipsandawards/batemancompetiti on/. INTERNSHIP FEEDBACK PR majors are strongly encourage d to participate in internships to help them prepare for the transition from college to career. PR interns maintain a writte n work log and must complete a debriefing with their faculty intern advisor. The intern advisor is provided an employer inte rnship evaluation which offers preparedness information for the intern and the PR program. RECENT EXAMPLES: Portfolio and Internship employer feedback have led directly t o changes in the curriculum for PR 358, PR 356, and the choices made in the types of service learning proj ects. Also, to make the servic e learning experience more efficient and effective, the two senior classes - PR 454 and PR 456- are scheduled so that the same students work on the same project during two consecutive semesters. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The PR senior cla ss outcomes are judged in national and regional student competitions. Seniors' PR campaigns are entered in the annual, national Batem an Competition sponsored by PRSSA. Bateman entries both are reviewed by public relations professionals and educators ac ross the U.S . In the past 5 years, the WKU PR seniors' PR campaigns have earned four honorable mentions. The seniors' campaigns are also judged in the annual Nashville Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America's Parthenon Awards, open both to PR profe ssionals and students affiliated w ith the chapter. Each year, entries are judged by PRSA members in other cha pters across the U.S. Fourteen entries have been submitted since 2013 earning nine Pa rthenon Awards (64.3%) and three certific ates of merit (21.45) for 12 t otal awards (85.7% r ate of success). Professional opportunities for PR graduates include PR or commu nication specialists and manage rs for corporate offices, PR agencies, nonprofits, and government offering guidance on the process and application of effective strategic communications. They may specializ e in employee relations, comm unity relations, crisis comm unications, public affairs, media relations, or several othe r disciplines within the profes sional arena. PR graduates also enter law school or enroll in graduate progra ms in communicationrelated disciplines. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Because of our Certification in Education in P ublic Relations (CEPR) distincti on, further explained in 5d of this report, the PR faculty review updates provided by the Commission on Public Relations Education (CPRE) to direct changes and future initiatives in PR pedagogy. Th e Commission's most recent recomm endations \"Fast Forward: Foundations and Future State. Educators and Practitioners\" w ere provided in Spring 2018. http://www.commissionpred.org/commissionreports/fast forwardfoundationsfuturestateeducatorspractitioners/ . Sixty Commission members condu cted research and developed more than 80 recommendations to enhance PR education. One key item led to changes in the WKU PR major. The Commission believes adding a required course in ethics is an essential change to all majors. Previously, the PR students rel ied on Journalism and Broadcast programs for access to their required law and ethics class. To provide a class focused on le gal and ethical issues related to PR, the PR program launched i ts own class, PR 350 Law and Ethics in Strategic Communication, wh ich was added to the PR curriculum effective Fall 2018 and will be first taught in Spring 2019. The law and ethics cla ss makes the program stand out among all other PR programs . In their fall certification visit (2018), reviewers said they knew of no other program that offers a stan dalone PR ethics course. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) The PR program's early adoption of PR 350 will offer students a n appropriate perspective of industryrelated law and ethics, offered by few other universities, if any. As numerical indicators show, we do an excellent job of retaini ng and graduating our majors. Also, we often have majors who transfer to PR in their second or third year at WKU. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) DELO revenue has been a significant source of support for the P R program. Four classes in the program have been offered routinely through onlin e formats. Because of the number of DELO points earned through online teaching, faculty members and students have benefited. In p articular, because of DELO, th e department routinely supports undergraduate enhanced experiences, such as studying ab road or competin g in national c ompetitions and routinely supports program faculty members and undergraduate students to conferences every year. The Department of Communication and the PR program experiences modest donor support and students benefit through similar experiences as those named above under DELO. The PR program has two longstanding endowed student scholarshi ps awarded each spring. In 2017, donations made in memory of a PR graduate's death led to a third scholarship for PR majors and a paid internship with the Communication Office in the Bowling Green Independent Schools. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The PR classes are taug ht by two fulltime faculty members. A D epartment of Communication i nstructor will launch the upcoming PR 350 class in law and ethics. The PR program occasio nally hires adjuncts as needed when fulltime faculty members also have graduate sch ool teaching responsibilities as part of their teaching loads or when departmental administrative responsib ilities have been assigned. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The PR program contributes directly to WKU's strategic plan . 1.

Facilitate student advising through a program advisor dedicated just to the program who meets with majors prior to registration . PR faculty members support this n eed on related areas of study, internship choices, best PR oppo rtunities, and graduate programs. ( Students/3.8 ), 4. Prepare students for career t hough a focused curriculum that undergoes annual assessment (see 3.B.), integrates high impact practices (see 3.E.), and allows students to tailor their academic and ca reer interests ( Students/5.12 and 13 ), 5. Provide uptodate classroom technology and faculty training , such as provided in PR 356, PR 358, PR 454, and PR 456 (Hill/3), 6.

Meet demand and maximize stu dent progression/completion by revising cours e offerings (see 6.C.) ( Hill/4.12) and offering four online courses , PR 255, 354, 356, and 358. ( Community/3.8 ), 9. Engage the community though service learning projects ( Community/1.1 ) and alumni as guest speakers and internship supervisors ( Community/6.17and 18). Since 2011, PR majors have completed 28 service learning projects. 10. Align courses with business and industry feedback and needs (see 3.D.) ( Community/1.2 ), 11. Integrate critical thinking, problem solv ing, effective wr iting, and org anizational interactions throughout curriculum (Community/1.4 ) b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) 1. Focus on student advising through a dedicated advisor and support of fac ulty advisor s. (SSA 6.1), 2. Reduce time to degree by reducing required hours and prerequisites and expanding ele ctive options ( SSA 6.2), 3. Conduct regular program/cours e assessment and \"close the loo p\" by revising instruction, assignments, and/or curriculum as needed (see 3.B.) ( SSA 8.1), 4. Support faculty travel to and participation in pedagogical training (SSA 8.2), 5. Developing skills required for entrylevel positions inPR is one of the student learning outcomes for the PR programs. (SSA 9) 6. Develop careers throughout the curriculum, particularly working with e mployers to provide internships ( SSA 9.1 and 9.3 ), 7.

Increase opportunities for undergraduate research through the required research methods course (AD 300, COMM 300 , SOCL 302 or PS 301), FUSE grants, and Honors projects/theses ( SSA 10.4). 10. PR students' participation in Imagewest offers an applied PR and entrepreneurial skills necessary for a successful, small business. ( SSA 10.5) c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) As noted on Kentucky Future Skills report , most of the estimated public relations specialist positions i n Kentucky are prevalent in Louisville, Lexington a nd Northern Kentucky . Many of our majors come to WKU from this part of the state an d have plans to return upon graduation. Networking opportunities (public relations agency tour to Louisville) and service learning projects (Louisvillebased project Keep Louisville Working) are made available to students in these markets to build these connectio ns as well as links to program alumni who currently work in those cities. The PR program prepares students for seeking jobs in a variety of Kentucky markets, and the anticipated turnover rate is discussed with them. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU's PR program is one of 40 international undergraduate programs and one of only two in Kentucky reviewed and approved for Certification in Education for Public Relations (CEPR) http://prssa.prsa.org/chapte rfirmresources/starta prssachapter/prprogramcertification/ . The PR program has been certified in 2003, 2011 and is under review in AY 181 9. CEPR offers academic programs the opportunity to have an outsid e evaluation team review and endorse undergraduate programs for meeting eight standa rds in curriculum, faculty, st udents, resources and facilit ies, assessment, professional affiliations, relationships with the total unit an d the univers ity, and diversity and global perspectives. The PR program also was reaccredited by the Ac crediting Council on Education in Journa lism and Mass Co mmunication (ACEJMC) in 2016 . ACEJMC accredits programs in journalism and mass communicatio ns at colleges and universities in the United States, Puerto Rico and outside the country and currentl y has 111 programs with fu ll accreditation status. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) According to our C EPR site reviewers (5d of this report ), PR 350is one of the first PRrelated law and ethics classes to be offered on a university campus. The site reviewers have suggest ed that this class may serve a s a model for future classes on other campuses. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , \"Employment of public relatio ns managers is projected to grow 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. As online social media incre ase the speed at which news travels, public relations manag ers will be needed to address go od and bad news for their organization or client.\" https://www.bls.gov/ooh/managemen t/publicrelationsmanagers.ht m#tab6 PR is continuing its growth trac k. To meet this increasing need in Kentucky, Tennessee, nationa lly and globally, we will need to expand our offerings in content and frequency. In addition t o our Kentucky and Tennessee students, we have potential in increasing our student populatio n from Illinois and the Greater Atlanta area, both geographic areas recently represented in our PR student population. For emerging trends, the PR program is already considering a new individual certification for recent graduates now offered by PRSA http://www.praccreditatio n.org/apply/certificate/ . This new certification now has recently released related rese arch (summer 2018) tied to test markets, and it has proven to show s uccess. The WKU PR program can offer test preparation with its current course offerings a nd is considering this addition t o the program as another emp loymentready distinction. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) While considered a social science, PR is a necessary complement to many business disciplines. These two categories were third and first, respectively, in the greatestnumberofdegree sconferred categories provided by NCES. The PR program tracks all trends as part of its ongoing class c ontent review and curriculum ch anges. When social media and digital tactics, such as web con tent, infographics and podcasts , became more prevalent in the industry, this information was incorporated in our class content and eventually led to creating PR 356, a digital tactics class now in its thir d year. Changes in social media constantly bring new ideas to the classroom con tent by adding new platforms and updating our use of existing ones. As always, our PR program and class content are adjusted to meet these changing needs. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Effective Fall 2017, the PR progr am launched a revised major th at reduced its overall cred it hours from 4546 to 36. The changes in the major reduced introductory classes from two to o ne and the same for a required elective as well as expanding the electives list to include mor e classes from Advertising, Us er Experience, Marketing and Communication. This revised credit hour total will give PR majors as well as s tudents outside the major more accessibility for double majors, second minors and certificates while preparing students for entry into the workforce. As noted in 3d. of this report, the PR program has also added a law and ethics class specific t o its major. The first offering of this class will be Spring 2019. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The PR program has reviewed its curriculum offerings as needed to accommodate changes in its related industry as described in 6. C of this report . The result was a cu rriculum that comple ments many other WKU programs and mirrors current industry standards. The PR program is ex pecting growth in student enrollment. The PR program has systems in place to stay on top of industry and academic changes as they occur and can then apply them to the program. However, if we hope to keep pace with the potential student inc rease, we will need to increase our faculty resources. The PR program will need at least one more faculty member now and possibly two in 10 years. While we have taken advantage of two adjunct faculty members in the past, they teac h only online. If a replacement hire in Healthcare Communciation comes about, and that person has expertise in campaign development , that would support the Public Relations program, too. Resources to support recruitment, technological changes, and ac cess to professional input will be required. Public Relations is a constantly evolving, technologybased industry. The WKU PR program will be prepared for the changes that are now in development and will be evident i n the industry and related ped agogy in the very near future. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or important complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) 1 Department/School: Philosophy and STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 31 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major , minor, or certificate) , supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admission. (maximum 200 words) The Religion major requires t hat students learn about a vari ety of religions, and related histories and cultures, preparing them for work in our diverse Commonwealth and the globalized economy . The Religion program requires 31 hours. Majors take an introductory world religion course , three courses focusing on d ifferent religious traditions, and a course that is comparative by nature. Our program is interdisc iplinary in that required elect ives include courses in other departments, and majors must also have a second major/minor. As we are the only public university in the Commonwealth offering a religion major, we welcome several students each year who c ome here specifically for our p rogram, along with many students us who discover us once they are Hilltoppers. Up to 25% of our coursework can be taken online, and between 15-20% of our students study abroad. Nearly all of our courses are part of Co lonnade (offering 1000 Colonnade seats ea ch academic year), making our program essential to WKU's mission and strategic plan. Along with acquiring advanced knowl edge in the study of religion, students in our program also gain crucial skills for the mode rn workplace in cluding inquiry and analysis, critical and cr eative thinking, effective and compelling written and oral communication, intercultural knowle dge, competence in ethical reas oning and action, and locating and interpreting complex sources, all of which align with LEAP outcomes as outlined in th e CPE's strategic plan.

In what ways does the program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in suppor t of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, a nd interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Religion major fosters inte rdisciplinarity by counting c ourses in Anthropology, Arabic, Art, Chinese, English, History, Japanese, Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology toward our majo r. Arabic, Chinese, Internatio nal Affairs, Ph ilosophy, and Pop Culture all includ e Religion courses in their majors. Signi ficantly, the Religion program is essential to the Asian Religi ons and Cultures program; without Religion th ere would be no ARC . Thus, if we consider their fundamental connection and the fact that the faculty in Religion simultaneously teach in ARC, the number of enrolled students increases to 69, conferrals to 21, SCHP to 455 (adding both programs together). During AYs 2013-2017, there was a JUMP component to our MA p rogram. The JUMP/MA programs were conceived as a way to attract more undergraduate s. Unfortunately, enrollments were consistently low, and under graduate enrollments declined as a result of not offering enough undergraduate courses. There fore, as noted in \u00a74c below , the JUMP/MA programs were suspended as part of our transfo rmation in AY 2017-18. Since th en, the Religion program has s een an increase in majors and SCHP and we expect steeper upw ard trends in coming years. The Religion program has also been transformed by deeply int egrating with Colonnade, especially Connections courses; for example, in AY 2018-2019 fulltime Religion faculty taught/will teach 369 SCH in Foundations, 792 SCH in Explorations, and 1,077 SCH in Connections. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) In 2018, faculty comprehensive ly revised the Religion progra m with approval from UCC. Since Religion majors comprise only one-third of our SCH, the Religion program has transformed by thoroughly integrating with Colonnade. Excepting a single one-credit-hour Senior Se minar, current fulltime Religio n faculty can shepherd students through the major in as little as one academic year while exclusive ly teaching high-enrollment Co lonnade courses. Commencing in AY 2018-2019, this recalibrated staffing and schedu ling model optimizes the progra m's productivity and we have since seen an increase in majors and productivity. 33.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificat es may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of a ssessment were used to improve the program (i.e., closin g-the-loop). ( maximum 300 words) There are four SLOs for Relig ion: 1) communicate clearly and effectively in written work; 2) construct and effectively writ e a thesis for a research paper a nd defend it thro ugh relevant li terature and resources; 3) locat e the relevant literature or re sources for research paper; 4) and utili ze relevant literature or resou rces to defend research paper thesis. These SLOs are assessed in two ways. The first is using stud ents' final grade in courses th at require a research paper. Students receiving an A or B in t hese courses meet the learning outcomes. The second means of assessing the outcomes is through the se nior seminar. For that course, students are required to write three mini-research papers in whi ch students explore how religi ons affect and shape the lives of people today, examine one's responsibility in light of our multicultural and multireligious society, and to think about how best to understand religion through a comparative lens. To assess the students, there is a committee that meets at t he end of each academic year using a 4 point scal e: far exceeds expectations, exceeds expectati ons, meets expectations, and doe s not meet expectations. For the two past year, over 70% of the students met or exceeded e xpectations. We draw from LEAP va lue rubrics in our assessment, in particular the critical thinking, written communication, i ntercultural k nowledge and co mpetence, and global learning. The assessment committee discovered that a number of student s were not able to critically e valuate the intersection of religion and contemporary societ y. To close the loop, many of o ur religious traditions courses have been revised to include a section on religion and society. Finally, as thinking through r eligion and society often happens through a comparative lens, t he major was changed last year so th at students are now required t o take at least one course that examines religio n comparatively . c. In what ways does the program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progre ssing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional s chool acceptances)? What are t he key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The religion program systemati cally gathers and incorporates feedback on graduate success th rough exit interviews and post- graduation surveys. We have found that 10-15% of our students pursue graduate sc hool. We have been successful in placing students in top-rate programs, typically with excellent funding. Examples include Ha rvard, Duke, Yale, BU, Unive rsity of Chicag o, Princeton, UNC Chapel Hill, ASU, USC, FSU, Emory, and Syracuse. The most common fields in whic h our graduates are employed i nclude: non-profit and soci al services (27%), education (12%), media (9% ), and healthcare (5%). While we are excited to see our graduates serving these fields , we see increasing opportunity f or future graduates to be employed in healthcare, business, and government, as the need for emplo yees in these fields who are s killed at navigating complex religious issues in the global economy becomes urgent. We find that our graduates continue to serve our immediate region in diverse ways: as small business owners, camp directors, graphic designers, photographe rs, and pastors, just to name a few. Our alumni consistently report how valuable they find th eir Religion major both in term s of navigating the competitive workforce, as we ll as in terms of the long-term mentoring relationships they developed with our d eeply engaged faculty who often continue to offer guidance even after graduation. d. In what ways does the program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in ord er to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boards, national data)? Provide one best example where the in formation gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Currently the progr am does not have the staffing to conduct our own systematic studies w ith respect to the needs and satisfaction of employers, but we pay close attention to report s produced by the American Acad emy of Religion, Society of Biblical, AAC&U, AASCU, as well as the Council on Postsecondary Education, and the Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce. In addition to close attention to external reports an d studies, the chair and several faculty have regular conversations with those in Bow ling Green with res pect to the n eeds of and satisfaction of emplo yers who hire students with a major in religion or coursework in religion. In our 2018 progra m revision, for example, we were especially attentive to the expressed need of employers to hire students who can communicat e clearly and effectively based on skillful research. As we face an era of \"fake news,\" where it becomes difficult to sift through data towa rd accurate and meaningful analysis, we have 4emphasized this for both our maj ors as well as the nearly one t housand Colonnade students we teach each year. The program faculty are enthusiastic about working with staff from the WKU Alumni Association to help think through ways in which more specialized and targeted regional and local data could be colle cted given the resources available. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) Our students have b een very successful, routinely winning aw ards, scholarships, national h onors, and receiving full funding offers from top graduate programs. From 2013-2018, for instance , Religion majors submitted 9 sep arate applications for highly competitive national scholarships; of those, one received a Gil man, one received an EPA grant, two were finalists for Fulbright, and one was a finalis t for a Gilman. Almost all Reli gion majors are at least double majors, and 15-20% spend at least one semester studying abroad. Given the small number of students who declare Religion in their first year, the retentio n rate listed above does not reflect anything meaningful about ou r program. 54. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 4 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH 104.00 128.00 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 389 434 336 390 358 375 % SCH by FTF by Dept. 64.9 59.8 62.1 77.6 75.7 75.8 Median Class Size by Level 12 13 14 10 17 19 % Under-Enrolled Sections by Level 52.4 52.8 55.6 57.1 47.4 36.3 b. What external revenue strea ms are directly associated with t he program? For example, con sider research grants that require/engage program students a nd/or provide fac ulty buy-out time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate-university partnershi ps, and economic development rel ationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college, and/or university . (maximum 200 words) Religion faculty have won both university and national grant s and demonstrate impressive external revenue potential, particularly for a small humanitie s faculty. Awards include Nat ional Endowment for the Humanities grants, a $105K grant from Metanexus Institute, Asian Research Institute, DELO (avera ge 7500.00), and The Kettering Foundation. These grants allowed for student researcher s and buyout time. Our competitiv e faculty are actively engaged in scholarly communities and are highly likely to continue to receive grants, including thos e that engage students, fund i nnovative research, and buy out teaching time. Additiona lly, several Religion students have rec eived FUSE grants and faculty have engaged program students in their own research here and abroad as a result of RCAP grant s. Faculty have organized local c onferences, events, and engage ment initiatives that involve students and meaningful cross- sections of our region (business leaders, non-profit leaders, r eligious leaders, alumni). Examples include the Religion and Ea rth Care Conference, Interfaith Workshops on Religion and Climate C hange, a Southeast Early China Roundtable, and a Symposium on Peace, Islam, and C ounter-Narratives. Further, fac ulty routinely engage community organizations and alumni in their work, which, if more car efully leveraged, represent ph ilanthropic potential (e.g., Muha mmad Ali Center in Louisville) and are poised to contribute to a committed and engaged group o f supporters for the program and department. c. What else should evaluators k now about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For exam ple, if the data provided for the department as a whole di ffer substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Department's cost per SCH is cheaper than the WKU averag e, and the SCHP/FTF was in line with University median (a 381 five-year average in PHIL/RELS vs. 375 across WKU). Nonethe less, throughout AYs 2013-2018 the department evinced inefficiencies, which predominan tly arose from the MA program i n Religion. Offerings disproportionately served a small cohort that was costing, rather th an generating, revenue for WK U. Accordingly, the suspension of the MA program is the strongest signal of the Department's transformation. Additional gains in efficiency will be achieved via thoroughgoing integration with Colonnade (see \u00a72c above). Since the MA affected the % of under-enrolled sections in Re ligion, eliminating it drops th e percentage by half; if we consider lower-enrolled courses that were taught as an overload , that number drops by 75%. 65. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics . (maximum 200 words) Religion has a track record and commitment to student completion and success , graduating the majority of our majors in four years (the \"time to degree\" numbe r in section 3 is higher as a result of a number of non-trad itional students who have been taking one class a year with us for over a decade). We attribut e this in large part to our emphasis on mentorship and meaningf ul faculty-student engagement in the classroom as well as collabor ative student-faculty research ( research & creative activities ). Additionally, we offer an average 500 seats in the Colonnade pr ogram each semester, enabling st udents across the university to fulfill their requirements with a range of innovative courses t hat emphasize high impact practi ces and prepares them for the competitive global workforce ( preparation for the global stage & global learning by focusing on the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa ). A nuanced understanding of the ways that religion influences the current global and interna tional contexts is essential for those working in nearly all fields from education to accounting ; from diplomacy to the medical fields. No long er can anyone escape the need for fluency in ho w religious worldviews shape c ulture, markets, politics, and t he everyday routines of all Americans. Finally, our revenue -earning program has and will co ntinue to contribute to a sustainable budget model . b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Re ference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, an d metrics. (maximum 200 words) The program contributes to the statewide strategic agenda by promoting academic excellen ce through teaching, with a particular emphasis on LEAP outcomes related to knowledge of hu man cultures, information literacy, critical thinking, and intercultural knowledge (8.4). Our program contributes to an in crease in persistence and timely c ompletion for all students (6 ). We do this by intentional mentor ship and advising with respect to coursework, but also with attention to students' broader academic trajectory and holistic a ttention to their context, ba ckground, goals, and dreams (6.1). Further, we increase persistence and timely completion across the university by offe ring to access a range of Colonna de classes taught by faculty interested not only in their intellectual growth as scholars, b ut also as individuals a nd citizens (6.1, 6.2). Our program's focus on high-impact educational practices (6. 6) such as writing-intensiv e courses and collaborative assignments, along with faculty-s tudent research collaboration (10.4), contributes both to persistence and to preparation for the workforce where employers repeat edly say they are interested in hiring graduates who are able to communicate well and work well in collaborative environmen ts (Hart Report). Finally, our curriculum meaningfully contributes to increasing cultural competency among students such that they both understand and ca n work better with neighbors, colleagues, and fellow students who come from a diverse religious and cultural backgro unds (1.1). c. How and to what ex tent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent p ossible. (maxi mum 200 words) Report after 2015; NACE 216; AACU 20 18; Hart) notes that one of the workforce challenges across the nation, including in Kentucky, is students' weaknesses in o ral and written communication, as well as ability to think creatively, work with others, and solve complex problems. The R eligion program has made an explicit effort to take this into account in the past five years an d, in particular , in our progr am revision in 2017-2018. In most Religion courses students wil l be asked to work with their peers to wrestle with complex pract ical, moral and ethical questions about how we understand ourselves, others, our world, and our communities. They are the n asked to engage in intensive writing assignments that require critical engagement and creativity in thinking not only about i mportant theoretical problems, but also about the practical challenges of living in a religiously pluralistic region, commo nwealth, nation, and world. Our focus on our major/minors coupled with a strong emphasis on providing a range of Colonnad e courses and electives that enables students in other majors/minors to persi st and graduate in a timely manner prepar es our students for work in di verse communities and to work more productively with colleagues, clients, and customers acros s the Commonwealth. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Ref erence unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty /staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus imp act, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) As a small program that is par t of an interdisciplinary depa rtment, we are distinctive in o ur ability to provide our studen ts with individualized mentorship and attention, but also in our e fforts to collaborate with and support other programs and departments across the university. For instance, the course off erings in religion are essential to the Asian Religions and Cul ture major. In addition, during this academic year, we are providing over 1000 seats in Colonnade courses, and offer essential electives that support a wide range of other programs on campus including sociology, psychology, history, international affair s, Arabic, Chinese, and women and g ender studies. Further, unlike our neighboring states, which have several religion programs, we are the only one of its kind in a public institution in the Commonwealth. Our faculty is diverse, including those with backgrounds fro m the Middle East and Africa, and our interests span the globe. Due to our wide range of interest s, we are able to attract dive rse students, representing Kentuckians, regional students, raci al and ethnic minorities, and international students. 7e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and dist inctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Our program is distinctive in the ways that it invites stude nts into consideration of some of the most fundamental question s about how people make sense of our world and universe. The cour se offerings and co-cu rricular activities invite students to consider the interplay of history, culture, beliefs, and practi ces, with attention to how this enables possibilities for stude nts to make a good living and a good life for themselves, families, ne ighbors, and communitie s. Our contributions to the Strategic Plan are extensive, as outlined i n this report, but it is the d istinctiveness of the program tha t sets us apart from other pro grams. 86. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are potential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections b e made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Following our program revisio n in 2017-2018, we see two addi tional opportunities. The first is being more explicit to advisors, other departments, and students about the fundamental importance of considering religion in an increasingly globalized economy. From accountants working with a company in Japan to physicians working with Burmese patients, religious literacy/fluency provi des our students with cutting e dge advantages essential to car eer success. Currently, Arabic, Chinese, International Affairs, Philosophy, ARC, and Pop Cultur e all include Religion courses in their majors and we look forward to expanding the number of majors and minors where Reli gion Colonnade courses also ful fill major and minor elective requirements. This not only makes students more competitive for global workforce, but also decreases time to graduation. Our second is being more explicit in our outreach and welcom e to students who identify as re ligious or spiritual themselves . Even though we are a secular pr ogram, through conversations wit h alumni, employers, and students, we have identified an untapped market among more religious and spiritual students at WKU that are interested in d eepening their knowledge of religious practices and texts. We have a plan to systematically reach out to and advise these stu dents such that their religio n major better enables WKU to meet our strategic g oals, in partic ular increasing student completion and preparation for the global stage & global learning . b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 5-10 year s? (maximum 200 words) Program trends align relative ly closely with national trend s in religious studies over the last 5-10 years. We have seen a decline in majors, like religio us studies nationally. The natio nal decline is tied primarily to the return to more typical lev els of religious studies majors after th e extraordinary spike followin g 9/11 and the general trend of declining liberal arts majors m ore generally. We attribute our dec line, however, less to national trends in the study of religion and liberal arts, but to our MA program, which led to a temporary and now remedied misallocatio n of resources. With respect to national trends in higher education and lib eral arts more genera lly, our program has b een ahead of the cur ve in terms of a focus on designing our curriculum such that it re quires students not only to master advanced content in religion , but also to develop skills related to inquiry and analysis, cri tical and creative thinking, eff ective and compelling written a nd oral communication, intercultural knowledge, competence in ethi cal reasoning and action, and locating and interpreting complex sources. c. What if any significant changes has your program instituted within the past th ree years to increas e productivity, success of students, and/or effici ency that may not yet be evid ent in the data provided? Exa mples might include course sequencing/scheduling desi enhance students' prog ress towards degree, mplementati on of a comprehensive recruiting and mark eting plan, or reallocation of faculty resources to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Last academic year, we completely revised the religious studies major, streamlining it to make it more accessible to students, allowing students to count more courses taught in other departm ents, and almost completely integrating the program with Colonnade. In that same year, t he department evinced inefficie ncies, which predominantly arose from the MA program in Religion, which disproportionate ly served a very small cohort t hat was costing, rather than generating, revenue for the University. Finally, for this cu rrent academic year, we did not renew a number of SIAs with o ur part-time in structors and revised the scheduling of our c lasses to increase enrollment. T his current year we are also proposing to suspend both our Classical Studies minor and our M iddle East Studies Certificate . This current academic year, we improved the visibility of th e department on social media and held more targeted recruitment events with students majoring in Arabic, Chinese, and Internati onal Affairs. We have seen a dramatic improvement in productivity as a res ult of these changes. Since the fall 2018 census cut off, we have added four more students as majors. Most impressive, howe ver, has been the increase in S CH: whereas in 2017-2018 our FTE faculty taught approximately 445 students, that number has increased to over 800 for th is current academic year. d. Where do you see the program i n five years? In ten years? Wh at would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We are excited about the future of our program, our interdis ciplinary department, and interdisciplinary collaborations that we are building across the univers ity. In five years, we expect to see the number of majors increas e by 100% to pre-MA program levels of 2013, and by 2029 to 1 00+ majors. Our faculty are ple ased at the ways that we rose to meet our students' needs by offering a significant number of Colonnade courses and this wil l continue to be a defining feature of our program. In order to meet the growing demands of our program and to continue to deve lop a rich Colonnade offerings, within five years, we would like the Hebrew Bible line restor ed. When we and others have d one the important work of making our programs more efficient and sustainable, we would like to grow our department to includ e faculty lines that meet t he needs of our program and are strategically aligned with other p rograms with which we have bu ilt collaborative interdisciplinar y partnerships. In ten years, we envision a larger department that is nationally recognized both for teaching and research. Through careful attention to strate gic priorities, productivity, market trends, efficiency, collaborat ive partnerships across the university, external revenue opportunities, and cultivation of our alumni network and region al business and philanthropic c onnections, we are confident we can achieve this. 9e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Master of Arts in Social R esponsibility & Sustainable Commu nities is a fullyonline, interd isciplinary program of study tha t provides students with the tools to lead communities toward soc ial justice and sustainability. It is designed especially for students inclined toward the human ities, social sciences, and r elated fields. Students take a core set of courses (18 hours) that provide interdisciplinary gr ounding in social justice, sus tainability, social policy, comm unitybuilding, and community based research. Students may fo cus their elective courses (15 hours) on environmental sustaina bility, sociology/criminology, gender & women's studies, leader ship, or other related topics i n consultation with their adviso r. Six hours of the 15 elective s may be taken as thesis hours. St udents in the SRSC master's pr ogram learn skills in community based research that help them understand the challenges and interconnections of social j ustice and sustainability and to identify possible solutions. The master's program culminates with a weeklong re sidency where students explore a community in Kentucky and then share their scholarly and activist learning with peers and faculty in a conference st yle symposium. This MA is a forwardthinking program that cu ltivates the skills and knowled ge necessary to shape economic , political, and social change agents for more just and sustainable communities. 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a. Data Provided by IR 201314 201415 201516 201617 201718 17/18 Univ. 31 31 28 27 20 31 Conferrals 9 7 11 8 10 12 SCHP 261 237 270 220 199 357 b. In what ways does the program contributeto other programs or areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The core curriculum of the MA in Social Responsibility & Sustai nable Communities (SRSC) consist s of six courses that address what it means to be \"socially res ponsible citizenleaders of a global society,\" whether that's our core course on \"perspective s on social justice\" (SR SC sustaina bility\" (SRSC 540). The fact th at the program is offe red online has helped us reach \"students of all backgrounds\" from around the country, though a significa nt number of students come from Kentucky or the region. Many of our students are nontraditional; they come from a wide range of backgrounds or place s of work, from the military, COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 to community organizations, to business, and man y of them take jobs in the fields of sustainability and so cial justice, broadl y understood. The five electives are often drawn from other PCAL departments, especially Sociol ogy/Criminology and History. For the last several years, WKU has encouraged departments to r each cross disciplines to creat courses and programs. The SRSC has answered call by incorporating principles and course f rom philosophy, business, socio logy, social work, literary studies, and other fields. Finally, as a way to share resources, two of our core courses a re taught by faculty in other units. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The SRSC is unique among MA degrees\u2014it is fully online and inte rdisciplinary, addressing thr ee key themes: environmental sustainability, social justic e, and community studies. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 Rate 9 55.6% 11 54.5% program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) SLOS for the SRSC MA Upon completion, stude nts will be able to: 1. examine a range of disc iplinary perspectives on social justice 2. analyze the interrelationships of issues and interlocking syste ms associated with social o rganization and community development 3. examine the practical and theore tical principles of sustainabil ity and how to apply them to diverse situations and communities throughout the world 4. analyze the power relationships (gender, race, age, class) that historically surround social justice and how these may be changed or augmented to increase social equality and equity 5. apply the principles of community organizing and be able to eff ectively utilize them in a variety of communities We have systematically assessed t he program every year since it s inception through surveys and questionnaires that collected selfreported information about satisfaction with the overall program and courses. Beginning in 2017, we collected data to assess the SL Os through analysis of written comprehensi ve exams using LEAP Value rubrics. We have consistently used all data to revamp course and the program. For example, re levant to improving students' performance, in 201314, we revamped the methodology courses (520: Communitybased Research and 540: Communitybuilding for Sustainability) to make the IRB process less time consuming and difficult. The fol lowing year, we dropped an economics class from the core and replaced it with a social po licy course to a ddress inadequa cies in students' reported needs and performance on learning outcome #5. We also dropped LEAD 5 00: Effective Leadership Stud ies and replaced with SUST 514: Environmental Justice & Public Spaces to help students better understand principles of sustainability (learning outcom e #3). Each year we have made adjustments to course outcome and assignmen ts to better reflect the outcomes of the program in response to student needs and performance. Another example was the adjustment of the guid elines for \"comps,\" which more accurately measures the existing SLOs. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The student employment outcomes scatterplot from Kentucky emplo yment statistics, shows t he 3year employment outcomes (counting employed in Kentucky by median wages) for mu lti/interdisciplinary masters programs at $40,000/year. We have selfreported data sugge sting student success based on current employment and/or promotion. In a recent survey (n = 35; 78% response rate) of all SRSC graduates (20122017), th e following positions and p romotions were noted: Senior Vice President Director of Education Sustainability Coordinator Graduate Teaching A ssistant at BGSU & Adjunct Instr uctor at Lanier Technical College Director of High School Programs Planning & Projects Manager Recreation Therapist & Mental Health Counselor Executive Director, and Extension Specialis t /Arts Extension Program Lead er. Comments to phone interviews sim ilar to this one are also commo n: \"My first job out of the [SRSC] program was a Public Administration Specialist. My emp loyer was impressed with the m any courses I had taken relate d to sustainability. I was promoted to Business Services Tea m Lead where I had a 12 person team under me working on job placements, training, and disability services for those wit hout jobs. Again the SRSC prog ram prepared me to do these jobs...!\" Several students are pursuing (or have completed) PhDs at other universities (University of W ashington, Bowling Green State University). d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) We have no mechanism for surveying employers, in part because o ur students attend WKU from around the country, so there are no common feeders for our graduates. Our primary reso urce for collecting employment data is by asking students; however, maintaining contact with them is difficult except thro ugh social media, and that is only partially effective. Instruments used to collect employment data include questions a bout efficacy of programs and courses. For example, students indicated via surveys and phone interviews that they c ould have benefited from more instruction on community organizing. Changes were made to one of our core courses, SRSC 540: Community Building for Sustainability, to include an emphasis on the principles of co llaborative community practices . We also have collected selfreport ed data from graduates one ye ar after graduation since the beginning of the program (201317). Many of the SRSC students are already employed when entering the program and are seeking degrees from personal reasons or promotions. This data gives us an idea of h ow many students have changed jobs, received promotions, and/or started other graduate programs. We also ask openended questions about specific course and how those course have been useful (or not) to them on the job. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) We have taken assessment of our p rogram seriouslyad use results to enhance the program. We continually collect self reported data in addition to asse ssment of learning outcomes fr om comprehensive exams. The pro gram is unique in that it is fully online and targets a popula tion of students who might not be able to relocate for graduat e studies. The SRSC also is par t of a national trend of creating interdisciplinary programs. Jac obs (2015) i notes that the number of interdisciplinary college degrees (the merging two or more traditional degrees) has risen significantly over the last 40 years. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 1.5 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH $464 $167 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 169 190 167 171 199 FTF by Dept. 73.3% 74.5% 73.7% 68.3% 71.9% 76.8% Median Class Size by Level 9 11 11 11 9 8 % UnderEnrolled Sections by Level 54.5% 30.0% 36.4% 33.3% 54.5% 55.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The SRSC was a DELO cohort progr am for two years, at which poin t funding for the program was transferred into the department's operating budget. Since then DELO has supported th e SRSC with funding for marketing and for the capstone residency. The SRSC DELO distribution for 20132018 was $22,041 , with most years between ( $2,000$4,000) in 2012 the distribution was $26,000 due to the transfer from the cohort pr ogram to operating. These funds covered a range of student and faculty opportunities (travel primarily). c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) SRSC students frequently seek co mplementary graduate certificat es\u2014Gender & Women's Studies, Leadership, and Non profit are the most common. This means that SRSC students are s upporting enrollment in other graduate programs, from 6 12 hours duplicated. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Our students are a \"a diverse bod y\" including nontraditional st udents who have \"access through a targeted attraction and recruitment plan.\" Online delivery attracts older students, man y of whom are currently working but seek to enhance their career options. Second, in \"preparation for the global stage,\" the SRSC MA uses the most current pedagogical techniques to offer a highly engaged online experience that addresses global problems (e.g., SRSC 530 Social Justice and Social Policy and SUST 514 Environmental Justice & Public Spaces). This point als o speaks to the \"culture of inno vation\" and the insistence that our teaching scholars be keen on learning \"current teaching met hodologies\" and in three ways. Firs t, through the interdisciplinary examination of social justice, environmental studies, and community studies the influences of policies, programs and discourses, completion of the an advanced degree \"prepares students of all backgrounds to be [...] socially responsible citizenl eaders of a global society.\" Second, as a fully online master 's, the SRSC offers accessible \"lifelong learning opportunities for its students, faculty, and other constituents.\" Third, the SRSC \"enriches the quality of l ife for those within its reach\" as it provides opportunity for professionals to enhance t heir areas of expertise. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The SRSC master's aligns with th e following objectives: 1.1 Inc rease culture competence, 8.4 strengthen learning outcomes (LEAP), and 9.1 Make career development a state and institution al priority and a key strategy for student success. The SRSC advances the above objectives from the statewide postsecondary education strategic implementation plan. The program enhances cultural competency through indepth analyses of socia l justice and systemic oppr ession; global economic implications of environmental de vastation; and communitybased policies, actions, and disc ourses that maintain and challenge dominant ideologies (1 .1, 8.4). The program's assessm ent plan uses features of the LEAP outcomes (8.4). The program is offered wholly onlin e giving professionals the oppor tunity to pursue advanced spe cialization in asynchronous environment (9.1). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the Pew Research Center 2017 report \"The Future of Jobs and Job Training,\" \"a focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial inte lligence (AI) and machines see m unable to replicate\" will be important. These skills include the ability to network with others, manage public relations, displa y intercultural sensitivity, mar keting, creativity, and enough critical thinking to move outsid e the box. The SRSC excels in d eveloping these skills in students. As noted above (3c) our graduate s find jobs and receive raises that involve leadership in a wide range of occupations (they are \"change agents\"). d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The SRSC is fully online, drawing students from around the coun try (a few internationally).The program also culminates in a weeklong Kentucky residency focusing on a particular area of t he state that intersects comm unity, environment, and social justice. For example, students h ave spent time in Eastern Kentu cky's coal mining areas to examine the cultural and environmental backlash from the decrease in availability and ne ed of coal for fuel. We have also arranged for servicelearning projects along the way as a means for giving back to the commun ities we visit. As noted in 4b, the SRSC was ori ginally a DELO cohort program. Its uniqueness makes it hard to compare to other programs in or der to determine that we have achieved a \"quality comparable to the national average,\" but a recent study conduct ed by the Association for Prof essional, Continuing, & Online Education (UPCEA) ranked the SRSC as 3 rd out of 84 programs in the region including Kentucky and surrou nding states (February 2018). e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Jacobs' (2015) research indicates employers \"recognize the need to hire recent graduates who are equipped with sufficient competencies, skills, and an ability to adapt to cha nge and diverse settings\" (p. 3). Companies are increasingly looking for gradua tes who understand how systems a re connected, how to work as a team, and how to analyze problems and crtically think through solution. It is , therefore, increasingly valuable to be able to negotiate an everchanging work environment. Students who gradu ate from the SRSC commonly make these claims. The SRSC: \"teaches about sustainability, c ommunity building, food systems , and beyond which is invaluable in today's world.\" \"allows students the flexibility to take classes online, which provide a dynamic learning experience.\" \"provokes students to work on pro jects that inter est them and t hat intersect with social responsibility, its meaning, and how to build and sustain community and prepares st udents for real world applications of course materials and for obtainin g a job in our fields of study .\" AND: \"I believe the greatest strength is in the interdisciplinary na ture of the program. I loved being able to combine social sciences with earth sciences, etc.\" \"This master's degree applies to so many different fields and d isciplines and I feel that this was a good representation of that.\" 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The SRSC will move to an unidentif ied new departmental. It rema ins to be seen whether or not such a relocation will help increase the demand for the mast er's. With SRSC faculty scatter ed to different departments and those new home departments wanting to make use of the faculty for internal dem ands, WKU will face the cha llenge of supporting non conforming, innovative, interd isciplinary, and/or progressive p rograms. It is important to note that pro grams like the SRSC are on the rise across the countr y among universities that are experiencin g growth rather than decline. Arizona State University (ASU) hous es a School of Transdisciplinar y studies, a plethora of online programs, and boast that they ar e \"creating the New American Un iversity -a place where knowle dge informs decision making, research and study trans cends academic d isciplines, stu dents learn from the world aro und them, and local solutions have global impact\" ( https://schoolofsustainability.as u.edu/about/schoolofsustaina bility/). Since 2012, ASU enrollment has experience tremendous grwoth. The same is true for the Universi ty of Central Florida. The common denominators are their commitment to intermultitrans disciplinary and their multifac eted delivery of instruction (online, hybrid, collaboration, fa ce to face, weekend, etc.). It is imperative that we don't sacrifice innovative interdiscip linary programs that don't always fit as neatly as trad itional, disciplinary ones. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) It is difficult to align national trends with the SRSC because there are very few programs like it in the United States. Accor ding to NCES data (linked above) the number of students receiving mu lti/interdisciplinary maters d egrees is rising. It is also important to note that in our current polit ical, economic, ecol ogical, and social environment, jobs are constantly being created to help employers/companies navigate our changing world . For example, it is standard for organizations to have sustainability coordinators, dive rsity officers, community orga nizers, etc. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In order to provide greater flex ibility in scheduling, we made the core requirement focuses on sustainability a choice between a summer course (SUST 512) and a fall one (SUST 514). Almost al l our students take 6 hours a semester (and get financial aid), and with SUST 512 and other electives, many are able to finish in two years. Additional efficien cies include reevaluating our SRSC 520/SRSC 540 sequence\u2014perhaps eliminating one and giving s tudents the option for an addi tional elective instead, or by requiring a course offered by another department. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) One way to grow the program is to have core courses taught by f ulltime faculty vested in the program, sinceseveralcourses are taught by faculty in other departments and by adjuncts. One 2018 faculty member helped redesign the methodology courses, which should improve th e satisfaction and learning in our next assessment, but that faculty member has now been moved to another department. The biggest impediments to the pr ogram are WKU's state budget c uts, the dismantling of the department, and relocation of the faculty. It is difficult to p redict where the program will be in five years, but with suppor t we recommend \"grow/enhance\" because enrollment has been steady or has increased during a time when other graduate enrollments have plummeted; our core courses and electives (which serve other programs as well) are wellenrolled; there is some potential for collaboration with other department s; it is ranked 3rd out of 84 programs in the region including Kentucky and surrou nding states (see 5d); and because our faculty will be s pread around departments and w ill be tapped to teach other c ourses, so we'll need to replace at least one lost hire. (Our most recent loss was last year when WKU unfilled positions were taken.) e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) i Jacob, W. (2015).

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Social Studies program provi des a strong, interdisciplinary major both for prospe ctive secondary school teachers and for Liberal Arts students interested in a broad le arning experience. The Social Studies curriculum totals 60 hours and requires st udents to study history (27 hrs) , political science (9 hrs), economics (6 hrs), geography (9 hrs), anthropology ( 3 hrs), psychology (3 hrs), an d sociology (3 hrs). Social Studies majors are not required to complete an accompanying program, but nearly all So cial Studies students doublemajor in History (which requires 33 hrs). Most Soc ial Studies majors complete th e complementary Secondary Education curriculum in CEBS to become certified to t each social studies, and then t ake jobs as secondary school teachers in WKU's service area. Social Studies' delivery costs ar e low, and its revenues genera ted high. Great strategic potential exists to grow the program. The Commonwealth identi fies social studies teaching as a \"Critical Shortage Instructional Area and Subject,\" and specifically ident ifies the WKU service area (and many other Kentucky regions) as critically short of certified teachers. Tennessee al so cites social studies teachin g as a critical shortage area, and emergency \"outof field\" teaching waivers for Soci al Studies teaching are on the rise there. Social Studies program coursewor k is delivered to students in a ll available modes on all WKU campuses. COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 2.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Students who complete the program take jobs in Kentucky's secon dary schools. Thus, the program supports the Department's mission to \"mentor new generations of scholars and teachers who are prepared...to succeed in professional life.\" The program advances WKU's mission to be a professional \"talent pipeline\" of teachers regional secondary schools and to be a \"r egional lighthouse\" that serves area educational institut ions. Kentucky is facing a severe shortage of social studies teachers, and the program ful fills WKU's strategic mission to provide trained professionals to meet c ritical professional needs in the Common wealth. The Social Studies program's inhe rent interdisciplinarity contr ibutes to supporting enrollments in many departments across three colleges. Social Studies students are required to complete an interdisciplinary core of courses that spans across 7 depa rtments in PCAL, GFCB, and OCSE /CEBS. Most students in the program also complete CEBS' Secondary Education curriculum to become eligibl e for social studies teaching certification. Many Social Studies program alumni who are secondary school teachers return to WKU to take graduate coursework, and program alumni form a signifi cant portion of the History de partment's graduate student body. Productivity statistics indicate that Social Studies is a relat ively large major. SCHP pro duction has stabilized to an average close to the university median. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Social Studies enrollments have s tabilized over the past two ye ars, and the program remains one of the ten largest programs in Potter Colle ge. The program's enrollment tr end over the past 10 year s - an unprecedented spike after 2008 followed by an unprecedented decline - are in line with enrollmen t trends in other undergraduate teacher education programs at WKU and nationwide . Due to staffing shortages, Hist ory cannot offer enough upperle vel coursework to sati sfy student demand. Because Social Studies majors mu st take 27 hours of history cou rsework, this trend has led to student course enrollment and graduation bottlenecks. The History department's tenuretrack faculty shrank from 20 to 17 members between 2016 and 2018. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 (N=27) 3.88 (N=17) 4.39 List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The History faculty sy stematically assesses the research papers in the program's capstone course, HIST 498: Senior Seminar, to evaluate the ability of Social Studies stude nts to engage in advanced undergraduate historical analysis and argument, research, critical thinking, and writing . Social Studies students have performed well in HIST 498. Social Studies students succeed academically. The fiveyear ave rages of students' first year retention rate, progression, graduation rate, and time to degree compare favora bly to the university averages. The History Department monitors the success rate of Social Stud ies students who take the PRAXIS II examination, the standardized test that Kentu cky requires for teacher certif ication. Results of students taking the PRAXIS II examination in their subject area ( Social Studies: Content and Interpretation ) have been consis tently high (100% pass rate three of the past four years), and higher than the st ate average. To keep up with national trends i n the field, the History Depar tment changed the curriculum's core courses in 2014. Social Studies students must now complete two courses in World History instead of Western Civilization History. Department faculty memb ers met regularly for two years during implementation to develop a common syllabus, refine the course structure, and develop teaching str ategies. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) State employment statistics show that the large majority of WKU Social Studies graduates are employed as social studies teachers 3 years after graduation. WKU should grow the Social Studies program to meet a critical w orkforce need. Kentucky a nd Tennessee are both critically short of social stu dies teachers. The CEBS 20172020 Strategic Plan cites Social Studies as a strategic growth opportunity field because of these shortages. According to state employment statistics, secondary school social studies teachers are in high demand. Public school teach ing generally is the secondlargest employment sector Kentucky graduates. The department surveys the stude nts who complete the capstone c ourse and designed a survey of alumni that will launch in 2019. The departmen t collects feedback from alum ni through our ongoing professional interactions with them. The History faculty p erforms site visits to regional social studies classrooms to oversee dual credit offerings. The History Department hosts the History Contest eve ry year, during which dozens of Social Studies alumniteachers from Kentucky and bordering states bring hundre ds of their students to campus to compete. During the History Contest, the D epartment discusses curriculum and careers with its alumni. The feedback from graduating students and alumni remains very positive. Our alumn i praise the academic preparation they received in the Social Studies program. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In 2018, the department designed survey of alumni, many of whom are area school administrators, which will launch in 2019. The Social Studies curriculum aligns with state and national guidelines for social studies teacher training. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of studen ts in this program?(opti onal, maximum 100 words) The successes of our awardwinning alumni highlight how well th e Social Studies program trains students for professional life. The Kentucky Department of Education named a lumnus Ron Skillern the 2017 \"Kentucky Teacher of the Year.\" In the past three years, three alumni, Jesse Brewer, Kendrick B ryan, and Claire Bellar, won James Madison Fellowships, nationallycompetiti ve awards that fund graduate e ducation for teachers who will teach US Constitutional History and Gover nment in secondaryschool class rooms. The James Madison Foundation awards only one fellowship per year per state. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Provided by Faculty 4.5 12 Number of NTE Faculty 0.2 4 Cost per SCH (program) 107 128 Cost per SCH (department) 9 6 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 501 512 573 564 489 375 % 17 18 18 18 19 % UpperDiv. Under Enrolled Sections *** 38.0% 30.4% 41.3% 46.7% 31.1% 36.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) Through online, winter term, and summer term teaching, the Soci al Studies program generates a significant volume of DELO revenue, approx imately $2025K per year. The pro gram also generates significant philanthropic interest from donors interested in supporting teachers and teac her education. The History Department awarded approximately $10K in donorsuppo rted scholarships to prospecti ve teachers in 201718. There is significant, but dormant , potential for the Social Stu dies program to generate external government and private grant revenue. From 2013 15, for example, the Social St udies program was one of t he two programs in the $500K Clinical Experiences and Prac tices in Teaching (CEPT) Pro gram, sponsored by the Kentucky CPE. The CEPT Program placed Social Studies st udents into classrooms in Bowli ng Green High School and FranklinSimpson High School for an entire year before their formal student teaching internships. CEPT focused on providing aspiring teachers with realworld experie nces that improved their teache r preparation. Students and faculty members agree that CEPT was a tremendous success. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Social Studies' delivery costs ar e low, and its revenues genera ted high. The Social Studies program's curriculum is coherent, but entirely derived f rom courses embedded in its sev en related departments/m ajors. Service teaching of the Social Studies core cour ses, HIST 101/102, accounts for around 70 percent (9,541) of the department's total SCHP (12,615). To estimate costs, SCH P for the History and Social Studies majo rs were combined, since coursework offered by the History Department to support these majors is the same, wit h the only difference being the number of History credit hours each program requir es. Also, nonprogramrelated f aculty effort (HIST 101/102 service teaching and MA program teaching) was taken out of the equation. *** DATA NOTES: For the Social Studies program, the median clas s sizes are higher and the % u pperdivision sections underenro lled are lower than the data indicate. WKU data erroneously count HEEC s ections, ITV sections, and teamtaught, interdisciplinary cours e sections as freestanding course sections, when they are not. Data also cou nt internships and independent studies as \"low enrollment\" sect ions, when they are not. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Students who complete the program teach in area secondary schoo ls. Thus, the program advances WKU's ongoing mission to be a profession al \"talent pipeline\" of teach ers from WKU to regional secondary schools and to be a \"regional lighthouse\" that serves area educational institu tions. Kentucky defines social studies as a \"critical shortage instructional area,\" a nd the program fulfills WKU's st rategic mission to provide trained professionals to fill critical professional n eeds in the Commonwealth. A large portion of the Social St udies curriculum is offered con currently as part of th e Colonnade Program's \"Foundations\" and \"Connections.\" T hus, the program's students a re by design tied deeply into the Colonnade's HIPs and with it, \"preparation for career and life in a global context,\" as well as ens uring \"that WKU students graduate with skills to think crit ically, solve problems, and e ngage effectively with others.\" Our Social Studies alumni who teach in the regional schools are excellent \"Alumni Ambassadors\" and recruiters who send students to WKU all the time, thus advancing the strat egy, \"Incorporate alumni into undergraduate recruitment activities.\" b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The state strategic agenda descr ibes statesupported colleges a nd universities as \"primary providers of teacher education and training in the state,\" and asserts that a main s trategic educational goal (Objective 4.1) must be to \"attract, retain, and prepare highly effective adult educators. \" The Social Studies pro gram meets these goals directly by training teachers for Kentucky schools. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) WKU should expand the Social Studies program, which would meet a critical workforce need in WKU's service area and throughout t he Commonwealth. As is explained earlier in this program evaluation, Kentucky an d Tennessee are facing a critical shortage of social studies teachers. The Commonwealt h cites WKU's service area spe cifically as critically s hort of social studies teachers. The CEBS 20172020 strategic plan points to Social St udies as a strategic growth opportunity because of this situation. According to state employment st atistics, secondary school teac hing generally and social studies teaching specifically are highdemand professions, and public school tea ching is the secondlargest employment sector for college graduates in Kentucky. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Social Studies program requi res classes in more disciplines , and is thus more interdisciplinary, than are other programs in the state. The Social Studies curriculum pr ovides its students with all of the interdisciplinary content knowledge and skills articulated in the National Counc il for the Social Studies' \"Na tional Standards for the Preparation of Social Studies Teachers.\" Assessment of student skills and experiences is embe dded throughout the Social Studies curriculum. Student success is performancebased and all work is evaluated by authentic assessment de vices, including essay exams, book reports, term papers, observation, journals, oral p resentations, collaborative projects, and comprehensive written examinatio ns. Our faculty also become men tors for their students and model various methods of superior teach ing for them as well. The History Department teaches t he Social Studies curriculum al most entirely with fulltime, tenureeligible faculty, which makes the program distinctive, and higherqualit y, compared to others in Kentucky. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The History Department's faculty prides itself in training WKU students - majors and nonmajors - to be engaged citizens who understand the histo rical context of today's most difficult problems, and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to help solve them. WKU's historians are p ublic intellectuals who model engaged citizenship for their students and the broad er community. Our Social Studie s graduates teach in Kentu cky's schools and also carry out this mission as they work with students in secondary school classrooms. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) WKU should exploit the tremendous opportunities that could be r ealized by expanding the S ocial Studies program by devoting more resources to it . Expanding Social Studies woul d meet a critical workforc e need in WKU's service area, throughout the Commonwealth , and in neighboring states. Kentucky and Tennessee need many more social studies teachers. The Commonwealth identifies secondarylevel (grades 712) social studies as a \"Critical Shortage Instructio nal Area and Subject,\" and lis ts WKU's service area as one that is in dire need of more social studies teachers. Tenne ssee school districts are issuing more and more social studies \"outoffield\" te aching waivers, which are issue d to underqualified teachers on an emergency basis when no qualified teachers are available to staff classrooms. S tate employment statistics indicate that social studies teaching is a highdemand profession and that teaching one of the largest employm ent sectors for college graduates in Kentucky. For the se reasons, CEBS' 20172020 strat egic plan indicates that soc ial studies teaching is a strategic growth opportunity. Th e Social Studies faculty agrees . The Social Studies program does not need to be revised. The pro gram is already profoundly interdisciplinary in design and meets state and nation al guidelines for social studi es teacher preparation. WKU needs to devote more resources to Social Studies (see below). b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Enrollments have been stable for the past two years. The Social Studies program's enro llment trends align with national trends. The program experienced a sharp, unprecedented , upward spike in enrollments in the wake of 2008's \"Great Recession,\" followe d by a precipito us drop that c ontinued until 2016. Kentucky's identification of social studies teaching as a \"cr itical need,\" high demand job m irrors national trends, as well. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) We have changed scheduling and mode of delivery for upper level History coursework to accommodate Social Studies majors and graduate the m more quickly. Since 2017, Hist ory has shifted some of it s upperlevel courses to MWF schedules and offered more of them online. This allows Soci al Studies students completing required student teaching internships (which occur on a TuesdayThursday schedul e) to enroll in History c oursework more easily. History has implemented two init iatives that will benefit the S ocial Studies program. First , the History faculty now facilitates pedagogic al collaboration amo ng HIST 101/102 instru ctors at any Kentucky institution, including high schools and community colleges that are unaffiliated with WKU b ut that offer the course s for WKU credit. We expect this initiati ve to improve HIST 1 01/102 pedagogy and bui ld stronger bonds with So cial Studies alumni, other teachers, and students in our region. Second, the faculty is piloting a new pedagogy that will be imp lemented throughout Social Studies' history coursework and serve as a usefu l new \"HIP\" for HIST 101/102. Th e method, used at hundreds of colleges, immerses students in collaborati ve, scenariobased game playing revolving around turning point moments such as the French and American Revolutio ns. Students take on roles of historical characters and, in the process, engage in \"deep learning\" about the subj ect matter and acquire critica l thinking and other skills that they do not acquire in traditional classrooms. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The natural stable enrollment le vel for the Social Studies prog ram appears to be 150225 students, given the program's historical enrollment trends (see past Academic Progr am Reviews for context) and the high demand for social studies teachers in the region. The department remains shorts taffed, and current Social Studie s students are suffering fr om course registration and graduation bottlenecks. The department lost three permanent faculty lines in the most recent budget cut. It is not possible for the department to reassign remaining facult y members to teach more upperlevel courses to meet the necessary demand for th em. The department is obligated to offer a large number of Colonnade \"Foundations\" sections ( HIST 101/102 ) and does not have a budget for additional staff. The department could meet current demand and expand the Social Studies program with three additional tenuretrack faculty lines and a permanent budget for parttime instructors and graduate assistants . These faculty lines and GAs would also serve the History program. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELF STUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 Department/School: Department of Sociology College: Potter College of Arts and Letters Program Name: Sociology Reference Number: 105 CIP Code: 451101 Degree Type (AB, BS, STEM+H Degree (Y/N) Y Minimum Hours Required: 3440 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective adm ission. (maximum 200 words) The MA in Sociology is a faceto face, standalone degree with core courses in theory, quantitative and qualitative research methods, and statistics . Our elective offerings are me ant to provide students with a broad background in Sociology in areas such as Family , Demography, Advanced Social Interaction, Environmental Sociology, and Criminology. Many of our student s enter the program not knowing what subdiscipline they want to study so the broad electives help them determine what area they find most in teresting and applicable to their career path. Our coursework provides students with strong foundational skill s and knowledge that a llow them to go on for doctoral degrees in Sociology and related fields (4 students in the past 6 years, 3 students currently applying for the Fall) or into careers where they can apply their degree (6 students in 3 years). Mo st students choose the thesis track which allows them to get firsthand experience des igning and conducting research in their areas of specialization. We do offer a non thesis track tha t consists of 40 hours of coursework a nd a comprehensive exam. 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/ college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Sociology Department offers a JUMP in Sociology, which serv es our Sociology and Criminology majors. This program allows undergraduate stude nts to take Masters classes a nd count them toward bot h undergraduate and graduate degrees and finish their degrees in five years, which is both time and cost efficient for students. As for our MA classes, it is not uncommo n for students in other Master 's programs to take our classes as an elective. Specifically, Gender and Women's Studies and Organizational Lea dership list SOCL MA courses as approved electives in their program of st udy. Occasionally, we offer G c ourses or crosslisted undergraduate/graduate courses. Typically these classes raise the bar for undergraduat e students, giving them more of a graduate course experience, rather than lower the bar for graduate students. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) In the past five years, we have been more lenient in our admiss ions standards to increase the diversity of students in our program and encourage stu dents who are placebound to ac hieve a graduate degree. On occasion, students who have not completed t heir degree are those who we t ook a chance on but ultimately were not able to complete the degree due to circumstances beyond our program. Lack of assistantship funding and thus having to work full or parttime has been a barrier to a few of our st udents' success. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) 1.) Students will be able to synth esize and analyze sociologica l theory. 2.) Students will be able to ut ilize quantitative and qualitati ve social science research met hods to answer sociological questions. 3.) Students will be able to ident ify and evaluate sociological research findings. These learning objectives are a ssessed within individual course s and are typically a ssessed through exams, papers/presentations, and class discussion. In addition, learni ng outcomes are assessed through the student's completion of a thesis or the comprehensive exam. Most students opt for the the sis option through which they develop their own original research questions, review literature and theory, develop their methodological research desig n and conduct analyses. This process gives them experience a pplying their skills and display ing their achievement of the se learning outcomes in an independent research project. The structure of the comprehensiv e exam is a one day inperson exam with two questions, one to assess their knowledge of the ory and the other to assess the ir knowledge of research methods. Then they complete a specialty question in their chosen area to answer over a 48 hou r window at home. These three answers allow us to determine whether students have achieved the learning outcomes for the pr ogram. While we had been more lenient in our admissions requirements i n the past few years (discussed in 2c), we decided, upon reflection of student theses and comprehensive exams, that it i s not in the best interest of students or faculty to accept students who have a lower chance of succeeding (similar to Pres ident Caboni's comments on undergraduate admission at Convocation). We think we will serve students better by being u pfront about their chances of success in graduate school and accept only those who can perform at this level. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) We have not systematically gathe red information from previous s tudents, however, with the rapport and close mentoring relationships we build with stude nts, we keep in touch with the m and tend to know what they are doing in their career and how they are using their skills. W e are considering doing an ex it interview with students prior to graduation to get additiona l feedback. Our graduates are typi cally employed in Soc ial and Human Servic e positions such as counseling, social work, and community support service positions, research positions, or become educat ors. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary for Counselors, social workers, and other community and social support specialists is $43, 860 and projecte d job growth is expected to increase 16% by 2026 (19% in KY). Substance abus e counselors earn a median of $43,300 per year are expected to see 23% growth in the next d ecade. Research Assistants earn a median income of $45,020 in K Y and are likely to grow by 3%. Employment teaching at community colleges would earn a medi an wage of approximately $4050,000 per year. Projections for the state of Ken tucky are unavailable but natio nally are 10%. These are some of the career paths for our graduates. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) We have not done this ourselves but we do look to sources such as the Chronicle of Higher Education , the American Sociological Association, and ot her organizations who do this o n a larger scale and incorporate information as needed. We know that employers in fields th at employ our students want peo ple who are critical thinkers, who understand data and can make datadriven decisions, who ar e personable and can interact well with clients or comm unity members, who are well spoken and write professionally, who are passionate about helpi ng people in their communities . We teach those skills to the best of our ability by requiring students lead class discussion s and critically evaluate inform ation, by formally presenting i n classes and at their thesis propos al and defense, by writing li terature reviews that synthesiz e empirical information and enhance their writing skills, by socializing them into the prof essional discipline thro ugh our SOCL 505: Pr oseminar in Sociolo gy course, mentorship, and helping students travel to a conference , and by giving them a strong foundation in theory, research methods, and statist ics. We try to model the soft skills and ar e not afraid to have uncomfortab le conversations with students about professionalism and communi cation. All of our students in the past few cohorts have found employment. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) We are very proud that students who have graduated in the past two years are currently working in careers directly related to their degree and are performing at a high l evel because of the skills g aining in our program. From 2018 graduating cohort: Thera peutic Support Specialist for Benchmark Family Services; WRAP Facilitator/Social Worker at KVC Behavioral Health in Lexington ; Research Associate at the UK Medical Center/Center for Health Service s Research. We have also placed students in top Ph.D. programs, including SUNY Albany, Florida State University , and University of Illinois -U rbana Champagne (top ran ked Family and Consumer Science doctoral program). 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, co nsider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporateuniversity partnerships, and economic development rela tionships with communities that generate additional support for the program, departm ent, college, and/or university . (maximum 200 words) Our current program does not have any external revenue streams directly associated with the program. Within the past five years, one faculty member had a USDA grant which employed a gra duate student for two semesters. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) At present, the department devotes 0.411 faculty to teach cour ses in the sociology MA program, at a cost of $165 per SCH (internal cost calculation docum ent, Department of Sociology). 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) We address a few aspects of the WKU strategic plan. Most specif ically is that of \"Res earch and Creative activities.\" Our SLOs (see 3b, this report) are all related to the training of studen ts to able to independently condu ct social science research. I n the past six years, the vast majority of our students completed a t hesis. Many of our students have gone to conferences to present research with faculty an d/or have participated in the W KU Student Research Conference. We also attract a diverse body of students. In the past three c ohorts, we have had two international students, nine women, two nonwhite students (not including the international student s). We do our best to ensure our students complete their degree. Fa culty have worked to help students be successful, from offering unpaid independent studies, working with students over breaks, encouraging students who had been away from the university a while to finish bef ore their time ran out, etc. We are a regional lighthouse. We are the only terminal MA progr am in Sociology in the state and region. Many of our students have stayed in the state to work. Our faculty and grad uate students engage with community partners in their research. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The Sociology MA best serves the statewide strategic agenda in the broad goal of \"opportunity.\" A large portion of our students choose our program becau se of the location of the prog ram. Many students are \"tied to place\" due to economic concerns or family obligations. Our program provides the opport unity for those students to pursue a graduate degree. Objective 9: To improve career readiness and employability of p ostsecondary graduates is th e mission of our program. As discussed in 3d above, we pride ourselves of the employability of our graduates, most of whom are employed in the state of Kentucky. Our student theses addr ess Objective 10 : Increase bas ic, applied, and translational research to create new knowledge, accelerate innovation , and promote economic growth. They are learning how to create new knowledge, to conduct independent research, to critically evaluate the resear ch of others and information they see in the news, and to find datadriven solutions to problems. Many of our students go on t o be social workers or victim advocates or other community workers which addresses Objectiv e 11: Expand regional partnersh ips, outreach and public service that improve the health and quality of life of Kentucky communities. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) In all workforce areas in KY, the demand for all community and social service workers is expect ed to increase. From a low of 163 in the Green river area to a high of 1,093 in the Kentuckia na work area. Students with an M A in Sociology o ften go into what are historically considered \"social w ork\" type positions. The Sociology MA at 34 hours is shorter and therefore less expensive than earning a Master' s in Social work (MSW) and can be an appropriate route to social work type employment, particularly those students who do not have a Bachelor's in Soc ial work or for those students who are not interested in the licensure potential of earning an MSW. Also see 3c above. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU provides the only terminal M aster's degree in Sociology in Kentucky (UK and UofL have MA degrees but typically as part of their doctoral track). It is distinctive in its face to face format and its rigorous attent ion to instilling a strong resea rch methods foundation in our students, as reported by those who go on to attend top tier PhD programs. Further we serve those students who may not have a strong enough academic backgr ound to immediately enro ll in a PhD program. Our program serves to strengthen the skills of our students to bett er position their application to competitive PhD programs. Finally, we serve our region. Many of our students are \"tied to place\" in South Central KY and desire a face to face degree. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program ? (maximum 200 words) A more aggressive marketing campaign will take place. We are wo rking on updating our recruitment materials and website and will be engaging in communication with terminal BA/BS programs in the region. The department is a member of a regional and national professional association , which will allow for recruitment opportunities and visibility. Beyond marketi ng, we have discussed collaborati on with the Masters in P ublic Administration in offering our Quantitative Researc h Methods courses on a rotatin g basis, with each program teaching the class once every other year and having students take th e class in the other department in the off year. The classes are very similar so this collaborati on will reduce redundancy and f ree a faculty member to teach other course. We plan to put two of our elective courses OnDemand to give studen ts options and potentially free a faculty member as needed to teach another class. In the next few years while w e build our enrollment, we will offer at least one G course per semester so that we can be more efficient with our f aculty resources and give our undergraduates more of a graduate experience. (Note: we will only offer G cou rses so long as 400level and graduate courses are underenrolled). b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) The decline in MA stude nt enrollment in sociology mirrors the n ational trend over the past 10 years (a 12.6% decline) (http://www.asanet.org/sites/def ault/files/files/pdf/mastersinso ciology.pdf ; https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_325.92.asp ). Despite this trend, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us tha t there will be an increasing need for employees with the skills students develop thro ugh our program (see 3c above). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) About three years ago, we redesigned the timing of our required course offeringsto better prep are students for their thesis proposal defense in their third semester and their final defens e in the fourth semester. Last y ear, we saw the results of that change in graduating everyone from that cohort. We graduated ou r first JUMP student, have progressed one fully into the MA program and have a new JUMP student. We expect that program to grow as we have examples of students who have been successful. We have also fully staffed our MA program. Abo ut five years ago, we were not offering enough electives and students were having to take independent studies to complete th eir degree. We have not had that problem in the past three years, which has made our program stronger. In the fall of 2018 we worked with the GRE graduate school to u se GRE database to send out a recruitment letter to 300 students who indicated the intention to pursue a degree in Soci ology. While we did not seem an impact of this effort on enrollment for our fall 2018 coh ort, it is possible that we cou ld see an impact for our Fall 2019 cohort. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) In five years, we woul d like to see our program have larger coh orts (of about 1015 students) and a high graduation rate. Our program is a solid program. We are the only MA in the region at a midsized university (the only others are UK, U of L, and Vanderbilt - those are not attracting the same students since t hey also offer Ph.D.s). We just need to get more students in the door. We have lost assistants hips recently and we currently only have 4 assistantships. That makes it difficult to attract students when we don't have funding for them or cannot guarante e funding for both years. We understand that asking for new funding at this time is not possible but as we build recrui tment and the university gets to a better state financially, we would like to see some of those assistantships come back to the department. We are already pl acing students well, many of whom stay in KY and contribute t o the Commonwealth. In ten year s, we will see a turnover of senior faculty and hope to diversify the specializations of junior faculty recruits in eme rging areas of interest (such as medical sociology, immigration , etc.) We hope that over the next decade, our program is flexibl e enough to serve market demand. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant strategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAM EVALUATION PROGRAM SELFSTUDY WORKSHEET 19 October 2018 Department/School: Department of Sociology College: Potter College of Arts and Letters Program Name: Sociology Reference Number: 775 CIP Code: 451101 Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): AB STEM+H Degree (Y/N) Y Minimum Hours Required: 31 List Concentrations (if any): Inequality and Social Change (SISC), Community, Environment, and Development (SCED), Research Methods (SORM), Family, Gender and Sexuality (SFGS) 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective adm ission. (maximum 200 words) Sociology applies the analytic rigor of science to the social w orld so that one might understand and improve the human condition. It is the Swiss Army knife of majo rs. The major requires a minimum of 31 hours. Students must have an addi tional major or minor. The Soc iology major is available through face toface instruction as well as at a distance through a combinat ion of Web and On Demand courses. The major's core courses include Intro ductory Sociology, Social Sta tistics, Research Methods, Sociological Theory and Senior Seminar. Majors may concentrate in one of fou r areas (Inequality and Social Change; Community, Environment, and Develo pment; Research Methods; Fami ly, Gender, and Sexuality) or they may take a general major. One a dditional core course is require d for the major but varies depending on whether one chooses to concentrate or not and, if so, in which concentration. The rest of the credit hours are elective. Most students do not enter college seeking a sociology major; rather, they learn of the major through taking sociology classes, which are part of t he general education curriculum, or through social networks. 2. PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY a. Data Provided by IR 201314 246 165 135 114 89 Conferrals 103 69 53 32 32 22 SCHP 4378 2470 1768 1491 1324 991 b. In what ways does t he program contribute to other programs o r areas of the departmental/ college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Courses within the sociology majo r contribute to many WKU major s, minors and certificate programs across the university as well a s the colonnade program. Core so ciology courses (Intro, Stats, Theory, Methods) are either required, recommended, or elective courses for 15 majors, two minors, an A.S. degree, and prenursing advisemen t. The completion of the entir e core is also required for students entering the Sociology JUMP prog ram. Elective sociology courses are also either required or elective courses in an additional 16 majo rs, 8 minors and a certificate program. Sociology program also plays a key role in the Colonnade program where at least ten courses ar e included in the Explorations and Connections categories. The number of enrolled students declined over the past five yea rs with the creation of the Criminology major. When first created student s were not allowed to major in both sociology and criminology. Changed were made to allow for do uble majors in Spring 2018 and we have seen the major numbers begin to rebound accordingly. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Examination of the university a nd college percentage for first generation and underrepresented minorities reveals that during the 20172018 academic year firs tgeneration students consisted of 32% of the University student body and 30% were in Potter College. This contrasts with 50% of Sociology majors who were firstgeneration students. Similarly, underrep resented minority constituted 15% and 16% for University and College res pectively, while 22% of Socio logy majors were underrepresented minorities. The Sociology program therefore plays a significant role in the education of these two distinct and important groups within the Commonwealth of Kentuc ky. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student Learning Outcomes were not articulated when the major w as developed. The Social Science Research Council recently articul ated the Sociological Literacy Framework of essential concepts and competencies along with associ ated SLOs. The 11 SLOs are: Students will... Recognize key theoretical frameworks and assumptions on which t he discipline is founded and differentiated from other social sciences. Articulate what sociologists mea n by social structure and how s tructural forces affect human action and social life. Explain the relationship between self and society and how the s elf is socially constructed and maintained. Identify how social structures create and reproduce different f orms of social inequality, and interpret patterns and effects of inequality. Comprehend how social structure s reproduce themselves across ge nerations as well as how social change occurs. Be able to identify how sociolog ical concepts and theories rela te to everyday life. Possess a critical lens for understanding human behavior and so cieties. Articulate the importance of evid ence and scientific methods fo r explanations of social phenomena. Identify disciplinary standards for both quantitative and quali tative analysis. Be able to identify the characteristics of highquality data an d research methods in sociological research. Use their sociological knowledge and skills to engage and impac t the world around them. Assessment occurs in SOCL 499: Senior Seminar. The course draws on the core sociological courses to evaluate the knowledge and skills students have acquired in the ir studies. The department is in the process of rethinking the Senior Seminar to better align its as sessment processes with the Sociology Literacy Framework. Previous asse ssments data are shared with t he faculty on a regular basis and discussed. Based on previous year's assessments, changes were m ade to the ways that tabular analysis was being taught in social statistics and discussion of ways to increase data presentation and analysis across the major were instigated. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The Sociology Department periodically conducts alumni surveys. According to the most recent survey, 61.2% of our 390 undergraduate res pondents had gone on to gradu ate school. Nearly 80% percent reported that they were fully e mployed. Nearly 73% stated that their current position was either directly related or somewhat related to their degree. According to the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce St atistics, during the Federal Fiscal Years (FFY 1115), students graduating with Sociology major were empl oyed in Health Care and Social Assistance, Retail, Public Admin istration, Educational Services , and Manufacturing, among others. This mirrors American Sociological Association data as to what under graduates do with their degree in sociology. According to the KCEWS data, the median wage of WKU sociology majors who remained in Kentucky 3 years after graduati on was $24,000. According to the most recent departmental alumni surveys, the mean annual income w as slightly higher (in the $30 ,000$39,999 range). This is due to the fact that alumni who do not live in Kentucky have significantly higher annual incomes on average. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Department leadership stays curre nt on higher education and wor kforce development research (e.g., The New Education ; RobotProof ; A Practical Education ; etc.) and uses it to update the Senior Seminar. In addition, the department has increased career panels, improving interaction between employers, faculty, and students. Beyond this, the Internship in Sociology places students in local/regional organizations. The department re ceives feedback from the organi zations' internship supervisors about the quality of the students placed in their organizations. The department has discussed the creation of an advisory board, and will most likely implement the board aft er the next alumni survey. The department had planned to meet with the South Central Workforce Development Board; that organization has been in flux since 2016. 5. The latest research suggests tha t having some familiarity with computer programming has improved job prospects for liberal arts and social science majors at some un iversities. This in not so much that they are expected to program, but that it improves their ability to work with programmers. With this in mind, the department is currently experimen ting with using CS 146 Intro t o Programming for the required Colonnade quantitative reasoning course instead of a math cours e as a lead in to Social Statistics. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) Many students are now taking the major online. It is one of the few completely available online. These students often enter WKU with a significant number of student c redit hours (sometimes due to their military service) that may or may not be useful for their matri culation. Often the credit hours they bring in are all lowerlevel credit, me aning that at least 14 courses will need to be taken at WKU besides other major, minor and colonnade requirements. 6. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, co nsider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporateuniversity partnerships, and economic development rela tionships with communities that generate additional support for the program, departm ent, college, and/or university . (maximum 200 words) Students have the option of earni ng their degree online through either Web and/or On Demand courses. Both modes of delivery generate D ELO revenue. Furthermore, the Sociology program regularly offers Winter/Summer courses that contr ibute to DELO revenue stream as well. Over the past five fiscal years, the Sociology Department's porti on of the DELO distribution ave raged nearly $40,467. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency? For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Sociology major courses are also taken by students pursuing the sociology minor. In addition, most CRIM courses are also part of the SOC L major, meaning those classes may be taken by students finishing any of those programs. Since the sociol ogy is the common denominator, it bears the brunt of the cost per SCH. During 20172018, median course s ize for FTF courses was 25 at semester's end. FTF courses were enrolled at 65.1% and 80.6% capa city (fall/spring). When region al campuses are excluded, FTF courses were enrolled at 82% and 89% capacity. 7. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AN D DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The following demonstrate that the program \"prepares students o f all backgrounds to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizenleaders of a global s ociety.\" 50% of our majors are first gen eration students (PCAL30%; Univ 32%)\u2014Goals accessibility & minorities (PCAL16%; U niv15%)\u2014 Goals accessibility & diversity . We offer the degree both FTF and at a distance. In 2018 27% of our majors studied completely at a distance, 38.9% completely FTF and 33.6% a hybrid of the t wo\u2014Goals accessibility & diversity. We overhauled recruitment, advis ing, and retention efforts in 2 017. Most notably, we implemented a peer mentoring pro gram and have worked closely wi th ACDC's CAP (designating faculty mentors, cosponsoring se veral career workshops, etc.) to enhance our strengths\u2014 Goal completion & success . We are involved in HIPs includi ng study abroad opportunities, m entorship of undergraduate research, and service/communitybased learning and coordination with regional employers to place an average of 12 students in internships annually\u2014 Goals success, global context, & regional economy/quality of life. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by theprogram? Reference specific goals , policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) In addition, to the above discussion of accessibility , diversity, affordability, completion, and success achievements, the following demonstrate that the major ensures that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is strengthened. Enrollment in SOCL 100 dual credit has served an average of 150 students over the last five academic years enhancing capaci ty for citizens of the Commonwea lth\u2014Goal opportunity . 38.9% of our majors are nontradit ional (compared with 8.6% of P CAL and 12.8% across the university); all but one of these nontraditional students is ta king the major completely online- Goal opportunity . Research notes that employers l ook for the following skills tha t sociology majors acquire over the course of their degree: communi cation skills, interpersonal ski lls, leadership skills, analytical skills, statistical and research skills, computer literacy, and crosscultural understanding- Goal success. 8. Besides being recognized as a STE M field itself by the NSF, soc iology supports additional STEM/health programs (7 majors a nd 3 minors) through SOCL cours es included in those programs.\u2014 Goal impact . c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Twentytwo general occupational codes are presented in the Kentucky Future Skills Report (KCEWS). Using the ASA's Jobs, Careers & Sociological Skills report, the following occupational categories were associated with the AB in sociology\u2014Community & Social Service; Office and Administrative Support; Sales and Related; Education, Tr aining and Library; Protective Services; and Life, Physical, and Social Science. More than 85% of the 20 12 graduates with a bachelor's degree in sociology found employment in these sectors. Of the six, thr ee were projected to be \"fast growing\" and three were described as \"growing.\" Based on available information our students are pur suing a vibrant discipline with a transferable skill set to fit areas in which job growth is expe cted. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The AB in Sociology is one of the 14 degrees available online f rom WKU. In 2018, TheBestSchools.org ranked our bachelor's degree in S ociology as 12th best online p rogram in the nation. As noted above, the major serve s a higher percentage of underr epresented minority students compared with the college and th e university. The department a lso has a higher percentage of minority faculty compared with the university overall (21.4% compared wi th 15%). The Sociology program has had a longstanding, significant prese nce at our regional campuses, having instructors and parttime faculty at all campuses and fulltime faculty at two of the branches up until last Fall. With the decline of enrollments at regional campuses, the department has pulled its fulltime faculty from Glasgow. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) 9. The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. Sociological coursework currently focuses on at least 13 of the 17 goals with special a ttention to goals concerning reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality; increasing gender equality; ma king cities and communities more sustainable; strengthening peace, justice and social institutio ns; and decreasing degradation of the environment and climate through responsible consumption and pro duction. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program ? (maximum 200 words) Given the recent losses of perso nnel without replacement, the s ociology department is hardpressed to offer the courses it needs to it s own majors and minors in the needed platforms (FTF, online) not to mention provide the courses tha t 44 other programs across the u niversity depend on. Current personnel are locked in to their offerings . New personnel would allow the department to pivot to emerging/pressing areas of interest/need. Over the past eight y ears, the department has constantly and consistently advocated for hire s that would increase our presen ce in the these stre ngthen the sociology departmen t and draw students, but they would also have instant connections to other units on campus. These p ositions would also add to the skill and abilities of WKU faculty and stude nts vis a vis workforce train ing and development. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) 10 . Data from the National Center fo r Education Statistics (NCES) a llow a ranking of degree fields, unfortunately the categories invol ved are overly broad. That c aution aside, the \"liberal arts & sciences, general studies, and humanities\" c ategory comprised the greates t portion of postsecondary degrees awarded in 201516 at 38%. More specifically, conferrals in \"s ocial science and history\" were the third greatest at 8% of all bachelor d egrees awarded and increased by 29% between 200001 & 201516. These increases reflect the growi ng demand (as expressed in 5c) of professions related to these degrees and the desire for states to prio ritize investment in revenue g enerating programs/occupations (as expressed in 5b). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In 2014, the department began offering four concentrations with the idea that students might desire to specialize in particular areas of study. Three of those concent rations have seen success. The department will either redesign or cull the Research Methods concentration within the next year. In 2015, we implemented a regula r rotation of courses to provid e students transparency of when courses would be taught and where (i.e., at a distance, at a re gional campus, and on main campus). Since then, we have had some fac ulty changes and have added or deleted courses to reflect those changes. In 2017 & 18, we turned our atte ntion toward student recruitmen t and advising. Our new advising mission statement, \"To help students develop individual compete nce and purpose while strengthening connection to the community of so ciology and criminology,\" cont ains four general goals (with at least two specific objectives in support of each) and a plan for impl ementation. The departmental website is being revised with the goal of i ncreasing recruitment and reten tion. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Given demographic projections, t he number of traditional studen ts forecasted to attend Kentucky's regional fouryear universities will continue to decline until at least 2029 by somewhere between 7.5% and 15%. Despite this, within f ive years, the department will s till be providing students a degree with the highquality transferable skill set sought by employers and graduate schools (including our own MA program). It is hoped that the department would be provided pos itions and/or replacement lines to 11 . pivot toward the areas of opport unity listed above, making the unit even more relevant in the face of impending social problems. Moreo ver, our online presence will m ost likely expand attracting more distant traditional students as well as nontraditional students . To get there, the department will need personnel to have and to train so cial media, mobile, analytic a nd cloud skills. This may be an area of new opportunity within 10 years. Cu rrently, the biggest impediment is the continued struggle for resources against interdisciplinary ersatz social science programs with l ittle or no empirical focus. Since these units do not teach courses in support o f other majors, they can pivot quicker to flashy subjects of the day, drawing off majors and faculty lines. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? X Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or importa nt complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teachout may be required) Department/School: History College: Potter College of Arts and Letters Program Name: Southern Studies Reference Number: 462 CIP Code: 050122 Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 21 List Concentrations (if any): 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Southern Studies minor is an interdisciplinary program that provides a framework for understanding the American South in local, nationa l and world contexts. By invest igating the history, culture , and politics of the U.S. South, students will become fami liar with the major themes and events that have shaped the region's development. Most courses in the program are purposefully designed to be rea ding and writing intensive in order to train students in independent research methods and effective communic ation. They encourage students to think critically about the place in which they reside or intend to wo rk. The Southern Studies minor requi res 21 credit hours and does no t have any accompanying major or minor requirements. The majority of coursework is delivered facetof ace; however, online and study away opportunities are also integral.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Southern Studies minor offers a range of courses at the 200 , 300, and 400 levels. Departments that have either required or elective courses as part of the minor includ e: Anthropology and Folk Studies, English, History, Geography and Geology, Political Science and Philosophy and Rel igion. In addition to its wide range of course offerings, a fourth of which are listed in the Colonnade Progra m, it also encourages independent learning by allowing students to earn a three credit servelearning compone nt in consultation with the director. The program in Southern Studies f urthers the University's missi on of fostering students who are socially responsible citizens and who appreciate diverse perspectives. W orking in conjunction with student organizations such as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and Phi Alpha Theta, Southern Studies has helped sponsor diverse progr ams such as \"The Lincoln Racist Debate.\" Although Southern Studies has gen erated relatively low SCHP (12 ) compared to the Univer sity median (187), it has increased over the last three years and currently has two s tudents enrolled. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) Over the last two years SCHP has increased. It is poised to con tinue this upward trend as enrollment also continues to grow. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 % FirstYear Retention Rate Progression 150% Graduation (N=1) N/A 4.20 student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Student learning outcomes for History majors are also applicabl e for Southern Studies minors. These include: Critical thinking: prepare st udents to make informed decision s and ethical choices by examining historical examples Informed citizenship: develop knowledge of and concern for a multicultural world Historical perspective: increa se awareness of how personal bi as and opinion shape historical analysis Social engagement: encourage students to become actively enga ged in issues affecting their lives and those others around the world These outcomes are assessed by fac ulty through coursework assig nments including but not limited to term papers, projects, and presentati ons. These types of assessments ensure students have sufficient time to develop extensive research on and understanding of a particular topic e ffecting the American South. In recent years the Southern Studies minor has worked to incorp orate these SLOs by revisi ng its curriculum. These changes include the addition of several courses: ENG 394: Kentu cky Literature, HIST 456: Kentucky History, 390: Blacks in the American Sout h, PS 377: Southern Politics, P S 412: Kentucky Government and Politics, and a threecredit servicelearning co mponent in consu ltation with pr ogram director. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) A minor in Southern Studies prepares students to pursue studies in master, doctoral or professional programs in a related field. Such fields may potentially include American Stu dies, History, Literature, Political Science, Art, Music, Anthropology, Folklore a nd Religion. Students can use sk ills learned in the Southe rn Studies minor for future careers in law, education, public history, public policy , social work, digital humanities, and library, curatorial and archival management. The program in Southern Studies encourages its minors to take a dvantage of career and professional development opportunities. To thi s end, faculty have sponsored career development workshops that educate students on how the skills that they have learned as a Southern Studies minor can be utilized in many occupations. Southern Studies minors do not f ollow a narrowly focused career path, therefore have a wide range of career options upon graduation. Extensiv e coursework in the liberal ar ts provides them with tran sferable skills that are highly marketable. These includ e top skills identified by emplo yers in the areas of effe ctive written and oral communication, facilitating discu ssion, persuasion, appreciatio n of cultural diversity, cri tical analysis based upon evidence, independent researching, and the ability to evaluate how ideas change over time. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) The program in Southern Studies d oes not systemat ically gather feedback from employers regarding the minor curriculum. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Since revisions to the curriculum and regularly schedule progra ming have been implemented, increasingly students have started to declare it as a minor. None of these s tudents, however, have bee n active in the program long enough to graduate and receiv e their certificate. Expected graduation dates range f rom the fall of 2019 to fall 2021. Once graduation data ha s been obtained, it will undo ubtedly demonstrate that Southern Studies minors gain the critical skills necessary to prepare them for future e mployment. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a. Data Faculty 0 1 2 Number of NTE Faculty 0 4 Cost per SCH $0.00 $167 SCHP/FTF by Dept. 501 512 573 564 489 17 18 18 18 19 % UpperDiv. Under Enrolled Sections *** 38.0% 30.4% 41.3% 46.7% 31.1% 36.3% b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) The Southern Studies minor does not independently generate exte rnal revenue streams. However, its faculty has received substantial research g rants and funding in addition to generating income from study away and DELO courses. Southern Studies faculty have published widely and received bot h internal and external grants in support of their research. Internal funding sources include the: Potter College Research Grant, Research and Creative Activities Grant and the Quick TurnAround Gr ant. The Library Company of P hiladelphia, The Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Abolition and Re sistance, and Western Michiga n University are some of the external funding sources which have granted finan cial assistance to Southern Stu dies faculty research projects. Additionally, faculty member Glenn LaFantasie received a generous endowment resulting in the creation of the Center for Civil War Studies in the West. The Center facilitates the acquisition of Civil Warrelated secondary works as well as archival materials. Southern Studies faculty members also generate income by teachi ng study away and DELO courses. Faculty have taken students to diverse local s throughout the state. Associat ed history faculty have been particularly effective in regularly offering electives in the minor as web courses. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Southern Studies minor provides unique course offerings at zero cost to WKU. It is an intellectually coherent and interdisciplinary approach that promotes synergy with other University departments by expanding existing resources to benefit faculty research, cultivate public engagem ent, and progress student learning by offering a combination of courses not repli cated at any other institution of higher learning in Kentuc ky. No faculty effort is committed directly to support the program or its curriculum. Ra ther, it relies on committ ed faculty from existing departments whose research and teaching cover related fields. E liminating Southern Studies would undoubtedly harm the University by decreasi ng the variety of its minor prog rams. However, maintaining it would require minimal effort and reap significant benefits without requiring the allocation of any additional or substantial resources. *** DATA NOTES: Because of its a ssociation with the History Dep artment, the Southern Studies m inor has used data compiled from the History program for its CAPE cal culations. The median class siz es are higher and the % upperdivision sections underenrolled, however, are lower than the data indicate. WKU data erroneously count HEEC s ections, ITV sections, and teamtaught, interdisciplinary cours e sections as freestanding course sections, when they are not. Data also cou nt internships and independent studies as \"low enrollment\" sect ions, when they are not. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Southern Studies contributes substantial coursework and credit hour production to the Colonnade \"Connections\" category.. Courses attempt to fur ther the University goal to cr eate, \"responsible citizen s and good stewards of place,\" in part by designing curriculum that fosters understand ing of Southern society, human behavior, and cultural awareness. Southern Studies also address WK U's strategic plan to establish WKU as a \"regional lighthouse to provide resources, attract talent, and nu rture intellectual capital in the communities we serve.\" For students, the program helps them \"graduate with skills t o think critically, solve pro blems, and engage effectively with others.\" WKU is the only institution in Kentucky that has an active Southern St udies program. If it continues to regularly offer courses in Southern Studies, it will maintain its regional pres ence and attraction to stude nts who desire to learn about the region in which they intend to live and work. Southern Studies supports faculty who, \"engage with the communi ties we serve to be a resource and partner in finding innovative solutions to so cial, economic, and other cha llenges.\" By working with c ommunity organizations such as the West Kentucky Africa n American Heritage Center, the Hobson House at Rivervi ew and media projects including documentaries that dep ict the resistance of local bla ck residents, the program's collaborative initiatives will ultimately serve to link s tudents with opportunities to pu rsue local internships, serv ice learning, and research projects. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Southern Studies contributes to Objective 10 of the statewide s trategic agenda, which calls for the increase of basic, applied, and translational research to create new knowle dge, acceleration of innovation, and promotion of economic growth. To this end, faculty are committed to strategy 10.5, fostering a more innovative, creative, and entrepreneurial culture within the postsecondary community, and strategy 10.4, increasing opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct or assist in research. Interd isciplinary course offerings inspire students to cultivate innovative responses to problem solving in whatever f ield they are employed, wh ile the strong curricular emphasis on regional development equips them with knowledge par ticular applicable to the South and Kentucky. Southern Studies also directly addresses Objective 11 which see ks to expand regional part nerships, outreach and public services that improve the health and quality of life of Kentucky communities. With an emphasis on understanding the needs of the Ame rican South, most notably Ken tucky, it seeks to implement strategy 11.2, strengthening communication and planning between higher educati on and regional/community leaders. Southern Studies has added a qua rter of its curriculum to the W KU Colonnade Program, WKU's response to Objective 4.8 Strategic Agenda Objective, to promote the use of authentic assessments to evaluate student learning and provide data for pedagogical and curriculum review . c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) Aside from the transferable tech nical skills acquired by studen ts completing the Southern Studies minor, students also receive significant training in job skills related to cult ural competency or the ability to interact with others of varying cultural and community nor ms. Employers who are aware a nd appreciative of diversity can expand their clientele by providing goods and/or services in a way that effe ctively address the specific needs of a particular group or cohort. Empathy, active listening, and respectfulness are invaluable assets as businesses and government programs expand to service global and increasingly h eterogeneous populations. Kentucky is projected to experie nce substantial employment grow th totaling anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand new jobs in the areas of management, education, and of fice administration over the next five years. Southern Studies minors will be p oised to take advantage of the se opportunities because of the transferable skills they acquired while completing th e program's curriculum at WKU. Attesting to the high level of preparation of recent graduates who join the workforce is the fact that nearly seventy percent of students whose concentrations are centered in the liberal arts are employed one year after gr aduation. Research also indicates that as the graduates in Southern Studies or other liberal arts concentrati ons move from the entry le vel positions, which they may initially be offered, to rece iving in house promotions afte r acquiring specific job related work experience, most will also see their salaries increase by nearly 1/3 over t he next five years. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The Southern Studies minor at WK U is unique in that no other Ke ntucky college or university offers it as a concentration. Although Southern Studies is offered as a major, minor or concentration in over a dozen institutions of higher learning in the Southeast, the program a t WKU is the only one of its kind in the state where students can investigat e specifically southern history, society and culture. The Southern Studies program ser ves as an intellectual hub for faculty in many discip lines, and the program faculty's work is raising WKU's scholarly profile in this field . Over a dozen faculty, 75% of whom are fulltime and tenuretrack, contribute to the Southern Studies program. Over the past five years, these faculty have published over a dozen monographs, edited b ooks, journal articles and boo k chapters. They have appeared on television, radio and in film to discuss issues effecting the American Sout h such as Confederate memorials, Bluegrass music, local foodways and racial violence. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) In a recent national survey, emp loyers identified the top five critical skills that they sought in new employees which included the ab ility to clearly communicate, use interper sonal skills, demonstrate problemsolving abilities, process information, and organiz e projects. Students who minor in Southern Studies receive training in all of these areas through their interdis ciplinary coursework. Because the program does not have an established occupational trajectory that is recommended for its graduates, they emerge with a broad foundation of marketable skills applicable to a range of employment fields in areas such as business, communications, criminal justice, government service, e ducation, and social work. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) The liberal arts majors affiliate d with the Southern Studies mi nor seek to diversify their student bodies. Southern Studies classes attract diverse students and can help liberal a rts programs achieve this goal. Courses in Southern Studies accentuate the region's demographic diversity and in do ing so advance mission s. So far in working towards this goal, numerous cour ses in black southern history h ave been added to the program. These changes speak to the University's commitm ent to inclusiveness y as well as the growing recognition of the contributions of southerners from underrepresen ted or minority backgrounds. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National statistics confirm that the second largest number of d egrees conferred in the last five years were in the areas of social sciences and his tory. These fields make up the core disciplines in the Southern Studies minor. Furthermore, Southern Studies programs continue to find academi c homes in some of the region's top public and private institutions. Small to m idsize colleges and universiti es such as Mercer Univ ersity, the College of Charleston, and Appalachian Stat e University have programs in S outhern Studies that feed into regional leaders in the discipline including the University of North Carolina, Vand erbilt University, and the University of Mississippi, all of which house impressive graduate programs. Continuing the Southern Studies minor at WKU will help maintain the University's place as the state's sole provider of a Southern Studies concentration and maintain the research and intellectual momentum of the program's highlyprod uctive, committed faculty. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) In the last few years, in order to increase productivity, the S outhern Studies program has expanded its public outreach programs to address the contemporary issues that affec t both the South and larger American society. Such issues include the rise of white supremacist organizations , racial sensitivity and collective memory and symbolism surrounding the Civil War. In addition, the program has also approved for credit several s pecial topic courses related to the study of the South, yet not regularly offered by the University, in order to facilitate students' progress toward degree completion. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) In the next five years, the goal of Southern Studies is to incr ease the number of students in the program to five per academic year. In ten years, the program expects to consist ently maintain this projected enrollment and growth. In order to obtain this goal, minor course revisions ar e needed mostly in the area of expanded course offerings. Adding new courses such as HIST 325 Blacks in the Ci vil War and Reconstructi on and HIST 308 The Civil War in Film that align with South ern Studies is one strategy. O ther applicable courses such as those previously forming part of the now suspende d Kentucky Studies Certificate program, will likewise, attract new students. Another tactic is the creation of a 100 or 200 level introducto ry Southern Studies course, which combines interdisciplinary scholarship from related fields. Having a low er level required course that familiarizes students with the study of the South will consequently increase enrollme nt and progression in the program by offering opportunities to take required courses earlier in their collegi ate careers. e.

Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Spanish Program offers a major and Teacher Certification in Spanish, and an M AT in Education with an emphasis in Spanish. A second major or minor is required. A regular rotatio n of courses is offered on the WKU Main Campus in Bowling Green in addition to online and On Demand courses. Many studen ts of Spanish study abroad. W ith an increasing Hispanic population in the region, native and Heritage speakers of Spani sh who major in Spanish can place into intermediate and advanced courses and thus are abl e to complete the program in l ess time. The Spanish program offers students many opportunities to apply their language skills beyond t he classroom, primarily in service learning contexts, both here and abroad. In the advance d translation course students tr anslate materials for a variety of groups, including state and community agencies and local non profits. Students also interpr et at health clinics and other informative events. They tutor n onEnglish speakers in churches and afterschool programs. Although these activities are sponsored by other groups, in som e cases we have collaborated a nd Spanish faculty inform students about events and encourage them to take advantage of these opportunities to furt her develop their language skills and contribute to the community.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) Due to the nature of the Spanish Bachelor's Degree, students ne ed to have a minor or double major. The majority of our students tend to get double majors in Communication Disorders, Journalism, International Affair s, and International Business. The International Affairs major requires students to complete t hrough a 202 language course and International Business requires students to complete through a 201 language course. During the review period, 159 Spanish majors studied abroad in one of our numerous options of Spanishspeaking countries. Further, 45 studied abroad multiple times and in different loca tions. In addition, 220 univer sity students studied abroad on KIIS programs around the world, regardless of their majors. Ou r faculty involvement in running those programs, promoting them, and serving on the boa rd of directors is essential. The majority of those studen ts had majors in Biology, Photojournalism, International A ffairs, as well as other majors across colleges. Dual credit offerings are exten sive in different counties in ou r service region, allowing stude nts to earn college credits and then enter Spanish at a more advanced level. The Web and On Demand courses provide support to the completely online degrees as well as to working and nontraditional students. c.

Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Students are asked to demonstrate proficiency by interpreting a uthentic materials and/or p erforming tasks, thereby providing direct evidence of what they can do with the language at each course level, as pe r ACTFL proficiency levels (101:NM, 102: NH, 201202 ILIM). Spanish program assessments are g iven as exit exams to graduati ng seniors, in both oral and written form at the end the Fall and Spring semesters. The intended outcomes of the exit exams a re: Students will demonstrate an ab ility to analyze a literary text . Students will demonstrate oral a nd written competence in the la nguage, applying knowledge and training to address relevant concerns in the community. Students will demonstrate an ab ility to express their ideas abo ut relevant cultural topic s in the Hispanic world. Analyzing the results of the wri tten portion of the exit exams in order to improve program quality, the Spanish program implemented individual oral profi ciency interview s with Spanish majors and minors during the third and last year of their Spanish studies. The goal of th is assessment was to assist stud ents in determining their level of proficiency in Spanish at tw o different points of their Spanish studies in order to identify their oral communication stren gths and weaknesses, and then guide them in the use of specifi c communication strategies in o rder to reach higher profici ency levels. Also, Teacher Education students have the goal of reaching Advanced Low (ACTF L). c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The program fosters rapport between instructors and students, s uch that oral interviews conducted before graduationto assess the program and informal c ommunication through email and social media with alumni allo w faculty to incorporate this feedback as we revise established courses and plan new offering s and certificates. The 36credithour requirement for a major in Spanish, into which 3 to 9 credithours can be transfe rred from high school Spanish instruction, encourages our students to pursue an even more wellrounded education by earni ng a double or even triple major without postponing their graduation date. Furthermore, th eir demonstrated proficiency in Spanish and their understanding of Hispanic cultures qualify them to work for and with the local Hispanic population and to be better positioned for graduate studies or for the job market. The International Liaiso n for the City of Bowling Green , the WKU alumni database, and conversations with companies in the area indicate that our alumni work in many different fie lds, some of the most import ant being: 1) Education, Teaching, and Administration, 2) Business Admin istration/Manage ment & Marketing, 3) Medicine/Health & Nursing, 4) Communication, Public Relations , Publishing/Journalism/Writing, Radio/TV/Film, 5) Law, an d 6) Government & Public Services. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) In response to feedback on empl oyability, we have elevated the proficiency level of our students for all our majors and for those planning careers in educatio n, focusing on producing high er learning outcomes in inte rpersonal, presentational, interpretative, and intercultural communication in both oral an d written modes. We have also provided more exposure to the accents and cultural manifes tations of different areas of t he Hispanicworld. As a resu lt of conversations with professionals and executives fro m different companies in the ar eaparticularly Fruit of the Loom , the largest employer in the area, with manufacturing factori es in three Spanishspeaking co untrieswe have created a Spanish Business course covering how to write business letters, a pply for a job, ace an intervie w, and identify cultural differences in the workplace. We have also created experiential learni ng courses that provide student s with opportunities to serve their community while working with and learning from the Hispanic community and partnering wi th professionals to develop c reative problemsolving, teamwork, and leadership skills. I n response to requests from o ur students, alumni, educators, health and service providers, and businesses, we are developing a Certificate in Translation and Interpreting that will furt her strengthen o ur students' linguistic and cultural competen cy in their future professional practice. e.

(maximum 2 00 words) During the evaluation period, our program did not have any outs ide grants or contracts. However, the department did receive extra revenue from DELO for the On Demand SPAN 101 and SPAN 102, web courses SPAN 101 and SPAN 102, winter and summer term classes SPAN 101 and SPAN 102 (both facetofac e and web), as well as Dual Credit classes SPAN 101, 102, 201. Previous to the change in the Foreign Language requiremen t, winter and summer classes were always offered and filled. Our On Demand SPAN 101 and SPAN 102 enrolled between 2540 stud ents per class per semester. The requirement of demonstrating proficiency in a language at t he novice high level in the Colonnade Plan had meant that annually hundreds of students have taken SPAN 102 throughout th e majority of the review period, as it has been by far the most popular language. Therefo re, it was easy to fill our clas ses and accrue DELO revenue. Now that the requirement has changed, it will advers ely affect that stream of extra revenue. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) The Spanish Program generated nearly 3000 SCH in 201718. A lar ge proportion of the teaching staff were instructors. The high number of SCHP in service to the language requirement prov ided largely by instructors yiel ded a cost per SCH of $172. In December 2017, the language requirement was changed, and in spr ing 2018, the department lost two instructor positions. It now has 5 FTEF and 2 NTE. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Goal 2: Strategy 7: The requirement of demonstrating proficiency in a l anguage at the novice high level in the Colonnade Plan has meant that annually hundreds of students have taken Spanish 102 throughout the review period. Since all of our classes have cultural content and emphasize learning about and appreciating other groups, students from 101 on up have been increasing cultural competence. Internation al issues are intentionally inc orporated into all Spanish classes. Goal 3: Strategy 11: We engage in a number of high impact practices dai ly, as collaborative learning is central to building language production skills. Study abroad is central to our program, with the majority of majors taking advantage of these opportunities. We offer students opportunities to apply their l anguage skills interacting with the community by translating materials for community agencies and local nonprofits and inte rviewing Hispanic business professionals. Strategy 12: Courses required for Teacher Education students ar e scheduled in conjunction with their other requirements, including student teaching. Goal 3: Strategy 9: We collaborate with the MAT program to select stude nts and offer the Spanish courses they require. Goal 6: Strategy 18: Our alumni return t o campus to share their knowled ge and experiences with work opportunities and travel in other countries. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) This program contributed to College Readiness by adding LTCY 42 1 to its teacher certification program, enhancing future teachers' skills in teaching read ing and it addresses Goal 1 of a \"seamless, integrated\" system by aligning learning outcomes to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages pr oficiency standards and conduc ting outreach to K12 faculty on implementing these standards. It supports Goals 4 and 6 by p roficiency assessment at all levels. The Spanish program serves strate gic objectives 1.1, 2.5, and 8 .2: All of our classes have significa nt cultural content and emphas ize learning about and appreciating other groups. 2.5. Dual credit offerings are ex tensive in different counties, allowing students to earn college credits and then enter a language program at a more advanced level, working with 7 sch ools. 8.1. Students are asked to demonstrate proficiency by interpret ing authentic materials an d/or performing tasks, thereby providing direct evidence of what they can do with the language at each cours e level, as per ACTFL proficiency levels. 8.2. offers training and professio nal development to faculty on pedagogical topics and new uses of technology throughout the year, organizing workshops. Also, faculty partic ipates and presents in r egional, national and international workshop s and conferences. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) According to the Pew Research Center, Hispanic population growt h in the U.S. reached 56.6 million in 2015, with 6 out of 10 being 35 years or younger. This is reflected at the local level , where 16+% of the students at our Bowling Green City Schools are Hispanics. In general, 87% o f Hispanics often or sometimes speak Spanish at home, making it the country's secondmost spoken language. Langu age proficiency, communication skills, an d crosscultural competence are ranked as extremely valuable skills for jobs in the st ate of Kentucky and throughou t the country, particularly those in agriculture, manufacturing/businesses, servi ces, health, and the military. O ur Spanish majors gain the se skills in the classroom and through internships, service lea rning activities, workshops, an d study abroad, as they interact with Hispanics and learn both about them and from them. Confid ent in their lin guistic and aca demic skills, they are able to e nhance their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and get a foot in the door with a potential employer to \"test drive\" a ca reer. The discipline, the nature of our field, and our curricul um all foster the soft skills cited as most sought after by Kentuc ky's employers: strong work ethi c, creative problem solving, te am work, and leadership. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. ( maximum 200 words) One of the strengths of our program in comparison with UK and U ofL, is that our beginning through conversation classes are taught by fulltime faculty instead of graduate students, givin g our students the opportunity to work directly with their professors starting in the intro ductory levels. Being able to f oster strong academic relation ships between the beginning students and the professors builds a strong community and helps retain quality students. Faculty mentor majors and minors actively, providing information on scholarships, internships, o pportunities to teach abroad, and graduate school. The curricula of other state univ ersities are comparable to our s. However, we require a minimum grade of C in all the courses, which ensures that our majors and minors are better pr epared for advanced courses. Ours is the only progr am in the state to also offer the ARTC/MA T program, which provides opportunities for teachers already in the field with preparation in Spanish to complete their qual ifications to teach Spanish and fill a need at schools around t he state. To this end, a number of u pperlevel Spanish classes are offered as graduate courses, with additional requirements for graduate students. These participants in the graduate program e nrich the experience for undergraduates. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) Faculty are engaged in recruitin g events of all types,networkin g with Spanish teachers acro ss the state, and inviting prospective students to classes. T he department enhanced cultur al awareness through the annual Hatcher lecture series, Tracing the Unexplored, and Fulbright series, which presented o ver 15 free lectures on international cultures and communications. All of our classes in the Spanish Program have significant cult ural content and emphasize learning about and appreciating other groups. We participate in or sponsor discussion forums o f international films, prese ntations by national and international speakers, and othe r intercultural activities for students, faculty, and staff to learn more about different populations. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) We are currently developing a ce rtificate in Spa nish/English tr anslation, and investigating po ssible collaboration with other programs on certificates in Jour nalism, Legal Studies, Health C are, capitalizing on the varied other majors students pursue. These are all areas with a great deal of potential. We would like to increase opportunities for experiential learning through service learning courses or activities and internship o pportunities. Students request and the job market requires more community engagement and in ternship experiences. Another a ddition to recognize language skills under consideration is granting a Language Certificat e in Spanish (3 courses at the 200 and the 300 level to be determined). The development of other curricular options such as hybrid and online upperdivisi on courses is a possible area fo r future efforts, as well as sections restricted for Heritage and native speakers. Developme nt of more effective placement options to meet the needs of this growing population is also desirable. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Our program is in line with our b enchmark institutions in terms of number of hours and types of courses, including upper division special topics courses that focus on or emphasize such areas as translation, cultural studies and the media. Our offerings in study abroad and strong student participation are in keeping with national trends . At all levels of language courses we have integrated assessm ents that are evaluated using rubrics based on our national organization' s proficiency levels and descriptors. Students actively participate in artic ulating what they are able to do in the language at their level and identify how they can improve. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Growth in dual credit offerings makes it attractive for student s to major in Spanish at WKU, as they enter the program at a more advanced level, h aving already received credit for Spanish 102 or 201. Teachers at 7 schools have offered 69 sections of these classes. Four upperdiv ision courses have been added t o our offerings in the last 2 ye ars, giving students a wider variety of selections and facilit ating their completing the maj or or minor in a timely fashion. Phonetics, in addition to pro ving popular with students, will provid e further preparation in oral production. Spanish 381 is now offered regularly as a bridge course to better prepare studen ts for upperdiv ision courses an d it appears to be contributing to student success. The faculty's active engagement in a nd support of study abroad also aids students in making timel y progress toward the degree. Often shortterm summer or winte r options make it possible for students to complete Spanish c ourses that may be difficult to fit in with other major requi rements during a regular semest er while semester options a llow them to concentrate on Spanish courses and make consider able progress. Faculty have d irected and taught on several programs in the past 3 years. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We would expect the number of majors to continue to grow, as it has in the last 5 years. The majority of our students enter with dual credit, AP, CLEP credits, thus allowing them to enter the program at a more advanced level. As we develop relationships with other program s, we will attract students wit h certificates in some of the areas listed above, as these opportunities will enhance student s' abilities to apply their S panish skills in a variety of wo rk settings. We anticipate continuing to have Teacher Educa tion students wh o will fill the critical need for instructors in the region. We are always working to increas e study abroad, as it is a vita l part of our program, and we would like to see a 15% increase in student participation. Funding is an impediment, as our dep artmental scholarship resources are minimal. In order to offer more internships, the department would need t o provide a course release t o establish and sustain the connections in the community; create the academic curriculum; s upervise and work with the partner organizations or businesses and the students.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The Graduate Certificate in TESO L is unique because it trains f uture public school teachers and adult educators to understand the process of second language acquisition and the needs of Eng lish language learners; deliver s evidencebased, quality instruction in both academic and nonacad emic English; assesses students' progress and their own instructional approaches; assists students' adaptation to t he various cultures of the Uni ted States and abroad; and engages in state, regional, and national professional development. The mix of delivery methods (i.e ., facetoface day and evening courses, IVS, and online) dem onstrates our flexibility for students pursuing degrees that re quire extensive and intensive field placements, as well as tho se who work offcampus jobs. All students must maintain a 3.0 GPA to enter and complete the program. Those holding undergraduate degrees in any subject are eligible to apply. Students typically pursue the ce rtificate while they are completing another graduate program. Those holding public school certification in any subject are el igible for the Kentucky P12 ESL Endorsement upon successful completion of the certific ate and the TESOL Praxis.

In what ways does the program contributeto other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The majority of ESL teachers in Warren County and Bowling Green public schools graduated from our program. Over 10% of Warren County is foreignborn, and many of their Americanborn children are English learner s (ELs). In 2018, the EL population in Kentucky's public s chools increased to almost 30, 000. There are 4 million ELs in schools nationwide. Our graduates also include several ESLI teachers, and ESL teach ers at Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College. Students from several different graduate programs participate i n the certificate an d/or take courses in this program. Individuals from adult education, English, elementary education , secondary education, and the doctorate in educational leadership are some of the programs from which we have received students. In addition, one course\u2014English 565 Integrated TESL\u2014is required for graduate students in the E nglish Departmen t, and students from a number of departments take our courses are electives. Most sign ificantly, the s ame courses are required for those pursuing the ESL Endorsement at the graduate level. Thus, the enrollment numbers above do not reflect the number of students in our courses. For example: In spring 2018, English 565 had 10 stude nts, one of whom was enrolled in the Gr aduate Certificate in TESOL. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) This program also contributes to training in WKU offices and th e wider Bowling Green community. Dr. Alison Youngblood received two PROYECTA grants, which paid for STEM majors from M exican universities to receive English languag e instruction at WKU. Dr. Youngblood is the liaison to the Japanese Consulate for the JET Program, and organized workshops for the FranklinSimpson Literacy Center . Dr. Trini Stickle works with DELO to develop autism and dem entia workshops for faculty. Dr. Alex Poole carries out trainin gs with the Onyx Job Corps to equip teachers to help second language learners. Dr. Elizabeth Winkler supervises the Honors Major in Linguistics. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data Provided by IR 201314 N % FirstYear Retention Rate 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 100% 0 N/A 3.73 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Our learning outcomes are primarily based on the teaching stand ards developed by TESOL, the flagship organization for Teaching English as a Second Lan guage. Specific areas assessed include (1) Language : Students understand language structures and apply them to the classroom; (2) Instruction: Planning and Implementation : Students use standards, methods, materials, and technology to meet students' content and languag e needs; (3) Culture: Students show awareness of culturally appropriate instruction; (4) Assessment : Students understand, implement, and reflect appropriate types of assessment; (5) Professionalism and Leadership : Students reflect on themselves as teachers and their effectiv eness and consider professional development plans. Three pieces of information are used to obtain this information in ENG 471G (TESL Practicum), which is also the final and culminating experience w ithin the minor: (1) Research paper : Students write, expand, and revise one paper started in another class (English 565 or 407G). (2) Teaching Observation : During one period, student s present a lesson in their respective classrooms. In order to ensure that they are aware o f the importance of the standard s to cover, strive to do so, and reflect on their use of those standards, we have them first turn in a lesson. We then ask them to carry out the lesson, after which they complete a refl ection on the experience. (3) Critical Reflection : Students reflect on th e success with which they have carried out instruction, assessed their students, and generally met their students' needs. Students also discuss professional development plans. The development of this multicl ass paper and the associated ru bric significantly improved professional expectations of academic writing. During the 20 152016, we developed a rubric b ased on thick descriptions of previous research papers. This process involved discussing expe ctations, resolv ing differences , clarifying definitions, and differentiating realistic vs. unrealistic expectations. The res ulting rubric has helped guide our principles and parameters for papers in coursework. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) First, we assess our yearly Prax is II (TESOL) results. Our pass rate has been 100% for close to a decade, which is exceptional given that (a) Kentucky has the highest minimum passing score i n the country and (b) we don't have a full degree in the subject. Second, we discuss students' performance with supervis ors (e.g., public school teacher s and program coordinators). Finally, we keep in contact with individual students. Those qua lified to teach in Kentucky public schools always find employment. This is not only becau se there is a critical shorta ge of ESL teachers in Kentucky (and in Warren County, in particular), but also because our students can pass the Praxis II and because we have the most hourintensive program for public school teachers in the state. Other students have gained employment at ESLI on campus, SKYCTC, and abroad. Reviewers should note that gradua tes also often pursue careers in their majors, such as secondary foreign language and English, middle grades language a rts, and elementa ry education, among others. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) We look at Praxis II (TESOL) resu lts to ensure our students hav e met requirements for teaching in public schools. Fortunately, our pass rate has been 100% for close to a decade. We have used the students' results on specific subscores to make curricular improvements. For exam ple: The most numerically sign ificant portion of the exam consists of theoretical and applied linguistics, both of wh ich require knowledge of phonolo gy, morphology, and syntax . Several years ago, some students' scores reflected diffic ulties with these areas. As a result, we decided to require a basic grammar and/or linguistic s class as a prerequisite to our c ore linguistics course, English 407G Linguistic Analysis. Doing so allows us to assume a certa in baseline level of disciplinary kn owledge and to cover Praxisre lated topics more in depth. We also discuss current and future students' performance with s upervisors (e.g., public sch ool teachers and program coordinators). LoriAnn Martin, current ESL coordinator at Warre n County Public Schools, informed us that incoming teachers need to be more knowledgeable about a battery of placement and progress tests called the WI DA. They also need to know more about embedded instruction. As a result, we have incorpora ted units relating to both in English 471G TESL Practicum. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) We cannot stress enough how remar kable our gradua tes are. As st ated before, many students acquire jobs in public schools and adult education programs. We want to reiterate that the cla sses in our program are taken by many students in other programs, thus the enrollment numbers don't reflect actual cour se enrollments. 4.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) DELO revenue has been generated by creating online sections of English 565 (Integrat ed TESL) and English 5 66 (Teaching and Testing ESL Grammar). We have br ought revenue to the university through the PROYECTA grant (see 2 PROGRAM PRODUCTIVITY for more information). Our students have interned and later worked for Warren County Public Schools, Bowling Green City Schools, the I nternational Center of Bowling Green, ESLI at WKU, and Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College. We have a lso hosted several experts to a ssist current students and teac hers in the community become better educators. These include Dr. Kathleen BardoviHarlig (In diana University: Pragmatics); Dr. Kouider Mokhtari Education and ESL). What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) *To estimate costs, we combined SCHP for the MA program and the TESL Certificate since coursework supporting the programs is basically the same, w ith the number of credit hours for each program being the primary difference. **We disagree with data for med ian class size and underenrolle d sections because combined graduate and undergraduate courses don't appear to have been considered and WKU had been o perating at a significantly lower graduate course cap before the new number was retroactively put into place. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) The TESL program exceeds WKU's st rategic plan by preparing our students for the global stag e and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. First, we train current public school te achers seeking endorsement in TESL and every future teachers attending WKU in methods of lan guage instructio n or English as a second language pedagogy. Doing so, our graduates are competitive for numerous employment opportunities, both nationw ide and globally (\"Preparation Students for the Global Stage\" 7). Secondly, our students become welleducated citizenr y by acquiring linguistic met hods which promote diversity and equity since the TESL curriculum is built upon the premise that all language varie ties and the speakers of those languages are equal (\"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" 7). Such training allows our graduates to perpetuate these perspectives within their own classrooms. As a result , the quality of life in South Central Kentucky for all residents\u2014natural born, immigrants, refugeeis elevated (\"Quality of Life\" 15). In turn, our stude nts are prepared and prepare their students to 1) continue learning, 2) invest in the future, 3) advance partnerships loca lly and beyond, and 4) cultivate new ideas and bu sinesses that benefit our state, nation, and globe (\"Continuing Education\" 15 ; Investing in t he Future 16). b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) The English Depar tment's TESL minor serve s the five objectives of WKU's Strategic Agenda well. First, TESL courses promote diversity and foster inclusive c limates within and outside our campus by introducing students to empiricallybased research supporting the equality of languages, language users, and the c ulture of all language speakers (Goal 1, 1.11.4). Secondly, th e TESL minor is completed, most of ten, by prospective teachers or current teachers seeking the TESL endorsement, so we are an integral part of Kentucky's P12 teacher training program at the baccalaureate and Master's degree levels (Goal 2, 2.1 2.8).With the training we provide, we, in effect, contribute to the postsecondary education of our students' students, creating appreciation for and advocacy of equality (Goals 1.1, 1.3). Likewise, many of ou r students are members of underserved populations: minorities, immigrants and refugees, f irst generation college stude nts, of lower socioeconomic status. Our course content validates the language and cultural differences that set the members of underserved populations apart from the mainstream (Goal 3, 3.13.5). Lastly, the TESL m inor and its courses afford via ble careers (e.g., teaching, translating, social and health pr ofessions serving nonnative p opulations) which, in turn, better secure our graduates the ability to afford postsecondary e ducation (Goals 4 and 5). c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) As has been mentioned several times in this document, we are th e primary supplier of English l anguage teachers in the area. The Kentucky Department of Educa tion has documented that there is a critical shortag e of English languag e teachers in the following Local Workface Areas (LWAs): Barren, Bluegrass, Green River, Kentuckian Works, Lincoln Trail, and Northern Kentucky. According to the Migra tion Policy Institute (MPI), th ere were 154, 172 foreign born Kentuckians in 2016 compared to 78, 432 in 2000. The website Coloring Colorado reports that Kentucky public schools have experienced a tremendous increase in the population of En glish language learners: \"As of the 201213 school year, Kentucky's schools were home to more than 20,000 English language learners (ELLs), which marks a 219% increase from the 20022003 school year (Migration Policy Institute, 2015) . Currently, the most common five langua ges spoken by ELLs in Kentucky are Spanish, Arabic, Somali, Chinese, and Japanese.\" In Warren County Public Schools and Bow ling Green City Schools, over 50 languages are spoken. It is clear that the skills we impart a nd the careers for which we pr epare our students are in great demand locally and across the state. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) The mix of delivery methods (i.e ., facetoface day and evening courses, IVS, online, trave ling to regional campuses) demonstrates our flexibility for students pursuing degrees that require extensive and intensive field placements, as well as those who work offcampus jobs. In terms of reputation, our pro gram is known throughout the state, as is WKU, for turning out the best teachers. The program coordinator regularly receiv es phone calls and emails from principals and curriculum coordinators requestin g graduates to fill teaching positions. O ur faculty are also regularly asked to serve on Fulbright committees, doctoral dissertations, and editorial boards signif icant to our fields. We also v isit area schools and community groups to talk about t he needs of En glish language learners. Fo r example: Dr. Alex Poole has gi ven talks to Latino students at Greenwood High School about the i mportance of maintaining one's Spanish language proficienc y while also lea rning English. He is also in the process of per sonally helping the child of Al banian refugees apply to WKU a nd seek the Cherry Presidential Scholarship. This individual has an unusually strong high schoo l record, yet cannot receive help from his nonEnglish speaking parents. Without Dr. Poole's help, he most likely would have go ne to community college or immediately started working for his father following graduation. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) As said above, the ESL program is extremely cost efficient beca use of the overlap with several programs. Students from several different graduate programs participate in the certific ate and/or take some of our co urses. Most significantly, the same courses are required for th ose pursuing the ESL Endorsemen t at the graduate level. Fac ulty also teach all general education courses in t he Department of Eng lish, various courses in the undergraduate Eng lish program, and in the undergraduate TESL program. The faculty regularly publish in pe erreviewed journals and present at international conferences. Several faculty mem bers have already published boo ks and another has one under contract. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) During the last two years, we have reached out to colleagues in various fields (e.g., business, criminology, nursing, social work) in order to recruit student s. While these areas are not t eaching per se, they can benefit from the skills gained in our program (e.g., intercultural competence, knowledge of immigrant communities, awareness of glo balization). Typically, these students are undergraduates, yet we stress that they may pursue the Graduate Certificate in TESOL following completion of their undergraduate program. We intend to continue these outrea ch efforts. We would like to initiate outreach efforts to specific graduate programs, as well. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) Directly comparing enrollment tr ends to our program enrollment is misleading for two reasons. F irst, our program has always had small numbers. Second, the vast majority of students who ta ke courses required for the Graduate Certificate in TESOL program are enrolled in other programs (e.g., ESL Endorsement, MAEnglish). c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Our assessment has revealed that we need a standalone assessmen t course. While we integrate a ssessment into our courses, the weight of placement tests an d other standardized tests, in addition to the large number o f assessment questions on the Praxis II, necessitate an entire course. Due to curricular free zes, we have not taken a proposal through the curricular proces s. Finally, we have become active sp eakers on linguistics and ESL at WKU and within the wider community. For example: Dr. Trini Stickle has spoken to reli gion classes about the role of linguistics in textual analysis. She has also visited sociology classes to talk about various issues rel ated to linguistic s and sexuali ty and sexual abuse. These are i n addition to the recruitment talks we engage in each se mester discussed in 6a. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonablytake to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) We would like to double the number of TESOL students. We need m ore opportunities to talk to incoming graduate students to attract them to our program. Many are simply not aware we ex ist until it is too late to complete the program. We need affordable tuition rates and financial aid which allows students the time to devote to study. When students have to work 3040 hours weekly, they lac k sufficient time for study. I n addition, students have few opportunities for graduate and teaching assistantships. This lack of financial s upport makes o ur program less competitive. Another impediment is WKU's la ck of focus in mission, which hop efully this CAPE process will help us address. This lack creates a situation in which facu lty are obligated to teach 4 c lasses per semester, engage in ma ny hours of service, take on administrative tasks, advise, a nd research. This fosters a cult ure based on fulfilling shortte rm goals and within which makes generating a longterm vision impossible. It likewise creates a sense of being constantly overwhelmed and behind, yet always asked to do more. Coupled with lack of raises and the reduction of benefits, this state of affai rs breeds mistrust, resentment , and a sense of unpredictability that stymies necessary risks an d innovation, both of which cannot come from an increasingly small budget. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) The AB in Theatre is designed to provide students with a flexib le, comprehensive overview of theatre practice. Students receive a solid grounding in sc ript analysis, performance, tech nical theatre and design, and theatrical history and literature . They may use their elective hour s to pursue indepth study in o ne or more of these areas. C lasses combine uptodate scholarship in the field with direct handson practice, and mos t culminate in showcases or portfolio presentations that concretely demonstrate the skills learned. Students also take a t least four hours of performance and production labs earned working directly on departmental productions. The degree requir es 45 credit hours and does no t have selective criteria for admission, although all majors par ticipate in regular juries to assess their overall progress in the program. Departmental advisors also work closely with each student to help them craft a course of study that will best meet their individual career aspirations. WKU is an accredited member of the National Associ ation of Schools of Theatre ( NAST) and the BA is fully compatible with its standards. T his degree requires a minor or second major, making it an ideal path for s tudents wanting to explore multiple academic fields.

For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) The Theatre AB is an important part of the cultural environment of the campus and community. Last year, Theatre & Dance provided 90 individual performances of 32 different works, serv ing an audience of around 11,000. The department produces a very wide range of material in cluding Shakespeare, musicals, children's theatre, new works, and plays. This includes on campus performances for school groups, and a show which tours t o elementary schools. Any W KU student may audition. All courses offered in this Thea tre AB program are also offered as part of the BFA in Performing Arts Program, the Theatre Minor, and the Musical Theatre Minor. Acting (PERF 101) and Act ing for the Camera (THEA 303) serve the Film BA, and Film Studies Minor. Theatre in Education (THEA 325) and Play Product ion in the Schoo ls (THEA 425) support t he BA in English and Allied Language Arts degree. Theat re in Diversion (PERF 362) wa s created in partnership with the Sociology department, and provides Theatre and Criminology students the opportunity to wo rk with juvenile offenders, conduct original research, and lead creative projects. This fall, the Theatre Program offered 12 sections of Colonnade classes, with a total of 444 students, including over 50 in Connections courses. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Theatre AB complies with all NAST standards. Faculty and students are also active in the Southea stern Theatre Conference, the Kentucky Theatre Association, the Midwest Theat re Auditions, the Unified Pro fessional Theatre Auditions, where student work is adjudicate d, and students have the opport unity to seek professional inte rnships. Program students may also participate in a showcase for graduating seniors each year in New York where they audition for a panel of agents, managers, and casting directors. The program has a very strong trackrecord of success through these events. Dozens of students are engaged in internships each summer and many gradua tes go directly into professio nal theatre employment. 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a. Data by IR 201314 Rate 7 57.1% 23 73.9% 13 92.3% 13 20 4.39 b. List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) The Theatre AB meets all NAST standards for student learning ou tcome assessment and periodic program review. Departmentspecific Student Learning Outcomes can be found here. Routine departmental progr amlevel assessment of this degree program is conducted through a Jury/Portfolio Review (JP R) process, and department level review of production work, coursework, and adjudication results. Theatre AB students meet with all members of the Theatre faculty at three points during their time at WKU, where they are provided constructive, individualized feedback aimed at maximizing their full potential for success after graduation. The results of these as sessments are also compiled and used to monitor the effectiveness of the program and identify areas for program imp rovement. Student scholarly and creative work are regularly adjudicated by program faculty and are also frequently presente d for adjudication at regional and national professional conferences. Results of this adj udication process are also used to maintain the quality and ef fectiveness of the program. This most recent JPR, conducted d uring finals week in December 2018, suggests that despite a shortage of faculty, we are continuing to meet our program student learning outcomes. Feedb ack generated through JPR in past semesters, along with feedback from theatre professiona ls reporting on emerging trend s in theatre practice, has suggested we incorporate more opportunities to create new works as part of the program. As a result, we have added a biannual New Works Festival to our mainstage series, and are now offering a Plays in a Day event every semester. We are also producing a new play, Aglaonike's Tiger, as part of our spring 2019 mainstage series and have invited the playwright to campus a s a visiting guest artist. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) As a smaller program where student s work closely with faculty f or long hours in the studio an d classroom, it is common for faculty and students t o stay in close contact for many years af ter graduation. The Theatre AB program utilizes a number of methods to informally gather feedback from alumni, including se veral Theatre & Dance Alumni Facebook groups, an annual alumni reunion in New York, an oncampus alumni reunion every f ive years. Faculty also regular ly communicate with alumni via email. In a field where most jobs are shortterm, it is dif ficult to generate employment data comparable to other fields. AB in Theatre graduates follow a number of different paths after g raduation. Some choose to p ursue professional work in theatre, film, or television. Som e go on to gradua te training, and some go into other fields. E xamples of AB Theatre alumni activities since 2013 include: Nate Hovee (Flight Attendant, Qa tar Airways), Susan Creech (D evelopment Officer, Actors Theatre of Louisville), Jessica Gr aham (Public Relations Specia list, University of Texas Theatre ), Eric Mattingl y (Stage Manag er, New York City), Samya Monem (Gra duate degree in L ibrary Science ), Chandler Smith (Associate Producer, Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center), Kelly McGee (Sta ge Manager, Seattle), Colin Wa ters (Actor, Charles ton Stage Company). d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Theatre faculty stay in close contact with entertainment indust ry professionals and are conti nually adapting the AB Theatre program to changes in the field. This feedback is gathered at p rofession conferences such as SETC and UPTA where student work is adjudicated by employers, and at events organized by th e department such as our New York Showcase. Most of the program faculty continue to wo rk professionally themselves, and maintain a close relationsh ip with employers. A good example of this process was at our most recent New York Showcas e on 1/5/19 where 8 graduating seniors (3 AB Theatre, 4 BFA Performing Arts, 1 Theatre minor) performed before a panel of six major New York agents a nd casting directors. After the performance, the panelists p rovided an hour of detailed fee dback. Casting Director Michael Cassara provided an additional hour of audition work shop with the st udents. Program faculty took detailed notes th at will be used to fine tune training in future years. While feedback was overwhelmingly pos itive, faculty noted the need for additional coursework in film and television acting as career opportunities continue to grow in this area, as emphasized by industry professional at th e showcase. The program will now pur sue additional faculty in thi s area to respon d to this need. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Theatre program makes a very concerted effort to keep reten tion high and boost the su ccess of incoming students. These efforts include a Universit y Experience class required of all department majors and team taught by department faculty. Each freshman is also assigned a student mentor from their prog ram. Each freshman student also meets with the full department faculty at the end of their fall semester. At that t ime faculty makes sure they ar e on track with coursework, answer any questions they have, and discuss solutions for any c hallenges they are facing. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

This is due to the fact that curriculum between all Theatre an d Dance degrees is so tightly interwoven. b. What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buy out time, philanthropic p otential, DELO revenue, corporateuniversity partnerships, and economic development rel ationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college, and/or university. (maximum 200 words) Theatre & Dance funds its extensive production series entirely through ticket sales. WKU provides no funding to support our shows, typically b udgeted at around $55,000 annually. The d epartment operates the Fine Arts Box Office in order to do this. Our annual budget is well below the average of benchma rk programs of a similar size. It is also highly unusual for a program of our size to be unsubsidized by their instituti on. Significant department resources must be dedicated to marketing department productions, straining personnel. Program faculty and students are frequent recipients of RCAP, QTAG FUSE, and student travel grants. The department also gener ates production revenue through individual and corporate sponsorships. The Theatre program has been fortunate to have recently recei ved two significant philanthropic gifts. The Theatre Program is one of five to be s upported annually from the $10 million Jerry Baker Endowment. We are also scheduled to receive a future estate gif t from Dick Frockt of an endowed professorship. The Theatre in Diversion program has been completely grant funded f or the past seven years, and received a $15,000 grant from the WKU Sisterhood in addition to receiving $1000 through the WalMart Community Foundation. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Please note, the department typically offers 25 practicums (pro duction labs, performance labs, ensemble performance courses) every semester, compr ising roughly 29% of the total nu mber of courses. These pract icums are not included in teaching loads and are taken by students as part of their parti cipation in productions. Enro llments in these are typically quite small, 1 to 5 students, and significantly skew the median class size and underenrolled sections data above. NAST guidelines range from 12 to 20. After removing practicums from the equation, the average siz e of upper level courses in the Theatre Program is 15. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) A sample of Strategic Plan objec tives addressed by the Theatre AB Program: \"Provide opportunities for peopl e of the region to be educated, entertained, assisted, and inspired outside the classroom.\" The Theatre Program is a significa nt part of the cultural lands cape, providing entertainment and educational opportunities for a total audience of around 11,000 every year. \"Work with regional K12 and Com munity College educational syst ems to provide educational opportunities through outreach\" The Theatre Program provides per formances and wo rkshops to loca l schools, typically servi ng around 20 schools and over 3,000 K12 st udents per year. \"Facilitate high impact practice s, immersive learning in differ ent cultures, processlearning practices, and collaborative learning and instructional opportunities.\" The Theatre Program utilizes bes t practices to provide immersiv e, processlearning practic es. Much of the learning takes place in the studio and on the stage. Students develop ex tensive resumes, support ed by instruction from professors and guest artists. \"continue to expand offcampus and oncampus educational opport unities.\" The Theatre Program offers an annual study away program in New York City and/or London. This year, over thirty students and alumni are participating. \"Through the Colonnade Program . . . provide common intellectua l experiences and highimpact practices to develop hard and soft skills as well as to cultiv ate good, producti ve citizens.\" The Theatre Department offers the Connections courses Culture a nd Performance, Period Styles of Design, and Theatre Appreciation. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics. (maximum 200 words) Strategy 1.1., The Theatre Program increases cultural competenc e among students, staff, and faculty at WKU through its many productions which focus on diversity and inclusion. Strategy 8.1, The Theatre AB Pro gram has developed an intensive and effective advising and jury process to ensure the steady progress of its majors to ward graduation, and to continu ally measure the effectiveness of the program's learning outcomes, curriculum, and prepar ation of its majors for graduat e training or work in the field. Strategy 8.2, The Theatre AB fac ulty are actively engaged in co ntinual training as well as sch olarly and professional work to ensure their teaching is effectiv e, timely, and of the highest professional standards. Strategy 10.5., The Theatre AB h elps foster an innovative, crea tive and entrepreneurial culture at WKU and in the region through its many theatre productions, workshops, scholarly pres entations, and Colonnade courses. c. How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) KY Workforce data suggests a 23% increase in demand for \"arts, design, entertainment\" professio nals over the next five years in the 27county service area. National data from the Bureau of Statistics forecasts a 12% inc rease in demand for actors, directors and producers nationally over the next decade. Multim edia artist demand should r ise by 8% over the decade. Clearly, most employment opport unities in these fields are not in the WKU service area, and a significant percentage of AB Theatre graduates go on to career s in a wide array of fields. T hose who stay within the service region typically go into education, tourism, or arts admi nistration. Beyond theatre spec ifically, the skills we emphasiz e - including collaboration, creative problem solving, effective deadline management, and co mmunication skills -prepare students to work in a wide range of sectors anticipating future demand in Kentucky. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation. Discuss contribution to student/faculty/staff diversity, DELO cohort co mponent, regional campus impact, and other factors as appropriate. (maximum 200 words) WKU is one of only 36 universitie s in the nation accredited in all four arts areas: theatre, dance, music, and art and design. The WKU Theatre Progra m has a strong regional and national repu tation. For example, in 2015, Onstage Blog ranked WKU #6 in a list of the 10 most underrat ed theatre colleges in the Mid west. When polled, incomin g program freshmen report choosing WKU over institutions su ch a Point Park, Elon, Savanna h School of Art and Design, NKU, University of Cincinnati, U of L, UK, MTSU, Belmont, University of Michigan, Ball State, Ho fstra, and the American Academy of Music and Drama. The average incoming ACT is 25. The program is unique in the number of handson learning experi ences it offers. In 20172018, we produced 90 total performances of 32 individual wo rks, creating 797 onstage roles and 1040 backstage jobs for students. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) The Theatre Program very activel y recruits. Faculty not only pa rticipate in all WKU recruitmen t events such as Head for the Hill, but they also travel to eve nts such as the Governor's Sch ool for the Arts /Youth Performin g Arts High School College and career Day Audition/Interviews, the Kentucky Thespian Festival College Day and Auditions, the Southeastern Theatre Conference Auditions/Interviews, and the summer GSA College Fai r. The department also holds an audition/interview day every spring which brings dozens of prospective students to cam pus. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) While interdisciplinary connecti ons currently exist with film, music, and pop culture, those cou ld certainly be strengthened and developed further. These areas c onnect to the emphasis on p erformance that is obviously k ey to our Theatre program. As performers and technicians in creasingly move between fields, this will be increasingly benefi cial not only to our students but to students in those other majors as well. Further interdis ciplinary connections could be made with community and diversity studies. Theatre is known for helping audiences empat hize across categories of difference, and cultural competency is key to the work we do. There are efficiencies to be gained w orking with these other programs sharing curriculum, faculty, resources, and marketing. Looking at national trends and benchm ark programs, there is evidence that a strong relationship between theatre and film would enhance the attractiveness of bo th programs, increasing enrollment. The major impediment to the continued growth is lack of commens urate growth in faculty and staff to match past increases in student enrollments. Lack of funding to support production a ctivities is also a major concern. The program has recently begun offering students work as standa rdized patients for the new UK Medical School. This effort is being supervised by a faculty member receiving no additional co mpensation or load reduction. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) National enrollment trends in th e visual and performing arts ha ve fallen somewhat over the last 5 years, after rising to a pea k around 2012. Theatre AB Program enrollments dipped in 2017/2018 . This is not unexpected and aligns with WKU enrollment trends and statistics regarding high school graduates in Kentuc ky. However, indications of future recruitment opportunities are good. Continued interest from prospective students during t he fall 2018 semester brought an average of two students and their families to campus per week to visit the program. Ove rall, the department is quite healthy. In fact, the WKU Theatre Program is the 14th larges t accredited, pu blic, undergr aduateonly theatre program in the US. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three years to increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) The Theatre AB Program made a num ber of curricular revisions ov er the past three years to ensure the coursework best meets the needs of our students: Ensemble and practicum credits are now offered in both 1 credit and .5 credit versions to better suit the needs of particular shows. This is now beginning to increase the overall SCHP of our department. Menu options in the area of Theatre History and Theory were bro adened to avoid enrollment bottlenecks and ensure students could progress through the degree in a timely f ashion. Connections courses Period Styles in Design (THEA 323) and Cult ure and Performance (THE A 341) were added as electives in the major. The department has increased recruitment efforts in recent year s. The Potter College Creative Arts Scholarship has become an increasingly important elemen t of the recruitment process, p roviding scholarship support to 27 incoming students in the most recent year. The faculty ar e increasingly using email and social media to communicate w ith prospective students. d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) The program has strong prospects for continued growth in presti ge and enrollment, should resources be made available to support such efforts. The departm ent recently lost an instructo r/costume shop manager positio n (nonetheless incorporated in data above) which must be restored in order to maintain our production series. We are also short faculty in the areas of acting and history/theory/dramaturgy. A new acting instructor w ould allow us to solidify our relationship with the Film Program. Current faculty are regularly teaching overloads to su pport the acting curriculum. In fact, reliance on parttime instructors to teach lower level courses significantly skews th e data regarding FTF SCHP production here. Our sole theatre history and theory faculty membe r is also regularly teaching ov erloads. A second faculty member in this area would be necessary to support any enrollment increase. The department al so lost an instructor line in te chnical theatre several years ago and this position needs replacement to support enrollment i n the technical theatre programs. e. What recommendation would you put forward for the program (c heck one)? Grow/Enhance (Significant s trategic potential exists) Maintain (Core or important complementary program) Transform (Redesign/combine/reorient) Suspend (Teach-out may be required) Department/School: Art Arts Degree Type (AB, BS, etc.): BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) STEM+H Degree (Y/N) N Minimum Hours Required: 73 (studio concentration); 79 (graphic design concentration) List Concentrations (if any): Studio; Graphic Design 1. PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Accredited by NASAD, the BFA in Visual Arts (514) is a professional degree, with co ncentrations in Graphic Design and Studio. Students are prepared for professional employment i n the visual communication, design, and fine arts industries; for further study at the graduate level in visual a rt or graphic design; and fo r developing an individual, professional, design or studio practice. Course requirements include labbased studio courses with 5:20 contact hours per week (80%), lectures and seminars in art history (20%), a nd a Capstone course. No additi onal specific courses outside the department are required. The degree is geared towards full and part time stude nts on the main campus. Based on pedagogical best practices, studio courses are deliver ed facetoface. Art history courses are delivered facetoface and online. To assi st with timely degree progressi on, studio and art history courses are offered in every DELOadministered term. Faculty regularly lead studyabro ad courses, and students often take advantage of study abroad opportunities origina ting outside of the Departmen t. The program has selective admi ssion. Students may enter the 514 by earning a minimum GPA in introductory art courses or via portfolio review. Students not meeting these req uirements have the option of pursuing the department's 509 degree, a path wh ich most in this situation ch oose.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) All faculty in Art teach courses necessary for all three majors . All courses comprising th e 509 studio concentration (49 hours) are a subset of the larger and more focused 514 BFA Visual Arts degree (73 or 79 hours depending upon concentration), making the de partment both efficient and p roductive. One studio course from 509/ 514 is required for the 613 (Art History). 514 courses comprise 100% of the Computer Animation minor, 75% of the Graphic Design minor, and 100% of the studio art minor. 86% of students in these minors have a major outside of the Art Department, illustrating the department's curricular support t o nonart majors across campus . Program foundations courses are often taken by Interior Design and Fashion Merchandising majors to cover a core requirement of their progra m, and by Architectural Manufac turing Sciences students as an approved elective. IDFM majors routinely take art history survey courses as a component of their studies. Four program courses are part of the Colonnade , two in the Explorations and two in the Connections category. As the 514 program is l arge (73 or 79 hours), the SCHP produced by this program alone is 2.5 times the university median . c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) To assist students with progressi on towards degree, the departm ent officially revised the BFA curriculum (effective Fall 2018) to reduce p rogram requirements from 81 cr edits to 73 or 79, dependi ng on concentration, a change falling within accreditation guidelines. Studio classes are intensive, meeting for twice the number of s tandard contact hours (5:20 hours per week). Their smaller class sizes, mandated by NASAD and based on safety and appropriate pedagogy, are balanced by larger SCHP art history and art appreciation lecture courses. Art appreciation is a service course, therefore its SCHP is not captured in progra m cost / SCH (Q 4). 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) SLOs for Art's professional de gree, the BFA. Students will: 1. Develop a broad understanding of visual arts history and an ind ividual art or design practice focused in one or more specific media. 2. Be competitive candidates for employment in the visual communic ation, design and arts industries and/ or for further study at the graduate level in visual arts/ graphic design; create a profe ssional, active, studio/ design practice. 3. Develop a robust individual art istic voice evidenced through th e creation of a cohesive body of work. 4. Learn and demonstrate appropri ate professional practices. 5. Develop the ability to effectivel y communicate through visual, oral and written means. In their final semester, student s in 514 (both concentrations) create a portfolio of their art / design work and writing. For program assessment, department faculty and outside experts evaluate portfolios on design competency, technique, creativit y, level of craft, and writing ability. The department noted in a previo us APR that students fell short of goals measuring writin g ability, with fewer than 70% achieving a score of \"3\" on a 5point scale. The department developed a Capstone co urse to provide more focus on writing. Recent review s of writing samples have illust rated a marked rise in achievement. c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) The department has recently form alized what has been a successf ul informal method of ma intaining contact with alumni. Because of our predominantly mentorshipbased instructi on (intensive labbased classes), faculty develop and maintain close connections w ith students in their courses, continuing to serve as mentors for, and remain connected to, former students long after they graduate. Most fa culty maintain profession al networks on Facebook and LinkedIn, and routinely add new department alumni. The Depa rtment maintains an active Facebook page, Instagram account, and several di sciplinespecific Facebook gro ups with which to maintain connections and communicate with alumni. The depa rtment has recently begun cond ucting exit interviews with all graduating seniors for program assessment a nd selfreporting on employment success. The department consolidated our i ndividual faculty data into on e alumni spreadsheet, trac king the large majority of our alumni over the past five years and developed an online alumni survey hosted on our wku/art website. Results indicate that 80% of BFA students who graduated within this report's focus period are currently employed or in graduate school in arts and design fields. Based on the K YSTATS report, 52% of arts and humanities majors were employed in Kentucky five years postgraduation. Depa rtmental data also correlate t o the statelevel data. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary emplo yability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boards, nationa l data)? Provide one best exa mple where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Many of our alumni are in industr ies that employ our graduates; based on feedback from alumni recently transitioned to the workforce, we have added practical business elements to our courses. Over the timespan of this review , we have engaged dozens of emp loyers to talk with students about art and design careers, give programmati c feedback on the relevance of our course content, arrange internships and career placement. Every semester for multiple courses we bring professionals in various stages of their careers to campus to present information ab out their work and employment s ector; discuss agency careers and freelance entrepreneurship; provide formal portfolio feedback to our stud ents; and provide program feedback to faculty. Each semester we also take students into the field, for experie nces ranging from introductory industry field trips to formal mock interviews. We have a close, collegial relationship with many industries in our field in the area, and regularly tap this network for input. Our department has also recently evaluated and restructured our internship program and now routinely solicits feedback from students' internship hosts, all of whom are in fi elds of potential employment for our graduates. We use all information garnered to ensure our curriculum is aligne d with necessary employability skills. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) Graduates from this program are employed in design positions at all levels throughout the area stretching from WKU to Nashville, Louisville, Lexi ngton and Cincinnati. Our alu mni are working on both coas ts, in countries such as Korea, Japan, and the Netherlands , and have design positions at companies including Apple, Google, and Starbucks. Many have c reated their own successful businesses in design or print and many have profitable individual freelance careers. A good percentage have attended p restigious graduate schools. Most - despite the statistic that 90% of those with art degrees stop producing - a re still active artists and designers. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) We will soon receive more than $80,000 in scholarship funds yea rly from the Baker Foundation, a gift that will transform the Art Department. The student support made possible by this gift and the publicity that will flow from it will tremendously enhance ou r ability to recruit and retain students. Program revenue connected to cour se fees (which must be spent o n supplies and equipment that directly benefit students in specific classes) a pproximated $96,000 last year. A major percentage of these fees fund the department's 55 Mac student lab computers and Adobe Cloud subsc riptions. The department has collected a n average of $7,600 per year over the past 7 years from DELO revenue, with this number trending sharply upwards over the past three years. This past semester, the department launched a \"fund and friend raising\" initiative through the Foundation, using a studentdesigned tshirt as a reward for giving, and develope d a social media marketing strategy to target alumni and the area community. This project is still in its inf ancy, but has seen an uptic k in departmental giving and a huge surge in social media traffic. As a creative departm ent of people that mak e and market stuff, we anticipate seeing growing returns from this initiative. c.

How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) There is projected growth in Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations, the sector most likely to hire graduates from this prog ram, over the next five years, with an anticipated addition of more than 5,000 positions with a mean salary o ver $45,000. The Kentucky Future Skills Report predicts mo re than 1,000 jobs will be added in graphic designrelat ed positions alone, with salari es as high as $60,000. There are over 1,000 print related jobs in Kentucky, just one profession that is an offshoot o f graphic design, currently po sted on Indeed.com. Additionally, with a curriculum that requires progressively ind ependentlevel critical thinking and creative problemsolving skills, a discip lined work ethic and the abilit y to realize effective progress on multiple simultaneous projects, this program develops the hard and soft skills needed to be effective in any position. Students develop strategies to e ffectively set and meet short a nd longterm goals and th e skills to excel in a workforce position that demands creativity, attentiveness to de tail, time and material management, hand and organizational skills, and the ability to research and synthesi ze multidisciplinary knowledge to create production oriented solutions. d.

(maximum 200 words) The WKU Department of Art's mission is to offer paths to explore, experie nce, and expand the possibiliti es of artistic expression, an indispensable part of human society. WKU has been accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art & Design sinc e 1989, and was recently recert ified in 2016. NASAD, with over 360 member institutions, is the primary agency establishing, evaluating an d certifying highquality professional standards for education in the field. All departmental resources are available to all major and minor programs. We: Are one of only four NASAD accredited art programs in the state . Have the only computer animation program in the state. Are the third largest art program in the state. Have a celebrated art education program. Are known for producing highquality graduates that combine art and design practices and aesthetics Have on faculty one of the primary fresco experts in the nation (Mike Nichols), who is invited for educational workshop s across the country. Have a majority of faculty regularly invited to exhibit, speak about their work, and provide workshops in their fields at a regional or national level. Attract worldclass artists and programming to campus, reinforc ing connections between southcentral Kentucky and the global art community. e. What else do evaluators need to know about the program's str ategic alignment and distinctiveness? (optional, maximum 100 words) All Art Department programs are taught by a committed, collegia l faculty who are all acti ve artists, designers, and scholars. We promote and celebra te student success and actively serve our campus, Bowling Green, and disciplinary communities. Since 2013, our faculty have won two Universitylevel Awards for Research and Creative Activity (2013 and 2015), two PCA L Public Service Awards (2014 and 2015), and one PCAL A ward for Research and Creative Activity (2018). WKU is one of only 36 universiti es in the nation with all four (art, music, theatre, and dance) of its visual and performing arts programs accredited. 6. PROSPECTUS a. What opportunities do you see for the program going forward? For example, where are po tential new markets for students, how might the program be revised to take advantage of emerging trends in the discipline, how could new interdisciplinary connections be made to increase the demand an d quality of the program? (maximum 200 words) Our program has always boasted t he ability to teach students to connect analog and digital skills, encouraging them to work interdisciplinarily throughout our curriculum. Fur ther embedding emerging t echnological trends in both fine and graphic arts has t he capacity to make our program more attractive in recruiting students. Our computer animation minor, th e only program in the state in this trending field, has t he capacity to grow into a concentration within this majo r within the next few years and serve to recruit students to the program. More fully embracing the trend in art and design education towa rds providing handson, communitybased experiential studentlearning opportunities will allow further development of robust partnerships with area organizations, giving students at all levels necessary 'real wo rld' experience and aligning and connecting our department more intentionally with employers. The program recently developed a new recruitment strategy to au gment our current efforts aimed at our natural audience. Using our robust P12 network, we are inviting area h igh school art teachers and their students to participate in a halfday \"#WKUart intensive\" on campus and are making plans to take 'popup' workshops on the road to area high schools. We re cently received grants and purc hased two mobile printing presses for this activity. b. How do program trends align with national trends over the last 510 years? (maximum 200 words) After a drop in 2014, this progra m's enrollment and conferrals have remained relatively stable. A slight downward trend reflects both the state and national patterns. The most r ecent data from the CPE shows enrollment in art departments is down across the state, with four of the seven pr ograms in Kentucky seeing larger drops than ours. Our decline is less than that of NKU (7.69%) and significantly less than Murray (15%), M orehead (24%), and UK (42%). Data from the NCES also indicates that while degrees con ferred in the visual and performing arts rose at the beginning of the decade, they have also been on the decline since 2014. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three yearsto increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided? Examples might include revised course sequencing/scheduling designed to enhance students' progress to wards degree, implementation of a comprehensive recruiting and marketing plan, or reallocation of faculty resou rces to better align with demand. (maximum 200 words) Last year, the department revise d our curriculum and course sch eduling practices to a ssist students with timeliness towards graduation. This year, the department is in the process of developing and implementing a number of strategies to assist with recruitment, retention, and student progression towar ds degree. Changes are recent and ongoing, but we hope t o see positive results in the data emerging soon. Changes include: restructured curriculum to reduce number of required hours and assist with timeliness towards graduation introduced block scheduling for firstyear students, effective 20182019 in process of developing more robust recruiting and marketing s trategies recently reevaluated implementation and structure of internshi p program to assist with retention, degree progression offered more January and summer classes to assist students with progression towards degree developed more robust and effective departmental advising to as sist with student re tention and progress towards degree instituted more streamlined and studentfriendly course sequenc ing including developing projected 23 year course offerings/ rotations to assist student s with schedu ling experimenting with innovative co urse formats to provide more op portunities for students to take double length studio courses, including allday Friday courses; one da y a week 5:20 hour studio night class; late night class (twice weekly from 7:00 - 9:20 pm) d. Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Both concentrations in this majo r serve to benefit from incorpo rating rapidlyadvancing technological innovations, ranging from using 3Dprinters and laser cutters i n studio, to more aggressi vely transitioning from print to digital and webbased media in graphic design, to fost ering growth in the new computer animation program - a field that bridges b oth areas. The computer animati on minor, as it is the only one of any level in the state, has grown to 28 students in less than a year, and is the mostinquiredabout program in the department, has real potential to soon evolv e into a concentration within t his major, driving program numbers upwards. The majority of the computer animati on courses are taught by one fa culty member who spends half of his effort teaching design courses. Additionally, as more and more i nformation moves to the web, ev ery sector, spanning profit, nonprofit, and government, will need people who can create content; social and economic transitions that will likely also create demand for our program. We antic ipate additional growth based o n the integrated, targeted recruiting strategy we are currently implementing. With program growth, spurred by and following national trends, we anticipate soon needing an additional faculty member to support the design and computer animation areas. e.

PROGRAM SUMMARY a. Please provide a brief summary of your program to assist eva luators. Include factors such as delivery mode(s), whether an accompanying program is required (e.g., second major, minor, or certificate), supporting course requirements, and/or criteria for selective admi ssion. (maximum 200 words) Accredited by NASAD, the AB in Visual Studies (509) is a liberal arts degree with a broad program of study in the visual arts. Students develop an understanding of visual arts h istory and practice acro ss various art media, and graduate prepared to succeed in diverse careers that integrate the visual arts with other d isciplines; the longer art education concentration (aligned with KEPSB and National Core A rts Standards, accredited by both NASAD and CAEP) further leads to P12 teacher certification. Course requirements include lab based studio classes with 5:20 contact hours per week (75%), lectures and seminars in art history (25%), a Capstone course, and 15 hours of methods courses (art ed ucation only). For the studio concentration, no addition al specific courses outside th e department are required; art education requires 25 additional hours within the Sc hool of Teacher Education. The degree is geared towards full and parttime main campus students. Based on pedagogical best practi ces, studio and methods courses are delivered facetoface. Art history courses are delivered facetoface and on line. To assist with timely de gree progression, studio an d art history courses are offered in every DELOadministered term. Faculty regularly lead studyabroad courses, and students often take advantage of study abroad opport unities originating outside of the Department.

In what ways does t he program contribute to other programsor areas of the departmental/college/university mission and priorities? For example, you might consider factors such a s courses delivered in support of other major programs, involvement in a JUMP program, and interaction between undergra duate and graduate programs. Provide a brief summary and quantitative breakdown to the extent possible. (ma ximum 200 words) All faculty in Art teach courses necessary for all three majors . All courses comprising th e 509 studio concentration (49 hours) are a subset of course s constituting the more specif ic 509 art education concen tration (88 hours) and the larger and more focused 514 BFA Visual Arts degree (73 or 7 9 hours depending upon co ncentration), making the department both efficient and productive. One studio course from 509/ 514 is requi red for the 613 (Art History). 509 courses comprise 100% of the Computer Animation minor, 75% of the Graphic Design minor, and 100% of the studio art minor. 86% of students in these minors have a major outside of the Art Department, illustrating the department's curricular support t o nonart majors across campus . Program foundations courses are often taken by Interior Design and Fashion Merchandising majors to cover a core requirement of their progra m, and by Architectural Manufac turing Sciences students as an approved elective. IDFM majors routinely take art history survey courses as a component of their studies. Four program courses are part of the Colonnade , two in the Explorations and two in the Connections category. As a large program, the 509's SCHP is significantly higher than the university median. c. What else should evaluators know about this program's produc tivity? (optional, maximum 100 words) 509 coursework was adjusted to pro vide greater breadth and opti ons. The change assists students with progression towards degree, preparing them more intentionally f or employment and with an understanding of the way the arts integrate with other disciplines to provide di verse career paths. Studio classes are intensive, meeting for twice the number of s tandard contact hours (5:20 hours/ week). Their smaller class sizes, mandated by NASAD and based on safety and appropriate pedagogy, are balanced by larger art history and art appreciation courses. Art appreciation is a service course, therefore SCHP is not cap tured in program cost / SCH (Q 4). 3. SUCCESS OF STUDENTS a.

List program student learning outcomes and means of assessme nt. Minors and certificates may or may not have SLOs that differ from those of a major; if they do not, use the SLOs for the major. Describe one best example of how findings from a recent round of assessment were used to improve the prog ram (i.e., closingtheloop). (maximum 300 words) Abbreviated SLOs for studio: 1. Develop a broad understanding of visual arts history and practi ce. 2. Understand the way visual arts can integrate with other discipl ines to provide diverse career paths. 3. Develop the ability to effectivel y communicate through visual, oral and written means. In their final semester, student s in 509 studio create a portfo lio of their artwork and writing. For program assessment, department faculty a nd outside experts evaluate por tfolios on design competency, technique, creativity, level of craft, and writing ability. The department noted in a previous APR that students fell short of goals measuring writing ability, w ith fewer than 70% achieving a score of \"3\" on a 5poin t scale. The department developed a Capstone course to p rovide more focus on writing. R ecent reviews of writing samples have illustrated a marked rise in achievement. Abbreviated SLOs for art education : 1. Achieve studio concentration SLOs. 2. Acquire critical knowledge and und erstanding of visual arts con tent to advance P12 student learning. 3. Meet all of the KEPSB core requirements, professional dispositi ons, and instructional standards for KY P 12 visual arts certification. Within their capstone course, students are evaluated by interna l and external experts based on a rigorous state mandated rubric and must meet all program and KEPSB state requi rements to receive P12 visual arts certification. The goal is a rat e of 90100%. Findings from rec ent program assessments h ave been used to improve certification rates by revising studio experiences to better al ign with area content mastery requirements; specifically studio requirements for this concentration shifted from 6 lowerlevel and 3 upperlevel courses to 4 lowerlevel and 5 upperlevel. Ce rtification rates are now in t arget range. As a side benefit, students completing the art education concentration will additionally complete the requirements for the studio concentration, enabling them to graduate with a double concentration (effectiv ely a double major). c. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback on the success of graduates in gaining employment and/or progressing onto graduate/professiona l school (e.g., pass rates on national exams, alumni feedback, graduate/professional school acceptances)? What are the key areas of professional opportunity for students graduating from the prog ram? Reference relevant employment statistics and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maximum 200 words) Art education faculty track all alumni via regular communication through email and sitevisits, boasting near 100% employment in the field. The department has recently form alized what has been a successf ul informal method of ma intaining contact with all alumni. Because of our predominantly mentorshipbased instr uction (intensive labba sed classes), faculty develop and maintain connections to students long after graduat ion. Most faculty mainta in professional networks on Facebook and LinkedIn, routinely adding new alumni. The Depa rtment maintains an active Facebook page, Instagram account, and several di sciplinespecific Facebook gro ups with which to maintain connections and communicate with alumni. We have recently begun conducting exit interviews with all graduating seniors for program assessment and selfrep orting on employment success. Through consolidating individual faculty data, we tracked 83% o f our alumni over the past five years. Everyone in this cohort is employed minus one graduate who is a fulltime p arent. 53% are employed in arts/ design fields with the remainder in fields in cluding corporate, financial, an d office management, milita ry service, and building trades. Based on the KYSTATS postsecondary feedback report, 52% of arts and humanities majors were employed in Kentucky five years postgraduation. Departmental data exceed s tatelevel data as a large majority of art educators remain in the Commonwealth. d. In what ways does t he program try to systematically gather a nd incorporate feedback regarding needs and/or satisfaction of employers in order to ensure the curriculum is aligned with the necessary employability skills (e.g., employer surveys, advisory boar ds, national data)? Provide one best example where the information gained was used to improve the program. (maximum 200 words) Many of our alumni are in industr ies that employ our graduates; based on feedback from alumni recently transitioned to the workforce, we have added practical business elements to our courses. We have engaged dozens of employers to talk with students about art and design careers (through visits to campus and student field trips), give feedback on the relevance of our course cont ent, and arrange internships and career placement. Art education faculty routinely receive employment feedback fro m their robust P12 network of curriculum coordinators, principals, alumni, and classroom teachers, creat ed in part by 16 years of ongoing school visits and consultations. Our department has recently eval uated and restructured our inte rnship program and now routinely solicits feedback from students' internship hosts, all of whom are in fi elds of potential employment for our graduates. We use all information garnered to ensure our curriculum is ali gned with necessary employability skills. Moreover, the most common \"skills gap\" with which employers gra pple, according to a 2017 study in the MIT Technology Review , are deficiencies in reading and writing\u2014precisely the skills that our liberal arts 509 program is well equipped to endow. Our students are adaptable to changing economic realities and ar e successful in many fields. e. What else should evaluators know about the success of stude nts in this program?(optional, maximum 100 words) A defining feature of this progr am is its versatility, which ca n be individualized and paired with other disciplines for a wide range of career opportunities in and beyond the visual art s. Interdisciplinary pursuits are encouraged. The studio concentration is often paired with majors/ minors in cluding Art History (museum careers), Biology (medical and scientific illustrat ion), Chemistry (art conservat ion), Psychology or Psyc hological Sciences (art therapy), and Advertis ing, to provide career paths in hybrid fi elds. A defining feature of the 509 art education concentration is ne ar100% employment in the field; it provided 24 new teachers to the region in the past five years. 4. COSTS, REVENUE AND EFFICIENCY a.

What external revenue streams are directly associated with t he program? For example, consider research grants that require/engage program students and/or provide faculty buyout time, philanthropic potential, DELO revenue, corporate university partnerships, and economic development relationships with communities that generate additional support for the program, department, college , and/or university. (maximum 2 00 words) We will soon receive more than $80,000 in scholarship funds yea rly from the Baker Foundation, a gift that will transform the Art Department. The student support made possible by this gift and the publicity that will flow from it will tremendously enhance ou r ability to recruit and retain students. Program revenue connected to cour se fees (which must be spent o n supplies and equipment that directly benefit students in specific classes) a pproximated $96,000 last year. A major percentage of these fees fund the department's 55 Mac student lab computers and Adobe Cloud subsc riptions. The department has collected a n average of $7,600 per year over the past 7 years from DELO revenue, with this number trending sharply upwards over the past three years. This past semester, the department launched a \"fund and friend raising\" initiative through the Foundation, using a studentdesigned tshirt as a reward for giving, and develope d a social media marketing strategy to target alumni and the area community. This project is still in its inf ancy, but has seen an uptic k in departmental giving and a huge surge in social media traffic. As a creative departm ent of people that mak e and market stuff, we anticipate seeing growing returns from this initiative. c. What else should evaluators know about program costs, revenu e, and efficiency?For example, if the data provided for the department as a whole differ substantially from that of the program, please address. (optional, maximum 100 words) Studioclass sizes are mandated b y NASAD based on safety and ap propriate pedagogy. All Department programs share a largelycommon set of courses, faculty, and students; costs cannot be effectively separated. Cost/ SCH has been calculated using tota l SCHP generated by all majors and minors and 100% FTF effort of nonservice courses. *53.8% reported underenrolled co urses does not accurately captu re data, or faculty workload. 198 identified underenrolled include 45 independent study/ internships (faculty member receives no load credit ) 33 misassigned stacked classes ( no additional load credit assigned) 17 regionalcampus classes With above classes remo ved from calculation, 28.7% of classes on Bowling Green campus are underenrolled. 5. PROGRAM ALIGNMENT AND DISTINCTIVENESS a. What aspects of WKU's strategic plan are directly addressed by this program? Reference specific go als, objectives, strategies and metrics. (maximum 200 words) Prepare(s) students for career and life in a global context , providing highimpact practices to develop hard and soft skills ; Embraces A Culture of Innovation , including Facilitat(ing) high impact prac tices, immersive learning in different cultures, processlearn ing practices, a nd collaborati ve learning ; Promotes Quality of Life . Global practices include: art history courses emphasizing nonWestern perspectives; regu lar facultyled study abroad experiences throughout Asia and Europe; atleastyearly international FAC Gallery exhibitions and/or visiting artists. Additional highimpact practices include: courses regularly integrate servicelearning projects with pro fessional and community partners; a growing internship program; facultyd esignedandled field trips (ranging from industry and museum visits to mul tiday regional excursions); s tudents accompanying faculty to and presenting at professional conferences. Critical thinking, problem solving, and engaging effectively wi th others are learned in a projectbased studio curriculum in which every studio course requires students to imagine an d physically make creative solu tions to presented problems, working both individually and in small grou ps, and to publicly present and defend this information in written and ora l formats on a regular basis. Quality of life in the region is enhanced through regular public lectures, workshops, and exhibitions pr ovided by the program on campus, and through faculty and students regular ly exhibiting their art locally. b. What aspects of the statewide strategic agenda are directly addressed by the program? Reference specific goal s, policy objectives, strategies, and m etrics.

How and to what extent does the program directly address wor kforce needs in Kentucky and/or demand in the profession? Reference relevant workforce and/or provide supplemental data to the extent possible. (maxi mum 200 words) This program directly address workforce needs in Kentucky by providing needed P12 art teachers for the schools. A defining feature of t he 509 art education concentrat ion is near100% employm ent in the field; the program provided 24 new teachers to the region in the past five years. There is projected growth in Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations, the sector most likely to hire graduates from this prog ram, over the next five years. Estimated Current Employment: 30,579 Total Projected 5 year Demand: 5090 Projected wage (weig hted Mean): $45.066 Additionally, with a curriculum that requires progressively ind ependentlevel critical thinking and creative problemsolving skills, a discip lined work ethic and the abilit y to realize effective progress on multiple simultaneous projects, this program develops the hard and soft skills needed to be effective in any position. Students develop strategies to e ffectively set and meet short a nd longterm goals and deve lop the skills to excel in a workforce position that demands creativity, attentiveness to detail, time and material management, hand and organizational skills, and the ability to research and synthesi ze multidisciplinary knowledge to create production oriented solutions. d. In what ways is the program distinctive in design/delivery, reputation, and impact? Reference unique aspects of the program relative to similar prog rams, and point to indicators o f reputation in Kentucky and/or the nation.

(maximum 200 words) While our departmental enrollment has declined somewhat (7%), e nrollment in and conferrals for this program have remained relatively steady over the last five years. A dow nward trend reflects both the state and national patterns. The most recent data from the CPE shows enrollment in art departments is down across Kentucky, with four of the seven programs in Kentucky seeing larger drops than ours. Our decline is less than that of NKU (7.69%) and significantly less than Murray (15%), Morehead (24%), and U K (42%). Data from the NCES also indicates that while degrees conferred in the vis ual and performing arts rose at the beginning of the decade, they have also been on the decline since 2014. c. What if any significant chang es has your program instituted within the past three yearsto increase productivity, success of students, and/or efficiency that may not yet be evident in t he data provided?

Where do you see the program in five years? In ten years? What would it reasonably take to get there? What impediments currently exist? (maximum 200 words) Though it is an important and discrete degree in its own right, currently the 509 AB has less of an established identity than its departmental o lder sibling, the 514 BFA. Over the past two years, we h ave been intentionally re defining this degree away from t hat of a \"BFA lite,\" a process that still needs more atte ntion to reframe the 509 into what it should be - a broad , interdisciplinary liberal art s degree with many optio ns for individualization depending upon a student's interests, career and life goals. In line with the interdisciplinar y liberal arts nature of the 5 09, there is potential for intentionally developing cross department major/ minor, double major, or certificate partnersh ips, pairing with programs like Psychology or Psychological Sciences (art ther apy), Biology (scientific illus tration), Entrepreneurship/ Marketing (freelance art or design), Chemistry (art conservat ion), Anthropology/ Art Histor y (museum careers). These partnerships could be as simple as pairing up across departments to advertise career possibilities that bridge fields and curricular paths to get there; to developing spec ific courses, minors, or certif icates to serve another depa rtment; to creating inter departmental curricular options such as interdisciplinary cert ificates. Giving students specific careertrack options would assist with both recruiting students for the program and the employability of graduates. e.
