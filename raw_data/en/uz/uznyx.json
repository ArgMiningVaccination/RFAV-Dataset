This compendium has been extensively revised and updated since the 2010 version. 1 Importantly , the concept of occupational safety and health in veterinary medicine is beginning to achieve equity with employee safety and health in human health care. The NORA states that \"[v]eteri-nary medicine and other animal care personnel are at substantial risk for various occupationally acquired in-juries and illnesses, many of which parallel and even exceed those encountered in human healthcare.\" 2 The NORA had not previously addressed the veterinary medical workforce, but a shift occurred in 2013, when veterinary medical occupational safety and health was included as a component of the NORA. Preventing transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to veterinary personnel represents 1 component of a comprehensive safety and health program. This compendium places infection pre-vention in this context and endorses the concept of conducting workplace risk assessments and using a hierarchy of controls to minimize employee safety and health risks. The hierarchy of controls refers to a range of measures that may be taken to reduce the risk posed by workplace hazards: elimination, substi-tution, engineering, and administrative procedures and use of PPE. A thorough review of the human and veterinary medical literature has been conducted and has resulted in updates to a number of recommendations. Of note, hand hygiene recommendations have been updated to embrace use of alcohol-based hand gels as an important strategy for improving overall hand hygiene compli-ance in veterinary clinical settings. I. INTRODUCTION A. OBJECTIVES Within the context of a comprehensive em- ployee safety and health program, the objectives of the compendium are to address infection preven-tion and control issues specific to veterinary prac-tice, provide practical, science-based veterinary infection control guidance, and provide a model infection control plan for use in individual veteri-nary facilities. Since 2003, employee safety and health in the veterinary workplace, particularly infection prevention, has garnered increasing attention in the United States and other countries. 3-5 The 2003 monkeypox outbreak was a clear example of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in veterinary practice and led to the development of a novel set of infection control guidelines for veterinarians. 6,7 A cohort study8 of potentially ex- posed veterinary personnel working in veterinary practices in which prairie dogs associated with the outbreak were examined as patients identi-fied occupational risk factors for monkeypox transmission and highlighted the importance of infection control practices. B. BACKGROUND Zoonotic diseases are recognized occupational hazards faced by veterinary personnel on a daily ba-sis. 9-12 It is known that 868 of 1,415 (61%) known human pathogens and 132 of 175 (75%) emerging diseases that affect humans are zoonotic. 13 There are > 50 zoonotic diseases of importance in the United States (Appendix 1).14,15 Documented zoo- notic infections of Feline Practi- tioners published feline zoonoses guidelines in 2005 to provide veterinarians with educational information for clients and to highlight infection control procedures for small animal hospitals. 51 In 2006, the NASPHV published online the firs Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions that systematically addressed various infection prevention strategies specifically for veterinary personnel. Results of 2 surveys 52,53 published in 2008 identified deficiencies in the awareness and use of personal protective measures among veteri-nary staff. In the United States, the OSHA has promulgated a variety of specific standards that apply to individ-ual workplace hazards. Of note, the OSHA has cre-ated a Personal Protective Equipment Standard and a Respiratory Protection Standard, which provide guidelines for workers exposed to contact, droplet, and airborne transmissible infectious agents. 54 At the state level, California has developed a General Industry Safety Order that declares \"every employ-er with facilities, operations or services that are within the scope of this standard shall establish, implement, and maintain effective procedures for preventing employee exposure to zoonotic aerosol transmissible pathogens....\" This order is inclusive of veterinarians. 55 For situations where the OSHA has not promul- gated specific standards, employers are subject to the general duty clause (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 Sec. 5) and should provide safety and health control mea-sures to ensure a safe work environment. Consis-tent with the general duty clause, some states, such as Washington, require employers to develop and AbbreviA tions ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices AD A Americans with Disabilities Act EP A US Environmental P rotection Agency HCSA Health care and social assistance NASPHV National Association of State P ublic Health V eterinarians NORA National Occupational Researc h Agenda OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration PPE Per sonal protective equipment VSP Veterinary Standard P recautionsJAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1255implement a written accident prevention program to identify and address worksite safety and health hazards. 56 This law applies to veterinarians and their staff. A general overview of workers' rights to a safe workplace under the Occupational Safety and Health Act is available. 57 The NORA was initiated in 1996 to stimulate innovative research and improved workplace prac-tices. There are 10 NORA Sector Councils to guide research in each sector (including but not limited to construction, manufacturing, and HCSA). 58 The HCSA sector includes all aspects of human health care. However, veterinary medicine and animal care were never included in any of the original sectors. Owing to a relative similarity between veterinary and human medicine, and following the one-health concept, veterinary medicine and pet care were rolled into the NORA HCSA sector in 2013. 2 The NORA HCSA sector now identifies goals for improving the workplace safety of veteri-nary medical and animal care workers. Within the NORA HCSA sector are several goals that apply to both human and veterinary medical providers. These include the following: Promote a culture of safety . Reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. Reduce or eliminate exposures to and adverse outcomes from hazardous chemicals. Reduce injuries related to sharps. Also within the NORA HCSA sector are several goals that apply specifically to veterinary medical pro-viders. These include the following: Minimize or prevent occupational exposure of personnel to zoonotic diseases. Reduce the occurrence of animal-inflicted injuries. Minimize or prevent occupational exposures to respiratory hazards. Reduce potential reproductive hazards. C. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS This edition of the NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions provides updated infection prevention recommendations, references, and concepts. However, it should be noted that in-fection prevention is only 1 component of an em-ployee safety and health program. As indicated in the NORA HCSA goals, worker safety and health extends far beyond preventing zoonotic disease transmission. This compendium provides guidance to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens between employees and animal patients. It does not address prevention of disease transmission be-tween patients (nosocomial disease transmission); however, many of the same principles apply . D. CONSIDERATIONS In general, provision of a safe work environ- ment is accomplished through the assessment of risks in the workplace and application of a hier - archy of controls to manage those risks. A hierar -chy of controls is a systematic method of hazard reduction implemented by employers to control (or eliminate) risks posed by workplace hazards, such as zoonotic diseases (Figure 1). In the context of zoonotic diseases, the aim is to interrupt the disease transmission cycle at 1 or more points. Transmission of disease requires an infectious source (the animal patient), a susceptible host (the veterinary employee), a route of transmis-sion (contact [direct or indirect], aerosol, or vector-borne transmission), and a portal of entry (eg, an open wound or mucous membrane). A successful control measure will reliably interrupt transmission at some point and could be termed infection pre-vention. Control measures include the following: Elimination or substitution of the hazard\u2014In general, this is the most effective measure, as it requires no action on the part of the employee. The hazard has been identified and eliminated. An example would be exclusion of exotic pets or native wildlife from a clinic because of the dis-ease risk; such animals would include macaques and skunks that are associated with a risk of her - pes B virus or rabies virus transmission. Engineering controls\u2014A veterinary clinic is designed to facilitate infection prevention best practices. An example would be placement of sinks for handwashing in convenient locations. Administrative controls\u2014Clinic policies are adopted that mandate appropriate infection prevention practices. Administrative controls are generally not considered as effective as elimination or engineering controls because they require rigorous adherence to the policy by all employees. Examples would be the re-quirement for handwashing between patient contacts, no recapping of needles, and rabies vaccination of staff. PPE\u2014This control measure is generally con- sidered the least effective and the last line of defense because it requires the most action from the employee. The use of PPE requires routine adherence to and appropriate use of a variety of equipment and is dependent on employee training. Personal protective equip-ment is frequently and appropriately used in veterinary practice when engineering and ad-ministrative control options are limited. An example would be wearing a mask and face shield while performing dental procedures. The VSP are derived from standard precautions applicable to human medicine, which are the corner - stone of infection prevention in human health-care settings. 59 In addition, the VSP also include strategies to reduce the potential for animal bites and other trau-ma that may result in exposure to zoonotic pathogens. During their careers, approximately two-thirds of vet-erinarians report a major animal-related injury that resulted in lost work time or hospitalization. 9,10,60-62 The most common occupational injuries among vet-erinary personnel include animal bites and scratches, kick and crush injuries, and needlesticks. 63-721256 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015The VSP described in this document should be used consistently by veterinary personnel\u2014regard- less of the clinical condition or the presumed diag-nosis of animals in their care\u2014whenever personnel may be exposed to potentially infectious materials including feces, blood, body fluids, vomitus, exu-dates, work surfaces contaminated with these items, and nonintact skin. Although the VSP are intended to be adaptable to individual practice needs and circumstances, any modifications should adhere to basic principles of infection prevention and comply with federal, state, and local regulations. Although it may not be possible to eliminate all zoonotic disease hazards, employers should conduct a workplace risk assessment and implement appro-priate control measures where possible. Adherence to a well-developed employee safety and health pro-gram will minimize the risk of injury and illness. This compendium provides reasonable guidance for minimizing 1 type of workplace hazard\u2014zoonotic disease transmission\u2014among veterinary personnel in clinical settings through the application of the VSP . II. ZOONOTIC DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND INFECTION PREVENTION Pathogens are transmitted via 3 major routes: con- tact, aerosol, and vector-borne. Some agents may be trans-mitted by multiple routes of infection.59 Infection preven- tion or control refers to policies and procedures used to minimize the risk of spreading pathogens through any of these routes of transmission. A. CONTACT TRANSMISSION Contact transmission occurs when patho- gens from animals or their environments enter a human host through ingestion or through cutaneous, percutaneous, or mucous mem-brane exposure. Many zoonotic pathogens are transmitted from animals to people by hand-to-mouth contact either directly from animals or indirectly through the environment. Direct transmission may occur during examination, treatment, and handling of animals. Indirect transmission involves contact with a contami-nated intermediate\u2014objects such as cages, equipment, workplace surfaces, and soiled laundry . The role of the clinic or work envi-ronment in transmission of disease can be very important. 16,19,73-75 B. AEROSOL: AIRBORNE AND DROPLET TRANSMISSION Droplet transmission occurs when droplets created by coughing, sneezing, and vocalization Figure 1\u2014Hierarchy of controls for methods to facilitate infection prevention among veterinary practice employees.JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1257are deposited on the mucous membranes. These droplets are typically large, can generally travel only approximately 1 to 2 m (3 to 6 feet), and do not remain suspended in the air. Procedures such as lancing abscesses or dentistry can also produce droplets. Examples of zoonotic pathogens that are transmitted by droplets include avian infl - enza virus and Rhodococcus equi. Risk of patho- gen transmission increases with proximity to the source and duration of exposure. Airborne transmission occurs when small droplets or particles that are created remain sus-pended in the air for extended periods and are inhaled. These small droplets or particles can be disseminated by air currents in a room or through a facility . They may be generated through medi-cal procedures such as suction and bronchoscopy and during cleaning, particularly with high-pres-sure sprayers. Certain airborne pathogens may remain infective over long distances depending on particle size, the nature of the pathogen, and environmental factors. 59,76 T wo zoonotic patho- gens over Mycobacterium bovis.77-81 C. VECTOR-BORNE TRANSMISSION Vector-borne transmission occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks transmit pathogens. Animals may bring flea and tick vectors into contact with veterinary person-nel. Working in outdoor settings may increase the risk of exposure to arthropods. III. VETERINARY STANDARD PRECAUTIONS A. HAND HYGIENE Consistent, thorough hand hygiene is the single most important measure veterinary per - sonnel can take to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. Most common pathogens are transmitted by hand-to-mouth contact either directly from animals or indirectly through the environment. 82-84 Hand hygiene includes hand- washing with soap and water, the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, and appropriate use of gloves. Adequate hand hygiene may include washing the forearms when contamination extends be-yond the wrist. Hand hygiene should be performed after contact with feces, body fluids, vomitus, or exu-dates; after contact with articles contaminated by these substances; after contact with environ-mental surfaces in animal areas; and after remov-ing gloves. Hand hygiene should be consistently performed between examinations of individual animals or animal groups (eg, litters of puppies or kittens, groups of cattle). Either plain or antimicrobial soaps are ap- propriate for routine handwashing, which re-moves loosely adherent transient flora from the hands. 85 Transient flora reside in the uppermost layers of the stratum corneum; are acquired through contact with animals, people, or the en-vironment; and are most frequently associated with infection transmission. Transient flora may be removed by the mechanical friction or deter - gent properties of soap and water or killed by antiseptic agents. In contrast, resident flora are of low pathogenicity , are permanent residents of the deeper layers of the skin, and are not suscep-tible to mechanical removal; if the goal is to re-duce their numbers, such as when scrubbing for a surgical procedure, an antiseptic agent must be used. 85 Several antiseptic products with variable efficacy against different classes of microorgan-isms are available (Appendix 2). 82,84,86 Hand soaps may be susceptible to bacte- rial overgrowth and have been associated with nosocomial infections. 87 To prevent creation of a bacterial reservoir or cross-contamination, no additional soap should be added to liquid soap dispensers before they are empty (ie, they should not be topped off); once completely empty , re-fillable dispensers should be cleaned and dried, then refilled with liquid soap or sealed soap re-fills 82 Water temperature has little effect on the removal of microorganisms from hands, but warm (as opposed to cold) water improves com-pliance. 88 Moisturizing soaps and lotions can preserve skin integrity and encourage adherence to hand hygiene protocols among veterinary staff. Dry , cracked skin is painful, indicates com-promised skin integrity , and is more likely to be colonized with staphylococci and gram-negative organisms. 82 When hand lotions are used, per - sonal containers are recommended over use of shared dispensers to prevent contamination. Staff members who have animal contact should not wear artificial nails and should keep fingernails short. 82,89 Wearing rings and other jewelry reduces the effectiveness of hand hy-giene; as a result, the skin underneath rings and other jewelry can become more heavily colo-nized with organisms. 82 Additionally , the use of community or shared towels should be avoided. Disposable towels should be used for the drying of hands. 82,90 Alcohol-based hand rubs are fast-acting, broad-spectrum germicides that kill microorgan-isms by denaturing microbial proteins. 85 They lack residual activity , but can be combined with other antiseptic products (eg, chlorhexidine or triclosan) to enhance persistence (Appendix 2). Hand rubs are generally well tolerated ow-ing to the addition of emollients. Hand rubs, when properly applied for 30 seconds to hands that are not visibly soiled, are highly effective against bacteria, many fungi, and enveloped vi-ruses. 82,91-93 Hand rubs are less effective against bacterial spores, protozoal parasites, and some nonenveloped viruses. 82,94,95 In the field, when running water is not available and hands are vis-ibly soiled, use of a moist wipe to remove organic material prior to application of an alcohol-based hand rub may increase the effectiveness of hand hygiene. Use of moist wipes alone is not recom-mended. 82 The CDC recommends hand rubs 1258 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015containing 60% to 95% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) for use in health-care settings. 82 Hand antisepsis products containing other disinfectants may be suscepti-ble to bacterial overgrowth and have been associ-ated with nosocomial infections. 96-99 Hand hygiene performed with an alcohol-based hand rub requires approximately a third of the time re-quired to perform handwashing with soap and water. 85 For this reason and because hand rubs are well toler - ated and easily accessible, they are gaining acceptance in veterinary medicine as an important strategy for im-proving overall hand hygiene in clinical settings. 100,101 Strategic placement of hand rub dispensers increases access to hand hygiene where soap and running water are not immediately available, such as in examination rooms and outdoor stalls. 101 However, it is important to train staff that the visible presence of organic matter (eg, blood or feces) on hands will greatly decrease the efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs The importance of hand hygiene cannot be over - emphasized. Personal adherence to hand hygiene pro-tocols can be negatively influenced by several factors including inaccessible hand hygiene supplies, skin irritation, high workload, and insufficient time. 102 Compliance with hand hygiene protocols among vet-erinary personnel can be improved when adherence is made as simple and convenient as possible, with regular training uniquely tailored to individual work-places and delivered in innovative ways, and, most importantly , when senior team members consistently display good hand hygiene practices. 103,104 correct handwashing procedure: Wet hands with running water . Place soap in palms. Rub hands together to make a lather. Scrub hands thoroughly for 20 seconds. Rinse soap off hands. Dry hands with a disposable towel. T urn off faucet using the disposable towel to avoid hand contact. corr ect use of hand rubs: Place alcohol-based hand rub in palms. Apply to all surfaces of hands. Rub hands together until dry . B. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE ACTIONS AND EQUIPMENT The following sections highlight a variety of PPE intended to prevent the transmission of zoonot- ic infectious agents to veterinary employees. How-ever, the personal protective value of PPE is realized only if there is a collective culture that supports the use of PPE and if the necessary gloves, face shields, respirators, gowns, and other supplies are readily ac-cessible when needed. Personal protective equipment is equipment worn to minimize exposure to serious workplace in-juries and illnesses. As stated by OSHA, \"when en-gineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or do not provide sufficient protec-tion, employers must provide PPE to their workers and ensure its proper use. Employers are also required to train each worker required to use PPE to know: When it is necessary What kind is necessary How to properly put it on, adjust, wear, and take it off The limitations of the equipment Proper care, maintenance, useful life, and dispos- al of the equipment.\"105,106 1. Gloves Gloves reduce the risk of pathogen trans- mission by providing a barrier that can be ef-ficiently removed when soiled. 107,108 Gloves should be worn routinely when contact with feces, body fluids, vomitus, exudates, and non-intact skin is likely . They should be worn when performing dental or obstetric procedures, resuscitations, and necropsies and when han-dling diagnostic specimens (eg, urine, feces, as-pirates, or swabs). Gloves should also be used when cleaning cages, litter boxes, and contami-nated equipment and environmental surfaces in animal areas and when handling dirty laun-dry . Gloves should also be worn when person-nel have wounds or other compromised skin integrity of the hands. Gloves are not necessary when examining, handling, vaccinating, or ob-taining a blood sample from most healthy ani-mals, provided good hand hygiene is practiced. Gloves should be changed between ex- aminations of individual animals or animal groups, between dirty and clean procedures performed on a single patient, and whenever torn. Gloves should never be washed and then reused for another procedure. 109,110 Gloves should be removed immediately after use and before beginning other activities. During removal, care should be taken to avoid skin contact with the outer glove surface. Wearing gloves (including palpation sleeves) does not preclude the need for hand hygiene. Hand-washing should be performed or alcohol-based hand rubs should be used immediately after glove removal because gloves may have undetected microperforations or hands may be contaminated during glove removal. 111,112 Gloves are available in a variety of materi- als, such as latex, nitrile, and vinyl. Choice of gloves depends on their intended use; a range of sizes should be available to encourage use. Some personnel exposed to latex may experi-ence allergic reactions. Further information re-garding prevention of allergic reactions to natu-ral rubber latex in the workplace is provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 113,114 2. Facial Protection Facial protection prevents exposure of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth to infectious materials. Facial pro-tection should be used whenever exposure JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1259to splashes or sprays is likely to occur (eg, when lancing abscesses, flushing wounds, or suctioning and when performing dentistry , obstetric procedures, or necropsies). 59,115-118 A face shield or goggles worn with a surgical mask provide adequate facial protection dur - ing most veterinary procedures that generate potentially infectious sprays and splashes. 3. respirator y Tract Infection Respiratory tract protection is designed to protect the airways of employees from infectious agents. In veterinary medicine, molded N95 and N99 particulate respirators are the most common-ly used equipment option when respiratory tract protection is needed. Employers and employees must understand and distinguish between respi-rators and surgical masks, which are designed for very different functions. Respirators are designed and certified to prevent inhalation of small air - borne contaminants. Surgical masks are designed to protect the patient and do not provide the same level of protection for the wearer as a respirator. 119 Pathogens such as C burnetii, Brucella spp, and Chlamydophila psittaci are known to pres- ent an occupational risk to veterinary staff; use of respiratory tract protection is recommended when exposure to these and other airborne pathogens is likely . 120-122 Additionally , respira- tory tract protection is warranted for proce-dures that are likely to generate aerosols, such as the use of power tools during necropsy . 123 Respirator use requires compliance with OSHA 's respiratory tract protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), and employers must ad-dress the following elements to fulfill the re-spiratory tract protection program criteria 124: Develop a written respirator y tract protec- tion program. Select the appropriate r espirator for use. Identify a physician to perform medical evaluations and provide a medical deter - mination for each employee. Perform fit testing Provide education on proper respirator use including donning and doffing, cleaning, dis-infection, maintenance, storage, and repairs. Given the strict requirements of the re- spiratory tract protection standard, it may be desirable to identify other means, such as engineering or administrative controls, to ad-dress risk from specific airborne pathogens. Nonetheless, in certain situations, use of re-spiratory tract protection may be the only fea-sible means of addressing the risk. 4. pr otective Outerwear foot-wear, and head covers. The purpose of protective outerwear is to limit the transfer of pathogens be-tween the wearer and the patient, and its importance in infection control is often underappreciated. 125-127 a. Laboratory coats, smocks, aprons, and coveralls Laboratory coats, smocks, aprons, and coveralls serve as a temporary layer of pro-tection that prevents contamination of the wearer's garments. Protective outerwear should be worn when attending animals and when conducting cleaning chores. In situations where splashing or soaking with potentially infectious liquids is anticipated, impermeable outerwear, such as a dispos-able plastic apron, should be used. 128 Garments should be changed and laun- dered daily and whenever they become visibly soiled or contaminated. Protective outerwear should not be worn outside the work environment, and coveralls should be changed between visits to different farm premises, facilities, locations, or herds. 59,129,130 b. Nonsterile gowns Nonsterile gowns are generally worn when attending a single patient to protect the wearer and prevent movement of infec-tious material from one location to another. Permeable gowns can be used for general care of animals in isolation. Impermeable gowns should be used when exposures to splashes or large quantities of body fluids are anticipat-ed. Disposable gowns should not be reused. Washable protective garments may be used repeatedly to care for the same animal kept in isolation, but should be laundered between contacts with different patients or whenever soiled. Whenever gowns are worn, gloves should also be used; the outer (contaminat-ed) surface of a gown should be touched only with gloved hands. Fabric gowns should be removed and placed in a laundry receptacle and gloves put into a refuse bin before leav-ing the animal's environment. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately after these items have been removed. 116 Gowns should be removed as follows131: After unfastening ties, peel the gown from the shoulders and arms by pulling on the chest surface with gloved hands. Remove the gown, avoiding contact between its outer surface and clean surfaces. Wrap the gown into a ball while keeping the contaminated surface on the inside; place in a designated receptacle. Remove gloves and place them in a refuse bin; wash hands. When body fluids have soaked through the gown, promptly re-move contaminated clothing and wash the skin.1260 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015c. Footwear Footwear should be suitable for the spe- cific working conditions (eg, rubber boots for farm work) and should protect person-nel from both trauma and exposure to infec-tious material. Recommendations include shoes or boots with thick soles and closed-toe construction that are impermeable to liquids and easy to clean. Footwear should be cleaned to prevent transfer of infectious material from one environment to anoth-er, such as between farm visits and before returning from a field visit to a veterinary facility or home. Disposable shoe covers or booties add an extra level of protection when heavy quantities of infectious mate-rials are known or expected to be present. When leaving contaminated work areas, promptly remove and dispose of shoe covers and booties. Disposable shoe covers should not be worn on slippery surfaces; water- impervious boots that can be disinfected af-ter use should be worn as an alternative. d. Head covers Disposable head covers provide a bar - rier when contamination of the hair and scalp may occur, such as in livestock barns, or in situations involving airborne patho-gens. Disposable head covers should not be reused. C. PROTECTIVE ACTIONS DURING VETERINARY PROCEDURES 1. patient Intake W aiting rooms should be a clean and safe environment for clients, animals, and veterinary personnel. Staff training regard-ing waiting room protocol for reception area personnel should include instruction to pose basic questions to incoming clients about the reason for the visit and to observe every pet for behavioral cues and outward signs of illness. Animals that are fearful, are aggres-sive, or have a known exposure to an infec-tious agent should bypass the waiting room and be placed directly into an examination or isolation room, as should those with the following so-called red flag signs: neurologic signs, diarrhea, respiratory tract signs, fever, infected wounds, or chronic infection. Con-sider providing alcohol-based hand rub dis-pensers in the waiting room and at the desks where clients check in and out. 2. Animal Handling and Injur y Prevention Proper handling and restraint of animals decrease the possibility of staff receiving bites, scratches, needlesticks, and other animal- related injuries, which are associated with risk for zoonotic infections. Most injuries among veterinary personnel occur during animal han-dling or treatment. 132 Preventive measures in- clude reliance on experienced veterinary per -sonnel rather than owners to restrain animals and the use of muzzles, bite-resistant gloves, and sedation or anesthesia as necessary . 133 Veterinary personnel should be trained to re-main alert for changes in a patient's behavior. Aggressive or fearful tendencies and bite his-tory should be recorded in the patient's record, communicated to personnel, and indicated with signage on cages and enclosures. Those working with large animals are at risk for kick and crush injuries. Proper livestock-handling equipment should be used, and an escape route should be kept in mind at all times. 9,10 Veterinarians have the right to refuse services if large animal-handling facilities are not avail-able or are not adequate to ensure their safety and the safety of those assisting them. Simi-larly , veterinarians have the right to refuse to provide services for clients with exotic species or wildlife that cannot be handled safely be-cause of physical infrastructure or clinician or staff training limitations. Preplanning, adequate equipment, and clear communication with coworkers while working with animals are key to preventing animal-related injuries. First aid supplies, including eyewash, should be readily avail-able, and personnel should know where the supplies are located and how to use them. Incident response procedures should be dis-played prominently . 3. Examination of Animals Animals with potentially infectious dis- eases should be examined in a dedicated examination or isolation room and should remain there until initial diagnostic proce-dures and treatments have been performed. Contact with animals suspected of having an infectious disease should be limited to essen-tial personnel who should wear protective outerwear and use gloves and other protec-tive equipment appropriate for the situation. The examination room used for this purpose should remain out of service until properly cleaned and disinfected. Every ex-amination room should have an easily ac-cessible source of running water, a soap dis-penser, and paper towels. In addition, it is recommended that alcohol-based hand rubs be available in the examination room. 4. Injection, V enipuncture, and Aspiration Procedur es a. Needlestick injury prevention Needlesticks are common in veteri- nary medicine, can cause serious injury , and may result in a loss of work time. 70 Needlesticks may result in the inoculation of vaccines containing live organisms, harmful chemicals, hormones, chemo-therapeutics, or infective materials; in ad-JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1261dition, the wound can serve as a portal of entry for pathogens.71 Needlestick injuries are preventable. Following the passage of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act in 2000, percutaneous injuries among human hospital employees decreased by 38% in the first year of implementation and remained low in subsequent years. 134 To promote a culture of safety and reduce workplace injuries, a NORA HCSA goal of promoting the use of safety devices to prevent needlestick injuries among veteri-nary personnel employed in all work set-tings has been set. 2 Records of needlestick injuries should be kept and analyzed so that interventions specific to the practice may be implemented and protocols cor - rected as necessary . Clinic personnel should be educated regarding the serious nature of needlestick injuries. Trained personnel should restrain animals to minimize needlestick injuries resulting from animal movement. Veteri-nary staff should not bend needles, pass an uncapped needle to another person, or walk around with uncapped needles. Needle caps should never be placed in the mouth. Needles should not be recapped unless the 1-handed scoop method is used: Place the cap on a horizontal surface. Hold the syringe with attached needle in 1 hand. Use the needle to scoop up the cap without use of the other hand. Secure the cap by pushing it against a hard surface.135 An approved sharps container (punc- ture- and leak-proof container designed for the safe collection of sharp medical articles for disposal) should be located in every area in which animal care occurs. 136-138 Following most veterinary procedures, a forceps can be used to remove the uncapped needle from the syringe, and the needle alone can be placed in the sharps container. Uncapped needles should never be removed from a syringe by hand. After aspiration of infectious materials or injection of vaccines containing live organ-isms, the used syringe with needle attached should be placed in a sharps container. Sharps containers should not be overfilled, and sharps should not be transferred from one container to another. Disposal of sharps and sharp containers must be done in accordance with applicable state and local laws. b. Barrier protection Currently , there are no data indicating that venipuncture of healthy animals con-stitutes an important risk of exposure to pathogens, and contact with animal blood (except primate blood) has not been report-ed as a source of occupationally acquired infection. Appropriate PPE should be worn when procedures are performed on animals suspected of having an infectious disease that may result in exposure to blood or oth-er potentially infectious materials. 5. Dentistr y Dental procedures can generate splash- es, sprays, and large droplets that are po-tentially infectious. Veterinary personnel and anyone in range of direct splashes or sprays should wear protective outerwear, a head cover, gloves, and facial protection. Dental procedures should be performed in a dedicated space\u2014ideally a dental suite\u2014with separate, dedicated equipment and appropriate ventilation. 139 Environmental surfaces can be easily contaminated during dental procedures. These surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected between patients and at the end of daily work activities. 140 6. Resuscitation The urgent nature of resuscitation in- creases the likelihood that breaches in infec-tion control will occur. Standard emergency protocols and regular staff training regarding resuscitation are very important to minimize risk and reduce exposures. Barrier precautions, such as the use of gloves and facial protection, should be implemented to prevent exposure to zoonotic infectious agents that may be present. Never blow into the nose or mouth of an ani-mal or into an endotracheal tube; instead, intu-bate the animal and use a manual resuscitator, anesthesia machine, or ventilator. 7. Obstetrics Zoonotic agents, including Brucella spp, C burnetii, and Listeria monocytogenes, may be found in high concentrations in the birthing fluids of aborting or parturient animals and in stillborn fetuses and infected neonates. Gloves or sleeves, facial protection, and impermeable pro-tective outerwear should be used routinely to pre-vent exposure to potentially infective materials. 141 Respiratory tract protection should be used when investigating abortions attributable to C burnetii infection (Q fever) or when other airborne patho-gens are known or suspected risks. 142 8. Necropsy Necropsy is a high-risk procedure be- cause of the possibility of injury and po-tential contact with infectious agents in body tissues, body fluids, and aerosols. 117,120 Nonessential persons should not be pres-ent during necropsy procedures. Veterinary personnel should routinely wear gloves, facial protection, and impermeable protec-tive outerwear. In addition, eye protection 1262 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015and respiratory tract protection used in the context of a respiratory tract protection pro-gram should be employed when band saws or other power equipment is used or there is a high probability of exposure to a zoonotic pathogen. Cut-proof gloves should be used to prevent sharps-associated injuries. 9. diagnostic Specimen Handling Samples of feces, urine, or vomitus; aspi- rate specimens; and swabs collected from the general patient population should be handled as though they contain infectious organisms. The sample containers should bear clear and detailed labeling and be stored in a designated refrigerator. Protective outerwear and dispos-able gloves should be worn when these speci-mens are handled. Discard gloves and wash hands before subsequently touching clean items such as telephones, medical records, or computer keyboards. 143 Specimens shipped for diagnostic testing must be packaged and labeled according to applicable regulations. 144 10. Wound Care and Abscess Treatment Many zoonotic pathogens can be associ- ated with wound infections and abscesses.145 Veterinary personnel should wear protective outerwear and gloves for debridement, treat-ment, and bandaging of wounds; facial protec-tion should be worn when abscesses are lanced and wounds are lavaged. Hand hygiene should be performed after gloves are discarded and fol-lowing removal of outerwear. Animals with in-fected wounds should be prevented from con-taminating environmental surfaces, including floors. Used bandage materials and equipment such as bandage scissors and clipper blades should be considered contaminated and han-dled accordingly . Leftover bandaging material should be sterilized (autoclaved or gas steril-ized) prior to storage for reuse because unused bandaging material may become contaminated with methicillin-resistant S aureus and other wound pathogens during wound care. a D. ENVIRONMENTAL INFECTION CONTROL The veterinary clinic environment can po- tentially serve as a source of pathogens for staff and patients. Controlling this potential reser - voir of infection is increasingly recognized as an important component of infection control and prevention. Surfaces in a clinic can be-come contaminated with methicillin-resistant S aureus, Salmonella spp, and other pathogens; once introduced onto a surface, some patho-gens may persist for months in the facility and serve as a source of infection for animals, their owners, and veterinary employees. 16,146-148 Ad- ditionally , equipment (eg, stethoscopes) can become contaminated with pathogens follow-ing physical examination. 149,150 Guidelines have been developed for hospital layout and design that address infection control issues and pro-vide for ease of cleaning and disinfection of en-vironmental surfaces. 151 1. Cleaning and Disinfection of Equipment and Surfaces Regular cleaning and disinfection of equipment and surfaces is critical for envi-ronmental control of pathogens. Equipment and surfaces must be cleaned with water and detergent before they are disinfected because organic material decreases the effectiveness of most disinfectants. 151-153 An EPA-regis- tered disinfectant should be used according to label instructions, with attention to stor - age conditions, proper dilution, and contact time. When selecting a disinfectant, ensure that users will be able to accommodate all label requirements, including appropriate contact time. Quaternary ammonium com-pounds and hypochlorites are the most com-mon disinfectants used on environmental surfaces in veterinary practices; however, hy-drogen peroxide-based oxidizing agents are also effective against a wide range of veteri-nary microbes (Appendix 3). 152 Equipment and surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected between uses or whenever visibly soiled. Special attention should be paid to surface areas with high contact rates (eg, examination tables, door knobs, cage latches, faucet handles, and sinks). 154 A written checklist should be de- veloped for each area of the facility (eg, wait-ing room, examination rooms, treatment area, surgery suite, and kennels) that speci-fies the frequency of cleaning, disinfection procedures, products to be used, and the staff responsible. At a minimum, staff should per - form hand hygiene after they have finishedcleaning and before beginning other tasks. Surfaces in areas where animals are housed, examined, or treated should be made of nonporous, easily cleaned materials. Gen-eration of dust that may contain pathogens can be minimized by use of vacuums with high-efficiency particulate air filters, wet mop-ping, dust mopping, or electrostatic sweeping. Surfaces may be lightly sprayed with water prior to mopping or sweeping to minimize dust generation (wet mopping). Use of high-pressure sprayers and similar devices that can disseminate infectious particles should be avoided. However, if procedures that may generate infectious aerosols are undertaken, appropriate PPE should be worn. Cleaning products and disinfectants may contain components harmful to hu-man health. It is incumbent on employers to provide appropriate training as required by OSHA. This training must detail all physi-cal, chemical, and biological hazards in the JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1263workplace, and each cleaning and disinfec- tant products' label and safety data sheet should be easily accessible. 155 Routine dishwashing is sufficient to clean food and water bowls used for most hospi-talized patients. Toys, litter boxes, and other miscellaneous items should be discarded or cleaned and disinfected between patient uses. Litter boxes should be cleaned or disposed of at least daily by a nonpregnant staff member. 2. Isolation of Animals with Infectious Diseases Animals with suspected or confirmed communicable diseases should be identifiedprior to arrival if possible and be examined, cared for, and housed in designated isola-tion rooms (small animals) or areas (large animals) to protect other patients and vet-erinary personnel. Isolation procedures should be prominently posted. 116 Isolation rooms or areas should be identified with signage, access should be limited, and a sign-in log should be used. Only the equipment and materials needed for the care and treatment of the patient should be kept in an isolation room or area, and isolation supplies should not be removed for use elsewhere. Whenever possible, use of disposable articles such as bowls, litter pans, and gowns is recom-mended. Equipment that must be removed from the isolation room or area should be disassembled, cleaned, and disinfected prior to removal to prevent contamination of oth-er areas of the hospital. Potentially contami-nated materials should be bagged before transport within the facility and disinfected or disposed of in accordance with state rules governing disposal of medical waste. 116,156 Limited data are available regarding the effectiveness of footbaths and foot mats for infection control in private veterinary practic-es. 157-159 Footbaths and foot mats are difficul to maintain , which limits their effi- cacy . Disposable, impermeable shoe or boot coverings made of plastic should be consid-ered for use in isolation rooms. All PPE used when attending animals in isolation should be donned immediately prior to and doffed following care for the animal in an effort to limit movement of infectious organisms with-in the facility . 3. Handling of Laundry Although soiled laundry may be contami- nated with pathogens, the risk of disease trans-mission is negligible when soiled items are han-dled correctly . 160 Personnel should check pock- ets for sharps before items are removed and laundered. Gloves and protective outerwear should be worn when handling soiled laundry . Bedding and other laundry should be machine washed with any standard laundry detergent and machine dried at the highest temperature suitable for the material. 161 To prevent cross- contamination, separate storage and transport bins should be used for clean and dirty laundry . When soiled clothing is laundered at home, it should be transported in a sealed plastic bag, kept separate from household laundry , emptied from the bag directly into a washing machine, and thoroughly machine dried after comple-tion of the wash cycle. 162-164 4. Spill Response and Decontamination Spills and splashes of potentially infective substances should be immediately contained with absorbent material (eg, paper towels, sawdust, or cat litter). Personnel should wear PPE sufficient to protect against potentially infective substances in the spill and the clean-ing or disinfectant agent selected for use. The safety data sheet for each EPA-registered dis-infectant will indicate appropriate PPE for use with the product. 165 The spilled fluids and absorbent material should be collected and sealed in a leak-proof plastic bag, and the area should be cleaned and disinfected. An EPA-registered disinfectant should be used with attention to storage conditions, label instruc-tions, and contact time. Animals and people who are not involved in the cleanup should be kept away from the area until disinfection is completed. Creating a spill response kit with instructions in advance may expedite cleanup processes and enhance worker safety . 5. Medical Waste Medical waste is regulated at the state level, and employers should become famil-iar with the applicable laws in their state. 166 Medical waste is defined by the EPA as \"any solid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human be-ings or animals, in research pertaining there-to, or in the production or testing of biologi-cals.\" 167 Sharps and regulated medical waste are generally considered subsets of medical waste, and proper management of them is also based on state medical waste laws. 6. Rodent and Vector Control Field veterinarians and any accompany- ing support personnel are likely to have the greatest risk of exposure to arthropod vec-tors that may transmit zoonotic pathogens. However, the risk of illness for any particu-lar infection is not uniform across the Unit-ed States. 168,169 Regardless of the geographic location of the field work, permethrin-treated clothing has been demonstrated to be highly effective at reducing tick bites and would be recommended for those vet-erinarians and assistants with occupational 1264 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015exposures.170 Animals may act as mechani- cal carriers for ticks, and it is important to check patients as they enter a clinic to limit introduction of arthropod vectors into the indoor work environment. 171 Integrated pest management is the rec- ommended approach to the control of rodents and vectors in veterinary medical buildings. Integrated pest management is a comprehen-sive approach to pest control based on an understanding of the life cycle and ecological niche of the pest. Pest populations are con-trolled largely by creating unfavorable en-vironments; by removing the air, moisture, food, or shelter that pests need to survive; or by blocking access to buildings. 172,173 Pesti- cides and rodent traps may be used as part of a comprehensive plan that includes environ-mental control measures as follow: Sealing of potential entry and exit points into buildings with caulk, steel wool, or metal lath. Storage of food and garbage in metal or thick-plastic containers with tight lids. Disposal of food waste promptly . Elimination of potential rodent nesting sites (eg, clutter). Removal of sources of standing water (eg, empty buckets, tires, and clogged gutters) to reduce potential mosquito breeding sites. Installation and maintenance of window screens to prevent entry of insects and rodents. Additional measures may be warranted for control of specific pests. For example, birds and bats should be excluded from hos-pital barns and veterinary medical facilities. Facility managers may wish to contact a pest control company for additional guidance. 7. Other Environmental Controls It is important to provide an employee break room or area for eating and drink-ing. Such activities should be prohibited in laboratories, treatment rooms, and other patient care and housing areas. Separate, appropriately labeled refrigerators should be used for human food, animal food, bio-logics, and laboratory diagnostic samples. Dishware for human use should be washed and stored away from animal-care areas. IV . OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH A. GENERAL Veterinary clinic managers should develop a comprehensive employee safety and health pro-gram on the basis of their own workplace risk as-sessment addressing the potential for animal- related and non-animal-related occupational injuries and illnesses. 174,175 Utilizing control measures that place the least amount of burden on the individual employee will be most effective. Personal protective equipment (while often essential) represents the least effective and least desirable control measure in any workplace envi-ronment. Some elements to consider when implement-ing a safety and health program follow. 1. Employee Vaccination Policies and Record Keeping a. Overview Veterinary practices should maintain up-to-date emergency contact information and staff records including vaccinations and rabies virus antibody titers. Employee health information should be collected on a voluntary basis and confidentially main-tained. Employees should inform their su-pervisor of changes in health status, such as pregnancy , that may affect work assign-ments. New employees should receive train-ing regarding the importance of informing their health-care provider that their work duties involve contact with animals. 176 b. Rabies Veterinary personnel should receive pre- exposure rabies vaccination and antibody titer checks in accordance with the ACIP recom-mendations. 177,178 Preexposure immunization against rabies consists of 3 IM doses of vac-cine administered on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. Periodic titer checks (generally every 2 years) should be performed, and a single rabies boost-er should be administered when immunity is defined as less than adequate by the perform-ing laboratory . It should be emphasized that preexposure vaccination against rabies does not eliminate the need for additional rabies vaccinations following a known rabies virus exposure. It does, however, simplify the rabies postexposure treatment, and it may be protec-tive in cases of unrecognized rabies exposure or when postexposure treatment is delayed. 178 c. T etanus Tetanus prophylaxis and prevention recommendations for veterinary personnel are no different than those for the general public. However, because animal bites are tetanus-prone wounds, veterinarians and their staff may be at an elevated risk of ex-posure. Veterinary staff should receive a rou-tine tetanus vaccination every 10 years in accordance with ACIP recommendations. 179 New personnel should be screened to ensure they are currently vaccinated for tetanus. Additionally , if a person sustains a wound, including a bite wound, and it has been more than 5 years since his or her last teta-nus booster, a single dose of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) or Td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine should be administered. Persons who are not adequately immunized against tetanus may require tetanus immune globulin in addition to vaccine. 179,180JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1265d. Influenz Owing to their extensive contact with animals and the public, veterinary personnel should receive influenza vaccine or vaccines in accordance with ACIP guidelines. 181-185 2. Management and Documentation of Exposure Incidents W orkplace injuries and illnesses will still occur despite best efforts to identify and reduce hazards. The management team should review recent work-related injuries and illnesses in the practice to ascertain any patterns or cause. Ad-ditional or new administrative or engineering controls may be warranted. Another important step is to conduct refresher training for employ-ees that addresses the cause of the incident and covers new control measures. Pursuant to OSHA 's recordkeeping and re- porting requirement (29 CFR 1904), employers must complete the following 186: Form 301: Within 7 calendar days after you receive information that a recordable work-related injury or illness has occurred, you must complete this injury and illness incident report form that is specific to an individual event. This form will contain information about individual employee health and must be used in a manner that protects confidentiality of employees. You must keep this form on file for 5 years follow-ing the year to which it pertains. Form 300: Each incident, as recor ded on Form 301, must be entered on Form 300. This is an injury and illness log that contains sum-mary information for each event recorded on a Form 301. This will help employers identify trends and complete Form 300A. This form will contain information about individual em-ployee health and must be used in a manner that protects confidentiality of employees Form 300A (summary of injuries and illnesses): This report summarizes, for all employees, the number of work-related injuries and illnesses, the number of days away from work, and the to-tal numbers of injury and illness types. This form will not contain confidential information and must be publicly posted for employees to review. Employers with 10 or fewer employees throughout the previous calendar year are not required to complete these forms. This ex-emption applies to employers in states with federal as well as state OSHA plans. 187 3. Staff Training and Education Comprehensive staff training and education are essential components of an effective employee safety and health program. Training should have defined objectives and a means of measuring the effectiveness of the training. 188 Furthermore, all training, whether written or oral, must be provided at a level of complexity and in a language that em-ployees can understand. 189 Before new staff begin work, they should receive training that emphasizes infection control practices and the clinic infection control plan, the potential for zoonotic disease ex-posure, hazards associated with work duties, and injury prevention. 104,190-193 Training should also in- clude instruction in animal handling, restraint, and behavioral cue recognition. Additional in-service training should be provided at least annually and as recommendations or policies change. Staff par - ticipation in infection control and hazard aware-ness training should be documented. Although training is critical to reducing the in- cidence of occupational illness and injury , remem-ber that it is only 1 component of an employee safety and health program. Practice managers and super - visors must ensure that all feasible engineering and administrative controls have been implemented on the basis of a workplace risk assessment. B. IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PERSONNEL Personnel with a weakened immune system as a result of disease or medication and pregnant women are more susceptible to infection with zoonotic agents and more likely to develop serious complications from zoonotic infections. 194 Em- ployees with immunocompromising conditions should talk to their primary health-care provider to clarify work parameters and obtain guidance. Occupational activities associated with a higher risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens include processing laboratory samples, necropsy , and care of certain high-risk animals. High-risk animals include those that are young, parturient, unvaccinated, stray or feral, fed raw-meat diets, or housed in a shelter; animals with internal or external parasites; wildlife; reptiles and amphib-ians; and exotic or nonnative species. 195,196 Although data regarding the risks of zoonotic infection for HIV-infected persons employed in veterinary settings are limited, there are none that justify their exclusion from the veterinary work-place. 197 Risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens in the workplace can be mitigated through consis-tent use of the VSP outlined in this compendium. C. PREGNANCY Pregnancy presents a situation in which mul- tiple potential occupational hazards must be ad-dressed. The employer, on the basis of a workplace risk assessment, should provide information about hazards to which the employee and fetus may be exposed. Pregnant employees should consult with their health-care provider about potential hazards including zoonotic disease, chemicals, waste anes-thetic gas, radiation, and lifting hazards. Employ-ers must then provide reasonable workplace ac-commodation for the employee. The ADA as amended in 2008 states that while pregnancy itself is not a disability , pregnant workers and job applicants are not excluded from the protec-tions of the ADA. Pregnant workers with pregnancy-related impairments may demonstrate that they have 1266 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions JA VMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015disabilities for which they may be entitled to a rea- sonable accommodation under the ADA. Also, if an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job because of pregnancy , the employer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled employee; for example, by providing light duty , modified tasks, alternative assignments, disability leave, or leave without pay . 198,199 Employees should notify managers as soon as they know they are pregnant so that poten-tially harmful activities may be avoided and necessary adjustments to workplace activities can be addressed. Pregnant women are more susceptible to certain zoonotic infections owing to physiologic suppres-sion of cell-mediated immunity . Conditions to which pregnant are more susceptible include toxo-plasmosis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, brucellosis, listeriosis, and psittacosis. 200 Vertical transmission of certain zoonotic agents may result in miscarriage, still-birth, premature birth, or fetal congenital anomalies. V . CREATING A WRITTEN INFECTION CONTROL PLAN Veterinary practices should have a written infec- tion control plan. 3,53 A model infection control plan that can be tailored to individual practice needs is available in electronic format from the NASPHV website (Appendix 4). 201 Effective infection control plans should do the following: Provide explicit and well-organized guidance spe- cific to the facility and practice type Be flexible so that new issues can be addressed eas- ily and new knowledge incorporated. Indicate the staff members responsible for each area, activity , or function. Provide contact information, resources, and references. A. INFECTION CONTROL PERSONNEL All veterinary personnel are responsible for supporting and carrying out the activities outlined in the practice's infection control plan; however, it is the practice management team and senior clinicians who must play a leadership role in establishing the culture of infection control practice. Staff members should be designated for development and imple-mentation of specific infection control policies such as monitoring compliance, maintenance of records, and management and documentation of workplace exposures and injuries. Breeches in infection con-trol practice should be addressed. B. IMPLEMENTING THE INFECTION CONTROL PLAN 1. Leadership The management team should set the stan- dard for infection control practices, champion the importance of infection prevention in daily activities, and model desired behaviors such as hand hygiene after every patient contact. 2. New Staff New staff members should be given their own copy of the infection control plan. Detailed training should be provided. Receipt of the plan and training should be documented for each employee. 3. Review and Revision Practice management should evaluate inci- dents as they occur and evaluate processes and identify deficiencies that may necessitate engineer - ing or administrative changes. Revisions should be communicated to all staff members. If deficiencie in training are identified, the management team should ensure that corrective measures are taken and employee retraining is instituted. 4. Compliance All team members should ensure that in- fection control policies and protocols are car - ried out consistently and correctly . 5. Availability Copies of the infection control plan and re- source documents should be readily accessible to all staff, including reception, administration, animal care, and housekeeping personnel. a.

A modifiable electronic version is available on the NASPHV Website (www.nasphv.org). Please refer to the full Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for complete information and guidance (also available at www.nasphv.org). Clinic: ______________________________________________________ Date of __________________________________________Infection Control Officer: ______________________________________ This plan will be followed as part of our practice's routine procedures. The plan will be reviewed at least annually and as part of new employee training. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE ACTIONS AND EQUIPMENT Hand hygiene: Perform hand hygiene between examinations of individual animals or animal groups (eg, litters of puppies or kittens, groups of cattle) and after contact with feces, body fluids, vomitus, exudates, and articles contaminated by these substances. Perform hand hygienebefore eating, drinking, or smoking; after using the toilet; after cleaning animal cages; after contact with environmental surfaces in animal areas; after handling laboratory specimens; after removing gloves; and whenever hands are visibly soiled. Keep fingernails short. Do not wear artificianails or hand jewelry when handling animals. Keep hand-hygiene supplies stocked at all times. Staff responsible: _________________________________________________ Correct handwashing procedure: Wet hands with running water. Place soap in palms. Rub hands together to make a lather. Scrub hands thoroughly for 20 seconds. Rinse soap off hands. Dry hands with disposable towel. Turn off faucet using the disposable towel to avoid hand contact. Correct use of hand rubs: Place alcohol-based hand rub in palms. Apply to all surfaces of hands. Rub hands together until dry. Gloves: Gloves are not necessary when examining or handling healthy animals. W ear gloves when touching feces, body fluids, vomitus, exudates, and nonintact skin. Wear gloves for dentistry, resuscitations, necropsies, and obstetric procedures; when cleaning cages, litter boxes, and environmental surfaces and equipment in animal areas; when handling dirty laundry; when handling diagnostic specimens (eg, urine, feces, aspirates, or swabs); and when handling an animal with a suspected infectious disease. W ear gloves if you have wounds or compromised skin integrity of the hands. Change gloves between examination of individual animals or animal groups (eg, a litter of puppies), between dirty and clean procedures performed on the same patient, and when torn. Gloves should be removed promptly and disposed of after use. Disposable gloves should not be washed and reused. Hands should be washed immediately after glove removal. Facial protection: Use a face shield or goggles worn with a surgical mask whenever splashes or sprays are likely to occur . Wear facial protection for the following procedures: lancing abscesses, flushing wounds, dentistr , procedures, Use a molded particulate respirator (N95 or N99) when exposure to airborne pathogens is likely . Use respiratory protection under the supervision of a veterinarian and following OSHA regulations. T raining and fit testing are required for their use Protective outerwear: Wear a protective outer garment such as a laboratory coat, smock, nonsterile gown, or coveralls when attending animals and when conducting cleaning chores in animal areas. Protective outerwear should be changed after handling an animal with a known or suspected infectious disease, after working in an isolation room, after performing a necropsy or other high-risk procedure, and whenever soiled. Impermeable outwear should be worn during obstetric procedures and necropsies and whenever substantial splashes or large quantities of body fluids may be encountered. Shoes or boots should have thick soles and closed toes and be impermeable to water and easily cleaned.Disposable shoe covers or washable boots should be worn when heavy quantities of infectious materials are expected. Garments should be changed and laundered daily and whenever they become visibly soiled or contaminated. Coveralls should be changed and boots cleaned between farm premises, facilities, locations, or herds. Protective outerwear should not be worn outside of the work environment. Keep clean outer garments available at all times. Staff responsible: __________________________ PROTECTIVE ACTIONS DURING VETERINARY PROCEDURES Patient Intake: Place animals that have neurologic signs, diarrhea, respiratory signs, fever , infected wounds, chronic infections, or a known exposure to an infectious agent directly into a designated examination or isolation room. Bring them in a side entrance if possible. Animal handling and injury prevention: Take precautions to prevent bites and other animal-related injuries. Identify aggressive animals and alert clinic staff. Use physical restraints, muzzles, bite-resistant gloves, and sedation or anesthesia as necessary in accordance with practice policies. Plan an escape route when handling large animals. Do not rely on owners or untrained staff for animal restraint. If there is concern for personal safety, notify: ____________________________ When injuries occur, wash wounds with soap and water, then immediately report incident to: ___________________________________(infection control officer If medical attention is needed contact: __________________(health-care provider) Bite incidents will be reported to: ____________________(public health agency) as required by law . Telephone number:____________________ Examination of animals: Wear protective outerwear and perform hand hygiene before and after examination of individual animals or animal groups (eg, a litter of puppies). Use gloves and other protective equipment as appropriate to examine potentially infectious animals. Keep potentially infectious animals in a designated examination room until diagnostic procedures and treatments have been performed. Continued on next page.JAVMA, Vol 247 , No. 11, December 1, 2015 NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions 1277Injections, venipuncture, and aspiration procedures: W ear gloves when performing soft tissue or body fluid aspirations and while performin venipuncture on animals suspected of having an infectious disease. T rained personnel should restrain animals to minimize needlestick injuries due to animal movement. Do not bend needles, pass an uncapped needle to another person, or walk around with uncapped needles. Do not remove an uncapped needle from the syringe by hand or place a needle cap in the mouth. Do not recap needles unless the 1-handed scoop method is used. 1-handed scoop method for recapping needles: Place the cap on a horizontal surface. Hold the syringe with attached needle in 1 hand. Use the needle to scoop up the cap without use of the other hand. Secure the cap by pushing it against a hard surface. Dispose of all sharps in designated containers. After injection of live vaccines or aspiration of soft tissue or body fluid, dispose of the usedsyringe with needle attached in a sharps container. Otherwise, you may remove the needle with a forceps and throw the syringe away in the trash. Do not transfer sharps from one container to another. Replace sharps containers before they are completely full. Staff responsible: ________________________________ Dental procedures: Wear protective outerwear, a head cover, gloves, and facial protection when performing dental procedures or when in range of splashes or sprays (such as when monitoring anesthesia). Resuscitation: Wear gloves and facial protection. Use a manual resuscitator, anesthesia machine, or ventilator to resuscitate animals. Do not blow directly into the mouth, nose, or endotracheal tube of the animal. Obstetrics: Wear gloves or shoulder-length sleeves, facial protection, and impermeable outerwear. Do not blow directly into the nose or mouth of a nonrespiring neonate. Necropsy: Wear cut-resistant gloves, facial protection, and impermeable outerwear. Also wear eye protection and a respirator when using a band saw or other power equipment. Only necessary personnel are allowed in the vicinity of the procedure. If an animal is suspected of having a notifiable infectious or a foreign animal disease, consult with the State eterinarian before proceeding with a necropsy. Contact information for State Veterinarian's office:__________________________________ Diagnostic specimen handling: Wear protective outerwear and gloves. Handle feces, urine, vomitus, aspirates, and swabs as if they were infectious. Discard gloves and perform hand hygiene before touching clean items (eg, medical records, keyboard, or telephone). Eating and drinking are not allowed in the laboratory. Wound care and abscesses: Wear protective outerwear and gloves for debridement, treatment, and bandaging of wounds. Facial protection should also be used when lancing abscesses or lavaging wounds. Discard used bandages. Handle used scissors, clipper blades, and other equipment as if contaminated. Autoclave or gas sterilize leftover bandaging material before putting it away . Perform hand hygiene after removing gloves. ENVIRONMENTAL INFECTION CONTROLCleaning and disinfection of equipment and environmental surfaces: Wear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting cages and other surfaces in animal areas. Perform hand hygiene afterwards. Clean surfaces and equipment to remove organic matter , and then use a disinfectant according to manufacturer's instructions. Clean and disinfect animal cages, toys, and food and water bowls between uses and whenever visibly soiled. Clean litter boxes at least once daily. Keep clean items separate from dirty items. Isolation of infectious animals: Put animals with an infectious disease in isolation as soon as possible. Clearly mark the room or cage to indicate the patient's status and describe additional precautions. Limit access to the isolation room. Keep a sign-in log of all people (including owners or other nonemployees) having contact with an animal in isolation. Keep only the equipment needed for the care and treatment of the patient in the isolation room, including dedicated cleaning supplies. Personal protective equipment should be donned immediately prior to care of the animal in isolation and removed just prior to leaving isolation. Discard gloves after use. Leave reusable PPE (eg, gown, mask) in the isolation room. Clean and disinfect or discard protective equipment between patients and whenever contaminated by body fluids. Disassemble and thoroughlyclean and disinfect any equipment that has been used in the isolation room. Place potentially contaminated materials in a bag before removal from the isolation room. Staff responsible: ______________________________________________________ Handling laundry: Wear gloves and protective outerwear when handling soiled laundry. Check for sharps before items are laundered. Wash animal bedding and other laundry in the facility with standard laundry detergent, and completely machine dry at the highest temperature suitable for the material. Use separate storage and transport bins for clean and dirty laundry . Outerwear to be laundered at home should be transported in a plastic bag, kept separate from household items, washed separately , and then thoroughly machine dried. Spill response and decontamination: Immediately contain spills and splashes of potentially infective substances with absorbent material (eg, paper towels, sawdust, or cat litter). Use PPE to protect against potentially infective agents and the cleaning agent or disinfectant to be used. Consult and follow the label recommendations for the cleaning agent or disinfectant. Pick up the material, seal it in a leak-proof plastic bag, and clean and disinfect the area. Keep clients, patients, and employees away from the spill area until disinfection is completed. Veterinary medical waste: Insert here your local and state ordinances regulating disposal of animal waste, pathology waste, animal carcasses, bedding, sharps, and biologics. Refer to the US Environmental Protection Agency website (www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/industrial/medical/programs.htm) and the AVMA website (www.avma.org/PracticeManagement/Administration/Pages/AVMA-Policies-Relevant-to-Waste-Disposal.aspx) for guidance. Rodent and vector control: Seal entry portals, eliminate clutter and sources of standing water , keep animal food in closed metal or thick-plastic covered containers, and dispose of food waste properly to keep the facility free of rodents, mosquitoes, and other arthropods. Check and treat animals entering the veterinary facility for vector parasites. Other environmental controls: Use the employee break room or designated area for eating, drinking, smoking, application of makeup, and similar activities. These activities should not occur in animal-care areas or in the laboratory . Do not keep food or drink for human consumption in the same refrigerator as food for animals, biologics, or laboratory specimens. Dishes for human use should be washed and stored away from animal-care and animal food preparation areas. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH Infection control and employee health management: The following personnel are responsible for development and maintenance of the practice's infection control policies, record keeping, and management of workplace exposure and injury incidents.Staff responsible: ______________________________________________________ Record keeping: Current emergency contact information will be maintained for each employee.
