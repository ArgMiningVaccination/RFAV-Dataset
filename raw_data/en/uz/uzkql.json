District law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities. For example, employees that request to work from home because of a medical condition that weakens their immune system should be accommodated to the extent possible. District law prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers and employees. For example, District businesses cannot discriminate against people of specific racial groups or people from specific foreign countries based on stereotypes about their race or national origin. Every District resident is legally entitled to paid sick days annually. This is a really good time to use them if you aren't feeling well. Here's info on your rights . The COVID-19 Emergency Bill creates a new type of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, called \"declaration-of-emergency leave\" (or DOE). It allows all employees whom DOH recommends to self-quarantine or who test positive for covid-19, to take DOE leave. DOE leave is available to all employees\u2014regardless of their employer's size. It does mean the employee gets up to 16 weeks of medical leave (every 2 years) without fear of losing their job. Report discrimination: If you experience discrimination of any kind, report it to OAG by calling 202-727-3400, emailing OAGCivilRights@dc.gov, or filling out our online form . You can also file a complaint with D.C. Office of Human Rights through their online civil rights complaint form .

At this time, Pepco will continue to respond to requests to start, stop or more service, which in many cases, can be done remotely, without accessing customer homes or businesses. In cases where accessing a building is necessary, our employees and contractors are being advised to take appropriate action, such as wearing appropriate PPE to perform their jobs safely.

LIHEAP provides grants in varying amounts based on a household's income size, type of fuel, and type of dwelling, with no pay back required.

Never provide your social security number or personal information to anyone initiating contact with you claiming to be a company representative or requesting you to send money to another person or entity other than Pepco. 2. Always ask to see a company photo ID before allowing any Pepco worker into your home or business. 3. Never make a payment for services to anyone coming to your door. How to protect yourself Pepco representatives will never ask or require a customer with a past due balance to purchase a prepaid debit card to avoid disconnection. Customers can make payments online, by phone, automatic bank withdrawal or by mail. Customers with a past due balance will receive multiple shut off notifications - never a single notification one hour before disconnection. If a customer ever questions the legitimacy of the call, hang up and call Pepco at 202-833-7500. Washington Gas There are several payment options available to help manage your Washington Gas bill. Budget Plan The Budget Plan spreads the cost of winter heating over the entire year. We calculate your average monthly payment based on historical natural gas usage, adjusted for normal weather and projected gas costs. Periodically, we review your account to confirm that our monthly estimate is on target. Each month, your bill will show actual gas usage and bill amounts, along with budget installments, so you can review the information. Depending on the time of year, your budget installment may be more or less than your actual monthly usage. If actual gas costs, weather and/or usage differ significantly from our original estimate, we may adjust your monthly payment to prevent significant charges or credits at the end of your budget year. You may also request an adjustment to your monthly budget A W i d e r C i r c l e ' s C e n t e r f o r C o m m u n i t y S e r v i c e : 9 1 5 9 B r o o k v i l l e R o a d , S i l v e r S p r i n g , M D 2 0 9 1 0 w w w . a w i d e r c i r c l e . o r g W a s h i n g t o n , D .

If an adjustment to your monthly budget payment is necessary, you will be notified and can decide whether to change your monthly budget payment amount. Your 12 t h monthly bill will reflect the last installment of your budget cycle - adjusted for the difference between actual and budgeted gas usage. Overpayments are credited to your account unless a refund is requested. If you use more gas than you paid for, you owe the company the difference. This amount will be billed in the 12 t h monthly bill of the budget cycle. The Budget Plan is designed as a 12-month program, and we encourage you to stay on it year-round to realize the potential benefits. Remember that continued participation in the plan depends on your ability to make the monthly budget payment. A late payment or failure to pay may result in removal from the plan, and the full amount of the account balance will become due. For information or to enroll, call our Automated Services Line at 703-750-7944 or download the Billing and Payment Plans Brochure and mail in the application. Please have your Washington Gas account number available. Customers outside the local calling area may dial 800-752-7520. Please call us at 844-WASHGAS (927-4427) if you choose to purchase natural gas from an energy supply company and want to participate in the Budget Plan. eBill Automated-Payment Plan (EBAP) Pay your bill automatically every month through the eBill Automated Payment Plan (EBAP). Washington Gas will continue to bill you each month, but, on your payment due date, the bill amount will be automatically deducted from your checking account - no check writing, postage or waiting in line. An email notice will be sent every month with a link to view your electronic bill. With EBAP, you can select the number of days after billing when you would like the payment to be deducted and you can set a maximum payment amount. If the amount of the bill surpasses the maximum amount, the payment will be suspended to allow the account holder to investigate the charges. Additionally, all program details can be managed online any time, day or night.

Then pay your gas bill automatically each month through the Automated Payment Plan (APPL). Washington Gas will continue to mail you a statement each month, but, on the due date, the amount of the bill will be deducted electronically from your checking account. If you have questions about the amount of your bill or wish to suspend an automated payment, please call us at 844-WASHGAS prior to 4 p.m. at least three business days before your bill is due. When an automated payment is suspended, other payment arrangements must be made. Also, please notify Washington Gas if you change your checking account. To enroll or learn more, call our Customer Service Line at 844-WASHGAS (927-4427), download our Billing and Payment Plans Brochure and mail in the application or visit our eService Center . Payment Extension Plan (Residential Customers Only) The Payment Extension Plan (offered to residential customers only) can extend the due date for customers - typically individuals whose main source of income is a monthly government or pension check - who purchase gas from Washington Gas and receive their bills after the 10 t h of the month. With this plan, the due date (last day to pay without a penalty) of your current monthly gas bill is extended to the 5 t h of the next month, making it easier for you to apply a portion of your government or pension check to your gas bill. There is no late charge if the payment for your gas bill is received by the extended due date. For details or to enroll, call us at 844-WASHGAS (927-4427). Remember that it is the customer's responsibility to notify Washington Gas as soon as possible if he or she is unable to pay for service in accordance with the requirements of the company's billing practices.

You can buy jugs of glycerol online, and it's an important ingredient because it keeps the alcohol from drying out your hands . If you can't find glycerol, proceed with the rest of the recipe anyway and just remember to moisturize your hands after applying the sanitizer. Mix in 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide, then another \u00bc cup of distilled or boiled water. (If you're working with a lower-concentration solution of rubbing alcohol, use far less water; remember, at least of your final mixture has to be alcohol.) Load the solution into spray bottles\u2014this isn't a gel, it's a spray. You can wet a paper towel with it as well and use that as a wipe. If you must, you can add in a splash of essential oil to your concoction to make it smell nice. The Gel Recipe Isopropyl alcohol Aloe vera gel Tea tree oil (or another essential oil scent) Mix 3 parts isopropyl alcohol to 1 part aloe vera gel. Add a few drops of tea tree oil to give it a pleasant scent. *Recipes from https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-make-hand-sanitizer/ BONUS: How to Make Your Own No-Sew Face Mask A W i d e r C i r c l e ' s C e n t e r f o r C o m m u n i t y S e r v i c e : 9 1 5 9 B r o o k v i l l e R o a d , S i l v e r S p r i n g , M D 2 0 9 1 0 w w w . a w i d e r c i r c l e . o r g W a s h i n g t o n , D .
