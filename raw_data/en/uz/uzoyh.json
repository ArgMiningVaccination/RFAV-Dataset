Learn a little about her I graduated from the University of Nebraska with dual Bachelor's Degrees in dietetics and exercise science, as well as a Master's Degree in nutrition & exercise. I completed my dietetic internship at the University of Nebraska, where my thesis research involved the development and implementation of an eating disorder risk assessment instrument for athletes. I have presented my research at the national level for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics and been a contributing author for multiple peer-reviewed publications. In an effort to advocate for evidence-based practice, I served five years as a member of the Council on Practice for the [Omaha Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics](https://eatrightnebraska.org/) and am currently serving my second peer-elected term as the Chair of the [Nebraska Board of Medical Nutrition Therapy.](https://dhhs.ne.gov/licensure/Pages/Medical-Nutrition-Therapist.aspx) I am dual-licensed in the states of Nebraska and North Carolina. I also serve nationally for the [Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics](https://www.eatright.org/) on multiple professional boards including the Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics Examination Committee, the Sports Dietetics Practice Analysis Workgroup, and the Commission on Dietetic Registration Specialty Certification Panel. As a registered dietitian, I have nearly 15 yrs of experience working with clinical nutrition, sports nutrition, weight management, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, eating disorders, substance abuse and more. I have also served in multiple leadership roles tasked with program development and oversight. As a consulting Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics, I work with high school, club, collegiate, elite, professional and Olympic athletes. My experience includes developing and conducting needs assessments for individual athletes, teams and athletic programs, as well as the development and integration of sport-specific programming. As a sports nutrition consultant for the [Gatorade Sports Science Institute](https://www.gssiweb.org/), I spent three years integrating sports nutrition services into the NBA G-League. I also spent three years as a member of the [GSSI Sweat Testing Consultant Team](https://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/sse-161-sweat-testing-methodology-in-the-field-challenges-and-best-practices), for which I traveled the country sweat testing elite athletes to facilitate the development of individualized sweat profiles and hydration regimens. My love of sports brought me to the state of North Carolina, where I spent two years developing a sports nutrition program for the University of North Carolina - Wilmington as a sports nutrition consultant and am in my fourth year as the consulting sports dietitian for the [Campbell University Football Team](https://gocamels.com/sports/football). To promote optimal wellness for athletes statewide, I have served as a consulting sports dietitian for the [Nebraska Coaches Association](https://ncacoach.org/), endorsed by the [National Organization of Coaches Association Directors](https://nocadcoaches.org/) as a Beyond the Game professional speaker, conducting statewide research and providing educational outreach to coaches. With a passion for community outreach and philanthropy, I also serve as a Health Promotions Clinical Director for [Special Olympics Nebraska](https://www.sone.org/), for which I collaborate on research projects, help to guide the development of sports nutrition strategies for individuals with developmental/intellectual disabilities, and serve on the Special Olympics Nebraska Health Advisory Committee. Personally, I have been a life-long, multi-sport athlete and love every chance I get to share ways that others can embrace a healthy lifestyle. I am committed to providing evidence-based and cutting-edge approaches to wellness, which is what makes [Clean Eatz](https://www.cleaneatzkitchen.com/) such a perfect fit for me! In addition, I am passionate about community outreach and philanthropy and am so excited to have an opportunity to contribute to the community outreach efforts that will come to life with the newly-launched Clean Eatz Foundation. As a mother of two little girls competing in gymnastics and wife to a husband who travels for sports, I am no stranger to the demands of a busy lifestyle! I love the impact that [Clean Eatz meal delivery services](https://www.cleaneatzkitchen.com/) can have on balancing holistic wellness for a busy family and can't wait to be a part of sharing the way that Clean Eatz changes lives!
