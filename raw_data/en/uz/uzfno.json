Detox and Herbal Protocol To Clean Out Candida & Parasite Overgrowth.", "sitename": "Living with The Spirit", "date": "2021-06-19", "cleaned_text": "I just completed the Candida & Parasite Cleanse, which Living with the Spirit created. I began the program intending to mildly cleanse my body. I feel now much lighter and purer. I used to have bad cravings for sweets & junk food, but at the moment I have no desire to go back to them, and even after I completed the course I am still keeping my diet as clean as possible. The course is not only to purify your body but it helps you to transition into a completely new healthy lifestyle. I was taking the herbal protocol together with a diet of mostly raw fruits and vegetables. The first week I had brown rice and steamed veggies but tried to stay as raw as possible after. I experienced some mild detox symptoms like a foggy head, lots of mucus being released from my body, and some fatigue. The Candida & Parasite Plan is easy and you have different dietary options that are all well explained, easy to follow and you could even do a water fast if you are up to it, to clean your body on a deeper level. Four weeks in and I have the energy I had when I was in my 20's (now 40's). I am awake at the crack of dawn, have lots of power, and no longer feel that I am dragging myself through the day. Sara and Simba have been wonderful in explaining everything in detail in the four webinars that come with the program. They offer their full support and you can always get in touch with them if you have any additional questions or need their help. It has been a spiritually and mentally strengthening experience and a blessing in my journey of healthy living. I can highly recommend the program. "}
