She began reading and studying the tarot in 2001, and draws upon her knowledge of Jungian archetypes, human psychology and Buddhist thought. Julie specializes in helping creative people become unblocked - writers and artists, but also those in finance or law.

Her sensitive nature can pick up feelings in environments, rooms and energies where she strives to speak and work from a place of high vibration, light and love. She uses a host of ancestors, spirit guides and masters, who she lets do the work as a willing channel of light. Having led a somewhat nomadic life, Julie currently works and reads for clients all over the world. She has lived in NYC, Cleveland, Detroit and Florida, and has lived in various countries across the world for months at a time. Julie's dedicated daily practice of service to others, meditation and self-care keep her centered. @EmpressWorldTarot on Instagram (Tarot) @JulieSchenkelberg on Instagram (Art) Julie's Offerings - Tarot Readings - Spiritual Guidance - Ancestral Work - Spiritual Art Julie's Readings are $90 Hourly or $45 Half Hour "}
