This concept about the union between the body and the mind, which was promoted in the health field by the cardiologist Herbert Benson, has caused a great impact in the medicine of the XXI century and is becoming increasingly important due to the multitude of problems that can treat, either for pain management, insomnia or stress among others 3. There are various definitions used to explain the meaning of mind-body therapies. Mosby's Medical Dictionary defines mind-body medicine as \"a holistic approach to medicine that takes into account the effect of the mind on physical processes, including the effects of psychosocial stressors and conditioning, particularly its involvement of the immune system.\" 4. In turn, the NCCIH (National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health) defines mind-body therapies as a varied set of interventions that are based on physical procedures or techniques taught or administered to others by a coach or teacher 5. All these therapies have one thing in common, It is important to mention that mind-body medicine is not part of complementary or alternative medicine but it can use certain techniques, such as acupuncture, Qi Gong or Tai Chi that are included in both medicines. Next we are going to differentiate the existing types of medicine 7: Conventional Medicine: also called Western or allopathic medicine, it is practiced by those who have the corresponding titles of doctor of medicine and include associated health professionals such as nurses, physiotherapists or psychologists. Alternative Medicine: is one that is used instead of conventional medicine. Complementary Medicine: it is about using alternative medicine together with conventional medicine. Integrative Medicine: this type of medicine is one that seeks to restore or maintain the health of a person taking into account their circumstances, seeking to achieve physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental well- being in this way. The latter type, like conventional medicine, is based on scientific evidence and, whenever possible, tries to use natural and minimally invasive interventions. 8 Mind-body medicine is part of integrative medicine since it seeks an approach both in the physical, psychological and mental spheres In addition, these types of therapies are increasingly popular, they can be easily learned by the general population 9 and, although they continue to be studied, there is sufficient evidence to show the improvement in the quality of life of people who use this type of therapy. 1. HISTORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE MIND-BODY CONCEPTS The importance of the mind in the treatment of diseases has been one of the fundamental pillars of traditional Chinese, Indian or Japanese medicine, with data on its existence for 2000 years. The mind-body relationship in these cultures is based on the effect that the presence of vital energies that pervade the world and our lives have on it. From this thought are born the terms that designate the vital energies, each one different according to the culture, be it prana in Indian medicine, Qi in Japanese or Chi in China, 10 In fact, these oriental cultures are the ones that They give more importance to the mind-body relationship since they see the human being as a union at the physical level (organs) and mental (emotions, thoughts ...) connected to each other by vital energy. it is the only gland in the brain that is not bilaterally replicated and he believed it only existed in humans. This thought gave rise to two different approaches in philosophy in relation to the mind and the body, dualism, which is based on the idea that the mind has its own identity apart from the body, and monism, which tries to explain the functioning of the mind in physical and biological terms and aims to introduce psychology in the field of neurophysiology. It was not again until the 20th century, during World War II, when the importance of the mind in the body was again studied by using Henry Beecher saline injected to try to relieve the pain of soldiers, thus creating the placebo effect and seeing the relevance that thoughts and beliefs have in the treatment of diseases. When mind-body interactions finally began to gain importance was in the 1960s when cardiologist Herbert Benson, the pioneer of mind-body medicine, studied how a person's emotional states influenced blood pressure. After doing experiments on primates and testing their effectiveness, he went on to monitor the pulse, respiration, brain activity and metabolism of a group of young volunteers who practiced transcendental meditation 16. When he saw the results of the experiment, Benson reasoned that this answer was totally contrary to the fight or flight reaction exposed by Walter Cannon in 1920 on the relationship between the neuroendocrine system and stress 9. In this way Benson called the reaction obtained as relaxation response. Currently, according to a 2007 NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme) report, 38% of the US population use some type of complementary or alternative therapy, among them 12% do deep breathing exercises, 9 % use meditation and 6% yoga, although it is seen that more and more people use this type of therapy as the results have increased compared to the 2002 survey. Below we will mention the different types of mind-body therapies that there is, its evolution over time and its current use. 1. CLASSIFICATION OF MIND-BODY THERAPIES There is no standard classification about which therapies are those that are framed in the group of mind-body since, according to the document that contains the basic principles of CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) published in 2011 by the health department and human services of the United States, all these therapies are included in the group: meditation, yoga, qi-gong, tai chi, hypnotherapy, progressive reverie and relaxation, deep breathing exercises and acupuncture ( although the latter is also classified as manipulative and body-based practices). This classification deviates significantly from the one also made in 2011 by the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality in which it is mentioned the existence of 139 natural therapy techniques and they are all classified into five groups, these being: comprehensive or complete systems , biological practices, manipulative and body-based practices, mind-body techniques, and energy-based techniques. In mind-body therapies they include some of those already mentioned such as yoga, meditation and hypnotherapy, but they add apart kinesiology, sophronization and those that use creative solutions based on art, music and dance. Meanwhile, qi-gong is included in energy- based techniques and acupuncture in integral and complete systems therapies. After exposing the above, we come to the conclusion that the mind and body therapies common to all classifications are meditation, yoga and hypnotherapy. Apart in this work we will also include some techniques based on energy such as qi-gong or Tai Chi, by including these meditation and breathing exercises that affect the energy fields that surround a person, and we will also include creative therapies. In addition, we will talk about acupuncture, although it must be borne in mind that this type of technique can easily be framed in any of the other exposed groups. It is worth mentioning that mind-body therapies can also be classifiable according to several factors: 6 - If the technique is administered by the person after training taught by the therapist or if it is administered by a specialist in the chosen field. - Whether attention is directed to a single point or to several - If the action is direct or indirect awareness of the person through mindfulness in the present moment. In this way we are aware of our own mental activity and, in the long run, we will be able not to judge our thoughts, feelings or sensations or those of other people. Although this type of meditation has been less studied than the transcendental one, in recent years it has aroused more interest and the advantages it has in reducing the symptoms of anxiety, depression or sleep disturbances have already been seen. 20. In mindfulness, The person should adopt a sitting position, with the eyes closed and try to focus the mind on the present moment and on the breath, if any thought distracts him, he should take his attention away from it, letting it disappear from his mind. 1.2. YOGA The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit yuj and means to unite, hence the main objective of yoga is to try to create harmony between the body and the mind. This technique has been developed in India and shows that the person is made up of a combination of four factors: the body, mind, energy and emotion. Only a guru is able to find the correct combination of these factors in the person, so this technique always requires the supervision of a specialist in the field. Yoga has eight precepts, which do not have to follow a fixed order and are divided into external yoga (the first five) and internal (the last three). As hatha yoga is the most practiced in the West, we are only going to mention the three most used precepts in this type of yoga, which are: asana, pranayama and nadanusandana Asanas are based on achieving mind-body stability through adoption of different physical postures and the ability to hold that position for a while. Pranayama consists of becoming aware of the breath to later be able to control it and in this way establish dominance over the mind. Finally, the nadanusandana is the meditation phase where we seek to achieve samadhi or final enlightenment based on listening to our own internal sound. Yoga has several advantages, among them are: the improvement of cardiovascular function, increases the functioning of the musculoskeletal system, helps to manage diabetes, hyper or hypotension and respiratory problems, reduces depression, anxiety and stress and regulates the symptoms of menopause among others. 1.2. HYPNOTHERAPY Despite the fact that hypnotherapy has been a technique used for more than six thousand years, the term hypnosis did not come to be formulated until the 19th century, this came from the hand of James Braid who defined it as a \"nervous dream\" and who said that hypnosis was produced by keeping your gaze fixed for a time on an object since this paralyzed the ocular nerve centers, which in turn altered the balance of the central nervous system, thus producing the phenomenon. Many scientists have studied hypnosis but it was Erickson who tried to get the patient, through distractions, to get in touch with his inner being. Hypnosis is a modality of waking consciousness that is characterized by the focus of attention in order to try to generate new knowledge and attitudes in the person that allow them to better cope with their problems or diseases. Although it is usually used as an adjunct to other interventions, it has been seen to be very useful for controlling anxiety, fighting addictions, improving school performance, treating high blood pressure, enuresis, immune disorders, depressive symptoms, fibromyalgia, etc ... 23. 1.2. CREATIVE ARTISTIC THERAPIES They are those that include solutions related to art, music or dance among others. In relation to music therapy, this has been used as therapy since the second half of the nineteenth century because music was considered as an agent that relaxes and distracts man and served to treat states of excitement and nervousness in people. Currently, it has become a scientific therapy studied by many professionals and spread throughout various countries for art therapy, it is based on the use of art to get the patient to reflect their conflicts, their personality, their interests and concerns and, unlike meditation, tries to make the person aware of their thoughts and feelings to create art through their reflection. This technique helps to reduce anxiety, improve the person's self-esteem and make them more aware of their problems. Other types of creative therapies are dance therapy, the use of drama, poetry, bibliotherapy, subsequent manipulation by touch, heat or electricity. The theory is that we can get in touch with our vital energy through specific points in our body that, through the meridians (channels through which energy circulates) restore Qi and balance the forces of jin and jang Insertion of the needles should not be more than 8cm deep and the sensation that the person usually feels is a tingling or tingling that, according to traditional Chinese medicine, indicates that the Qi has been mobilized. After this, it produces an analgesic effect that some authors attribute to the release of endorphins and the activation of the A-delta fibers that conduct nociceptive impulses. Despite the adverse effects that it has been seen to have, such as drowsiness, nausea, anxiety, pain or ecchymosis where the insertion is made or, in severe cases, traumatic wounds, it has been seen that it can be used in the relief of pain, headache, nausea and vomiting, and insomnia. 1. CURRENT SITUATION OF MIND-BODY THERAPIES Unlike developing countries in which traditional medicine is still very widespread and is more used by the population due to its easy access, cost and being highly related to their beliefs, mind-body therapies were not as well recognized in developed countries. This has changed and they are becoming more and more popular due to three factors: the increasing search for health information by the population due to the development of new technologies, the use of these therapies seems to be less harmful than the use of conventional medicine and the growing concern of the population about the possible adverse effects that drugs may have. At the national level there has also been an increase in the use of these techniques, according to a study carried out by the observatory of natural therapies in 2008, the best known by the population are yoga, used by 32% of the population, acupuncture, 31% and Tai-Chi, 13%. It should be noted that it is where Yoga is most practiced and in the northwest and south of the peninsula where acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine are used the most. It is important to say that for the incorporation of mind-body therapies into the health field it is necessary to reduce the importance given to the biomedical model and to begin to focus more on improving the patient's well-being, which is achieved by considering the person as a be holistic and stop focusing so much on diagnoses and procedures Ideally, the health system would be based on a model that takes into account integrative medicine, since it combines the best of conventional and complementary medicine and achieves better results in terms of patient satisfaction, problem solving and symptom treatment among others. This is because this type of medicine takes into account the psycho-emotional factors that affect the health of the person, in this way, managing to focus the care on the patient through a holistic look at the person based on the use of mind-body therapies. This medicine focuses its attention on the importance of psychological stress and its impact on the health of the person It has been seen that educating the population in their self-care through techniques such as mindfulness also helps to integrate and recognize these therapies in the health field and the treatment of Burnout 29, which seriously affects the health of the person and is considered by the WHO as a problem related to difficulties in coping with life. 1. THE BURNOUT PROBLEM Burnout or professional burnout syndrome was a term used for the first time in 1974 by Freudenberger 31 and could be defined as a disease that occurs as a response to being subjected to prolonged pressures related to stressors that develop in the workplace and that They lead to a state of emotional and financial exhaustion characterized by loss of energy, idealism, and purpose. This is considered more than just fatigue and affects the person both physically, psychologically, socially and business. Physically it can lead to sleep problems, migraines, chronic fatigue, weight loss, cardiovascular deterioration and muscle aches among others. At a psychosocial level it can cause depression, anxiety, irritability, difficulties in concentration and behavioral problems that can end up generating high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse or suicide-oriented behaviors. At the business level it causes a decrease in productivity and quality of work, poor treatment of customers, fail to combat the demands of work, another phase of exhaustion, in which the first symptoms of anxiety and fatigue begin to appear, and the last phase of defensive exhaustion, where changes in the worker's behavior such as cynicism, bad relationship with other colleagues or high-risk behaviors. Before the appearance of this problem, companies must take general measures to avoid it, including the continuous review of the company's objectives so that they are realistic and achievable, promote the empowerment of staff, their autonomy and their ability to make decisions, responsible distribution of workloads according to the levels of stress and mental load that they generate and, lastly, promoting equity, creativity and team spirit by constantly evaluating the work climate. These last measures are at the organizational level and to prevent burnout but, on a personal level, it is important to use psychological interventions such as the use of techniques that help increase the capacity for affective-emotional self-care and, for that, it is necessary to know ourselves Both physically and mentally. This brings us back to mind-body therapies, in which techniques such as meditation and yoga can both prevent and treat burnout. In this work we are going to talk about the use of these therapies in Burnout. Burnout has been chosen because it is a global health problem whose incidence is increasing due to the increases in work demands produced by globalization, which make it increasingly difficult to separate a person's private life from their job. This is due to a change in the work model for one in which temporary contracts predominate, which means that there is greater insecurity at work and less control of events by workers with a fixed contract, who must be more flexible and taking on new roles, which leads to more hours and workload, leading to a higher incidence of stress-related mental problems. Its prevalence is worrying in developed countries, seeing that in the United States, according to a 2007 EWCS study, there are 40 million people who suffer from some work-related illness related to stress. In 2009, between 50% and 60% of days lost by workers were due to work stress, in addition, it was found that 22% of the population suffered from it and that it was more prevalent in the new member countries of the EU (30 %) compared to the old ones (20%). It was also found that it affected the education and health sector the most (12% of the total) followed by public administration and defense (11%) and those related to the primary sector (9%). Despite its prevalence and the concern it causes in the workplace, less than a third of workers know the resources they should use to prevent them. It has also been seen that, In countries like Japan, work-related suicide has become a recognized social problem. In addition, it is important to mention that on a financial level burnout causes costs both at the level of absenteeism and productivity, this is seen where absenteeism and presenteeism cause losses of 272 billion euros and a decrease in productivity of 242 billion euros. Work- related mental and behavioral problems in 2010 generated losses of between 150- million euros This is seen where absenteeism and presenteeism cause losses of 272 billion euros and the decrease in productivity of 242 billion euros. Work-related mental and behavioral problems in 2010 generated losses of between 150-372 million euros. This is seen where absenteeism and presenteeism cause losses of 272 billion euros and the decrease in productivity of 242 billion euros. Work-related mental and behavioral problems in 2010 generated losses of between 150-372 million euros. 1. THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE IN NURSING Apart from Burnout, in this work we will talk about mind-body therapies as a treatment for this problem because it has been shown to be effective in stress-related problems and because they are techniques that are increasingly used worldwide. The problem is that the population receives information about these therapies from unreliable sources such as oral transmission (word of mouth), television, radio, non-scientific magazines or, above all, the Internet. That is why it is necessary for people to receive information from reliable sources that know the scientific evidence of these techniques, such as health workers, in our case, nurses, since we are the group that has the most contact with patients. Therefore, it would be necessary for nurses to know this type of technique and be well informed about its usefulness. personal experience (67%) although it is true that they also know about them from scientific journals (61%) continuing education (54%) and programs that are not based on nursing (54%). Another 2008 study by Holroyd et al found that the majority of nurses' sources about complementary therapies were non-scientific magazines and newspapers (64%) friends (57%) books (43%) and the Internet (24%). That said, we see that the information that nurses have about complementary therapies comes from both reliable and unreliable sources and the more information nurses know about the subject, the more they transmit it to the patient. It was seen in a 2009 study by Broom and Adams that most nurses are dissatisfied with the lack of information about complementary therapies but do show interest in learning information about traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. In Australia, most nurses indicate that they have limited knowledge of these therapies, and in a California study only 33% of nurses were able to correctly define what complementary therapies were. Despite not being techniques frequently used in nursing, there are clinical practice guidelines, such as the one carried out by the council of colleges of nurses in Catalonia, which show that these techniques have been studied by the nursing community and that positively affect people's quality of life and well-being. Within the levels of evidence established in the document, going from Ia to IV, we see that almost all the therapies mentioned in this work had a level of Ib (at least one well-designed non-randomized controlled study), which means that there are Sufficient scientific evidence to support their use in the healthcare setting It is also important to say that there are already NICs related to these therapies (such as energy management, music therapy or art therapy) that allow nurses to know the activities to be carried out in the various fields of action in which they can be included, such as: health promotion and education, disease prevention, monitoring of ailments or injuries, collaboration in the treatment of diagnosed disease processes among others. All this shows us that we must approach these techniques from a nursing environment, both healthcare (carry out the administration of these techniques according to the preparation of the nurse and the needs of the person) and administrative (ensure their correct use and the achievement of the chosen objectives) teacher (improve aspects of self-care and prevention at both individual and collaboration in the treatment of diagnosed disease processes, among others. All this shows us that we must approach these techniques from a nursing environment, both healthcare (carry out the administration of these techniques according to the preparation of the nurse and the needs of the person) and administrative (ensure their correct use and the achievement of the chosen objectives) teacher (improve aspects of self-care and prevention at both individual and collaboration in the treatment of diagnosed disease processes, among others.

METHODOLOGY In this work, a narrative review will be carried out about the efficacy of mind-body therapies focused on professional burnout, for this we have to carry out a bibliographic search in different scientific databases and the first thing we have done is look for the Descriptors in Health Sciences corresponding to mind-body therapies and burnout on the virtual health library page.
