Introduction The last few decades have been c haracterized by increased recog nition of the role that community pharmacists play in patient care [1]. A study by Quasim and Bay unus [2] revealed that community pharmacists received visits fro m patients 35 times a year compa red to the four times a year a primary care physician was visited. While the general medical practitioners have traditionally been recognized as the gatekeepers of primary care, studies show that community pharmacists recei ve an estimated 12 to 15 consultations each year [1]. Community pharmacists are st rategically positioned to play a central role in care delivery; moreover, Kayyali [3] pointed out that c ommunity pharmacists are the largest and most accessible healthcare professional since they are loca ted at the frontline of care delivery. Pharmacists play an important rol e in the healthcare system and have a greater impact on the outcome of public health programs. Community pharmacist has traditional ly played a critical role in patient training [4]. However, numerous s tudies have pointed to deficie ncies in pharmacist-patient communication regarding health products and nutritional choices . Some studies have suggested the need for effective training to promote improved healthcare outc omes. According to Hadi et al. [5,6], patients who seek nutrition and vitamin advice presume the role of community pharmacists include recommendation of effective vitamin and nutritional products. H owever, the professional responsibilities of pharmacists with respect to product and adv ice on nutrition is not w ell established. Besides, the nature of therapeu tic conditions in vitamins and n utritional deficiency cases means that the success of complementary medication depends on finding s that right therapy which varies from an individual to individual [7]. This implies that communi ty pharmacists must have knowledge about vitamin and nutritional supp lement products to effectivel y advise the consumers on vitamins, and nutrition, deficiencies treatment. Consequently, they must have the right attitude and appropriate counseling skills to effectively dispense their duties. Prior s tudies have shown that consumers routinely ask their pharmacist f or information about vitamins a nd nutritional choice s and seek advice on these products as part of the pharmacy practice [8,9]. A previous survey in Australia found that an estimated 87% of the consumers e xpect pharmacists to provide th em with sufficient information about nutrition and vitamin product efficacy. 92% of those who were s urveyed in this study pointed out that they also expected to receive safety information regarding thes e products [10]. Most of the vitamin and nutrition supplement consumers believe that the role of pha rmacists is to provide recommendations about effective vitamin and nutrition supplemen t products and reliably detect and restrain interactions between the conventional me dicines and supplementary nutritional products [7]. Despite the high-level expecta tion about community pharmacists by vitamin and nutritional supplement seekers, most of the pharmacists rate their knowledg e about CAMs as inadequate. A study conducted by Abadel [11] found that most community pharmacists do not feel confident in answering 699 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712. patient questions on dietary a nd nutritional choices. Numerous studies have also illustrated the lack of knowledge or inadequate education in supplement products among pharmacists [12-14]. The lack of knowledge incapacitates pharmacis ts to provide informative cons ultation on nutritional and vitamin choices to the consumers. The lack of counseling skills has als o been cited as one of the primary challenges that many pharmacists face while providing care [15, 16]. To our knowledge, there is paucity in studies considering pharmacists' knowledge, attitude s, and practice of community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia towa rds providing counseling on vit amins and nutritional products. Thus, this study aimed to study knowle dge, attitudes, and practice of community pharmacists towards providing counseling on vitamins and nutrition deficiencies tre atment in Saudi Arabia. The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and pr actice of community pharmacists towards providing counselli ng on vitamins and nutrition deficiencies treatment in Saudi Arabia. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study design and selection criteria A cross-sectional study design was adopted to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of community pharmacists towar ds providing counseling on vitami ns and nutrition deficiencies treatment in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted between Sept ember 2019 and April 2020. The study targeted registered community pharmacists working dir ectly with pharmaceutical product consumers in the country. They must be registered as pharmacist and work in community pharmacies in the country. The pharmacist must have at least a bachelor's degree certification or higher degree and willing to participate in the study. 2.2. Study procedure The study processes began with the construction of survey instr uments that were designed to capture data on the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of commu nity pharmacists towards providing counseling on vitamins and nutriti onal supplements. First, all survey questions were obtained from relevant literature. Then, field experts selected questions to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of community pharmacist s towards providing counseling on vitamins and nutritional supplements in Saudi Arabia. To validate the survey content, we conducted a pilot study. Finally, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficien t test to measure the internal consistency. The survey instruments were organized into three sections. The first section captured the demographic characteristics of t he targeted population\u2014age, gen der, level of education, years of practice, area of residence, and practice setting. The second s ection captured the pharmacists' knowledge about vitamins and nutritional deficiencies. A five-p oint Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disa gree was used to capture the k nowledge of the community pharmacists. The last section to covered pro fessional practice, attitudes, a nd beliefs towards counseling by the community pharmacists on nutritional and supplementary products . Practice was measured by the frequency of counselling consumers while dispensing vitamins an d nutritional supplem ents, ability to make follow up after dispensing vitamins and nutritional supple ments, frequency of customer demand 700 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712. for more information, and the mate rials relied on when making d ecision on which vitamins and supplements to dispense. The survey instrument was then entered into google survey instr ument and distributed to the target population. It was expected that each interview will tak e an average of 10 to 15 minutes. To increase the rates of participat ion in the study, the researche r offered a clear explanation of the purpose of the study and the potential benefits associated with the res ults of the study to pharmacy as a profession as well as the benefits to the patient and the healt h sector in general. 2.3. Statistical methods The data collected was cleaned, organized, and entered in the S tatistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 25.0. The de mographic characteristics of the sampled population was analyzed and grouped based on their descri ptive statistics. To determine the pharmacists' attitudes and practices towards providing counseling on vitamins, and nutrition, defici encies treatment, a Kruskal Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison test was conducted. A Kruskal W allis Test is a non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA test which is used to test for dif ferences between groups when the dependent variables are ordinal. A p-value of 0.5 was considered statistically significant. 2.4. Ethical consideration An ethical approval was obtaine d from the authority responsible for pharmacy research and ethics in the University board. In addition, a written consent form wa s provided electronically where the respondents had to agree to partic ipating into the research bef ore filling the questionnaires. The consent form explained the purpose of the study, guaranteed dat a safety, and explained how the data will be used in the study. Imperatively, no personally identifi able data will be used in the study. 3. Results 3.1. Reliability and consistency Cronbach's alpha test was 0.84 on the seven questions regarding the practice of Pharmacists in Saudi Arabia measured on a Likert scale. The alpha test value s hows that the survey has a good internal consistency. 3.2. Demographic characteristics A total of 1199 questionnaires were distributed electronically. Of this, only 1041 were responded to representing an 86.8% success rate. A significant majority o f the respondents in this study (80.7%) were young pharmacists in their ea rly years of their career (23 -34 years), 17.9% were within the age bracket of 35 and 44 years while 1.3% of the respondents were between the age of 45-54 years. Majority of the respondents were males (98.7%) with women takin g a minority status in the community pharmacy circles (1.3%). Most of respondents were non -Saudi residents (96.4%) while 701 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712. only 3.6% of the sampled population were Saudi residents. A sig nificant majority of the community pharmacists in this study were married (78.4%), 0.4% had been d ivorced, while 21.2% were single. Most of the community pharmacist surveyed in this study were wo rking from cities (91.0%) with only a small proportion working in t he villages (9.0%). The western and central region of Saudi Arabia represented the largest block of the community pharmacists in t his study (35.6% and 24.0% respectively). The southern region of the country accounted for 19.9 % of the total surveyed population, while the rest of the regions were distributed almost equally ( 9.4% eastern region, 11.0% for the Northern region). To a large ext ent, the samples collected repr esented the opinion of pharmacists on all the blocks of the country. Majority of the pharmacists work ing in the country have a minimum qualification of a bachelor's degree, (88.9%). Most of the pharmacists surveyed in this study described themselves as pharmacists (75.6%) with 23.2% considering themse lves as senior pharmacists. A small number of community pharmacist surveyed in this study did not h ave Saudi board certification, accounting for 76.0% of the total population. Only 24.0% had certification from the board. For years of practice, 47.5% of the surveyed population had 6-10 years of experience as pharmacists, 26.2% had 2-5 years of experience, 23.3% of the population had over t en years of experience as community pharmacists, while 3.2% were unde r the two-year experience. Dai ly, the majority of the pharmacists attended to an estimated 100-200 patients (62.3%) with only 22. 7% attending to more than 200 customers per day. At least 15.0% of the surveyed population at tended to less than 100 customers in a single day (Table 1). 3.3. Pharmacists knowledge about vitamins and nutr ition deficiencies trea tment in Saudi Arabia To test the knowledge of community pharmacist about vitamins an d nutritional deficiency treatment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the researcher obtain ed responses on the pharmacists training on vitamins and nutritional substance, the most freque nt consumers of vitamins and nutritional supplements, the top five vitamins and nutritional substances in their point of sale, and the most common uses of vitamins and nutritional products [15]. When asked whether they had received any form of training with respect to vitamins and nutritional supplements, 86.4% agreed to have received a form of training in vitamins and nutritional supplements, 13.6% had not received any form to training concerning nutritional supplements and vitamins.

The responded were asked to choose five of the most commonly co nsumed multivitamins from a list of 36 vitamins and nutriti onal supplements as follows Vi t C., Vit E, Vit A, Fish oil, Amino acids, Antioxidants, Beta-carotene, Bee-pollen, Black rotein powder, Multivitamins, Caffeine, Glutamine, and Multimineral. From this list, the respondents pr oduced a list characterized by hundreds of combinations based on the characteristics of their point of sale. Specifically, 452 combinations from the selected drugs were products with some gaining the most frequency. Multivitamins, fish oil, omega-3 antioxidants, and vitamin C appeared in most of the com bination. The data was then further sorted to identify similarities in combination from the community pharmacist. The following diagrams capture the most popular combination from the list of 452 produced by the respondents. From the table, a combination of Multivitamins, Vit C., Vit. D., Fish oil, Omeg a-3 was produced 94 times accounting 7.8% of the total combinations p roduced. The distribution of th e various combinations generated is shown below (Table 2).

To identify the most common users of vitamins and multivitamins , the pharmacists were asked to choose a combination from a list of 18 possible users as fol lows, Anemia, Blood di sorder, Boosting immunity, Cold/Flu, Diabetes, Elderly situations, General healt h, Hair, skin and nail condition, Hypertension, Loss of appetite, Nutritional deficiencies, Pregnancy and lactation Prophylactic antioxidant, ht gain/loss. From this list, the respondents produced a combination of sixty possible users based on the usage of vitamins and nutritional supp lements from their point of sal e. Children, Adult men, Elderly, Pregnant or lactating women, Patients with Chronic Diseases wer e identified as the most common users of vitamins and nutritiona l supplements accounting for 13 .2% of the total popul ation surveyed. Imperatively, adult men, the eld erly, and children featured predominantly in all the combination produced from the provi ded options (Table 3). 704 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712.

Practice The practice of community pharm acist in this study was assessed by obtaining responses concerning frequency of counselli ng consumers while dispensing vitamins and nutritional supplements, ability to make follow up after dispensing vitamin s and nutritional supplements, frequency of customer demand for more information, and the mate rials relied on when making the decision on which vitamins and supplements to dispense. The practice of counselling is a complex process; however, these activities were identified as the key e lements in the practice of community pharmacist while ex ecuting their duties. When asked how often they counsel patients and consumers about the side effects of vitamins and nutritional supplements consumption, a descriptive analysis of the sample resulted in a mean of 4.19 with a statistic skew of 0.811. The histogram output was skewed to the right, indicating that most of the responses ranged from quite often to always. These results indicated that most of the community pharmacist counsel the ir patients and consumers about the side effects of vitamins and nutritional supplements (Table 4). Table 4.

Equally important in determining the ability of community pharm acists to make informed counselling decisions during practice are the facts that influe nce their decision making when prescribing, recommending or dis pensing vitamins and nutritiona l supplements. A pe rcentile analysis of the responses indicated that a combination of availability, effectiveness and cost were the leading factors considered when making recommendations, prescription or dispensing vitamin s and nutritional supplements among Saudi Arabian c ommunity pharmacists (Table 5).

Discussion The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of community pharmacists towards providing c ounselling on vitamins and nutri tion deficiencies treatment in Saudi Arabia. Today, it is widely acknowledged that community pharmac ist is more likely to prescribe medication a shift from their traditional role of dispensing dr ugs.

The Saudi population is traditionally known for its use of alternative me dicines; vitamins and nutritional supplements are among the most p opularly consumed medical produ cts in Saudi today [11,18]. The pharmaceutical demands of society mean that community pharmacis ts must demonstrate efficacy in the knowledge, competence in the execution of the duties and the right attitudes towards counselling while executing their duties. Yet, despite t he high-level expec tation about community pharmacists by vitamin and nutritional supplement seekers, most of the pharmacists rate their knowledge about CAMs as inadequate. The number of studies demonstrating this fact is myriad. The most popular of these studies include those conducted by Abadel [11], who found that most of the community pharmacists do not feel confident in answering patient questions on vitamin and nutritional choices. Numerous studies have also illustrated the lack of knowledge or inadequate education in supplement products among pharmacists [12-14]. The lack of knowledge incapacitates pharmacists to provide informative consultation on nutritional and v itamin choices to the consumers. Besides, the lack of counselling skills has also been cited as one of the primary challenges that many pharmacists face while providing care. This study closes this gap by assessing how community pha rmacists in Saudi Arabia are prepared to handle the complex demand of the Saudi population concerning vitamins and nutrit ional supplement use. Demographically, the sampled co mmunity pharmacists were compose d of expatriates suggesting that a large number of the community pharmacists in the country were experts from other countries. Also, most of the community pharmacists were males which was co nsistent with the tradition and regulations of the country in re lation to community pharmacists ' services. The least qualification for most of the community pharmacis ts surveyed for this study was t he bachelor's degree. 4.1. Knowledge and the ability to co nfidently offer vitamins and nut ritional counselli ng to patients The pharmacists surveyed in this study were extensively informe d about the most common forms of vitamins and nutritional supple ments demands of the Saudi Ar abian population. For example, it was established that out of a list of 36 vitamins and nutritional supplements Vit C., Vit E, Vit A, Fish oil, Amino acids, Antioxidants, M ultivitamins, fish oil, omega-3 antioxidants, and vitamin C appeared in most of the combination . The data was then further sorted to identify similarities in combination from the community pharmac ist and a combination of Multivitamins, Vit C., Vit. D., Fish oil, Omega-3 was produced 94 times accounting for 7.8% of the total combinations p roduced. This result demonstrated knowledge not just of the available vitamins and nutritional supplements but also the nature of products consumed within the country. Also, the sample of community pharmacists surveyed in this study was the most common users of vitamins and nutritional supplements. From a list of items designed specific a l l y t o t e s t t h e k n o w l e d g e o f t h e community pharmacists on the type of consumers of vitamins and nutritional products, the respondents produced a combination of sixty possible users. Children, Adult men, Elderly, Pregnant or lactating 708 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712. women, Patients with Chronic Diseases were identified as the mo st common users of vitamins and nutritional supplements accounting for 13.2% of the total popul ation surveyed. Imperatively, adult men, the elderly, and children fe atured predominantly in all th e combination produced from the provided options. To determine whether the knowledge possessed by the surveyed sa mple was sufficient to adopt or reject the first hypothesis ra ised in this study, comparative analysis in the form of Friedman test\u2014 a non-parametric altern ative to one-way ANOVA test which is use d to test for differences between groups when the dependent variables are ordinal was used. A p-value of 0.5 indicated sufficiency in knowledge to support the hypothesis that Community pharmacists in the country possess adequate knowledge to confidently offer vitamin and nutrition counselling to patients in the country. Knowledge is cited as one of the primary tenets determining the capacitie s of community pharmacists. Community pharmacists are expected to be aware of a wide range of pharmac eutical products, side effects of various products, remedies to the side effects, the reaction of drugs in relation to other products, as well as the nature of consumers of their products. Knowledge is a strategic resource in community pharmacy has been established in many studies. Shilbayeh [15] found that knowledge about pharmaceutical products was central to the effective dispensing of pharmaceutical products among community pharmacist in Palestine. In this study, the community pharmacists surve yed demonstrated sufficient knowledge on the cons umers, vitamins and nutrients supplements and counselling. 4.2. Attitude and the prac tice towards counselling As identified, previous practice in this study was assessed thr ough community pharmacists' ability to counsel consumers, while dispensing vitamins and nut ritional supplements , ability to make follow-ups after dispensing vita mins and nutritional supplement s, frequency of customer demand for more information, and the materials relied on when making the d ecision on which vitamins and supplements to dispense [19-22]. In relation to the practice of counselling, a mean of 4.19 with a statistical skew of 0.811 was re corded. These results indicate d that most of the community pharmacist counsel their patients and consumers about the side effects of vitamins and nutritional supplements. As to whether the respondents made follow-ups afte r dispensing vitamins and supplements to patients and consumers, a significant majority o f the surveyed population, 66.72%, agreed to make follow-ups. An estimated 20% of the surveyed com munity pharmacist in the country did not make follow up after dispensing vitamins and nutritiona l supplements Equally important in determining the ability of comm unity pharmacist to make informe d counselling decisions during practice what the facts that in fluence their decision making wh en prescribing, recommending or dispensing vitamins and nutritiona l supplements. A percentile a nalysis of the res ponses indicated that a combination of availability, ef fectiveness and cost were the leading factors considered when making recommendations, prescription or dispensing vitamins and nutrit ional supplements among Saudi Arabian communit y pharmacists. The paper set out to determine wh ether the community pharmacist s surveyed in the country possessed the right attitude towar ds the practice of counsellin g for vitamins and nutritional supplements by comparing how attitudes relate to counselling pr actice. The results of the study demonstrated that community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia possess positive attitudes and practice 709 AIMS Public Health Volume 7, Issue 3, 697-712. towards providing counselling on vitamins, and nutrition, defic iencies treatment. The results of this study painted a positive picture with respect to the practice of counselling among community pharmacists when dispensing, reco mmending or prescribing vitami ns and nutritional supplements. The results of this study are consistent with previous studies in the region with respect to the practice of community pharmacist in disp ensing vitamins and nutritional supplements. A study conducted by Ghosn, Addison, & Ali [23] the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia found th at community pharmacist in the country possesses a significant amount of knowledge to meet the demands for practice in pharmaceutical settings. The pr actice of counselling is, howeve r, one of the least explored duties of community pharmacists in contempo rary Saudi Arabian pharmaceuti cal literature [24]. In this study, the pharmacist demonstrated eff ectiveness in counselling, follo w up activities, and the practice of vitamins and nutritional supplement dispensing. One of the primary characteristics of the consumers of vitamins and nutrients is th eir information- seeking behavior. The results of the study established that a significant population of consumers of vitamins and nutritional supplements were interested in obtaining more information about the nature of the products being consumed. The data was distributed betwee n very good 27.36% and good 39.70% indicating that over 75% of the consumers attending comm unity pharmacist are interested in obtaining data about the nature of vitamins and nutritional sup plements dispensed. This suggested that community pharmacist should be aware of the various brands, sup plements, and vitamins available in the market, the working mechanism and the side effects [25,26]. Previous studies [27,28] have shown that community pharmacists dispensing vitamins and supplements should be aware of the drugs interactions with vitamins and the various supplement products, the side effects of the products [29]. A study conducted by Song et al. [30] found that there was a si gnificant correlation between the health condition being treated and the nature of vitamins and suppleme nts being used. Srikanth et al. [31] found that different groups consume vitamins and nutritional su pplements for different reasons. As such, community pharmacists should have the right knowledge of vitamins and nutritional supplements in order to match t he demands of the consumers. In relation to the practice of information acquisition, Williamson et al. [9] found that most community pharmacists obtained information from the internet, p harmacy journals, specific governments websites. The widespread use of smartphones has mad e it possible for both consumers and community pharmacist to have a wide range of information re sources. 5. Limitations of the study While all the necessary precautions were taken to improve the r eliability and validity of the samples collected, several chal lenges could have affected the i nterpretations and conclusions arrived in this study. The primary limit ation of this study was its ent ire reliance on self-administered questionnaires for data collecti on. This method of data collect ion is known to have a likelihood of response bias. In addition, the use of self-evaluation question s to determine the knowledge of community pharmacist on nutrients and vitamins was also another limitation for the study. There is also the increased chance of recall bias since some of the requ ired information came from a distant past.
