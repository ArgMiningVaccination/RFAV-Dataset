On May 20, 2004, the Committee members met in closed session and receiv ed briefings -- at a Sensitive level -- from M r. Ed Gabriel, Deputy Commissioner, NY Office of Emergency Management, on details of t he New Yor k City's preparedness and countermeasures plans and capabilities. The Committee was later briefed by Dr. Sally Beatrice of the Public Health Lab on thei r role in homeland security. The Committee then traveled to various operational si tes involved with countermeasures. On May 21, 2004, from 8:15 a.m. - 11:45 a.m., HSSTAC members were briefed at the Environmental Measurem ents Laboratory - at the classified (SECRET) level - by the Directors of the Chemic al & Biologic al Countermeasur es Portfolio, Radiation & Nuclear Countermeasures Portfolio and the S&T Policy Planning. Briefings included: (1) activities and accomplishment s of the Chemical & Biologic al Countermeasures Portfolio, given by Dr. John Vitko, Dir ector, D HS S&T, Chemical & Biologic al Countermeasures Portfolio; (2) activities and accomplishments of the Radiation & Nuclear Countermeasures Portfolio, given by Dr. Sonya Bowyer, Director, DHS S&T, Radiation & Nuclear Counterm easures Portfolio; (3) activities and accomplishments of the S&T Policy Planning Portfolio, given by Mr. Vayl Ox ford, Special Assistant, DHS S&T, S&T Policy Planning. The meeting adj ourned at 11:45 a.m., fo llowed by the public session from 12:30 p. m. to 4:00 p.m. The public session of the meeting on Ma y 21, 2004 in New York City convened at 12:30 p.m. Following is a transcript of the proceedings. GENERAL WELCH: I welcome y ou here today and I have a couple opening comments specifically for our guests. In this session vi sitors are not invited to participate, but only to observe. If you do have input, we'd like to have those inputs, and you can provide those to the e-mail site which is at www.dhs.gov/hsstac. The minutes of this open session will be posted on the HSST AC web site. I would now ask Dr. McQueary to give his presentation. DR. MCQUEARY: Mr. Chairman. Since we've been together for two days, some of this is redundant. Our guests can put into context what we've been talking about. I 1 want to public ly thank each of you servi ng on the Homeland Security S&T Advisory Committee. This is a very important committ ee. While this is only the second time we have met, i t is very gratifying to see the progress and level of interest and knowledge that each of you has demonstrated in the tw o days that we've been together here. So I'm looking forward to your continued advic e and suppor t as we go forward in shaping the Department. I was happy to have a chance yesterday to see some of the operational aspects of what we're trying to do, so we can begin to put into context the magnitude of issues with whic h that the Depar tment has to deal. What I want to do, very briefly, is to cover some of the important steps that we'v e taken within the Science & Technology Directorate as a part of the Depar tment of Homeland Security. To put that in context, I want to remind you of our mission and that mission is to conduct and stimulate research and developm ent and testing and evaluation and to ensure the timely transition of security capabi lities to the state, local and operational end users. That's what we're looking for, and we need input from many different sources. Vayl Oxfor d talked earlier about the st rategic planning cycle; we're pleased with the cycle. The first Science & Technology five -year strategic plan will lay out (we're not quite finished yet) the full R& D test and evaluation program t hat we have to execute on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security. We execut e our programs in a highly matr ixed fashion, and specifically we have four units that constitute the Department. Within the Science & Technology Directorate, we have the Office of Plans, Programs and Budget, the Office of R esearch and Development, the Homeland Security Advanc ed Research Projects Agency, and finally we have the Systems Engineer ing and Development Office. We have the portfolio managers to manage the mission and scientif ic areas in which we operate. Each of the portfolio managers ac tually handles work that is done in each of the line organizations that I've mentioned earlier. Qu ite frankly, it is extremely im portant that we operate this S&T Direct orate as a matrix organization in order to insure deploy ment of information throughout the various elements that make it up. We will continu e to refine the strategic plan; this is just a firs t step. Strategic planning is something that continues on a yearly basis, but having a firm five-year strategic pl an puts us in a much stronger position to evolve that plan on a yearly basis as we go forward. Each one of the portfolios I mentioned will have its own input in to that particular plan. Secretary Ridge testified a couple days ago before the 9/11 Commission and mentioned several things. O ne that I wanted to touch on in detail because of its importance was the announcement that we are going to form a new Office of Interoperability Cap ability, and I'll try to be precise what we mean by that. By the way, the new office will be managed by the Science & Tech nology Director, specifically. We have not named the indiv idual wh o will lead that yet. A very important part of the subset of that Inter operability Capability group is a program called 2 SAFECOM, which we picked up responsibilit y a few months ago. SAFECOM is an acronym for the name for a program that de als with int eroperable wire communications for state and local gov ernments. This is a very large program amplified in detail because of the difficulties we had on 9/11 wh ich the fireman could not communicate with the police and so forth. We're approaching this interoperable c ommunications issue from two standpoints: (1) a near-term soluti on, which we are working on; and (2) the long-term issue of having the country as a w hole have interoperable communications among the various elements that make up th e first respondent community. It is a complex problem bec ause a solution cannot be to go in and tell them to throw away what they've got and start all over. The em bedded costs of the capi tal equipment that the community has right now is measured in billions of dollars and, therefore, it is not feasible to say let's start over. So we have to have a plan that will evolve thos e communications into a fully in teroperable capability. The first step will be, and we expect to hav e some test sites available not later than the end of September of this year, to put in place interoperable communications that will be constructed at sites w here an in cident may have occurred or has occurred. There are several companies that have developed what I'll call a communications device that permits radios and ess entia lly any frequency and format to communicate with one another, so this will be the first step that we pl an to take in a number of geograph ic areas in the United States. It will be a first step in moving towards fully operable s ystems. We recently issued a statem ent of requirements, in ot her words, w hat are we looking for in the area of the interoperable c ommunications coming under SAF ECOM. The point that we touched upon earlier is that this statement of requirements is put together by bringing together peopl e, representatives from some 44,000 different tribal, state, and l ocal entities to have input in this . So we believe that we've touched every single agency or association that has strong interest in maki ng sure that their interests are represented. In some regards we reached agreement among all of these groups that we interacted with that issued that devic e, so we view this as a first step. I encourage you to watch what happens beca use it will b e the first ti me that this country has, I think, taken a significant step in the direction of ac hieving interoperable communications. Another major step that has been extremely important to us is the creation of the University Centers of Exc ellence. For t he Department of Homeland Security to be successful, and particularly for Science & T echnology to be successful, we must have a strong relationship wit h the university communi ties and private industry, as well as the federal and National L abs. A way to facilitat e that relati onship with the universities was to establish the Centers of Excellence. The first center was chosen in November of last year to be the Univ ersity of Southern California, and their focus is on the economic consequences of terrorist threats and attacks. A nd so we felt that was t he important first step to look at. We just named, about two weeks ago, two other Centers of Excellence: One is the University of 3 Minnesota, which is really a cons ortium of several univ ersities, and their focus will be on post-harvest food supply safety; and the Texas A&M University, which also represents a consortium of universities, and they will focus their energies on the consequences of foreign animal and zoonotic diseases, those t hat can be transmitted from ani mals to human beings. We're pleased to have those thr ee Centers of Excellenc e in operation. We already have our universities pr ogram group working on developing the request for proposals for the next round of Univ ersity Centers of E xcellence. We can afford within our current budgets (current being defined as what has been appropriated and what has been proposed by the President for the FY05) a total of five University Centers of Exc ellence, so that's the path that we're curr ently going down. We're not going public yet with what t he next two will be, but certainly I can tell you that the examination of the psychology of terrorism i s high on the list of considerations as we go forward. The associated work is in the area of scholars and fellows. The Department was formed in March 2003. We made an early decis ion that we were going to very quickly establish s cholarships and fellowships that will be ass ociated wit h Department of Homeland Security. We have 100 of thos e, 50 scholarships for undergraduate students and 50 for graduate students, which are fe llowships. They are quite generous scholarships and fellowships . The undergraduate scholarship s pay $1,000 plus tuition and required fees for the particular universit y where they want to go. The graduate fellows hips are $2,300 a month, plus tuition and required fees; and the third element of the program is that we expect each one of the recipients to participat e for about eight to ten weeks at some locations -- could be Secr et Service, part of Science and Technology, or a National Lab -- that way we insure that they have an exper ience that can be relevant to the development of a strong scholast ic base for Department of Homeland Security. We expect, within the next few months , to announce the next 100, which will bring us to about 20 people that we will hav e on scholarships and fellows hips. Again, we view that as extremely important. On a separate subject, I'll talk briefl y about the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency. That organiza tion was created by th e legislation that formed the Department of Homeland Security. Its primary function is to interface with the public- private sector, if you wi ll, and to do so we've issued six broad agency announc ements so far. We have three more that will be coming up very shortly. The solic itations deal with the standard threat scenario s that we deal with: biological, radiologic al and nuclear, and advanc ed security devices. So far we have 131 contracts and we're working hard to get the money that we have appropriated on the streets so that we can begin working on those issues expeditiously. Within a very few weeks, we'll have a broad agenc y announc ement which will solic it research and new approaches for railroad and suicide bom b detection and interdiction. 4 Lastly, I think it's impor tant to wrap up with a c ouple com ments about where we are here in New York City. It's been over two years since 9/11 in which the Twin Towers collapsed. If you have forgotten about that, go out in the hall and look at the picture of the savage attack that occurred in this city. General Welch made comments in an earlier session when we wer e discussing these issues about how New York City has really recovered, and to a large measure so me of that recovery is that in this past year profits on Wall Street hav e reached almost $17 billion, t hat's the highest since the year before 2002 when the profits that year were some $21 billion. Unemployment in the city has gone below eight percent for the fi rst time si nce 2002. In the first quarter of this year, the city gained some 20,000 new jobs; and the city's spending was about $3 billion in the previous two year s. An important statistic i s our prime interest rate is down from three years ago. These ar e all statistics that came out of the NYC Mayor's office, but they are indicativ e, I think, of the re solve that people in this country have when something happens and what we can do to come back. While we c an certainly mourn, thin k about, and plan for future attacks, the resilie ncy this country has is what the Depar tment of Homeland Se curity is really about and is helping protect. The issue is not about protecting you or me, but it's about protecting this country so that people who come after us have the opportunity to live in a free and open society that we all grew up with. That's fundamentally the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security in concert with many other government, state and local agencies. Quite frankly, we will nev er reach the point where we have perfect security. One can postulate a threat that we haven't thought of, but I am confident that the way this country and the people are pulling together to work is very important. We can make ourselves much safer so that we can get to the stage, I believe, which is really the important one. We need to be able to live our lives so t hat we can feel co mfortable with where we are in homeland s ecurity and the way we th ink about it. Much the same way it is with policemen, firemen -- we don't have perfect police protection or fire protection, but we have enough so we feel comfortable abou t going and living our lives. Thank you very much for what yo u're doi ng to help us on this. I gratef ully appreciate it. I'm sure Secretary Ridge could be more eloquent if he were here, but we appreciate people like you who are spending your time to try to help us make sure that w e're doing the things that are necessary in order to make this country a safer place for all of us. Thank you. GENERAL WELCH: Thank you. DR. SHINE: Mr. Chairman, I think the co mments with regard to resiliency is also reflected in the spirit and the attitudes of the personnel with whom we met yesterday as we went to the various places around the city, and I want to co mmunicate from the committee our appreciation to those groups wit h whom we met, thank them for their willingness to share their exper iences , commend them on their commitment and acknowledge the fact t hat they are operating in the spir it of post 9/11 in an exemplary manner. 5 DR. MCQUEARY: One of those polic emen told me he lost 32 friends. DR. SHINE: I would like to for mally make such a stat ement, Mr . Chairman, which we should com municate to those folks because they were really terrific. GENERAL WELCH: One of the comment s that I heard after our experience yesterday was about the profe ssionalism of everybody that we encountered. Also, the fact that while we're not yet happy with the capabilities th ey have, that they are absolutely doing the utmost with those capa bilities. I'd like to ask you, Chuck [McQueary], to comment on t he overall com plexity and how we think about dealing with that, if we have the federal, state, and possi bly Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy and the Department of Defense in the equation. We have started to put that kind of a matrix together and to stress the im portance of the matrix , but it is a much bigger, broader, more comp lex matrix than S&T. DR. MCQUEARY: Although on a minuscule scale compared to the one applied here, any work on the matrix organization refl ects the importance of having a clear line of authority and responsibility. If there are not clear lines of communication, conflict between agencies can arise in regards to thei r indiv idual missions and how they are to interact. S o far we have had 10 Homeland Security directives that have attempted, some in detail, to identify what those role s and responsibilities are; and I think that's a major step in helping c larify who's doing what in time of a crisis. W hether or n ot it's finished, I think the working groups that we put together to engage the various agencies that have a major stake in this form an import ant relationship. Again, the clear lines of responsibility have to be defined so so meone can deal with any consequenc e. DR. HAPPER: Chuck [McQueary], I would gue ss, some of our allies such as the British are trying to do much the same as you are. Do you have counterparts? DR. MCQUEARY: In fact, I have had severa l important interact ions. Professor David King is chief scientific advisor to the British Government. We have a number of UK people here, and we have learned things from them. We have people heading the national programs who were in the UK about two weeks ago. Again, we want to ensure that we have a good understanding of their capabilities because that relationship is important. Similarly, the rela tionship with the Canadians is important; Mexico is another issue. But one thing I can comment upon, we have encouraged T exas A&M to bring in a Mexican university as part of the work we're doing on lar ge animal disease because of the important relationship. We also encoura ged the University of Minnesota to bring in someone from a Canadian university so we c an begin those ties. We talked a bit about the consequences of biological attack, and I'll always remember the fi rst time that was discussed. David King told me the following story: The British had procedures in place if they had a biologic al attack, but he said the consequence of having to go public and saying t hey had cause to wait longer just to be sure, although a few days, was that they had to slaughter twice as many animals than necessary. They reacted instantly with the plans they had in place at the time when 6 they first made the detections, and that gets to the heart of somethi ng we talked about this morning; that is, how important it is in a biological threat to be able to decide early on so you can get on with your consequenc e management process -- it is very, very important. Just to follow up. We' ve also had a number of interacti ons with the Israelis (they have more experience than anybody, particularl y with those who blow themselves up) and with the Japanes e, although more limited in that area; and we are beginning to reach out to Australia. We had interactions with Australia just a short ti me ago. So it is important we reach out, but we , frankly, foc us on more things that we need to here. That's an area where any advice and relati onships you have and want to follow up on would certainly be pleased to have that opportunity to so. MR. VITTO: You talked about SAFECOM and interoperability. Is there any encryption associated with that? DR. MCQUEARY: No, not at this stage, although that will be something that has to essentially be inclu ded in it. I'm confi dent that will evo lve. It makes the problem harder as you and I obviously know. GENERAL WELCH: One of the subj ects that comes up repeatedly in discussions with local or state authorities is having enough c onfidence in the indicators that are present to commit re sources and take action, but which may turn out to have been unnecessary. So I think one of the real i ssues that we need to address is how do you gain that kind of interacti on with state and local authorities so that they can indeed take maximum advantage of what DHS can provide. DR. MCQUEARY: We ll, certainly trai ning programs are i mportant. The emergency room preparedness is sue response organiz ation has a lot of interaction in that relationship. Our interaction, S&T's in teractions with state and local authorities has largely been confined, although we've had a num ber of i nteractions on the biological side. For SAFECOM, I mentioned earlier, we didn't bring in 4,000 people, but we brought in representatives from all the agencies to engage in what we're doing. We have an active program within t he Department in whic h we actually issued 12 standards in less than a year, which is quite remarkable compared to the time i t takes to g et those standards out. To create these standards and maximiz e their saliency, a standards group was created to gain a cons ensus from various agencies and localities to discuss the issues at hand. We also work very cl osely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, whic h is under the Department of Commerce, in helping us decide what to do, because they are the experts on the standards issue, and they've been very helpful to us. In fa ct, they loaned us people, one person in particular, to define our effort in creating standards, and they worked with us to issue standards quickly, which is faster than what they've normally done, and I thin k that i s indicative of their intent. 7 Back to the point that you r eally asked about. I've descr ibed activities. I did not describe a plan. We have a way to go to plan how to move forward in all the areas where we have responsibilities. MR. IBARRA: General Welch, one of the things that I see happening in regards to SAFECOM and first responders is that the te chnology is already out there. There are companies that can already do the inte roperability with all the first responders throughout the country. I think you hit right on it, Secretary McQueary, that where we need to get involved is with the local authorities or their organizations, to bring them in, make them feel part of DHS. I do get a sense also that when the federal gov ernment comes into a state, the first responders ar e made to feel part of the group which will open it up much more quickly. DR. MCQUEARY: I think a point that Se cretary Ridge lik es to make when he is talking about Homeland Security is that it is not a federal issue, it's a national issue, and our job is to try to muster the national resources on this, not view it as the federal governmen t is going to tell people this is what you're going to do. It will not wo rk. The individual localities, small town, large town , whatever, have to rely on their experience and what they do. We can provide a lot of help and guide them in a distribution that can be beneficial and also help them move in the direction of having a better interoperability capability than what we do right now. MR. IBARRA: Is there a budget allotted for going out to cities that are over a million-and -a-half? DR. MCQUEARY: I don't know if we have it broken down that way. Let me describe to you what our intent is. We have within the Office of Domestic Preparedness a grant program. In fact, we already have in place spec ific guidanc e that says if you're going to buy communications equipment of this type, here is the standard to which you should be buying your equipment, or you're not authorized to spend government money for that, and we believ e that will be helpful in doing that. This is because the groups help to put together the standards themse lves, doing what they agreed was a good idea to do. And then we'll be prov iding government money that will he lp accomplish that. That's very likely the approach that we'll be using for this, putting together these pilot stations to prove, not only to ourselves but also the c ountry, that what I described earlier, how do we meet and use these boxes that can permit mobile phones and radios to commun icate. How we show that it is a via ble solution is a first step. We do n't want to go out and buy thousands of them and find out there's something we didn' t think about. We are trying to put pilot programs in place quickly so we can begin to gather the information to determine how broad bas ed an issue is in the country. DR. FISCHHOFF: It's one of the challenges and great opportunities that DHS has in its charter; that is , to provide the syste ms engineering or analysis for th e entire operation, even if some are not w ithin its juri sdiction to operate. I would like to see us find some way to discuss how to treat that as science and technology and no t just as a management issue, recogniz ing ther e are limits, sort of the best practices that are out 8 there. Vince Vitto had some suggestions earlier that I would like to see us pursuing, systems dynamic or other analytic al techniqu es. It's worthwhile bringing in the people from Health and Human Services who are wo rking a piece of the puzzle to see what interfaces. I think it would be interesting als o to bring in some of the British. They speak the same language. They have a ve ry different model in the contingency secretariat. You can go to their web site at www.ukresilience.info /home.htm, and that has its own history. Sometimes it's useful to view one's own model by looking at somebody else's model. . DR. MCQUEARY: I certainly share y our point of view about the system engineering and how it can guide the Department in how we go. We talked about this in a side bar conversation earlier and I think it 's pretty straightfo rward to define the capabilities we have right now because it is what it is. I think it's relatively straightforward to be able to define where we need to get to, although there's going to be a lot of debate about where it is the country needs to get to, and how we want to get there. Part of the problem is how we make the transition, because it fundamentally has to be done. People us e the old cliche of c hanging the engine on a plane when you're flying. I like that analogy, but the solution is not to throw away what we've got and start over. It's got to be how do we evolve from where we are and wher e we need to get to, and that requires some very ca refully thought-out systems wo rk in order to be able to define how you do that. The idea is not to change it over time, but how you make the changes that make the greatest i mpact to w hat we're trying to do first and then change the things that are less consequential as we can get to them. DR. HAP PER: I was very interested in your comments on interoperability. Department of Defense, different services, di fferent parts of the same service -- they have struggled with this as long as I can re member. They're currently going to decide whether to build a new radio called JTRS (J oint Tactical Radio System), and so the question is whether you try to get as much, help as poss ible from them, because they have faced such similar problems. NEXT TO MR. OXFORD: We have not gone out with any reques t to purchase radios or communications devices at all, as fa r as I know yet. I'd s ay at this p oint, it's very clear that some kind of a software defined radio or communications devic e is how to solve this problem; but in terms of specif ications on what those should be, I think we need to put together the standards, and privat e industry will then try to solve the technical pr oblems bec ause there's a busines s opportunity there. I think we need to hold fast to the idea of what the standards ar e going to do, and that's what we're going to do -- listen to the inputs and not be pers uaded by who's got what on the street right now. We need to get to competitive forces and let the country evolve in a meaningful way. DOD has a slight ly different pr oblem vis-a-vis multi-level secur ity. DR. MCQUEARY: You're absolutely right. MR. VITTO: If you can, av oid that. I would hope you can avoid that. That was sort of the heart of my comment -- there's a wa y to do encryption. 9 GENERAL WELCH: You mentioned standards. There's another kind of standard, and that is a conseque nce management standard. We all und erstand that the actual harm to the public inv olves more t han just what happens, it involves whether or not you can meet the public's expectations. So the question is: who's addressing the standards for cleanup, for example, and who' s addressing the standards for consequence management? There was a standar d to clean up the Hart Senate Office Building so there would be no anthrax there, so in many cases the only standard we have is zero. There must be no toxin present in order for us to declare that it's an acceptable standard. DR. MCQUEARY: Which means we coul dn't go on the Chisholm Trail. GENERAL WELCH: Right, I couldn't have li ved most of my youth, but in any case, who' s addressing that? Jo hn [Vitko], do you think you can? DR. VITKO: Yes, there are two things. Recently issue d Homelan d Security Presidential Directive 10 estab lished the standards, protocols in all the issues related to decontamination and has responsibi lity for protection. DHS is the lead in biodefense. Also, in the biodefens e area, we agreed that DHS should have clear delineation of responsibilities. The HSPD initiated a study with the National Ac ademies to provide guidelines on how to clean up cont amination and make it safe. They will look at a series of risks that are encountered at different leve ls of contamination, and following that, there's a policy dec ision that needs to be made t hat says what levels we will accept. So we've got those efforts and other things. HSPD-10 for biodefens e gave very clear responsibility, and those words \"s tandards\" are in ther e explic itly and th at's important. GENERAL WELCH: So is there an in terface now between t hose who are doing that and those who know what's possible? DR. VITKO: Absolutely. MR. OXFORD: As part of the task, EPA was in the lead due to cooperation wit h DHS, etc. There's an unclass ified version of H SPD-10 called \"Biodefense in the 21st Century\" that was issued within the pas t month, and includes some wording on decontamination at the level of the assignme nt of agency re sponsib ility, and it specified what's involved at the top level. GENERAL WELCH: Would you say something about the search for good ideas, the search for applicable technologies, sinc e we're addressing the set of problems that, in many cases, we've never addressed before? How do you reach out and find new technologies? 10 DR. MCQUEARY: We haven't had to do t oo much reaching out. The issue has been can we meet with all the people that have the ideas. When I got into this job, because my knowledge is quite limited and it 's a little better now but certainly not complete, I believed that the job was more than setting the R&D standards of what the country needed to do in this period of homeland security. As we got into it a very short number of months, it became clear to me, and I'm sure others serving before me, that this country has many things to offer about addressing the issue of the attacking Homeland Security, so we sort of changed our focus of thinking about what the science program should be, to how to take advantage of many of the ideas , prototypes, things that are nearly ready to deploy and that t he country already has. That permits us to move quickly toward possible solutions and res earch programs. One of the key things we had responsibility for is in the Homela nd Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, so we have to demonstr ate that the process we're us ing actually bring s in non- traditional bidders int o what we're doing. And the las t time I had an input that wa s measured in tens of companies that were nontraditional DOD bidders, we were feeling pretty good about the idea of the approach we're using to bring in people that have not histor ically been bidding on DOD programs. So I think that's a very positive result. But th e reach-out to private i ndustry really come s through responses to BAA's an d when pe ople send us unsolic ited proposals; we have a process in place for people to go through these propos als, evaluate them, and either decide there's some thing of merit, or get back to the people that submitted it and tell them no. I've received some interesting proposals th at were easy to say no to, and without saying too much, one that came to me wa s the idea of putting swords in various strategic places on an airplane s o that shoul d there be any terrorists on board, the pilot could release these swords to trusted people that begin to defend the people on the plane. We did not spend any money on that. I mean people are thinking creatively. MR. VITTO: Do you answer everyone? DR. MCQUEARY: We try to answer ev eryone, and I believe we'v e done a good job, although when we were in the startup phase we really didn't have a tracking system that was very good, so we may have had some that fell through th e cracks. If you have somebody that comes to you and says they never received a response, tell them to come back. MR. VITTO: No, no, it's just a hard thing to do. It can be overwhelming, but it's critically im portant to st imulate the environment. DR. VITKO: Even if y ou're not interested. MR. VITTO: The worst thing to do is te ll them it fell into a dead hole. 11 DR. MCQUEARY: We get a lot of inpu t. We get Congressi onal members that have members in their districts that have i deas. I give high marks to most of the Congressional members; they do not simply send us everything that comes across their desks. They try to do some scre ening. We've asked in every case that they screen them a bit because we don't have enough people to look into every single idea t hat comes in. In general, they've done a pretty good job with those things that l ook lik e they might have some scientific feasibility, although I wouldn't say it was a 100 percent success, because I did get the one on the swords. One idea that came through was to put a digital shield around critical areas so that if a plane were to try to penetrate that defined area, you have a way of taki ng over the controls of the aircraft and precluding t hem from going there. We also had one come in that said if there was a terrori st attack on board a plane, the pilot pus hes a button on a black box and the black box take s over absolute control of the plane and doesn't release until the plane lands. I tried that on a couple pilots and the answer was: Why don't you just let it take off too -- you don't need us. I try not to dismiss any of these things. You never know when a piece of this one or piece of that one mi ght have an idea. In fact, I began to think t hat I might be able to do so mething with the digital shield. Eventually it could be meaningful as it was proposed. DR. GAST: It seems like one of the chall enges with bringing in ideas is that the tendency is always to be fighting the last war. The ideas are generated by public interest and fear based on perceived threats. So the more difficult idea generation is the risk assessment and evaluation of scenario s and future scenarios, and how to weigh all those risks that we've been talking about. I'm wondering what the mechanis ms are for that kind of brainstorming, which is really beyond the things we're working on a nd aware of and trying our best to defend against to push out towards the future. DR. MCQUEARY: I believ e the answer to that is in good strong systems modeling in which you can do studies, because very often you can do point solutions and the circumstance as we ascribed here, we can fix that problem, but that's not the issue. It's what happens when the problem gets perturbed from that location. You have to have confidence in what we do and c ope with variations that may not have been perceived. The way you do that is by havin g good models that you can use to evaluate what those changes ar e. As we talked ab out earlier, w e're not there yet with the systems model, but that is a ve ry high, and what I think is an important issue for us to get on with quickly. DR. SHINE: In regards to that, shortly after 9/11, when the National Academies' Committee was being formulated, there was a discussion about whether, in fact, one 12 ought to create a group of unusual people , people with criminal backgrounds, people with strange backgrounds, to brai nstorm the whole notion of w hat kind of crazy things, you would want to come up with. As you can imagine, there is some obvious risk with this approach. MR. VITTO: You did talk about your next Un iversity Center of Excelle nce. At this time there's been a lot of scholarly work. There are some books out now, Terror Networks and a few others, where there was r eal data, real analys is. You could combine that kind of scholarly work with so me brainstorming, and I think you can start doing more of this threat modeling, which you can then get together and do some systems an alysis. GENERAL WELCH: Well, Vayl [Ox ford] talked this morning about the threat vulnerab ility and threat analysis group, a sma ll group of people wh ose respon sibility is to figure out what to do, not with criminals and peopl e of that sort, but rather with people who could look at how you probe the system i n order to d o that. An important p art of what we do, because you really need to hav e confidenc e in what you're doing, has a high probability of being able to deter an attack on whatever it is. DR. BESSETTE: Have you mentioned the wo rk that might be going on in the area of cyber security and cy ber terrorism programs? DR. MCQUEARY: We have a couple small pr ograms in place. I think there is $18 million in the budget this year. One thing we have going on from an S&T standpoint is a joint program at U niversity of Cali fornia, Berkeley. They're putting together a network that could be used to probe it and meas ure things that could be done in order to make it less vulnera ble. It is a joint pr oject of $5 million or so , so it's not a large activity, but that's indicative of the ki nd of thing we're doing. The National Cy ber Security Division under IAIP and reporting to Bob Liscouski, actually has the lead responsibility for DHS' s cyber-security acti vity. He is a customer of Science & Technology that we needed to bring to bear and we looked at him for one of the requirements in that regard. That's not to say we don't try to think about things ourselves with the few people we've got worki ng this area, but he specifically has the lead on behalf of the Department for what the Department is going to do in cyber security. I think you'll find a lot of this whole issue of cyber security has got to have private industry involved because private industry owns the bulk of things that could be affected by this. I can tell you that I'm unaware of any interest currently of trying to fix this problem through legislation wit hin the Department. It's a complex problem and the idea of writing some law is not the right way to deal with it. The point of view that I've express ed publicly is that I believe the issue of cyber security vulnerability is for those compani es who recognize what they need to do and how to do it. It can become a competit ive advantage. This country thrives on competition and being able to do things that other people can't. And this is an area 13 where all y ou have to have is one, or two, or three companies that do get it right and they position themselves, we solve the cyber security problems, and you get the investors thinking a bit about it. I have two companies here that both do about the same thing, both financia l investment fi rms, but on e has clearly demonstrated the ability to do this job, that's where I'm going to put my money. I could be to tally wrong in that. I think we look at more than just do this or do that. It's more ho w do you stimulate people to do things because of their own self-interest. MR. FERREN: It strikes me that one of the very hard, long-term problems facing the Department and S&T is under standing t he dynamics of complex systems. In particular, such problems include subjec ts such as emergent, unpredicted and unexpected behavior s: whether a system is public or terrorist's n etworks; interconnected technical systems; or intero perability dynamics of systems that were never intended to interoperate, such as co mmunications systems. I wonder if you could speak to your vision of the long-term method of how you address that subject, because it's obvious ly both operationally hard and scientif ically hard but also it strikes me quite critical. DR. MCQUEARY: I th ink it gets back to the point of the discussion we had earlier with Dr. Shine. It's how you bring peo ple to bear to think about diabolic al things that could be done in order to stimulate what we have to determine what the vulnerab ilities are. I don't know any other way to do that. It is an important step because we can take steps to dri ve terrorists in certain directions. I think you can make things a lot safer a lot more protected in one area than perhaps in another, so you might drive in dir ections such as that. MR. FERREN: I think it might be i nteresting beyond innovative thin king to understand some of th e fundam ental scienc e that may be dr iving these systems that nobody who has an operational r equirement has l ooked at in a coordinated way before. DR. MCQUEARY: Excellent point, but I c ouldn't tell you that we're doing it. I welcome y ou to continue to stim ulate us on those lines . DR. PAPAY: We've talked about several diffe rent areas of S&T over the last two days. We have not talked about critical infr astructure, although you did mention a little bit when you got into cyber security. Could y ou say just a word or two about the FY05 budget, and FY06 planning for critical infrastructure? DR. MCQUEARY: There are 14 identified crit ical infrastructure sectors, including telecommunications s ystems and national monum ents, water supply, food supply, etc. We are beginning to deal with the food supply system. As John mentioned in terms of food suppl y, USDA has the lead on that. But we're stimulating things that could be done. 14 MR. OXFORD: DHS has the lead on about ei ght other things. We coach here, out of S&T, a working group to develop annual S&T financial plans to deal with critical infrastructu re. The firs t vers ion of each sector infrastructure protecti on plan is due to the Secretary by the end of the May. So we 'll certainly see what the indiv idual sectors are saying are the most importan t things. GENERAL WELCH: We'll reconvene on the hour. (Whereupon a recess was taken at 1:50 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.) GENERAL WELCH: At the end of our fi rst meeting, we established four subcommittees, and subsequently made some adj ustments with the obj ective of helping us develop and form the best advice that we c an give to DHS. We defined the focus of the membership somewhat since then, but it's clear from our experience from the last two days here that this is, as we gai n more and more information and unders tanding, going to continue to evolve our view of what we need to do to provi de our best advice. And so what we want to do today is to have a set of discussions, led by the subcommittee chairs, that will get us to a common understanding of where we are right now, what we need for some subcommittees to address, how we go about structuring ourselves and focusing ourselves beyond wh at we have done thus far in order to provide the best advice that we can provide to DHS S&T. That's o ur objective this afternoon. I have no idea how substantive the work is that's been done to this point in time, and any substance will be greatly appreciated. But our real pur pose is to agree that we have the right structure so we can focus on the right things. We will start with the Mission and Operation Subcommi ttee report; Vince Vit to and Rich Roca are co-chairing that subcommittee. DR. ROCA: Let me s ay two things. Firs t of all, there are six of us on this subcommittee, and I w ould welcome any of the subcommittee me mbers present to contribute at any time in order to amplify or correct what I' m saying. Number two, I would reiterate that we vi ew ourselves as a working group of this whole committee, not as a separ ate arm that somehow goes in another direction. So the work that we're doing, we're assumi ng is going to be brought to this whole committee and then the committee will dispose of it as it finds appropriate. This vugraph shows the c harter, largely taken from the material that was developed for us as w e were defining the boundaries of the subcommittees that were established. I'm not going to bother to r ead the whole thing to you. You've got the preprint in your book. I think most of the issues that were rais ed today fall into general areas of: what direction are you going in, why and how do you interface with others, what's the context of the overall problem, are you w orking on t he right part of the overall proble m, and so on and so forth. 15 I don't think this subcommittee is going to focus on \"program number four\" being run properly, or is it realistic to expect that they're going to have it deliv ered at such and such a time. Another subcommittee will do that. We have both the strategy portion or the di rection setting, if you will, and als o the governanc e portion. I read this as, fo r example, when we say management and business pr ocesses, I'm thinking of that whic h is really, really the first order issues of how the charter is being met. I don't think of business processes as looking at how vouchers are being processed within the S&T directorate and determine whether they meet the government regul ations or not. That's the membership. GENERAL WELCH: The last bullet that des erves a little bit of discussion is that of these tw o organizat ional issues. One is the interaction and organization within DHS, and the role of DHS S&T versus integrati on with the operations people, etc. But the others are much larger organizati on construct issues. The one that Larry [Papay] brings up is this whole business about the organization to provide op erational concepts and operational architec tures that will necess arily reach beyond DHS S&T and, in fact, will reach beyond DHS. We need some discussion as to where we're going to address those. Is this the plac e or s hould that be addressed in the Resources and Organization Subcommittee? DR. ROCA: Well, I'll offer a strong end, as least as I' m thinking of it. When you get down to the details of where you get a particular competency of someone who's a nuclear physicist, or the like, it may be that the Resourc e team is the better one to understand that. But I think w hen you're looking at an overa ll organization, the goal is to protect the country as opposed to any par ticular function as we're doing. We're trying to discern just how that m aps out; where DHS is in this; where the Department of Transportation (DOT) is, the FBI, the local law enfor cement agency? How is S&T laying out that entire construct, and if I remember correctly, S&T considers their syste ms engineering responsibility to cove r that entire construc t. Abse nt other direction, I think this subcommittee would feel itself responsible for making sure that the S&T direct orate is indeed doing that, looking at it from an end-to-end perspective. MS. BORRONE: The other aspect that we talked abo ut was in business practices, as we lay out the construct of the relations hips, then how are the business practices supporting that structural relations hip? So, for example, Rich [Roca] used the Department of Transportation. D o you have your agreements in place for the Department of Transportation, and then who takes on what relationship or what responsibility under that agreement, which is where the Resources Subcommittee discussion should be focused. 16 DR. ROCA: We do have a c hart coming up, three charts from now, that lays out the initial questions we're going to lay out, a nd I think we can talk around that chart to some of th e first things we were looking at. GENERAL WELCH: Let's wait until we get to it. DR. ROCCA: Any other questions wit h regard to this chart? This is the subcommittee membership. As far as our method of operation, you can read this yourself; I think there are two items I would like to focus on: the methodology we're going to use poses spec ific questions, and then understanding the answers to those questions provides our evaluation and recommendation -- whatever might be appropriate in that specific issue, in order to keep the Subc ommittee focused. We will tak e questions that are formally pos ed to this particular subcommittee, ones that we self-generate as a result of t he charter, and obvious ly ones from the Under Secretary and his staff, even if they go in a direction somewhat different than we might have thought we would have originally. The second bullet reinforces the fact that we consider ourselves a creature of this organization, and any recommendations we make are really candidate recommendations for the full committee to cons ider prior to giving it to the Under Secretary. I have two slides that deal with the questi ons. We have the first ones we're going to tackle, and the second ones I call \"parking lot.\" Generally, these deal with issues of direction, and the \"parking lot\" ones deal wit h the mechanics of how you go about doing things, to fi rst order . So what are the underlying goals ? Wher e did you get them? How are you going to know that you are successful in those goal s or evaluate your particular progress? The second is the whole issue of threats, whic h, if you will, is a surrogate for setting the agenda of the entire S&T Directorate. What is the mechanism by which you ident ify and prioritize the threats, and then the next bullet is kind of the existence proof; specifically , what are the threats you're working on? How did you identify those parti cular ones, and what was the basis for it? And then the fourth one deals wit h the fact t hat it's an interrelated problem that is being attacked. DOT has thrown up, as an ex ample, other parts of DHS, entities that are not in the federal government at all, but local law enforcement , whatever it might be. GENERAL WELCH: Let's be fairly specific . An issue that came up repeatedly yesterday had to do with information disseminati on -- I guess the way we ask it often of various agencies is what are you going to do with this information? What's more broadly couched is what the operational concepts (CONOPS) are. 17 So, for example, we have an operational concept that i ncludes biologic al sensors, that goes all the way to cons equenc e management. I think there is a signific ant appetite for that in this committee. The issue is how we go about addressing that, and w ho is going to investigate that issue, not develop it, but provide advice on how to get that done, and also advice on when we think it is done. DR. ROCA: I think when we were casting these, particu larly the first one, that was our intent. I think it is too su btle t he way it's phrased. The issue of CONOPS is a major issue, it's pervasive, and it's a driv er for much that has to be done. Based on what we learned yesterday, t he comments this morning, and your present comments, I think we ought to explicitly add the CONOPS issue to this list. GENERAL WELCH: Well, let's let Larry [P apay] and Alice [Gast] weigh in here. DR. PAPAY: At this point on that particu lar question, I don't have an issue in terms of that subcommittee taking on sort of a -- call it the CONOPS. I think the distinction from the use of the word \"organization,\" \"organi zational relationship,\" I'm getting fairly comfortable with what they ar e looking at, I'll call it the \"high-level relationships,\" and sort of who they shoul d be dealing wit h and at that level. I think what we're talking about, with w hat we do, is how will they use the National Labs, what should be the relationship with the National Labs? So it's a more specific focus-type thing rather than the higher level. MR. VITTO: We would want to assess the strategic plan from a completeness standpoint -- does it meet the operational requirements, does it have the developments, have you considered t he interrelationships, how is that going to get done? I view you all as worrying about having the adequate resources -- are you spending five dollars on a $50 billion problem, etc. Every question I've asked over the last two sessions -- Chuck, you can read behind those bullets -- I mean we're talking about this high-level system, and we would lik e to deal directly. One of th e things that we can do as a subcommittee is to get inside the strategic plan and the stra tegic planning process. We would want to get with the FFRDC, a nd understand how they are goin g to operat e and at what level. Larry pointed out that you can simulate, as we've don e in DoD, right down to a level that will make it impossible. How are you really attacking this threat modelin g and then the systems modeling? I mean, I think that's bu ilt into these. But we've decided that the first thing we 'd start with was th reat -- I mean you have a CONOPS on top, then we decided we'd start wit h threat and then try to propagate that threat and look at the implications of that threat across other interagency relationships; so we're sort of veer ing ourselv es towards the systems group. DR. MCQUEARY: I will come back and point out again that we don' t characterize the threat. S&T does not do th at, that's not our charter and we get the 18 input for what the threat is fr om the other part of the organizati on. That's not to say it's just a one directional flow of information, certainly we ha ve knowledgeable people. For example, John and others in the bio ar ea would get inv olved in a dialogue. Fundament ally, the definition of what the Department's threat is as it evolves will come out of the Information Analys is (IA) group. That's not to say y ou can't go talk to them. I want to make it clear that when you say how do we identify a threat , it's a very simple answer: we get it fro m IA. MR. VITTO: However, you might get an input from this group through the committee that says given that's the threat or that's the i dentified threat, we suggest you prioritize it in a particular way, stressing ana lysis. We're not intel people either, but we might find some issues with too much of a saluting to the specified threat. GENERAL WELCH: None of this conversati on is contrary to this thought, but we need to keep in mind that the reason why, as an S&T advisory council, we're interested in this, is that we don't see how you make dec isions as to whether or not a prototype is something that you want to expand into a fi eld system, or whether o r not you w ant to expand generation one or wa it for generation two, unless you have a CONOPS plan and an operation architecture in which these things fit. So at the ri sk of blasphemy, it isn't te rribly important w hether the C ONOPS is right, because it won't be. What's terribly im portant is that there be a structure within which things can be reasonably evaluated. Otherwise, you simply evaluate the device on the meri ts of what the device will do, which leads you to optimize the device, and optimizing the device is almost never t he best path to optimiz ing the system. We've all got a lot of experience at bu ilding the world's best air superiority fighters tha t you can't exploit fully becaus e we didn't develop the system within which you can use those capabilities. So it's not a matter of you can't work on the device until you have a CONOPS that you're really happy with, it's a matter that you need to start iterating pretty early on. So I think if we have that as our purpose, then we're all pretty much talking ab out the same thing, but I want to be sure that you're comfortable with that. DR. MCQUEARY: I'm comfor table. DR. VITKO: I think General Welc h is ex actly right. The only caution I would quibble wit h on this chart specifically is that the term \"threat\" always has a classical meaning, and if you ask what is the nuclear th reat to New York City right now from intel, they're not going to have one, because they have not seen an inte l report that says it. If you use \"th reat\" in te rms of vulnerabilities, ri sks, those sorts of thi ngs, I feel a lot more comfortable. 19 MR. VITTO: It's the way we meant it. We're quite experienced wit h the intel community tellin g you there's not an identifia ble threat, therefore you can't even think about the potential \"threats.\" We'll work on that. DR. VITKO: If it's going to go down that path, I want to go back to what Ken Shine said that it ma y be useful to pick out a couple syst ems or portfolios to look at in some detail, because there's actually been a fair amount of work there. So we'll take a detailed look at the logic path, where the gaps are, w hat needs to be done, and that would be the most useful. GENERAL WELCH: It seems pretty clear that the two that leap out at you are the two that we spent yesterday on. DR. VITKO: I agree. I'm just saying that you should try to get at a number of those questions at the top level today to allow the syste matic unfolding. GENERAL WELCH: We heard pieces of it. We heard lots of pieces of it yesterday, but all of our efforts to get somebody to kind of knit it together a little bit have not been terribly satisfying. However, we didn't expect to get a ll the information we needed in one meeting. MR. VITTO: Larry [Welch], if we're goi ng to be successful with this though, I could identify the areas that we w ere interested in. I think we need a point of contact. It seems to me, it needs to be done somewhe re in the PPB organiz ation. I think we are going to be focused on that part of the organization, alt hough I think there's going to be a portion of discussion on the entir e strategic plan. Isn't your plan -- I guess this is to either Larry [Welch] or Chuck [McQueary] -- to identify key i ndividuals who will help us? One of the best things an operat ing committee can do is to get the right information, and if we can explic itly explain the question, and we get answers from the right people, then truly understanding what we're after is always a big challenge. If we're going to do this effectively, it would seem to me there has to be a point of contact within eac h of the major organizations. DR. MCQUEARY: I don't have any problem with how you're doing that. To make sure that we're responsiv e, I'd really like to have you work through the Executiv e Director and his staff, so he can fan it out and reach into the organization as needed, because in general, the portfolio manager is wher e you go to get i nformation on each of the programs. DR. ROCA: What I'm heari ng about this chart is t he whole issue of CONOPS, and that which surrounds it will b e explicitly stated. The word \"t hreat\" should be treated with care so it's not mi sinterpreted. We also ought to understand the degree to which S&T is or is not a free agent in declaring what the threats are and what the priorities are. GENERAL WELCH: I would almost ask if we don't really mean vulnerabilities. 20 DR. MCQUEARY: That's a good suggestion. DR. ROCA: There are the issues that we identified in our first meeting that we put for later consideration on the chart entitl ed \"Questions for Our ' Parking Lot '.\" Again, you can read them. They tend to be more about how you do business; for example, look at the matrix portfolio managers. I guess my questi ons are, and they are more to the DHS staff: Are you interested in any of these being explored? Are there others you would rather have explored? Are any of them ones you would rather put off? Are any of them ones you'd rather see done sooner rather than later? GENERAL WELCH: Just to begin wit h, I wonder if those are your subcommittee's responsibilities. I woul d think the first two are Larry's [Papay] committee. I take that back. I wouldn't say I think they are; I'm asking. If Larry [Papay] doesn't think they're his subcommittee, they're not his subcommittee. DR. GAST: We did tal k about resour ces involving not only the financial resources, but also human resources; so in that sense, under standing whether the human resources are correctly deployed and interacting would be something we would have taken up in that context. DR. PAPAY: Which gets us to the second one. DR. GAST: We could look at m anagement and business processes in the context of deployment of human resources. MR. VITTO: Larry [Welch], t he top two came out of the first page [charter] in the sense that we were looking for gaps, not res ources and not criticism of the portfolio. Is the matrix structure based on the CONOPS? Based on the vulnerability analysis? Then when you map what you learn from that against the portfolio management, you said it yourself earlier, are there gaps, what about the interfaces? So we saw this as logical, and it's only at that level that we were going into t hat. I would imagine the same two things could be on your list with a slightly different emphasis. DR. PAPAY: This gets down to words and the interpretation of words. For example, B [on the chart] word \"structure\" can be interpreted to mean organization. You're looking at it as the matrix -- the structure of the matri x and are their holes and gaps. MR. VITTO: And have we identified someth ing from the operati ons concept that is not being covered fully becaus e of the way the stove pipes are laid out or the way the cross matrix is structured? DR. PAPAY: \"Structure\" is a word that can mean different things to different people. GENERAL WELCH: I think we have agreement here. 21 DR. GAST: It does bri ng up the general issue that there needs to be a lot of interaction between the subcommittees. Programs and Resources Subcommittee obvious ly goes very well with Mission and Organization Subcommittee, and perhaps we can exchange our work produc t in between meetings. GENERAL WELCH: Ne xt up is the Program Subcommittee. DR. HAPPER: Let me introduce the Program Subcommittee; it consists of Ken Shine, Ron Atlas, David Franz and me. We welcome anyone who would like to join us in any of our meetings. We'll try and k eep you informed on what we're doing. While we'r e trying to get this high tech equipment working, perhaps I can read you our charter which comes out of the gr andfather document for our group. It says, \"To evaluat e the mission relevance, tec hnical quality, and manage ment of the S&T Directorate's programs; as well as to identif y research areas of potential importance to the security of the nation.\" We've had one meeting by conference call, most of us participated, and we occasionally see each other informally in other venues. We plan to meet at least once a quarter, either in person or if things are really tight, perhaps by phone. The deliber ations of our subcommitt ee will be judgments on t he exce llence and relevance of the programs of overall HSSTAC mission, and how the program efforts are balanc ed to address the most important vulner abilities facing the nation. Of course, we'll prepare a regular report for the full co mmittee, so we'll be ready to discuss what we've learned at each quarterly meeting. Let me tell you some of the issues that I' ve identified. I'm not sure that our full subcommittee has chomped on these enough to be certified as iss ues. Number one is we saw a lot of counter-bioterrorism efforts ye sterday. My impression is that it's taking a lot of resources from the Homeland Security budget, but it's probably appropr iate. We would like to understand a little bette r what the balance of investment on countering bioterrorism is with other programs that are also important. For example, we heard about radiation and nuclear threats today. One threat that worries me a great deal is, if you look aro und at what really kills people, by far the most people have been killed by rather low tech things lik e ordinary explos ives. This very difficult problem is something that I don't understand very well yet within the context of homeland security The attacks in Madrid were conventiona l explosives. Our domestic attacks at Oklahoma City were conventional homemade ex plosiv es. In Russia, most of the terrorist attacks on Chechnya wer e with explosives . I th ink one question is: Is this just an unwork able problem, or is it something that there is a chance of doing something with fresh ideas, and that homeland security could thrive. I don't see another agency 22 that is more likely to have that as t heir central mission than the Department of Homeland Security. DR. MCQUEARY: And we agree with you completely. DR. HAPPER: I'm glad to hear that. I realize it's har d to get the whole program out right away. I want to talk a little bit about nuclear weapons. We heard this morning about how difficult it is to handle s pecial nuclear materials. GENERAL WELCH: I remind everyone t hat we are convened in unclassified, open session. DR. HAPPER: The real defense is off our shores, and we ar e hoping that the programs in the Department of H omeland Secu rity work together wit h the Department of Energy (DOE) and with the State Department to address the sources of special nuc lear material, and the big source is Russia. We hope that, Chuck [McQueary], you and Secretary Ridg e will p ush this foreign interc eption as hard as you can. This is very much on my own mind personally because I spent a week last Fall in Russia looking at their highly enriched ur anium and plutonium. Most of the defense around these facilities is being paid for by the United States to hi re guards, to put up fences, to have portal monitors. And I don't know how long the U.S. can be expected to do that, and at some point, you have to count on the Russians to do the job themselves. There are a myriad of issues that need to be address ed. Here is a list of special issues [\"Specia l Issues\" chart]. This is a lo ng wind ed way of saying that where DHS has to rely on other agencies, they should not be shy about insisting that other agencies cont ribute to th eir charge It would help the Nation a lot if people all over the world would find it repulsive to put a nuclear weapon on Ne w York or on Washington and if they could somehow pr event that. Even though they don't like the U.S. very much, they might say this has gone a step too far, this should not happen. The sort of thing I'm thi nking about is th is ne w satellite broadcas ting system for Arab News. I don't know who supports that, but it's supposed to give a better view of the U.S. and what it really stands for than what you see on Aljazeera. Perhaps there may be ways to have exc hanges of people with the Muslim world and the United States to build ties. We did that duri ng the entire lengt h of the Cold War, and in the end it paid very helpful dividends. We built up a collect ion of people who were certainly not traitors to the Soviet Union, but they helped calm down some of the worst excess that existed there. MR. VITTO: This is a critically im portant issue, and there are DOD , Department of State, and a whole v ariety of others incl uding the Council of Foreign Relatio ns (who has 15 independent studies going) very aggressive ly looking at this issue. There are a lot of studies going on concer ning that topic in the ent ire interagenc y arena, and I'm 23 involv ed with one right now. So I just don't k now that it's something we, or your group, needs to focus on. GENERAL WELCH: Or to continue that conversation, just off the top of my head. Number two [on the \"Special Issues\" chart] is probably DHS busines s. Number three is definitely DOE business. DOE has all the funding to do that, but the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is assigned to DoD. Number four is not D HS' business. DR. HAPPER: You say number three is not DHS business, but the part of that business that DHS has is almost impossible. The very last stages of getting HEU to cross our borders into the Unit ed States is a terrible job to have compared to keepin g it in place. For DHS to be respons ible for this supremely important th ing at the very last stages when it's almost too late is te rrible, and DHS should have full support. I mentioned to Chuck [McQueary] the way to get that support is to get the Russians to take it more seriously, and the way to do that is to constantly lean on people like President Putin when they have the Sea Isl and [G-8] meeting, which will tak e place soon. President Bush will hav e talking points , and one of the talking points should be: you should pay closer attention to special nu clear materials in Russ ia. If you get that message from the U.S . and from our allies, e ventually I think it will h elp us, at least as much as putting a few more portal detec tors at our ports of entry. GENERAL WELCH: My issue is not whet her or not it's terribly important, not whether or not somebody needs to confront President Putin with this, it is that it's DOE and DTRA's responsib ility to do that. They're clearly assigned that responsibility. It's not a gap. We may not be happy with how it' s done, but it's clearly assigned and it's not a gap. DR. MCQUEARY: In conversation we had, I simply took your input as being one that we ought to come at this in multiple wa ys and try to move it fo rward, so I don't feel uneasy about our taki ng a good idea and then depending on present discussions taking the lead. General Welch is obviously right. DR. VITKO: Without talking details, this is working very high policy issues across the Homeland Security Council and the Nati onal Securit y Council with the interagency present. DR. FISCHHOFF: A question of form rat her than substance on this. During the Cold War the nature of our R&D effort and how it related to our relations with other countries was an important issue that came up in places that are classifie d and jointly work together. Over the longer term, it strikes me that that might be an appropriate topic for th e S&T Directorate. I think some of these thi ngs reflect policy iss ues that are outside of our brief. On t he other hand, there are things that may be possible from knowing the details of the technology that might seem otherwise impossible, that you can collaborate if you know t he details of it. And we mi ght be able to shape some of those relationships that might be within the r ealm of the Operations Subcommittee. 24 DR. ROCA: These I would characterize as issues of whether programs exist to do so, as opposed to whether programs are goi ng to deliver what you expect them to deliver, given that they exist. Is i t import ant to your Directorate , Chuck [McQueary], to have this body speak to what confidence we have in par ticular programs and whether we think they're going to deliver, when you think they're going to deliver, roughly what you think they're going to deliver? DR. MCQUEARY: Probably -- the answer probably depends; but, i n general, I would say yes. DR. ROCA: If that we re so, I would th ink you would want a bullet on here that would say that. GENERAL WELCH: This is \"special issu es\" [slide entitled presume there are other issues? DR. HAPPER: We really have not gotten star ted yet. These are initial iss ues. GENERAL WELCH: How do you plan, ju st in general, to get through the technology program? You plan to do a sampling? DR. HAPPER: Well, for a start w e're goi ng to look at the budget and see where the money is being spent on progr ams so that we know how the resources are allocated now. Then we're going to put our finger on the biggest effort as measured by dollars in trying to decide if this is being done properly , as best we know, if it is duplicative of other efforts and other federal agenc ies. DR. ATLAS: For better or worse, this subcommittee is popul ated with biologists, and I thought that might be reflective of so me of the large in vestments that the Department has decided to make in B IOWA TCH and in the center that will be constructed maybe at Fort Detrick, the National Biodefense Analys is & Countermeasures Center. I thin k it would be wise certainly fo r us to look at those two programs and give you advice on the adequacy, or are they too large? I mean where are those relative to your investments? I'm sure that we will be moving down, and I suspect we're going to need addit ional expertise from the parent co mmittee as we deal with some other areas, at least as I sit th rough the large briefi ng areas that I am interested in but not competent in. Beyond that, I would hope at some point we would look at some other documents, either the Presi dential Directive to see wher e the Department is supposed to be relative to their or ganization, make sure the pr ograms are meeting those mandates or even go back to the original National Academy report, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism , and look at the major recommendations, things like having a national testing bureau for the products involv ed in defense efforts and ask whether or not the program on st andards is actually 25 covering that full mandate that the Academy virtually charged the nation with moving forward. S o those have some of the more cent ral topics that I'd like to see us tackle. I suspect that's going to mean we have to come to Washington as a sub-committee at some point and meet with some people who c an show us some documents and gather the program managers to help us underst and the details of the programs. GENERAL WELCH: So, in general, you're going to start looking at the large technology programs? It's not exactly sampling; but of this very long list of technology programs, do you have in mind some approach to the longer list? Are you just going to look at the top group, or are you going to pic k from the l ist? DR. HAPPER: We're going to weight them by where we judge the emphasis goes, and then we're going to look at those that are not emphasized very much and convince ourselves that the lack of emphasis is justified, that t hey're not deserving of more support. The best way to do that, of c ourse, is to look at a budget, and if the line items are cl early identif ied, we will probe into those progr ams, find out who controls them and what's being done or what's planned to be done. GENERAL WELCH: Anything els e? Any comment? C huck [McQueary]? DR. MCQUEARY: No, having looked at the programs, I th ink it would be a helpful adjunct until we are in a better pos ition to use a solid system approach and to characterize what the investment shoul d be. A lot of this was based upon the considered judgments of very capable people, and so it has the element of human estimates, but we welcome t he examination by y our group, and any thoughts you might have. GENERAL WELCH: The Resour ces and Organization report? DR. PAPAY: The Resources and Organiza tion Subcommittee met on May 3. We had two objectives at the meeting: First, to get our charter and statement worked out; and secondly, to take on our first assignment, which deals wit h the relationship between the S&T Directorate and National Labs. Our charter is to evaluate whether financial a nd human resources, polic ies governing t hem and the laboratory infrastructu re are adequate to meet the goals of the Science & Technology Directorate, etc. We are a lean, mean group, only three members on our subcommittee, so we can ac tually hold a meeting with two people, and still have a quorum. At our first meeting, a gr oup joined us because we had a special is sue come up, which I'll get into, and we thank them for jo ining us. Bran [Ferren] was going to meet with us. H e couldn't make the schedule an d now he's removed himself from our group because we're dealing with the labs and he has a possible conflict. 26 Our methods of operation are very similar to the other subcommittees; that is, we will hold at least one meeting interspersed with meetings of t he full committee doing reviews as appropriate . We plan to look at the adequac y and the proper utiliz ation of the financia l and huma n capital allocated to S&T; thus, the timing of our reviews will be set to meet the Directorate's annual budget cycle. We need to feed this committee the informati on that we've taken a look at. The Program Subcommittee will hav e input into t hat too, but we need to time our meeting such that when this committee meets you can turn to us, and we can say something to the effect that we've reviewed the budget and find it is adequate or they don't have the right staffing, they don't have enough sta ffing, things of that sort. Under the \"special iss ues\" chart l et me just take a minute and give you some background information, because we're in t he process of reviewing the relationship between the Department's Science & Technol ogy Directorate and the National Labs. It is our current expectation that we wil l have a draft report forwarded to the full committee for review and discus sion at the August meeting. It's a tight schedule. We've got some information coming from t he new Homeland Security Institute which would help us. We need to have at least one additional meeting with some of the laboratories, as well as other intere sted parti es, before going forward. The issue gets down to this. If you look at the enabling legislation that stood up the Department, Secti on 309 of P.L. 107-296, November 25, 2 002, it talks about the use of the National Labs by the S&T Directorate, and it says you can use the labs by joint sponsorship, but it's like two riders on a hor se, only one of them can hold the reigns, and the person holding the reigns is the Department of E nergy. It talks about direct contracts, but the direct c ontracts are in there only for work transfe rred from the Department of Energy to the Department of Homeland Security. Third is a \"work for others basis, and the fourth is the usual, other methods as provided by law. The point here being these are DOE l abs. The RFPs are put out and the contracts are let by the Department of E nergy. The strategic goals for DHS and the Directorate really speak to awareness that there's a new need to meld the scientific community with the intelligence c ommunity, t hat there are some unique aspect s to the programs defined here, and that there is a need for organiza tional excellence within DHS. It's going to be an enduring program, and needs to have a scientific cadre which meets that. The question is: what's the bes t mechanism to use to accomplish that. There are some DHS laboratories , the one that's going to be stood up and Plu m Island. There are University Centers of Excellence. There's the new Homeland Security Institute, but ther e's a mixed bag right now. You don't have to have a single way of doing business, but you don't want to have a complicated way of doin g it, if things can be simplified. But let me just say that it's an interesting problem. 27 There are nine labs (technica lly eight labs and a Nevada test site) who have indicated that they would like to work with DHS, and although you' d like to work perhaps with all of those entities, I don't thi nk you want to have separate contracts going out to all of those through another body. Enough said on that point. There are three potential issu es listed here [\"Special Issues\" Chart], and actually I've written in a fourth one based upon a comment that Chuck [McQueary] made this morning: the long-term capitaliz ation r equir ements within the Directorate from a laboratory point of view. Also, the second bullet is the one dealin g with budget connectivity within Sc ience & Technology and the operating directorates. For this business of going forward as technology moves through the directorate and goes commercial, there needs to be an out-year budgeting mechanism which allows the operating entity within DHS to begin to get a placeholder within the budget for operational deploymen t. We think that's an important issue, and one that needs to be addressed by the subcommittee. DR. MCQUEARY: Could I comment on t hat? Unless Secretary Ridge changes his mind or changes our minds for us, we 're going to put the budget wedges in our budget, although that's not the pl ace where long-term should be. It should be in the operational plan and make sure it's covered, and we're going to put a place on it. DR. PAPAY: We would like to take a look at that. The ot hers are pretty well straightforward in terms of adequacy and proper distribution of resources. A nd since its going to be a five-year planning horizon, we can take a five-year process. That concludes the report of the subcommittee. Again, when we say resources, as I mentioned earlier, it's operat ing budget, capital budget, and human resources. GENERAL WELCH: Can you say a little bi t more about the organization issue? DR. GAST: Well, at least initially our organiz ational iss ue has focused on the National Lab question, so in some sense we were the Resources Subcommittee. We became the Resources and Organization Su bcommittee, and we're thinking through how to meet that charter. DR. PAPAY: The other part of that is to look at how from an organizational point of view, the S&T Directorate has set up this pipeline. You've got parties sitting here from the programmatic point of view, and then you've got the other three offices set up for the proper flow through. I think looki ng at that to make sure we don't have any constrictions in that pipeline, and that t he pipeline, in fact, does expand as you go downstream, and the adequacy or the appropriatenes s of how hand-offs are made. I don't think we're going to go in and s uggest the boxes [in the organization chart] should be rearranged or anything lik e that. I think the organization is a management decision. But if we see issues arising from the hand off, and I'm not 28 suggesting that those are going to occur, I think that's the sort of thing we need to look at. We will als o be lookin g at what should be d one perhap s using in-h ouse talent, the laboratories they do have, how we wor k out this arrangement with the National Laboratories, things of that sort. GENERAL WELCH: One of the issues that comes up again and again, using BIOWATCH as an example (simply becaus e it's t he first thing out here, not because it's inherently difficult), is the hand-off of systems. The experi ence that most of us have, even though you have an R&D organization or an S&T organization (an operational organization), you have a user who spans the entire spectrum. That is, when you deploy a weapons system, the owner of the weapons system is also the developer of the weapons system, and also owned most of t he S&T. So the hand off there is within an organization that maintains birth-to-death (c radle-to-grave) cognizance. And so one of the potential organizational issues that comes out of w hat we've heard so far, or what we have not heard so far, is how does that bi rth-to-death attention take place. As an example, BIOWATCH has now been handed o ff, but obviously BIOWATCH is not finished. There's an enormous amount of S &T that would be continuing, so I guess it's not quite clear to me how that birth- to-death organization actually operates. DR. MCQUEARY: I th ink that's an im portant area because, quite frankly, BIOWATCH is not perfectly clear to us eit her in a sense of how it's going, as you summarized very well. But it's not so clear to me that I want to have S&T continue to take on responsibility for operational capab ilities, because the risk i s we become an operational unit as opposed to Science & T echnology. DR ATLAS: On the other hand, you've got second generation technology. DR. MCQUEARY: And this is the rationaliz ation that I've convinced myself that BIOWATCH is in the embryonic beginning of a capability and provides a very important capability; but as John [Vitko] described, we hav e a long way to go for this thing to come to what we view as the system that we want to point to, where it needs to be. So on that basis, since it is going to be evolutionary, I can see us operating something that's got pieces of BIOWAT CH, pieces of BIOWATCH II, pieces of BIOWATCH III, and evolving this thing to be what we want it to be and scientifically what the right answers need to be. But if we do that with every single th ing (BIOWATCH is going to be roughly ten percent of our total budget), we can soon find ourselves in a situation where the operational aspects dominate the S&T piec e, and I don't w ant that to happen. DR. PAPAY: I think there are mechanisms for involving the ultimate internal customer, the operating entity within DHS that would be responsible. 29 DR. MCQUEARY: That's part of the problem too. There is n't an ultimate internal DHS customer. DR. PAPAY: One of the options may be to invent internal customers within an operating organization. DR. GAST: I was just going to say that ; in addition, we did spend s ome time talking about the integrated biodefense strategy and the or ganizat ional constructs to integrate the medical communi ty and the intelligence c ommunity appropriately on both ends -- the intelligenc e community on one end and the medical community on the other. So depending on how you interpret our role as the subcommittee, this organizational aspect was something in addi tion to the i nteraction with the National Laboratories we were taking very seriously. GENERAL WELCH: It seems to me that's very much w ithin your charge. DR. ROCA: I wanted to ask a questi on given the conversation about the operations part of the Mission and Operations Subcommittee. I had been as suming that operations referred to how S&T operates, its own domain as opposed to the operations in the field of how you did BIOWATCH or whatever. If that were true, then the operations M&O would worry about how to go from one phase of development to another phase, such as testing. GENERAL WELCH: I guess the intent of operations was operational concepts [CONOPS]. Now, that doesn't mean t hat's what we still believe. DR. ROCA : No. GENERAL WELCH: It's on that level. DR. ROCA: Okay. GENERAL WELCH: Not only internal operations. DR. ROCA: Given that, then I think there would be iss ues that we have listed in our charter that we're going to e-mail to you. DR. GAST: No thanks. DR. PAPAY: I think that's the basis fo r some of our chai rman's questions. You do the \"what\" and we will do the \"how.\" DR. ROCA : But how the matrix portfolio st ructure is working, I think that's an operational issue. 30 GENERAL WELCH: I'm not quite sure. DR. GAST: You're operation -- DR. ATLAS: I just w ant to emphasis what I said befor e: I see BIOWATCH as something that we have to look at very cl osely on the program side, not just because of the question of the content, but also for just t hese reasons -- that it's an exam ple of one in whic h accession to new technology (t he generational developm ent; the question of deployment of that technolog y; where, when and how fa r in the context of S&T) overlaps in terms of interests. DR. PAPAY: That's why I said t here needs to be coordination. GENERAL WELCH: All the subcommittees are intended to overlap. DR. ATLAS: Sure. But I do think that we h ave a primary responsibility on the Program Subcommittee side to say this is a major program and to question its goals and objectives, how well they are being met from an S& T point of view, and how does that interact with the w ay in which deployment takes place. We may have something to contribute with regard to BIOWATCH II and III just as the Operations Subcommittee does. GENERAL WELCH: Yes. I think the operations and the technology obvious ly have to be closely interfaced. DR. FRANZ: I would like to follow on to your point and also Alice's [Gast]. It's my understanding that there is a hand off at some point between NIAID, Tony Fauci's staff, out o f the tech b ase into the preclinic al trial pillar. DR. VITKO: Absolutely not. DR. FRANZ: So that is gone. DR. VITKO: There are no respons ibilities within DHS. DR. FRANZ: There was a pr eclinica l trial pillar that was briefed early on. DR. VITKO: It's not th ere. That was part of the cleaning up. There is no biomedic al. GENERAL WELCH: So you're not involved in syndromic surveillan ce. DR. VITKO: First of all, we were talk ing about progress of drugs to clinical vaccines. GENERAL WELCH: Now I'm talking about medical. 31 DR. VITKO: Let's answer one question, t hen we'll get to the other one. The answer to that one is clearly a no. We're not involved in that -- in fact, that whole clinic al process goes through there. Our only invo lvement on the biomedical counterm easures is in the context of Bioshield where our responsibilit y is to certify a material threat to this country, to estimate the size of what's needed, and to support those size and requirements for the strategic national stoc kpile. With res pect to the question that you raised about biomedic al surveillanc e, we're doing a small am ount of work in biomedical sur veillance. The President has a bio surveillance initiati ve. There's an integrated initiativ e across multiple agencies. There are sector specif ic responsibilities, so all human health data will be han dled throug h a separate line. Ther e is a responsib ility for DHS within that that deals with the integration of multiple sur veillance, heal th, animal food, as well as environmental sources, environmental wate r sources, air, water and food, and intelligenc e data. That fusion activity is to occur within DHS and the Information Analys is and Infrastructure Protection (IAI P) Directorate to s upport a more integrated CONOPS picture that DHS uses for managing an incident of the national res ponse plan and the national incident management syste m. GENERAL WELCH: What further complicat es this whole question, again not to start with a blank slate, but we have to relate things to our own experience, and that is, in this case, the customer is not the Federal Government, or at least there is a customer that is not the Federal Government. So when you think about how you relate continually in S&T, continuing product improvement, etc., to the fi elded product, not only is it not encapsulated within an e ntity like a military dep artment, it's not even encapsulated within the Federal Government. It seems to me that that raises the complexity of making product improvement, follow-on S&T, fielding, upgrades, etc., that it makes that far more complicated than anyth ing that any of us have dealt with in the Defense Department. MS. BORRONE: I thi nk the point you're raising, Larry [Welch], though, leads me back to the thought that we started with: risk and assessment of risk, and then how that factors in throughout the cycle of the devel opment of the product for BIOWAT CH, for example, particularly given other users, and so I think it leads us back to a question that our subcommittee focused in on immediatel y, which is we need a better understanding of not what the vulnerabilities and risks are per se, or how they're identified per se, but how we take those and make judgments about the priorities, the level of investment, and then how we see the resulting products ac tually meeting those expectatio ns or thought to be expectations, and w hether they are or aren't, a nd then whether they justify the additional level of resource depending on the continuing think ing about threats or risks and vulnerabilities. At l east that's what your comment sounded like to me as I was listening to what you were talking about in the Resource and Organization Subcommittee area. 32 DR. PAPAY: I took it a little bit differently . I think lookin g at it on that level -- whether you call it programmatic or mission, or what have you -- I think what the Chairman was suggesting from the Resourc e and Organization Subcommittee is how to effectively translate technologies to the field where your cu stomer base is 44,000 entities, and it may be public health entities for technolog y A, it may be ports and harbors for technology B, and it may be fighter s for technology C. I'm taking as the charge here that there may be a single way or multiple ways in which to get technologies out to the user community, and I'll use the phrase in \"the best manner possible,\" without trying to get in to it at this point in ti me, because it may be different approaches for different user communities. GENERAL WELCH: Yes. If you can do that, we will make progress. MR. FERREN: I have just one point. Th is strikes me as being critical to success, but it's also important to note that this is someth ing that the best companies in America do very badly, which is transition fr om R&D into production and such. So it's not like this is a basic skill set wh ere you ju st looked to best practices and ind ustry and government. This is a nationa l level problem, and it's one that is very hard to look around and say, here's how you would go do this. I think it's further complicated, in my observations of government, by the acquis ition regulations that most agencie s work with it, because the ability to react fast and to transfe r anything rapidly is contrary to all of the checks and balances that are put in place. I think someone should be looking at this from an acquisition's perspective of how to get the best leverage sp ecifically to address this issue of rapid technology transfer. I think it's doubly hard for government. DR. MCQUEARY: We actually have specia l legislation that's included in the Act that created the Department of H omeland Securi ty to be able to do fast contracting. One very i mportant example of the work t hat we're doing is on Counter MANPADS, the counter to the shoulder-fired miss ile which is a threat to je t aircrafts. We went from issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to hav ing three contractors under contract in four-and-a-half months. So we're working very hard to use these legisl ative authorities. Basically this puts us in a position wher e we don't have to put with up a protest if somebody doesn't like what we've done. We sort of avoided that aspect of it in some cases depending on which one you us e, but your point is extr emely important. I cannot imagine a s cenario where we say we know exac tly what to do, it's going to take us seven years to get there. Who would ever li sten to that and say this is the government. So you hav e to have that to be able to react quickly. I also think it would be helpful if t he Committee took a look at the H omeland Security Advanced Research Projects A gency. We're getting pushed back in some particular quarters in the government who th ink HSARPA should be just like DARPA. If we were to move in that direction, it woul d force us to create yet another organization reporting to me that deals with the cor porate i nterface by dividing execution responsibilities up differently, so I would appreciate a view. As I stated earlier, my view is we're going to evolve into something that can have more of a DARPA flavor, but we shouldn't start out that way. 33 GENERAL WELCH: Are you r eady to take that on? DR. PAPAY: That's fi ne. GENERAL WELCH: We'll discu ss it at the next meeting. The Outreach Subcommittee? DR. BESSETTE: The good news is we're the last presenter of the day. We had a couple of meetings by phone, a face-t o-face meeting, and considerable e- mail exchanges as we prepared our presentation. The Outreach Subcommittee is composed of Baruch Fischhoff, Tony Ibarra , Ernie Mitc hell, and me; and we view our mission as part of the legisl ative mandate for the Department , which was outreach. The Outreach Subcommittee will deal with matte rs concerning communications with university academic research institut es and commercial facilities. And so bas ed on that slide which you see and on whic h we had spent considerable time, we formulated a two point mission statement. If I were to re duce those two bullets into two words, the firs t word would be \"technology,\" and the second word would be \"communications.\" The first bullet is the mission of the Outreach Subcommittee which is to augment the Department's efforts in securi ng skill se ts. We chose the term \"skill sets\" to represent not only products, but also system s approaches, meth odology and skills that would be brought to bear from U.S. academic institutions, large and small businesses, and governmental and non-gover nmental organizations for homeland security. In that bullet we wanted to reflect the fact that our role was not to be a lobbying group, to be a testing group, or to focus on just products and widget s, but rather to look at the systems approach as to how the Depa rtment evaluates those technolo gies as they're brought into the Depar tment, the methods used, and w hether it is securing the best syste ms that would assist in homeland security. DR. MCQUEARY: In the part where y ou're talking about U.S. academic institutions, make sure that it includes Minority Institutions and, specifically, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, because ther e's strong interest in the colleges and universities being a part of what we're doing in the Department of H omeland Security. DR. BESSETTE: That's a good point. The second bullet deals with the effo rts to improve communications -- among those groups and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the public. We thought that was a very important concept, and also took advantage of some of the subcommittee members' expertise in addressi ng that issue, which we felt is very important -- where the rubber really meets the road. Th e communications of these skill sets, as well as responses to the public and to the other customer s that the Department 34 might deal with, such as academics, universities, business and governmental laboratories, are ve ry important. As we indic ated there, this effort seeks to improve communications among these groups as well as the public, who are c oncerned with the impact of their work on homeland security. S o these two bullets tri ed to capture our mission, and I w ould ask if there are any comments or if any of the other members wanted to add anything to that. MR. IBARRA: I'd like to just add a couple of items in regards to the government's procurement process that can happen relati vely quick ly, four months, which is phenomenal. I think, secondly, we have to look very carefully at the small business sector. Small bus iness is able to ramp up rather qui ckly compared to large corporations. I liked the analogy that Russ used. It's l ike look ing at a large cargo ship versus a small canoe. That canoe can turn and move quickly. And with small business that 's out there, they look at the needs of security that are occurri ng. In the security industry, I would say pr obably five percent of those companies are on that cutting edge of technology and at times they may be on the bleeding edge. That's why we have agencies like the Nati onal Labs to assist these companies, Small Business I nnovative Research ( SBIR), the universities , and to look at this kind of technology that's out there, and then actually put it into either a pilot program or a workable s ystem. Surveillanc e is becoming a major part of security today, because visuals are tools that law enforcement c an utilize to assess situations. They're a smart technology now. I see small companies out there that ar e putti ng programs together that can look at abnormal behaviors that will create ala rm conditio ns that then require human interventio ns. There are software progr ams out there that will loo k at unattended baggag e, somebody d rops bagga ge off it will creat e an alarm condition. We're going to see a move towards this. I think in order to deploy that rapidl y, we again need that procurement arm, but we also want to look at these smart companies that are out there. DR. MCQUEARY: We do have an SBIR pr ogram; we have $20 million set aside this year. We're currently in contract negot iations with 66 small businesses as the first step in the SBIR process. We do have 2 1/2 percent of the Researc h, Development & Acquis ition (RDA) budget set aside for SBIR, so your po int is well taken. DR. BESSETTE: I think our mission would b e to look into the Department's activities with those companies and become more informed about them. DR. GAST: I was just wondering, t he second bullet talk s about communicatio ns with those who are concerned wit h the impact of their work on homeland security. It 35 sounds lik e the focus i s on communications wit hin thos e working on homeland security rather than communications to the outside world who wo uld be inter ested in the impact of homeland security efforts to protect them. Maybe this is just a wording issue or the tone of the second bullet. DR. BESSETTE: Because we certainly di d not mean internal communications. We meant the external communications, as I said from the beginning. DR. ROCA: Is this the gr oup that concerns itself wit h how DHS effectively tells the public that they're in a pickle, or they're not, or whatever? DR. BESSETTE: That's what we're trying to convey by bullet two. DR. MCQUEARY: I'd encourage you to interact with Secretary Ridge's Homelan d Security Ad visory Cou ncil (HSA C) as you develop this advice. They also have an interest in advis ing the Secretary. DR. FISCHHOFF: The point is that we need science an d technolo gy that will inform the exec uting entities, that's ul timately a political decision. GENERAL WELCH: I would call that \"ex pectation control.\" You really nee d an understanding of the technical an d capability issues so that you insure that the public has realistic expectations. DR. FISCHHOFF: ... and has the ability to make decisions in its own best interest that will also s erve the national best interest, and where he re the public includes local officials. I mean there are lots of people who need to understand what the capabilities are with various pl anning horizons, bot h before, during and after events in a way that th at commun ication doesn't compromise us, s o this is a technically difficult forum of communication t hat requires R&D. MR. OXFORD: One other aspect that we talked about this morning on outreach is also reaching out to state and local gover nments to understand t heir needs. So this is getting into the community that may help provide us products, but reaching out to people so that we understand state and local needs . This is something we're beginning to work at the Office of Domestic Preparedn ess. We have a two-prong approach here that would be how to do busines s with sm all business es and also how to get the requirements. DR. BESSETTE: I think based on what I'm hearing, maybe we can expand to specify those areas such as Secretary Ri dge's HSAC, the other governmental elected officials, agencies that could be part of the co mmunications effort as well as the public. GENERAL WELCH: Just to be sure you don't get bored, we rather casually said several times that you need to involve state and local officials in these forums where you're making decisions. The problem is I don't know how one does that. So w hen you 36 say state and local, you're not talking 50 entitie s, you're talking 5,000. The point is to give some thought to how you can actually ge t useful state and local flow in some way that's actually manageable. DR. FISCHHOFF: It mi ght be worth thinking about this as having two S&T elements: one sort of politic al element, where the S&T element is first trying to get the content right so that people understand w hat the issues are, and you understand what they're hearing; and one where you engineer the process (that's the research part of a question) and then implement it in a way that you've gotten the science right though it is probably in somebody else's department. Y ou could pr ovide guidance on how to have this two-way communication that is technically sound. GENERAL WELCH: If you'll put a bulle t on your chart that says that. DR. BESSETTE: I take your point. Also, follo wing on y our point, General Welch, we did disc uss in one of our meetings, as a matter of fact, taki ng advantage of Ernie's [Mitchell] skill sets to outreach to the firs t-responder co mmunity on a nationa l basis and get their input into that. Is there anything you want to add to that? DR. MITCHELL: I thi nk we can flesh it out further, but there are a number of, let's say, large representative organizations that we could cross-sample to determine what the national consensus is, and take input as well as disseminate information. A lot of what folks are looking for is evaluati on of technology, to see what works, so standards and testing and evaluation would be very helpful. I think we want to look at ways to get that involvement as well. DR. BESSETTE: The last two slides, obviously, are based on our knowledge of the Department which has been increasing exp onentially. Our methods of operation will be the same as other subcommittees , but based on the DHS missions, the subcommittee may utilize the following metho ds to assist our evalua tion: by no means do we mean this is totally inc lusive, but si te visits would be useful to institutions engaged in research or manufactu ring of product lines that might be important for us to learn more about; review of requested reports or other studies, bot h from government and other academic and industry sources, as well as on suggested methods for improved communications, as Baruch sugges ted. There are a number of studies that have already been done, but they need to be expande d on how to best communicate with the various public s that the Department deals with. The last slide, in terms of what w e saw as special issues, contains really two prime issues. As we said from the beginnin g, one of these is to assist the Department in identifying cutting edge technologies, and we thought these choices of words were important; that is, they are \"r ealistic\" (meaning the timetable) , they are \"reliable\" (having sensitivities , specificities), and they are \"practical\" (meaning t hat first-responders and end-users or customers would find these helpf ul in enhancing homeland sec urity). So in that bullet, we tried to capture the realism of budgetary constraints as well a s the needs of customers to bring technology into their hands. 37 The second issue was assisting the Department to improve public communication. I think addressing Alice's [Gast] point there, we mean outreach public communications as a method for enhanc ing or improving homeland security. And I think Baruch has, obviously, a lot of experience in that area and can bring to bear how we should focus research to better improve t he Department's ability to reach out to the public before there's an event. A n educat ed public would be more secure than an uneducated public, and that, essentially, is how we viewed our missions. GENERAL WELCH: Comments? MS. BORRONE: I have a question of ba ckground information. Y ou mentioned earlier the Secretary's Advisory Council (HSAC) . There are a number of other activities that the Department of Homeland Security has underway that we mi ght usefully learn about just to have this information or backgro und. For example, I understand that there is a group that's been comprised of individu als from around the country who are experts in certain areas, that working through Louisi ana State University could call upon experts in the case of an incident or an emergency. I don't know if it's called the SMART group, or whatever it might be called. DR. VITKO: It's not through Louisiana State University per se. In the structure you saw for Weapons of Mass Destruction (W MD), Office of In cident Management, they have a group of subject matter experts that are called SMART. I forget what the acronym stands for, but it's sort of an s ubject matter expert readiness team, so in each of the areas they have a list of experts in biological, rad/nuc, and chemical that would scientifically support the Secretary; in t he case of an incident, if somebody pulled an interagenc y incident management team, they would s upport it. So, yes. MS. BORRONE: I' m just thinking, list ening to what Russ [Bessette] is saying, that some i nteraction with the way they are thinking and approac hing some of these issues with the work that you're describing might be helpful. DR. BESSETTE: That would be a good idea and that would be a good plac e for us to either visit or communi cate with them somehow. GENERAL WELCH: Anything else on the committee? DR. FISCHHOFF: On e thing that's occu rred to me in the course of these two days is that apparently there are a number of very differe nt things that are called communications. There are public affairs, which to some extent speaks to the heart, perhaps more than the head, and that's kind of how to think about these things; there's the kind of routine, public health communications done by somebody with a bachelor's degree in c ommunications studies - they us ually aren't defense ev aluated, are kind of best practices; and then there are other things that have to do with research done to make certain that the content of the message is worthy and is correct, which is often the problem wit h many of these because they're typical communications. 38 Each of these has its own rule for us to sort o ut, a lex icon of what a re these things, what are the best practices in an area that we haven't been notably successful as a society and may not be what we w ant to endorse here. We may have an opportunity here to set the standards for bette r risk communications, or that w e might find some good ways to figure out what's going on within the Department. GENERAL WELCH: Well, we have time for any general discuss ion, but let me talk very bri efly about some administrative items. The next meet ing is planned in the Livermore Valley, 31 August - 1 September. It will be a joint Lawrence Liver more and Sandia Laboratory meeting. As I mentioned earlier, if you have comments regarding structure let me know so t hat I can inform the staff as to how we would like things changed. You have my email address as well as those of the staff. Other comments, questions, discussions? The meeting is adjourned. Larry D. Welch General, USAF (Ret.)
