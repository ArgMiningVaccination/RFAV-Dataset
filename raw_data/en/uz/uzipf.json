Simply put, functional medicine is searching for the root cause of a health problem, rather than simply treating a symptom. Read about a personal example below. Whenever possible, we use evidence based based testing to help us understand what's going on with your body and to help guide therapy. This combination of factors creates a unique \"fingerprint\" of health and illness for each person. The goal of functional medicine to help patients achieve optimal wellness within this framework. - Nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management are essential foundational pillars for health. We can help you work on these factors one step at a time with suggestions by Dr. Gering. - Our body's function is also influenced by prior trauma, toxin exposure, genetics and our personal microbiome (good and bad bacteria, fungi, & viruses that live on and in our bodies). - There are three main body systems that we systematically test at treat: the neuroendocrine system, the gastrointestinal system and the detoxification system. Examples of specific tests include: - Neuroendocrine tests - full thyroid panel, Vit D level, salivary (and/or sometimes urinary) hormone tests - Gastrointestinal tests - H.pylori testing, SIBO breath test, comprehensive stool analysis, and others - Detoxification system - heavy metal provocation test, urine organic acid testing, lyme testing, etc How is Functional Medicine Different than \"Regular Medicine\"? Regular (allopathic) medicine can deliver amazing life saving results in the face of acute illness (i.e. pneumonia or appendicitis) and/or trauma (i.e. cuts or broken bones). - Unfortunately, this problem\u2014>drug, and symptom\u2014>surgery treatment approach does not work well with chronic illness. Examples of chronic illness include fatigue, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, headaches, irritable bowel. Even though medications help to manage common medical problems (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis), this often creates a dependency on the medication and can result in side-effects. To effectively address chronic illness, there needs to be enough time to gather a thorough patient history. This history helps us understand the complex factors that creates each person's \"fingerprint\" of health and disease. The history will also help direct which specific tests to do to help uncover hidden causes of disease. Dr. Kalish refers to these hidden causes as the \"4 horseman\". Functional medicine addresses the whole person, not one symptom or system at a time. (For example, instead of just thinking about the lungs when someone is wheezing, we may also think about the gut). This approach helps the health care provider understand the complex web of interactions, and provide therapy utilizing lifestyle management, nutrition, supplements, herbs, and if necessary temporary bio-identical hormone replacement and/or regular prescription medications - with the goal of restoring balance and wellbeing. What are the \"4 Horsemen\"? The 4 Horsemen are an analogy that Dr. Kalish uses to explain the underlying processes that cause disease. They include: - Inflammation - think heat, swelling, increased blood flow and white blood cells are on high alert, as in a sprained ankle or infected cut; but it can be on a smaller scale as in the gut lining or the cell lining inside blood vessels; this can result in \u2014> tissue destruction and poor function (like an arthritic joint) - Catabolism - breakdown of muscle and gut lining - this can happen when not getting enough nutrients (i.e. starving), but also can happen in response to high cortisol (as when stressed); if catabolism is short term (i.e. when being chased by a bear), it helps provide quick energy to save your life...but if longterm (i.e. mean boss that you face every day), it contributes to \"leaky gut\" and a change in body composition \u2014> less muscle, more fat - Insulin Resistance - when your blood sugar goes up and down a lot, your cells no longer respond to insulin very well; thus sugar (i.e. fuel) is not able to get into the cells where it can be burned to create energy \u2014> this results in less energy to run cell functions (fatigue) and high blood sugar causes tissue damage (kidney problems, nerve issues, heart disease, etc) - Oxidative Stress - free radicals occur during the process of breaking down hormones, waste products, and toxins; inside cells, these free radicals (electrons) act like \"sparks\" popping out from a fireplace; if not \"put out\" with antioxidants like vitamin C etc, the \"sparks\" start to burn little holes in the machinery of the cells (like the mitochondria) \u2014> causing the cells to not work right or be able to repair themselves (think fatigue and/or even cancer) Who Might Benefit from a Functional Medicine Consult? - Anyone who wants to optimize their health and focus on prevention - People who have chronic illness such as high blood pressure, heartburn, high cholesterol, diabetes, hypothyroidism, asthma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, etc. who want to look for treatment options to complement or perhaps even replace some of their prescription medications - Those who a struggling with conditions that traditional medicine does not have much to offer, such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, headaches, eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, difficulty with weight loss, etc How Do I Set Up an Initial Functional Medicine Consult? - Call our office at 715-861-2300. - We will email you a welcome letter with attached intake forms that you can either mail or email back to us. Please fill them out and return to Spero Wellness Clinic as soon as possible. Once we receive these forms back, we will then contact you to set up your Functional Medicine appointment. - We will ask for a $200 deposit by cash, check or credit card when you make your appointment. - If you are unable to keep your appointment, we request notice 2 business days in advance so that others can be served in that 90 minute time slot. You can give that notice via phone call at 715-861-2300. - Please be aware that we reserve the right to keep this deposit for Functional Medicine intake appointments cancelled with less than 2 business day notice. We understand that an extenuating circumstance may happen and we will take that into consideration. We also reserve the right to charge for the remainder of the visit fee if you do not show up for your scheduled appointment. - Lastly, if you would like us to review outside medical records prior to your appointment, you will need to sign & send a medical release form(s) for your provider of choice, such as your primary care physician, specialist(s) of hospital. This form can be filled out electronically on our patient portal, or we will email one to you. Remember it will likely take a few weeks for us to get the records, and may take an additional week for Dr. Gering to get the time to review them. How Much Will This Realistically Cost? A new functional medicine intake visit costs $600. This includes review and summary of your intake form, review of outside records if available in time, a 90 minute visit with Dr. Gering, a free BIA scan (body composition analysis), and often a free Alpha-Stim session. You will receive an initial treatment plan, including diet, lifestyle and initial supplement recommendations. Further expense and treatment depends on what we mutually decide to do to investigate further. - If not done recently, we will likely want to do some standard labs. Examples include a CBC, complete metabolic panel, ferritin, TSH, free T3, free T4, Vit D, Vit B12, +/- Lyme Western blot, etc. To expedite recommendations, you can have these simple labs drawn ahead of time. - You can have the labs drawn at our clinic at substantially reduced cost, and interpretation of these labs will be included. - Alternatively, you can have labs drawn at a local facility accepting insurance, however we reserve the right to charge a nominal interpretation fee of $25-50 depending on the number and complexity of labs needed. - In order to look at your condition in a different way, we will need to test and treat the 3 basic body systems as noted above. Again, examples of the three basic body systems and corresponding functional medicine tests to investigate those systems are: - Neuroendocrine System (\"hormones\") - Labrix Salivary hormones $255 for an 8 panel - Dr. Gering prefers salivary testing, but will recommend urinary testing in some circumstances - Gastrointestinal System (\"the gut\") - The GI MAP is a stool analysis by Diagnostic Solutions $359 - Detox System (\"detox\") - Genova ION is a Micronutrient with Amino Acids test - cost depends on your insurance - Initial cost will be $225. Genova will bill your insurance and depending on where you are at with your deductible and benefits you could pay up to another $214. This is a very complex test and often takes 45-60 minutes for Dr. Gering to review your results and research best treatment options. As such, there will also be a $45 phlebotomy fee/interpretation fee payable to Spero at time of blood draw. - There may be other specialty tests to consider as well, such as MTHFR genetic testing, heavy metals testing, celiac panels, lipid particle testing, H.pylori tests, Vibrant Food Zoomer and/or Tickborne Panels, CD57 count, mycotoxins and more. - You may have a copy of your results from these specialty test when they are complete. However, if you wish to receive Dr. Gering's interpretation of the results, we do require a follow-up visit for all specialty labs. During your follow-up visit, Dr. Gering will explain your test result and develop a personalized therapeutic program for you, which is typically designed to last 2-3 months before reassessment. Follow up visits will take 30-45 minutes for one specialty lab, 45-60 minutes for 2-3 specialty labs. Our base rate for a functional medicine follow up visit is: - $150 for a 30 minute visit - $225 for a 45 minute visit - $300 for a 60 minute visit Are you ready to invest in your health? When it comes to dealing with chronic illness, functional medicine may take more time, effort and perhaps a bit more up-front, out-of-pocket investment. However, we are confident that the investment in your health will be worth it!
