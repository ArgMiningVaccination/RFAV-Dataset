Of particular interest is the study of omega 3 and omega 6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFAs), notably acid, 22:6n 3), and ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4n 6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protec tins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the \"return to homeostasis\" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega 6 fatty acid ARA appears increased, and omega 3 EPA and DHA decreased in most cancer tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega 3 LC PUFAs consumption and an omega 6/omega 3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. Along with their lipid lowering properties, omega 3 LC PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our liver and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega 3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega 3 LC PUFAs and the omega 6/omega 3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or sup plementation of omega 3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.

This was followed by many others, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and peptidomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics [ 2, 3]. The latter is a subset of the metabolomics, and aims at mapping, determining and quantifying all lipids within healthy or altered cells, tissues or organisms [ 4, 5]. Lipidomics emerged about 15 years ago, and its pro - gress has depended directly on the advances made in analytical technologies, particularly gas chromatogra - phy (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). The ability of both techniques to be coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and the different ionization technologies developed including electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix-assisted Open Access *Correspondence: rzarate@icic.es 1 Canary Islands Cancer Research Institute (ICIC), Ave. La Trinidad 61, Torre A.

Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) has vastly improved their sensitivity. Other techniques, such as nuclear mag - netic resonance (NMR), have also been utilized. All are accompanied by robust software to process the vast amounts of data collected [6, 7]. Thus, the field of lipid research is clearly advancing in parallel with the progress of analytical techniques. These advances allow the deter - mination of lipid profile alterations and how these are associated with diseases. They can also detect changes in lipid metabolism or pathway modulation by lipids, that can now be established even in complex biological sys - tems. This provides new insights, enabling the discovery and characterization of molecular biomarkers, as well as the understanding of various pathologies associated to lipids and their mechanisms, for the subsequent restora - tion of lipids, prevention, drugs design and treatment of these ailments by acting on the lipid impact or alteration. Lipids are natural products derived from polyke - tides, which in turn originate from the acetate route [8]. The term lipids, includes fatty acids (FAs) and their derivatives, as well as related functional or biosynthetic substances derived from these compounds. Lipids are indispensable elements in the diet, both for the provi - sion of energy (beta-oxidation of FAs), and for the supply of essential FAs, i.e. ALA (alpha-linolenic acid, 18:3n-3) and LA (linoleic acid, 18:2n-6) [9]. They have biological activities that act to influence the function and respon - siveness of cell membranes and tissue metabolism, to hormonal and other signals. These biological activities may be grouped as regulation of membrane structure and function, regulation of intracellular signalling pathways, transcription factor activity together with gene expres - sion, and regulation of the production of bioactive lipid mediators. Through these actions, FAs affect health, well-being, and the risk of developing disease [10]. FAs are the simplest lipids, which in turn are compo - nents of other more complex lipids. FAs are organic com - pounds containing a hydrophilic carboxyl group attached to a hydrocarbon chain varying from C6 (six carbon atoms) to C32, with an additional terminal methyl group. Most of the FAs existing in nature have an even number of carbon atoms and linear hydrocarbon chains, although some of them, found primarily in bacteria, may contain branching or even cyclic structures [8]. In addition, these chains may be presented in two main forms, saturated without the presence of double bonds, or unsaturated, containing one or more double bonds, the latter being of greater physiological importance because of their medic - inal properties. Of particular interest within the unsatu - rated family are the long chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs), which can be categorized into two principal families\u2014omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6)\u2014depending on the position of the first double bond from the methyl end group of the FA. Common LC-PUFAs are EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3) and ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6). The synthesis of FAs can proceed either by anaerobic routes through polyketide synthase enzymes, which are only present in some microorganisms, or by aerobic met - abolic pathways, which are more universal, as they occur in plants, algae, fungi, and animals. This consists of suc - cessive elongation (carbon chain elongation) and desatu - ration steps (inclusion of double bonds into the carbon chain), reactions controlled by elongase and desaturase enzymes [11] (Fig. 1). There are variations in the order in which the steps of desaturation and elongation occur. Thus, \"metabolic path - way 6\" begins with a 6-desaturation, followed by chain elongation and desaturation thereof, to yield EPA when the initial substrate is ALA, or to yield ARA when the ini - tial substrate is LA. Next, EPA is elongated to DPA (doc - osapentaenoic acid, 22:5n-3), which is desaturated again in the 4-position to finally produce DHA (Fig. 1). There also exists the so-called Sprecher's route, which describes the production of DHA by consecutive 6 and 5 desatu - rations of ALA, to produce C24 metabolic intermediates that are finally shortened to DHA by a -oxidation step that takes place in the peroxisomes [12]. What defines this route, which has been characterized in mammals and fish [13, 14], is that the final product, DHA, is syn - thesized without the intervention of the 4-desaturase. Finally, the \"alternative route 8\" , typical in protists and algae, begins directly with an elongation step from C18 to C20, followed by desaturations at positions 8 and 5, generating DGLA (dihomo--linolenic acid, 20:3n-6) and ARA, respectively, as well as to finally produce ETA (eico - satetraenoic acid, 20:4n-3) and EPA [15] (Fig. 1 ). Diet, among other factors, has been postulated to modulate human capacity to produce LC-PUFAs from their essential C18 FA precursors, i.e. ALA and LA [16]. However, most recent studies indicate that endogenous synthesis of DHA from ALA in humans is much lower and more limited than previously assumed [17, 18] and as a consequence, sources of n-3 LC-PUFAs such as fish should be included in the human diet for general health [19, 20]. Thereby, with the technical advances attained in the last decades, and the deeper understanding of cell mem - brane physiology, lipids have eventually gained impor - tance in maintaining health, and more importantly, in their involvement in the development of diseases. In this review, we demonstrate the use of lipidomics and the cor - responding analytical tools to highlight the most recent information and evidences that LC-PUFAs participate in several major human pathologies.Page 3 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 Inflammatoryautoimmune diseases and lipids Virtually all diseases including diabetes and obesity, can - cer and cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, manifest some symptoms of inflammation. Other disor - ders classified under the term of inflammatory diseases, such as allergies, asthma, arthritis and autoimmune dis - eases, are dramatically increasing in occurrence. Possible causes of these inflammatory conditions are pointing to some novel factors, such as hidden allergens and infec - tions, environmental and dietary toxins, intake of pro-inflammatory diets, and even sustained stress. Western countries seem to be facing epidemics of aller - gic (60 million people), asthmatic (30 million people) and autoimmune disorders (24 million people), which include a wide variety of syndromes affecting all together around 5 percent of the total Western population [21, 22]. Rheu - matoid arthritis, lupus, multiple disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and thyroid disease, are just some of the ailments that belong to this poorly understood group of diseases. They are twenty first century illnesses that mostly occur in developed countries. Autoimmune disorders are characterized by a systemic inflammation, which results in the body attacking its own tissues. In the absence of an infection or other clear reason, the activation of T cells or B cells or both, gives rise to this clinical condition. It seems that women are more susceptible to suffer from autoimmune diseases, Fig. 1 Biosynthetic route of fatty acids requiring the essential LA (linoleic acid) and ALA (alphalinolenic acid) with the different variations and steps. des desaturase, elo elongase; ARA (arachidonic acid), DGLA (dihomo gamma DHA acid), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid), DTA (docosatetraenoic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic ETA (eicosatetraenoic acid), GLA (gammalinolenic acid), SDA (stearidonic acid)Page 4 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 and that environmental factors and alien substances may act as haptens and render autoantigens immunogenic. Autoimmune syndromes and their multifarious and still unknown foundations are a challenge to the progress and testing of new therapies to fight disease [22, 23]. Although an attempt to decrease total fat and satu - rated fat intake in Western diets has become a dietary tonic, with evolution, the intake of omega-6 FAs has increased while that of omega-3 FAs has decreased. As a result, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio has substantially risen from 1:1 in our ancestral diets, to around 20:1 in today's Western diets. This change also coincides with a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, together with a wide range of inflamma - tion disorders. However, controversial results have been reported regarding the influence of the dietary ratio of omega-6/omega-3 FAs on body fat increments, mecha - nisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and systemic inflammation [24, 25]. The reduction of inflammation observed in clinical studies with supplemental omega-3 LC-PUFAs opens new options to pharmacologically treat systemic lupus erythematosus [26]. Additionally, animal models dem - onstrate the benefits of n-3 FAs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma. Whereas results using supplemental fish oil in patients with IBD are still unreliable, clinical trials involving patients with RA have demonstrated benefits that have been further supported by meta-analyses studies [27]. Globally, experimental results highlight that a wide number of inflammation-related events can be partly impeded by a dietary intake of EPA and DHA from oily fish and fish oil supplements. As Calder elegantly revised [ 28, 29], these events include leukocyte chemo - taxis, cellular adhesion molecule (CAM) expression, leukocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, produc - tion of ARA derived eicosanoids like PGs and LTs, pro - duction of inflammatory cytokines and T cell reactivity. Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of n-3 LC-PUFAs also include: alteration of cell mem - brane phospholipid FA composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of the activation of the pro-inflammatory nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-B), activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NR1C3 (i.e. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor), and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. Mechanisms which are all interlinked. PUFAs can regulate a wide set of homeostatic and inflammatory processes linked to numerous diseases either directly or via transformation into locally act - ing bioactive metabolites [30]. These metabolites are (LOX), cytochrome soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and non-enzymatic reactions [31-34] (Fig. 2). The physiological functions of these PUFA-derived lipid mediators are only well understood for a few molecules. It seems that some of the ago - nists and receptors that regulate inflammation, and the cytokine cascade that accompanies infection, initiate the release of ARA and related PUFAs, resulting in a lipid bioactive signalling storm [35-37]. Classically, the term eicosanoids has been used to describe not only those metabolites derived from ARA, but also from other 20 carbon PUFAs, such as EPA and DGLA. Eicosanoids include the COX prosta (Fig. derived from omega6 PUFAs (i.e. ARA products PGE 2 and LTB4) are more powerful than their omega-3 PUFAs counterparts (i.e. EPA derived PGE3 and LTB5), which exert anti-inflammatory effects. SDA (stearidonic acid, 18:4n-3) and its elongated product 20:4n-3, have been reported to produce low active and health promoting eicosanoids able to lower plasma tri - glycerides (TG) [38]. Not only the absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 FA intake, but also the above mentioned increased omega-6/omega-3 ratio, have been recently shown to be highly pro-thrombotic and pro-inflamma - tory, and contribute to the prevalence of atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory-autoimmune diseases [25]. The larger the intake of ARA or its C18 precursor LA, the higher the production of their respective derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. In the last two decades, new families of lipid mediators important in the resolution of inflammation have been discovered and are being investigated. Thus, resolvins, protectins and maresins (Fig. 2) have been identified in the resolving exudates of acute inflammation. EPA-derived E-series (RvE) and (RvD) resolvins display potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory actions that include blocking the pro - duction of pro-inflammatory mediators and regulating trafficking of leukocytes [34]. In addition to the D-series resolvins, DHA is also a precursor of other anti-inflam - matory docosanoids named protectins (PDs) and mares - ins. These pro-resolving lipid mediators, together with the above mentioned resolvins, and the anti-inflamma - tory lipoxins, have been grouped together as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM). These are interesting compounds that constitute a novel topic of research, not only due to their bioactive role in the \"return to Page 5 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 homeostasis\" process, but also elucidating the physiologi - cal functions of other n-3 LC-PUFAs. In this sense, SPMs could be responsible for the efficacy of n-3 LC-PUFAs in the prevention and amelioration of childhood asthma, food allergies or atopy [39]. Metabolism of most eicosanoids/docosanoids implies the release of esterified into phospholipids, by phos - pholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes. Consequently, increased levels of free FAs and lipid mediator biosynthesis occur particularly after inflammatory cell activation. The most frequently involved PLA2s in the cellular production of bioactive shows a preference to hydrolyse ARA in the sn -2 position of phospholipids, and is generally considered the dominant enzyme mediating production of pro-inflam - matory eicosanoids, as well as the release of related n-3 PUFAs, i.e. EPA, DPA and DHA bioactive derivatives. In contrast, through the production of lysophospholipids iPLA2 plays a key role in most daily cellular functions, particularly in membrane homeostasis and remodelling. Finally, it remains unclear what role sPLA2 may play in eicosanoids signalling, although a cPLA2-dependent increase in the magnitude and duration of free FA levels, including ARA caused by sPLA2 up-regulation has been recently proposed [37, 40]. As already mentioned, the eicosanoids derived from ARA as a substrate are generally far more potent as pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic signalling regulators than those from EPA and DGLA. PGE2 and LTB4 in par - ticular induce the production of interleukins IL-6 and IL-1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). It is also known that the mechanism for PGE2-induced IL-6 production is via direct activation of the nuclear transcription fac - tor kappa B (NF-B). However, at the same time, DHA is a potent regulator of NF-B by several mechanisms, since it can directly inhibit NF-B activation, or prevent Fig. 2 Principal bioactive lipid mediators derived from ARA, EPA and DHA by action of lipoxygenases (LOXs), (thromboxane)Page Z\u00e1rate et al. (2017) 6:25 its activation by up-regulating intracellular glutathione to levels that effectively balance the oxidative stress. Furthermore, indirect mechanisms for DHA include its oxidation to the above mentioned potent signalling mol - ecules, the resolvins. During conditions of tissue stress, both EPA and DHA may be released from phospholipids by PLA2 to undergo conversions to resolvins that actively promote the resolution of inflammatory processes. Known anti-inflammatory mechanisms for the resolvins include the down-regulation of NF-B, and the removal of neutrophils from inflammatory sites [19]. Since the introduction of lipidomics, the expanded view of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory con - tributions of n-3 PUFAs derived eicosanoid/docosanoid signalling is remarkably more complex than initially thought. However, the potential to understand and develop novel treatments for proper inflammatory and metabolic conditions have become extremely promis - ing. The beneficial properties of omega-3 FAs have been appreciated for many years. However, the use of new lipi - domics analytical strategies, with increased sensitivity and throughput, has identified new FA-derived bioactive metabolites with new subjacent molecular mechanisms of action. Undoubtedly, this area of research has further highlighted the importance of eicosanoids in the inflam - matory process, and in particular, the role of omega-3 metabolites in controlling the inflammatory response and switching inflammation into a resolution state. In addition, it has also revealed the importance of gaining a 'global' view of eicosanoid and docosanoid metabolism in order to better understand the complex and exquisitely regulated mechanisms of their generation, action and metabolic inactivation, as well as an understanding into how these interconnecting and tightly regulated meta - bolic pathways are deregulated in disease settings [41]. A better comprehension of the cytokine cascade and its integration with the eicosanoid and docosanoid eruption that accompanies inflammation and its resolution should provide new insights leading to novel strategies for the understanding and treatment of inflammation according to individual age, genetic variation or dietary regime [37]. Meanwhile, the tremendous importance of acquiring the beneficial omega-3 PUFAs through diet to mitigate or prevent the appearance of these ailments has also been presented. Lipids and cardiometabolic health Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the leading global cause of death in 2013, claiming more lives each year than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. According to the last American Heart Association Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Report, CVD accounted for over 17.3 million deaths per year globally, a number that is expected to grow above 23.6 million by 2030 [42]. Several cardio-metabolic risk factors are associated with the prevalence of CVD, with only few of them, such as age, gender, genetics or family history, being non-modifiable. Most well-established risk factors for CVD are behavioural or modifiable, and are the target of pre - ventive or treatment interventions [43]. These risk factors include tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, inadequate diet, high blood pressure (SBP/DBP 140/90 mm Hg) and those that fall under the umbrella of metabolic syndrome, i.e. high fasting plasma glucose (100 mg/dL), dyslipidemia (triglycerides (TG) 150 or <50 mg/dL in females), obesity (waist circumference >102 cm in males or >88 cm in females) and insulin resistance [42] (Fig. 3). Within the possible lifestyle modifications for the pri - mary and secondary prevention of CVD, following a cardioprotective diet constitutes one of the main recom - mendations of many health and nutritional organizations and governing bodies. Consumption of fruits, vegetables, dietary fibre, and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats coming from sources such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils, has been shown to have a protective effect [44]. Multiple observational studies and early-randomized clinical trials show an inverse relationship between the ingestion of marine derived omega 3 or n-3 LC-PUFAs and major cardiovascular adverse outcomes [45]. Recom - mendations of n-3 LC-PUFAs intake from organizations Fig. 3 Scheme of cardio metabolic risk factors associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD)Page 7 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 such as the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL), the United Kingdom Scien - tific Advisory Committee in Nutrition (SACN) and the American Heart Association (AHA) include the con - sumption of 2-3 portions of oily fish per week in order to provide a minimum dietary intake of 200-500 mg/day of EPA plus DHA, increasing to 1-4 g/day for the secondary prevention of CVD or as a TG lowering therapy [46-48]. The capacity of n-3 LC-PUFAs to lower fasting plasma TG concentrations and VLDL production, one of the main TG-transporting lipoproteins, is one of the main proposed mechanisms that would explain omega-3 LC-PUFAs cardioprotective role, and it is also one of the most consistent findings across studies. Taking EPA and/or DHA in doses of 3.4-4 g/day have been shown to decrease TG levels by an average of 29% in individuals with levels higher than 150 mg/dL [49]. Proposed mechanisms to account for these effects include changes in transcription of several nuclear receptors involved in controlling lipid homeostasis: sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP), liver X receptor-alpha retinoid X receptor alpha and peroxi - some proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). EPA and DHA have been shown to regulate SREBP1c expression by inhibiting binding of the LXR/RXR heterodimer to the LXREs in the SREBP-1c promoter. This inhibition is translated into a decrease in de novo lipogenesis and therefore, into a reduction of circulating TG levels [29, 49]. PUFAs also inhibit transcription of HNF-4, regulating fat and carbohydrate metabolism and bile acid synthesis. Binding of n-3 LC-PUFAs activate FXR, which reduces TG levels by increasing hepatic through modu - lating lipoprotein lipase activity, inducing PPAR, and of PPAR increases FA oxidation, lipoprotein lipase, FA transport and enhances adipocyte differentiation, all contributing to lowering TG [45]. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs exert other cardioprotective functions, i.e. reduction of platelet aggregation and inflammation, anti - arrhythmic effect, improvement of endothelial function and myocardial relaxation and efficiency, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, and reduction of resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure [50]. The beneficial effects of EPA and DHA in reducing hyper - tension have been reported in both animal and human studies. Several meta-analyses of placebo controlled tri - als show reductions in blood pressure in hypertensive, as well as in normotensive individuals [51]. With reference to other cardiovascular risks also asso - ciated with CVD and metabolic syndrome, protection against the development of impaired glucose homeosta - sis and insulin resistance has been reported in animal studies, especially in murine models of metabolic syn - drome and type-2 diabetes. n-3 LC-PUFAs increase the expression of insulin-stimulated glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), substrate-1 (IRS1) and gly - cogen synthase-1 (GYS1) in skeletal muscle, enhancing glucose utilization [52]. In humans however, it is still not clear whether n-3 LC-PUFAs have clinically relevant effects on insulin resistance or diabetes risk. Regarding lipid mediators and CVD, as described pre - viously, eicosanoids have been attributed to a diverse range of biological activities, with PGs, TBXs and LTs dis - playing pro-inflammatory or pre-thrombotic roles. PGE2, in addition of being involved in all processes leading to the classic signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, and pain); it is also known to play a key role in the pathogen - esis of cardiovascular diseases, contributing to regula - tion of blood pressure. TXA2 has been shown to promote platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and smooth mus - cle proliferation, while leukotriene LTB4 promotes ath - erosclerosis [53]. However, not all ARA metabolites have a counterproductive effect, with some of them being able to display a beneficial/detrimental role depending on the tissue they are targeting or just having a general positive effect. In particular, ARA metabolites like EETs and their corresponding diols (DHETs), LXs and PGI2 have been understood to play a protective role in cardiovascular health (Fig. 2). Thus, EETs decrease inflammation and platelet aggregation, and in general act to maintain vas - cular homeostasis, while DHETs have vascular activity in coronary arteries. LXs have a number of direct actions on endothelial cells that are protective, and are in line with their role in resolution. PGI2 potently inhibits platelet aggregation and displays powerful vasodilator effects via relaxation of smooth muscle [50, 54, 55]. In addition to this \"classic\" pathway, EPA and DHA are likely to have a further protective function in cardiovas - cular health due to their ability to generate specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) named resolvins, protec - tins and maresins, which display an active role in the res - olution of inflammatory processes, [56]. EPA and DHA also serve as substrates for CYP-450 and sEH enzymes, generating epoxides and diols similar in structure but more potent than their ARA analogues (Fig. 2). It appears that DHA-epoxides are particularly efficient in reducing angiotensin-II driven blood pressure [57], and can be fur - ther metabolized to their corresponding diols, which are also vasomodulators and display direct effects on vascu - lar smooth muscle tone [58]. Multiple epidemiological studies, prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials have provided evidence for the cardioprotective role of n-3 PUFAs. Page 8 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 However, the overwhelming beneficial outcome of early studies appears to conflict with the results of recent pro - spective trials and meta-analysis of clinical trials, where mixed or less favourable results have been reported [59-61]. Back in 1970 epidemiological studies conducted in Greenland Inuits suggested that the high content of n-3 LC-PUFAs in their diet could be associated with the decreased risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovas - cular mortality observed in this population [62]. Follow - ing these observations, several prospective studies were designed to study the effect of fish or fish oil consump - tion on CVD. The DART study (Diet and Reinfarction Trial) enrolled male myocardial infarction (MI) survi - vors who were given dietary advice to eat at least two servings of fatty fish/week or fish oil capsules (0.5 g/day) for 2 years [63]. The results from this study showed that fish oil consumption reduced mortality by 29%. Another major study, the GISSI (Gruppo Italiano della Sopravvivenza nell' Infarto Miocardico-Prevenzione Trial) [64], showed an impressive reduction in both total and CVD mortality in post-MI patients taking 850 mg/day of EPA/DHA in a 1:2 ratio. However, a follow up of this trial, the GISSI-Heart Failure study [65], investigated the effect of 1 g/day omega-3 PUFA in patients with heart failure, reported a smaller reduction in mortality com - pared with the GISSI-P outcome. The JELIS study (Japanese Eicosapentaenoic Acid Lipid Intervention Study), an open-label blinded trial con - ducted with patients with hypercholesterolemia, showed that 1.8 g/day of EPA reduced combined cardiovascular events, although no effect on the incidence of arrhythmia was observed [66]. Recently, the double-blind Alpha-Omega Trial [67] indicated that an additional low-dose omega-3 supple - mentation did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in post-MI patients who were receiving state-of-the-art antihypertensive, antithrom - botic, and lipid-modifying therapy. However, a second - ary analysis in those patients with diabetes suggested that those who received the EPA-DHA plus ALA treatment experienced less ventricular arrhythmia-related events, and less combined end-point ventricular arrhythmia-related events. They also had a reduced number of fatal MIs [68]. In the last 7 years, other studies including the OMEGA trial, the SU.FO.OM3 trial, the ORIGIN study, the Risk and Prevention Study, and the AREDS2 trial have provided lit - tle or no evidence that n-3 PUFAs consumption reduces cardiovascular events, mortality or morbidity [69]. An explanation of the discrepancy between the results obtained in early trials and more recent studies could be the differences in baseline levels of omega-3 and drug therapy status of participants. Most of the early stud - ies were carried out in the pre-statins era and when consumption of fish oil was not as widespread, so it is understood that higher levels of n-3 PUFAs in the cur - rent background diet and higher numbers of participants on CVD medications would make it more difficult for n-3 PUFAs to display a significant effect on CVD outcomes. In this regard, the erythrocyte membrane EPA and DHA content or omega-3 index has been proposed as an indicator of n-3 LC-PUFAs intake, and as a risk strati - fication tool for coronary heart disease death. Setting an Omega-3 Index cut off or baseline level during the recruitment of participants would possibly allow out - comes of prospective trials to be more pronounced [70]. With reference to the interaction of drugs used in sec - ondary prevention of CVD and n-3 PUFAs, two clini - cal trials are being conducted at present, the reduction of cardiovascular events with EPA-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) and STRENGTH (Statin Residual Risk Reduction with Epanova in High Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia) to provide further evidence of the effect of omega-3 supplementation and statin therapy in established CVD or high risk for CVD participants [69]. In addition to the assessment of the n-3 LC-PUFAs baseline levels and the clinical history/medication of the prospective participants, other aspects, such as the qual - ity and stability of the n-3 LC-PUFAs sources, the bioavail - ability achieved with the selected EPA and DHA chemical form, the selection of the most appropriate FA dosage to use, and the ideal EPA:DHA ratio when these FAs are used in combination, should be taken into account. Other fac - tors as the improved digestion and absorption of these FAs when they are consumed along fatty meals, together with the selection of the most adequate study length and the use of compliance indicators during the course of the intervention, should carefully be weighed as important study design components that could possibly affect the overall outcome of future intervention trials. Cancer and lipids Cancer cells are known to exhibit a high and uncontrol - lable capacity to divide and proliferate. They require cel - lular building blocks, having an avidity for certain types of nutrients, particularly sugars, glutamine, nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the latter being needed for the for - mation of new membranes [71-73]. The high potential to boost angiogenesis or vascularization mechanisms for the progression of cancer is also well documented [74], as well as their metastatic faculty to invade healthy organs, with metastasis being the cause of 90% of deaths from solid tumours [75]. Regarding lipids, despite being ignored for a long time, an increasing number of reports are being made available Page 9 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 recognising the importance of these molecules within the cancer process where lipids, and in particular FAs, are required primarily for building new cell membranes. Cell membranes are composed of complex lipids, many of which are derived from palmitic acid (16:0). Lipids also act as biomolecules with ample signalling and transcrip - tion capabilities. Interestingly there are marked differ - ences in the lipid profiles of cancer cells compared with normal cells [76]. Like glutamine and lipids it has been agreed upon that cancer cells exhibit a high uptake of sugars, i.e. glucose, as an energy and building block molecule [71, 72, 77]. This sugar demand has served as a diagnostic tool in fluoro - deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) that can detect and image high glucose metabolism spots within the body [78]. Total sugar consumption positively correlated with the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma; while added fructose was linked with an increased risk of small intestine can - cer. In general, all investigated sugars were related to an increased risk of pleural cancer. Nonetheless, no relation between dietary sugars and risk of colorectal or any other major cancer was found [72]. A classical assumption has been that most proliferating cells rely on de novo synthe - sis of lipids from sugars to make new cell walls. However, an elegant report exhibits the nutrient preferences of pro - liferating fibroblasts and cancer cells in the presence of glucose and/or lipids (palmitate). Standard growth media for animal cells contain relatively low level of lipids, but large amounts of sugars and proteins. Employing this type of growth medium, fibroblast cells, HeLa and H460 cancer cells rely primarily in de novo synthesis of lipids from glucose or glutamate. However, when exogenous palmitate was added to the culture medium, de novo syn - thesis was very minor, showing a clear preference and marked uptake of palmitate (ca. 90%) from the medium for membrane formation. This evidence supports the importance of exogenous FAs to cellular proliferation. Moreover, blocking FA uptake decreased the prolifera - tion of fibroblast, HeLa and H460 cells, and supplement - ing them with exogenous palmitate, decreased lipogenic demand and dropped glucose uptake. These results sug - gest that proliferating cells utilizing exogenous lipids would be less susceptible to drugs designed to inhibit gly - colysis and/or lipogenesis for cancer treatment [73]. Cancer cells alter their metabolism to gain a continuous and potent proliferation capability. It has been cited that one major player is the modification of lipid metabolism, together with the reprogramming of lipid synthesis with the activation of many pathways and protein-protein interactions [79, 80]. Lipogenic 81, 82]. FASN appears overexpressed in many cancer types including breast and prostate, suggesting that FA synthesis plays a crucial role in cancer development [79]. Similarly, FA -oxidation enzymes, particularly carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoforms, were also overexpressed in many human tumours [80], with the upregulation of the FA biosynthesis beginning at early stages in the can - cer process in various types of cancers [77]. Analogously, some downstream cancer cell lipid metabolism transcription factors and signal regulating genes are overexpressed; in particular, FASN is controlled by growth factor receptor-associated pathways, PI3K-Akt [77, 83]. SREBP pro - teins are central for maintaining cellular lipid homeosta - sis, and unusual activation of SREBPs can contribute to obesity, fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, and could also be involved in cancer development [83]. Cholesterol is an important component of biological membranes influencing the fluidity of the lipid bilayer. With the reprogramming of cancer cells lipid metabo - lism, cholesterol synthesis is also affected; for example, in prostate and breast cancers. Its synthesis is highly regu - lated and proceeds through the mevalonate pathway with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) being a rate-limiting step. HMGCR is the target for statins, which have been reported to show antiprolif - erative activity in various cancer-cell lines, and have also been shown to increase the sensitivity to chemotherapy agents in colorectal cancer, and patients with acute mye - loid leukaemia or hepatocellular carcinoma [79]. In cancer cells major changes in lipid composition, i.e. the presence and/or abundance of saturated vs unsatu - rated FAs critically affects membrane physiology and plasticity. In bladder cancer tissue, levels of stearic acid (18:0), and oleic acid (18:1n-9) were higher compared to normal tissue, while the level of ARA was lower. Bladder cancer tissue showed a significant reduction in total n-6 PUFAs ( 15.1%). The change in the FA composition may be regarded as an indicator of altered lipid metabolism occurring in vivo during human bladder tumorigenesis [84]. In multiple myeloma (MM) patients, significant differ - ences in the plasma FA profile were observed compared to control. The total quantity of saturated and n-6 PUFAs in plasma were significantly higher in the MM group compared to the control group (28.0 vs 25.1%); and more strikingly, total n-3 FAs were significantly decreased in the plasma of patients with MM compared to control (7.7 vs 14.5%). The MM group showed decreased ALA (1.7 vs 6.0%), EPA (2.1 vs 3.8%), and DPA (0.3 vs 1.4%) lev - els, as well as a clear drop of the n3/n6 ratio (0.3) with Page 10 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 respect to the control (0.6) [85]. Compared to normal tissue samples, breast cancer tissue samples had higher levels of monounsaturated FA (oleic acid) and ARA, and lower levels of LA. Furthermore, the breast cancer tissues showed a significantly higher monounsaturated FA/satu - rated FA ratio [86]. Analogously, adipose tissue also influences cancer pro - gression, particularly for its capacity to act as an endo - crine system releasing and controlling biologically active substances (e.g. leptin, adiponectin, TNF-, etc.) some of which are upregulated in cancer [87]. Moreover, the size and/or number of intracellular lipid stores, or lipid droplets, which mainly contain triacylglycerides and cho - lesterylesters, are elevated in different types of tumours (breast, prostate, cervical, liver, colon) [79, 88]. Finally, n-3 LC-PUFAs exhibit anticancer activity, whereas n-6 LC-PUFAs promote the development of can - cer [89]. Omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption has been asso - ciated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. On the other hand, the levels of n-6 ARA appeared to be increased in most cancer tissues, while the levels of EPA and DHA were found to be lower than in normal tissues [90]. Rather than individual FAs, the ratio n-6/n-3 is of crucial importance for maintaining a healthy status and for the prevention of cancer, with a 2 4:1 ratio being optimal [91]. The mechanisms involved in the cancer prevention of n-3 LC-PUFAs are thought to proceed via their anti-inflammatory effect, their participation in the TXs pathways, their effects on COX and LOX enzymes, and their effects in many transcription factors [90]. In conclusion, since the role of lipids and/or FAs in cancer has been outlined and has already been dem - onstrated, it can be inferred that with the progress of lipidomics, understanding the underlying molecular machinery of lipid metabolism, and the role of lipids would assist the discovery of novel and potential targets, and develop new anticancer drugs for cancer therapy [76, 80, 87, 92]. Likewise, knowing the potential of n-3 LC- PUFAs to fight cancer, the inclusion of dietary sources of these PUFAs, such as fish, will direct the balance towards a healthy status rather than a cancer inducing diet char - acterized by reduced n-3 LC-PUFAs, containing elevated levels of dietary saturated fat, n-6 FAs, and hydrogenated trans-fats as it is often the case. Lipids and neurodegenerative disorders Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lat - eral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Aging is a natural process that affects the integrity of the neu - rovascular system, losing its functions and producing neurodegenerative diseases [93]. Such diseases are incur - able, resulting in progressive degeneration and in some instances death of neuron cells. To date, more than 600 neurodegenerative disorders are known. They are clas - sified according to the brain region, affected cell type or the specific molecular markers of each disorder. Genetic studies have discovered a wide range of molecular mark - ers related to neurodegenerative diseases which improves the elucidation of molecular mechanisms [94], diagnosis and therapeutic procedures [95]. The central nervous system (CNS) is highly enriched in n-3 LC-PUFAs, of which DHA is the most impor - tant, participating in many crucial processes within the mammalian cells, as well as being the most abundant component of the neuron membrane, having important structural and functional roles. Membrane status affects the transfer of neuronal information, speed of signal transduction, and interaction with proteins, indicating the importance of this FA in order to gain appropriate functioning [96]. DHA is also the principal n-3 FA in cor - tical gray matter, representing ~15% of total FAs in the adult human prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, other FAs like EPA, and less importantly DPA, are also pre - sent in the CNS, constituting around 1% of total brain FA composition [97] (and references within). Therefore, the control of the amount of DHA in our body, and especially in our liver and brain is really crucial for an optimal brain nutrition and functionality. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dis - order that produces severe cognitive impairment as it progresses. This pathology is the main neurological cause of dementia suffered by 36 million people worldwide, elderly adults in most cases (World Alzheimer Report 2011) [98]. The molecular phenotype is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid peptide (A) and aggre - gates composed of the hyperphosphorylated microtu - bule-associated tau protein [99]. Regarding lipids, DHA exerts a neuroprotective mode of with its lipoxygenase metabolite, Neu - roprotectin D1. They have been shown to participate in many different processes including reductions in pro - inflammatory signalling (prostaglandin E2 synthesis), activation of important genes like Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bfl-1, which participate in antiapoptotic mechanism, and also reducing the expression of proapoptotic genes (Bax, Bad) [100]. In this sense, the relationship between DHA deficiency and neuropathology in the pre frontal cortex, and how n-3 FAs deficiency may increase vulnerability to patients suffering affective disorder have been reviewed [97]. For example, it has been observed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), or bipolar disor - der (BD) exhibit a deficit of DHA in erythrocytes (MDD, 20%; BD 32%) relative to healthy controls [101].Page 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 Regarding AD, statistical differences in the amount of DHA in the liver of control subjects (324.83 \u00b1 122.89) and those of patients with Alzheimer's disease (204.64 \u00b1 74.62) have been reported. These data cor - related with both a lower amount of DHA in the brain, and a lower expression level of two genes involved in DHA biosynthesis in liver, fds2 and helo1 [102]. In post-mortem neocortex tissue, the profile of different lipids was investigated through GC-MS analysis. The results showed significant higher levels of FAs in AD neocor - tex region brain samples compared to non-AD neocor - tex region brain samples. A total of 9 FAs were elevated, with a marked increase in the percentage of DHA being observed in the cerebral region of AD patients [103]. This contrasted with most other reports of brain samples from AD individuals, which indicated a drop in DHA or an unaltered level in different regions of the brain [104, 105]. This increase may be due to the anti-inflammatory capac - ity of DHA, which may appear increased to activate the anti-inflammatory defence mechanism in AD brain. FA profiles in plasma also seem to be important and were quantified and compared with three different cor - tical regions in brains of deceased participants of the Memory and Aging Project. The percentage of DHA was lower in both the mid-frontal cortex and superior tem - poral cortex of AD brains compared to non-impaired brains, but only in the phosphatidylserine fraction. Furthermore, in plasma the differences in FA profiles between AD and non-impaired samples was related to the free FA (lower oleic acid isomers and omega-6 FAs in AD) and phospholipids (lower omega-3 FAs in AD), sug - gesting that the level of DHA in plasma is directly related with AD [104]. On the other hand EPA, which commonly displays 250-300 times lower level in the brain compared to DHA, appears preferably esterified to phosphatidylin - ositol (PI) [106], and plays also an important role in AD. It was shown that higher plasma levels of EPA, but not DHA, were connected with lower gray matter atrophy, suggesting that EPA might play an important role in cog - nitive decline. Higher EPA levels were also found in the right amygdale, and may be associated with depressive symptoms [107]. Within the brain, there exist glial cells comprising microglia and astrocytes. Although the role of glial cells in AD pathology is not clear, they are supposed to give support to neurons by removing amyloid peptides from the brain, and also modulate inflammation [108]. Dys - function of these cells may be related to AD develop - ment through accumulation of amyloid peptide. Since DHA can modulate glial cell activity, it was considered that dietary supplement of DHA may positively modu - late the effects of Alzheimer [109]. It has been reported that the polymerization of A monomers incubated with DHA was significantly inhibited (40%). DHA was also able to inhibit fibril formation [110]. These authors also reported that the level of DHA in the hippocampus of the A-infused AD rats was significantly lower than in con - trol, and how the subsequent DHA administration mark - edly helped to significantly increase the level of DHA. A mechanism of fighting AD is the clearance of amyloid , which has been suggested to delay or even prevent AD symptoms. A very interesting recent investigation showed that DHA and EPA mediate degradation of A by stimulating and boosting the gene expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (ide), resulting in a higher amount of IDE, the major A-degrading enzyme secreted into the extracellular space of neuronal and microglial cells [111]. Another interesting fact regarding A and its plasmatic accumulation has been recently described. The offspring of rats exposed to n-3 and n-6 PUFA enriched diets showed a significant increase in plasmatic A levels com - pared to control when their diet was n-6 PUFA-enriched, and decreased levels when a high n-3 PUFA diet was sup - plied. This accumulation is related with hyper-activation of the HPA axis, alteration of cortical monoamine con - tent, and an induced depressive- and anxiety-like state in adult offspring. Altogether these data endorse the posi - tive and protective role of an n-3 rich diet [112]. The rela - tionship between soluble A and depression in AD is still considered as a hotspot in AD investigation; in fact, the effects of soluble A accumulation and depression have been widely reported highlighting the strong relationship [113-115]. Hashimoto and collaborators have investigated the effect of DHA in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). These cells display a considerably lower content of DHA (2.15 \u00b1 0.25 mol%) compared to that found in normal neuronal cells (DHA > 10% of total FAs). The authors observed that DHA inhibits the in vitro fibrilla - tion of A2535 with a parallel inhibition of neurotoxic - ity induced by the formation of fibrils. In the presence of DHA, the degree of fibrillation significantly decreased by about 43%. However, when the A 2535 -treated SH-SY5Y cells were examined after treatment with DHA, the data indicated that the addition of DHA to the cells prevented the toxicity of A 2535 [116]. Furthermore, it has been reported that fat -1 trans - genic mice, which express more n-3 PUFAs (total n-3 PUFAs in WT: 17.51, in fat -1 mice: 23.45), are more resistant to intra cerebroventricular injection of A, which induces neuronal cell loss and impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory [117]. Similar to the results found in fat -1 mice, the clearance of interstitial A was much faster in those mice treated with fish oil, compared to untreated mice. Such a protective effect has been suggested to occur through an activation of the Page 12 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 AQP4-mediated to promote intersti - tial A clearance [118]. DHA, as a fundamental compo - nent of neuronal membranes, has been widely studied as an active compound to treat Alzheimer effects [119]. It has been shown that the novel hydroxyl-derivative of DHA (OHDHA) has a strong therapeutic potential to treat AD. It has been demonstrated that administra - tion of OHDHA increases the concentration of PUFAs-containing phospholipids (e.g. DHA or EPA-containing phospholipids). The increase in n-3 PUFAs in transgenic mouse model of AD was accompanied by a parallel reduction in amyloid- accumulation, which is strongly correlated with synaptic degeneration, and with mem - ory failure and learning deficiencies [98] (and references within). DHA asserts its protective role through its stere - oselective bioactive product Neuroprotectin disease [120]. Parkinson's disease (PD), was first medically described as a neurological syndrome by James Parkinson in 1817. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease character - ized by loss of dopaminergic neurons rigidity, bradykinesia and postural insecurity, with dementia and depression observed in the advanced stages of the dis - ease. It is known that a decline in FA concentration is observed in neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, and it could be expected that n-3 PUFAs may exert neuropro - tective action in PD, as previously shown in Alzheimer's disease. It has been described that PUFAs are known to play an important role in lowering anxiety and also improving cognitive functions in non-human primates [122]. One study investigated the effect of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) when given to mice (from 2 to 12 months of age) fed a diet high in n-3 PUFAs. It was observed that the rich n-3 PUFA diet protected against the MPTP-induced decrease in dopamine, and its metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the striatum. These data suggest that a high n-3 PUFAs dietary intake might exert neuroprotective actions in an animal model of Parkinson disease [123]. Within LC-PUFAs, DHA is the most important one for the brain; recently, in an experimental mouse model of PD the effects of the neurotoxin MPTP administrated together with DHA were evaluated. The results indi - cated that DHA has protective effects on dopaminer - gic neurons in this MPTP-induced experimental model [124]. Transgenic animal models have also been used to test the protective effect of high levels of n-3 PUFAs. Bousquet and collaborators published that the expres - sion of the fat -1 the n-6 mice increased the cortical n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio (+28%) compared to control. This modification is less effective than a dietary supplementation, since a 10-month exposure to an n-3 PUFA-enriched diet increased the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio by as much as 92%. Regarding neuroprotection in animal models of PD using MPTP , the data suggest that dietary intake of a preformed DHA supplement is more effective than the expression of the fat -1 transgene [125]. The preventing effect of DHA on dopaminergic lesion was also studied by determining the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in MPTP and MPTP + DHA treated cells [126]. There was a 65% decline in the number of TH-immunopositive neurons in the substancia nigra one week after MPTP administration and the num - ber of TH-positive neurons significantly increased in the MPTP + DHA group compared to the MPTP con - trol group. DHA may block the conversion of MPTP to MPP+ or prevents the uptake of MPP+ into dopamin - ergic terminals. This study suggested that dietary sup - plementation with DHA may be a potential means for delaying the onset of PD and/or the rate of progression [126]. One-third of PD patients suffer depression that may lead to worse health outcomes, and a decreased quality of life. Anxiety, apathy and anhedonia further complicate PD outcomes. DHA was tested as a therapy to reduce these symptoms. It was observed that 75% of PD patients treated with DHA and EPA (DHA, 800 mg/day, EPA 290 mg/day) for 6 months showed a reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, com - pared with only 25% into the placebo group. These data suggest that a combination of DHA and EPA can reduce the depressive symptoms of PD [127]. A similar study regarding depression using the Hoehn and Yahr scale did not however show a significant variation in all groups during a 3 month trial using fish oil supplements (con - taining omega-3 FAs). However, when the patients were evaluated for depression symptoms using the Montgom - ery-Asberg Scale, it was observed that after 3-month supplementation, fish oil groups, taking or not antide - pressant medication, exhibited a reduction in depression symptoms when compared to mineral oil groups [128]. It has been demonstrated that DHA stimulates the pro - duction of syntaxin 3 (STX3), a plasma membrane pro - tein that has an important role in the growth of neuritis in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons cultures. This protein is directly activated by ARA, but DHA also serves as an activator of STX3. Therefore, DHA can efficiently substitute dietary ARA in activating syntaxin 3 [129]. Regarding dietary omega-3 FAs, it has been shown that the combination of voluntary exercise potentiated the Page 13 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 effects of DHA after 12-day dietary supplementation with a resulting increase of STX3. Levels of STX3 were stimulated separately by both DHA diet (150% compared to control) and exercise (126% compared to control). It should be highlighted that the combination of DHA diet and exercise regimens showed an up-regulation of STX3 levels (186% of control) [130]. These authors have also published that DHA and exercise positively affect the levels of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B, which is important for synaptic function underlying learning and memory. Together DHA and exercise boost NR2B levels up to 169% compared to control, while DHA and exercise separately were able to elevate the levels of NR2B to 145 and 123% respectively, compared to the controls [130]. All these data suggest that exercise can influence the effect of DHA on neuron membrane function, and help to maintain synaptic and cognitive function by support - ing membrane stability. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare group of neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. The disease is progressive, in which symp - toms get worse year after year. Unfortunately, there is neither a cure nor an effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease. Membranes from motor neurons and other neurons in the CNS possess the highest amounts of PUFAs. They play an important role in the maintenance and function of the membrane by acting through a variety of molecular mechanisms [131]. A recent study in a mouse model of ALS (G93A-mutated human superoxide dismutase) has identified a relationship between neuronal loss and DHA levels. In this mouse model a significant decrease in DHA-contain - ing phosphatidylcholines (PCs), in the terminal stage of ALS was shown [132]. Using MALDI-IMS analysis, the authors observed that the mean signal intensities corre - sponding to PC (diacyl-16:0/22:6) in the anterior horn in L5 spinal cord sections of 22-week-old mice model were significantly lower than those in the age-matched control, and this lost was related with motor neuron cell death. It is known that ALS related protein oxidative damage affects FA concentrations specifically the n-3 series [133]. For example DHA levels were 30% lower in spinal cord samples from ALS patients compared to control. This data surprisingly contrasts with the significant increase (18%) observed in frontal cortex samples. TDP-43 pro - tein, a transcriptional repressor, is found as cytosolic aggregates in sporadic ALS. It is known that in ALS, TDP-43 protein pathologies are related with oxidative stress in which ERK1/2 pathway is involved [134]. It has been published that cytosolic aggregates of TDP-43 pro - tein associated with ALS produced in the spinal cord showed a lower expression of some DHA synthesizing enzymes, such as ACAA1, FADS1 and COX1. The authors analyzed the tissular concentration of these enzymes observing that in the spinal cord, the enzymes involved in FA -oxidation like ACAA1 and ACAA2, as well as those related to early steps of FA desaturation, like FADS2, were all increased in the analyzed ALS samples (ranging between 20 to 110%) [135]. A dietary intake of omega-3 is really important in ALS, as well as in Alzheimer or Parkinson. In a large analysis of a total of 995 ALS patients fed with an omega-3 PUFA enriched diet, this intake was associated with a risk reduction of 34% for ALS. Further analysis of the individ - ual omega-3 PUFAs established that intakes of ALA and marine n-3 PUFAs, were each associated with a lower ALS risk [136]. Inflammatory processes that destroy motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and cortex during ALS could be reduced by DHA administration due to its potent anti-inflammatory properties. It is known that DHA increases total glutathione levels in microglia cells, thus enhancing their antioxidative capabilities. In parallel, DHA causes a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-. Furthermore, Poly I:C, a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, has the capacity of increasing the secretion of IL-6 produced by micro - glia. Poly I:C is able to mimic a viral or bacterial infec - tion through activation of TLR pathway, which are considered the first line of defence against viral and bac - terial pathogens. Stimulation of an immortalized mouse brain cell line (EOC20 microglia) with Poly I:C causes an increase in IL-6; however, a 24 h pre-treatment with DHA resulted in a lowering of IL-6 to undetectable lev - els, indicating the inhibiting capacity of DHA of pro-inflammatory cytokines [137]. In another mouse model however, n-3 PUFAs could also act negatively, stimulating the symptoms of ALS pro - gression as well as lipid peroxidation compared to con - trol [138]. Feeding pre-symptomatic mice (G39A-SOD1) EPA (300 mg/kg/day), for 6 weeks increased lipid peroxi - dation. Higher amounts of 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, a toxic and reactive aldehydic intermediate formed by nonenzy - matic peroxidation of n-3 PUFAs, were detected in the entire gray matter of sporadic ALS [139]. The increment of 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal could result in an increased oxi - dative stress in microglia and could also be related with a decrease in microglia cell number [138]. Altogether this information indicates that n-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, are crucial for the development, main - tenance and function of the CNS and should be included in our diet. Moreover, further investigation should be carried out in order to determine the LC-PUFAs molecu - lar and physiological mechanisms participating in neuro - degenerative diseases affecting humans.Page 14 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 Diet as a tool to acquire functional lipids and to maintain health Food is part of our daily activity, and of vital importance for the maintenance of life. The relevance of omega-3 LC-PUFAs, particularly EPA and DHA, in human nutri - tion and health has been emphasized. Briefly, LC-PUFAs including ARA are the predominant components of the 75-88% of the phospholipids constituting the cell mem - brane bilayer in animals. They play a central role in almost all physiological and biochemical events within the cells, and therefore, in maintaining optimal cellular function [140, 141]. It is widely accepted that for attaining a healthy status a balanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in our diet is more essential than the absolute amounts of individual FAs. In the diet of early humans, the proportion between both groups of FAs was maintained close to 1:1. However, in present-day Western diets, characterised by a high intake of saturated fats, n-6 FAs, detrimental trans-FAs, and ele - vated consumption of sugars, this ratio has risen to 20:1 or even higher, leading to continuous daily intakes that are far away from the optimal acquisition of healthy n-3 FAs. This imbalance favours obesity and has been proven to be prothrombotic and proinflammatory [25, 142], which stimulates a myriad of inflammatory dependent ailments, such as arthritis, cancer, hypertension, diabe - tes, asthma, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer, Parkinson, aller - gies and many more [27, 28, 143]. Although mammals, including humans, possess the biochemical machinery and enzymes to fabricate LC-PUFAs from their C18 precursors, they are unable to de novo biosynthesize the essential fatty acids ALA and LA, which can only be attained through diet. Although some ALA is converted to the longer-chain omega-3 FAs, the extent of this conversion is modest. Thus, in vivo stud - ies in humans reported that ca. 5% of ALA was converted to EPA and ca. 0.5% of ALA was converted to DHA [20], indicating the low ability to produce these impor - tant FAs. Interestingly, another recent report shows that although the conversion of ALA into DHA is not very efficient (<1%), the addition of supplemental ALA, which did not significantly increase the detected amounts of DHA in plasma or erythrocytes unlike EPA that did aug - ment upon ALA feeding, appeared to be sufficient to sustain brain function. Moreover, it was determined that extremely low ALA dietary intakes are required to sig - nificantly affect brain DHA levels and function, assum - ing however, that the neurological impairments observed with ALA deficiency are caused by the decrease of DHA in brain [144]. Overall, it is widely accepted that the bio - synthetic pathway in humans does not provide sufficient levels of ALA because of being, together with LA, essen - tial FAs, to meet EPA and DHA demands and therefore, a dietary intake of preformed omega-3 LC-PUFAs is needed. Recommendations of consumption and/or supplemen - tation of these omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still require further study to be adequately established. However, most health bodies and Government agencies recommend con - suming between 250 and 1000 mg of EPA + DHA per day for adults, to maintain health and well-being [145]. Par - ticularly, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations jointly with the World Health Organi - zation (WHO), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommend a daily EPA + DHA intake of at least 250 mg. On the other hand, the lower limit for the health of a general adult population set by the UK Government is 450 mg EPA + DHA/day [47, 146, 147]. These amounts should be increased up to 1-1.5 g/day for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction or patients with hypertri - glyceridemia [145]; although the real benefit of this rec - ommendation is sometimes controversial [148]. Human milk is a source of LA, ALA, ARA, EPA, DHA and other LC-PUFAs. While the level of ARA remains relatively constant, that of DHA is more vari - able and depends on maternal diet and lifestyle. Dur - ing pregnancy, increased maternal dietary requirements of omega-3 FAs occur because of fetal accretion [149]. Enhanced maternal n-3 FA intakes during pregnancy and lactation may result in an increase in the duration of ges - tation and infant size at birth, reducing the incidence of preeclampsia and postpartum depression. In addition, some evidences from both observational studies, and interventional trials suggest that a higher n-3 LC-PUFAs supply was associated with beneficial effects on infant growth and neurodevelopment [150]. Pregnant and lac - tating women achieving an average daily dietary DHA intake of at least 150-200 mg up to about 1200 mg, pro - longed gestation, increased birth weight, and reduced the risk of preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation by 31% in all pregnancies or by 61% in high-risk pregnan - cies. No adverse effects were registered apart from some cases of belching or unpleasant taste, even at the high - est dietary levels assayed of 1.2 g/day of DHA or 2.7 g/day of total n-3 LC-PUFAs [150]. In a recent review, the relationship between reduced maternal consumption of n-3 PUFAs, and the prevalence of childhood and adoles - cence neuropsychiatric condition including autistic spec - trum disorders (ASD), attention deficit disorders (ADH), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), and depression and anxiety disorders has been highlighted [151]. In summary, a minimum daily intake of 300 mg/day of EPA + DHA, of which 200 mg/day are DHA or up to 700-1000 mg of EPA + DHA/day is highly recommended for a more favourable pregnancy and lactation [145].Page 15 of 19 Z\u00e1rate et al. Clin Trans Med (2017) 6:25 The diets of vegetarian (those avoiding all meat) and vegan (those completely avoiding animal-based products) have been associated with markedly lower levels of DHA in plasma phospholipids. In vegetarians, ALA supple - mentation was demonstrated to increase the proportion of EPA but not DHA. It would thus appear that only sup - plementation with preformed DHA reliably increases tis - sue DHA. On the other hand, although vegans had zero intake of preformed DHA, it was nevertheless present in blood phospholipids, suggesting basal conversions from ALA to DHA that may be up-regulated by the absence of\u2014and down-regulated by the presence of\u2014dietary preformed DHA [19]. In line with this, breast milk DHA cannot be increased with the addition of ALA or other DHA precursors to the diet, hence the breast milk of strict vegans contains the lowest DHA amount compared to that of fish-eaters or vegetarians [152]. Fish oil is the largest source of EPA and DHA, while eating fish constitute the major way of ingesting these functional FAs in human diets. A modest consump - tion of 2-3 servings of fish per week, particularly oily fish such as salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel or sardines, can be enough to meet most intake recommendations for healthy status (Table 1). There has been a continu - ous increase in the apparent fish consumption (kg per capita) from 9.9 kg in the 1960s to 14.4 in the 1990s, and to beyond 20.0 kg in 2015 [153]. This increase corre - lates with the concomitantly higher omega-3 FAs intake within this period. This increment is in part due to the significant growth in fisheries and aquaculture products as a whole, and to the raising awareness of the world's population to the benefits of fish consumption for human health. However, fish is a declining resource, with a dis - quieting 58.1% of all fish stocks being overfished, and more than 26% of stocks fished at biologically unsustain - able levels [153]. With capture fishery production being relatively static at around 80-90 million tonnes per year since the late 1980s, aquaculture has been proposed by the FAO as the potential complement to meet the grow - ing demand for marine based alimentation. In fact, the aquaculture contribution to the supply of fish for human consumption overtook that of wild-caught fish in 2014 for the first time [153]. At present, one of the major chal - lenges for the aquaculture industry is the environmen - tal sustainability of the activity. New sustainable and environmentally friendly ingredients for aquafeeds are needed, that do not compromise the nutritional benefits of fish consumption for humans. Fish recommendation must also be balanced with concerns about environmental pollutants. Larger fish predators may contain significant levels of methyl mer - cury, and other potentially harmful contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins that bioconcentrate in the aquatic food chain. Children and pregnant or lactating women may be at a higher risk of mercury intoxication from fish consumption and thus, it seems prudent to avoid consuming large quantities of higher fish predators. The consumption of a variety of fish species is the best approach to both minimizing mer - cury exposure and increasing omega-3 FAs intake [48]. None fish-eaters, or those who just want an extra boost, may ingest omega-3 supplements. Marine microorgan - isms are the major source for consumption and for the production of encapsulated fish oil. Fish oil is commer - cially available mainly as soft gel capsules often includ - ing added vitamins, antioxidants, and various flavours. However, capsules should be taken under medical super - vision, because taking fish oil can cause a number of gas - trointestinal disturbances, including belching, heartburn, nausea and loose stools. In addition, people under the age of 18 years, and pregnant or lactating women should not take fish oil capsules unless under the supervision of a doctor. To minimize possible adverse side effects, these supplements should be stored in the refrigerator Table 1 Amounts of total fat, EPA, DHA and EPA + DHA (g/100 g of serving) in fish species of different origin and processing Fish name Total fat EPA DHA EPA + DHA Atlantic mackerel (cooked) 17.8 herring (cooked) 11.6 salmon (farmed and cooked)7.2 (fresh or cooked) 6.3 0.363 1.141 1.504 Rainbow trout (wild and cooked) 5.8 0.988 Sword fish (cooked) halibut pollock (cooked) 1.9 0.076 various sp.

As fish oil production is currently declining, other sources of omega-3 LC-PUFAs are currently being evalu - ated. Micro and macroalgae, some of them with valu - able nutritional FA profiles, are already under industrial exploitation after optimization of culture and growth medium conditions [154]. Other promising sources of omega-3 essential FAs such as zooplankton, commonly known as \"krill\" , fungi, and genetically modified plants must overcome many challenges, such as cost, environ - mental concerns, consumer acceptance, viability and sen - sory quality prior to their consolidation [148]. Conclusions Undoubtedly lipidomics has allowed tremendous advances in understanding and determining the true importance of lipids and FAs in many physiological and molecular mechanisms implicated in the establishment of healthy or diseased status. There is compelling evidence that omega-3 LC-PUFAs, particularly EPA and DHA, and an adequate balance of omega-6/omega-3 FAs play a determinant role in most physiological and biochemical processes occurring in cells and organisms, having great significance in decreas - ing the risk of many diseases or even resolving their inherent inflammation condition. This has been broadly driven by the impressive development of technologies applied to lipidomics, and the subsequent understand - ing of the underlying molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism. Nutritional recommendations, based on epidemio - logical evidence, have been advocated by many health authorities, and agencies to reduce both, the excessive intake of omega-6 PUFAs, and the very high omega-6/omega-3 ratio of current diets. Thus, consumption of higher amounts of fish, the main source of biologically important omega-3 LC-PUFAs in combination with natural antioxidants is strongly recommended. In this sense, and although a more fine-tuning is still needed to particular groups of age and physiological status, 450-500 mg of EPA + DHA per day is suggested for general health condition of the adult population. This could be met with a weekly ingestion of 2-3 portions of oily fish. Increased amounts of up to 1 to 3-4 g/day of omega-3 LC-PUFAs should be ingested during pregnancy and lac - tation or to prevent most cardiovascular, neurodegenera - tive and proinflammatory disorders.
