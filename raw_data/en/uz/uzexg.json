In this project, we paint spiritual energy with loose strokes, continue it to form a face, and then add a protecting frame around the painting. I find this project soothing and healing. I hope it makes you pick the brushes again too! A) Where to Paint? I have made these paintings on my newest art journal which is [a black Dylusions Creative Journal](https://amzn.to/2y8YIxt). It is my third Dylusions Creative Journal, and I really like this product. It's durable, the paper is thick, and it can be closed with an elastic band. My first two Dylusions Creative Journals were [large ones](https://amzn.to/2Uip88L), but [the newest one](https://amzn.to/2y8YIxt) is a bit smaller, the page size being 8 by 8 inches.

This project can be made as a painting or as a collage where you paint the figure separately from the rest of the image. When I did this project the first time, I made a collage. I painted the profile on a paper, cut it out, and glued on the art journal page, and then continued painting the background and adjusting the facial features. In the photo below, the white line shows how I cut the face. If you choose the collage technique, it's good if the paper is not too thick. I used Bristol paper, which is fairly sturdy but thinner and easier to attach than thick watercolor papers. C) Pick the Colors that Bring Energy! I painted the second version directly on an art journal page. Both versions have a limited color palette. By picking only a few colors, they come alive and express energy more effectively than if you work with all the possible colors. So, choose the colors that energize you - that you feel drawn to at the moment. I recommend choosing three different tubes of acrylic paint and adding white to the mix as well. If none of your colors is dark, pick black or another dark color so that you get a strong image with good contrasts. For the first version, my colors were these (+ Titanium White): For the second version, my colors were these (+ some Mars Black for finishing) My acrylic paints are Golden Headybody Acrylics. D) Paint Spiritual Energy! Let's create some abstract art! Use selected colors and paint with horizontal strokes. Mix white to get lighter strokes and make muddy mixes to get tones that make the pastels shine. Enjoy the colors and making most of the narrow selection. If you paint directly on a page, mentally divide the page in half, and paint on the other side only. This way, you will have enough room for the face. E) Sketch the Face! Pick a pencil and sketch a profile. You can adjust it later by painting, so focus on the location of the face more than the actual look. I used a white pen in the photo below so that you can see my sketch clearly. F) Draw a Frame! Take a round object, for example, a plate, and draw a protective frame around the person. G) Paint the Face! Paint the skin and facial features. Instead of outlines, paint shapes. Allow yourself to be more unconventional. Don't paint bright white scleras or red lips but shapes that connect the person with the abstract part of the painting. In this project, the energy that the strokes represent is more important than the person herself. H) Paint the Background! Surround the person with everything that soothes and heals. At this point, it can be just subtle strokes that will be more defined later, when you finish the painting. Paint the frame too. Use muted colors so that the frame doesn't take the energy away from the person. I) Finishing: Give Her All the Beauty She Needs Paint details with a thin brush so that she will get all the softness and beauty she needs. Again, prevent using intense colors for the details on the background. Connect her forehead with the beauty so that she is in the middle of the energetic strokes and more delicate and soft fillings. I also added some decorations on the frame. Less Control - More Energy and Expression Art is freedom! In this project, we started with wild strokes and then built a portrait around them. These kinds of less-controlled uses of supplies are an important part of self-expression. On Thursday, March 26, 2020, I will be talking about doodling and how to expand it to various supplies and styles in my art community [Bloom and Fly](https://www.peonyandparakeet.com/bloomandfly/). The session will be recorded too. If you have bought my class this year, you are invited! I have sent an email to the members yesterday.
