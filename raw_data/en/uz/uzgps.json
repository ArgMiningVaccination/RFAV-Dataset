Because of the intensity of therapy associated with the transplant process, the pretransplant clinical status of recipients (e.g., age, presence of infections or organ dysfunction, and functional status) is associated with a risk of transplant-related mortality. The best tool to assess the impact of pretransplant comorbidities on outcomes after transplant was developed by adapting an existing comorbidity scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center systematically defined which of the CCI elements were correlated with transplant-related mortality in adult and pediatric patients. They also determined several additional comorbidities that have predictive power specific to transplant patients. Successful validation defined what is now termed the = forced expiratory volume in one second; ULN = upper limit of normal.| | a Adapted from Sorror et al.[ | |b One-or-more-vessel coronary artery or bypass graft.| |Arrhythmia: Atrial Coronary artery Requiring treatment||Prior solid tumor: Treated at any time in the patient's history, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer| |Diabetes: Requiring treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents but not diet alone||Rheumatologic: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid disease: kg/m2| |Psychiatric disturbance: Depression or anxiety requiring psychiatric consult or treatment| The predictive power of this index for both transplant-related mortality and overall survival (OS) is strong, with a hazard ratio of 3.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-6.3) for nonrelapse mortality and 2.69 (95% CI, 1.8-4.1) for survival for patients with a score of 3 or higher, compared with those who have a score of 0. Although the original studies were performed with patients receiving intense myeloablative approaches, the HCT-CI has also been shown to predict outcomes for patients receiving reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative regimens.[ Most patients assessed in the HCT-CI studies have been adults, and the comorbidities listed are skewed toward adult diseases. The relevance of this scale for pediatric and young adult recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been explored in several studies. Evidence (use of HCT-CI score in pediatrics): Most of the reported comorbidities in these studies were with respiratory or hepatic conditions and infections.[ References: Infectious Risks and Immune Recovery After Transplantation Defective immune reconstitution is a major barrier to successful HSCT, regardless of graft source.[ Factors that can significantly slow immune recovery include the following:[ Figure 1 illustrates the immune defects, contributing transplant-related factors, and types and timing of infections that occur after allogeneic transplantation.[ Figure 1. Phases of predictable immune suppression with their opportunistic infections among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. Adapted from Burik and Freifeld. This figure was published in Clinical Oncology, 3rd edition, Abeloff et al., Chapter: Infection in the severely immunocompromised patient, Pages 941-956, Copyright Elsevier (2004). Bacterial infections tend to occur in the first few weeks after transplant during the neutropenic phase, when mucosal barriers are damaged from the conditioning regimen. There is significant ongoing research into the role of prophylactic antibacterial medications during the neutropenic phase.[ Guidelines for prevention of infections after HSCT have been established by a joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.[ Prophylaxis against fungal infections is standard during the first several months after transplantation and may be considered for patients with chronic GVHD who are at high risk of fungal infection. Antifungal prophylaxis must be tailored to the patient's underlying immune status. Pneumocystis infections can occur in all patients after bone marrow transplants, and prophylaxis is mandatory.[ After HSCT, viral infections can be a major source of mortality, especially after T-cell-depleted or cord blood procedures. Types of viral infections include the following: Careful viral monitoring is essential during high-risk allogeneic procedures. Late bacterial infections can occur in patients who have central lines or patients with significant chronic GVHD. These patients are susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly pneumococcus. Despite reimmunization, these patients can sometimes develop significant infections, and continued prophylaxis is recommended until a serological response to immunizations has been documented. Occasionally, postallogeneic HSCT patients can become functionally asplenic, and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Patients should remain on infection prophylaxis (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis) until immune recovery. Time to immune recovery varies but ranges from 3 months to 9 months after autologous HSCT, and 9 months to 24 months after allogeneic HSCT without GVHD. Patients with active chronic GVHD may have persistent immunosuppression for years. Many centers monitor T-cell subset recovery after bone marrow transplants as a guide to infection risk.[ Vaccination after transplantation International transplant and infectious disease groups have developed specific guidelines for the administration of vaccines after autologous and allogeneic transplantation.[ Vaccination recommendations should be reconsidered at times of local endemic or epidemic disease outbreaks. In those settings, earlier vaccination with killed vaccines may be implemented, acknowledging limited host responses. |Autologous start regardless of GVHD status or immunosuppression)||12 mob(sooner if off immunosuppression)||14 mob(or 2 mo after dose)||24 mob| disease; IM = intramuscular; | a Adapted from Tomblyn et al.,[ | |b Times indicated are times posttransplant (day 0).| |c Use of Tdap is acceptable if DTap is not available.| |d Titers may be considered for pediatric patients and patients with GVHD who received immunizations while on immune suppression (minimum 6-8 weeks after last vaccination).| |e May start as soon as 4 months post-HSCT or sooner for patients with CD4 counts >200/mcL or at any time during an epidemic.

This syndrome has been estimated to occur in 15% to 40% of pediatric myeloablative transplantation patients.[ Risk factors for SOS/VOD include the following:[ SOS/VOD is defined clinically by the following: Life-threatening SOS/VOD generally occurs soon after transplantation and is characterized by multiorgan system failure.[ Prevention and treatment of SOS/VOD Approaches to both prevention and treatment with agents such as heparin, protein C, and antithrombin III have been studied, with mixed results.[ Another agent with demonstrated activity is defibrotide, a mixture of oligonucleotides with antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects on microvascular endothelium. Studies of defibrotide have shown the following: Defibrotide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients who have hepatic SOS/VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction after HSCT. The British Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) published evidence-guided recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Microangiopathy (TA-TMA) Although TA-TMA clinically mirrors hemolytic uremic syndrome, its causes and clinical course differ from those of other hemolytic uremic syndrome-like diseases. Studies have linked this syndrome with dysregulation of complement pathways.[ Diagnostic criteria for this syndrome have been standardized and include the following:[ Suggestive symptoms consistent with, but not necessary for, the diagnosis include a sudden worsening of renal function or neurologic symptoms. Evidence (impact of TA-TMA on HSCT outcomes): Treatment of TA-TMA Treatment for TA-TMA includes the following: Prognosis for normalization of kidney function when disease is caused by calcineurin inhibitors alone is generally poor; however, most TA-TMA that is associated with the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor and sirolimus has been reversed after sirolimus is discontinued, and in some cases, after both medications are stopped.[ Some evidence suggests a role for complement modulation (c5, eculizumab therapy) in preserving renal function; further assessment of the role of this medication in treating this complication is ongoing.[ Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS) IPS is characterized by diffuse, noninfectious lung injury that occurs from 14 to 90 days after the infusion of donor cells. Possible etiologies include direct toxic effects of conditioning regimens and occult infection leading to secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines into the alveoli.[ The incidence of this complication appears to be decreasing, possibly because of less intensive preparative regimens, better HLA matching, and better definition of occult infections through PCR testing of blood and bronchioalveolar specimens. Mortality rates of 50% to 70% have been reported;[ Diagnostic criteria include the following signs and symptoms in the absence of documented infectious organisms:[ Early assessment by bronchioalveolar lavage to rule out infection is important. Treatment of IPS The traditional therapy for IPS has been high-dose methylprednisolone and pulmonary support. Etanercept is a soluble fusion protein that joins the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha receptor to the Fc region of the immunoglobulin G1 antibody. It acts by blocking TNF-alpha signaling. The addition of etanercept to steroid therapies has shown promising short-term outcomes (extubation, improved short-term survival) in single-center studies.[ Autoimmune Cytopenias (AIC) AIC after allogeneic HSCT can be restricted to one cell lineage (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia), two cell lineages, or three cell lineages. Most data about AIC in pediatric patients after HSCT are reported from single-center experiences, with the number of cases ranging from 20 to 30, over a 10- to 20-year period.[ Treatment of AIC The most common first-line therapy for AIC has been corticosteroids.[ Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-Associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder After HSCT, EBV infection incidence increases through childhood, from approximately 40% in children aged 4 years to more than 80% in teenagers. Patients with a history of previous EBV infection are at risk of EBV reactivation when undergoing HSCT procedures that result in intense, prolonged lymphopenia (T-cell-depleted procedures, use of antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab, and, to a lesser degree, use of cord blood).[ Features of EBV reactivation can vary, from an isolated increase in EBV titers in the bloodstream as measured by PCR to an aggressive monoclonal disease with marked lymphadenopathy presenting as lymphoma (lymphoproliferative disorder). Treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder Isolated bloodstream reactivation of EBV can improve in some cases without therapy as immune function improves; however, lymphoproliferative disorder requires more aggressive therapy. Treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder has relied on decreasing immune suppression and treatment with chemotherapy agents such as cyclophosphamide. CD20-positive EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder and EBV reactivation have been shown to respond to therapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy rituximab.[ Improved understanding of the risk of EBV reactivation, early monitoring, and aggressive therapy have significantly decreased the risk of mortality from this challenging complication. Acute GVHD GVHD is the result of immunologic activation of donor lymphocytes targeting major or minor HLA disparities present in the tissues of a recipient.[ Typically, acute GVHD presents with at least one of the following three manifestations: Acute GVHD is classified by staging the severity of skin, liver, and gastrointestinal involvement and further combining the individual staging of these three areas into an overall grade that is prognostically significant (see Tables 3 and 4).[ |Stage||Skin||Liver (bilirubin)b||GI/Gut per surface area; GI = gastrointestinal.| | a Adapted from Harris et al.[ | |b There is no modification of liver staging for other causes of hyperbilirubinemia.| |c For GI staging: Theadult stool output values should be used for patients weighing >50 kg.

A study that included both adults and children used a score calculated on the basis of the levels of a combination of three biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR1], suppression of tumorigenicity 2 [ST2], and regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha [REG3-alpha]) measured at the onset of acute GVHD. Investigators were able to define patients with low (8%), intermediate (27%), and high (46%, P < .0001) risk of 6-month mortality. The biomarker score was more sensitive and specific for predicting survival than clinical staging.[ Prevention and treatment of acute GVHD Morbidity and mortality from acute GVHD can be reduced through immune suppressive medications given prophylactically or T-cell depletion of grafts, either ex vivo by actual removal of cells from a graft or in vivo with antilymphocyte antibodies (antithymocyte globulin or anti-CD52 [alemtuzumab]). Complete elimination of acute GVHD with intense T-cell depletion has generally resulted in increased relapse, more infectious morbidity, and increased EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. Because of this result, most HSCT GVHD prophylaxis attempts to balance risk by giving sufficient immune suppression to prevent severe acute GVHD but not completely remove GVHD risk. Approaches to GVHD prevention in non-T-cell-depleted grafts have included the following:[ Steroid-refractory acute GVHD When acute GVHD occurs, first-line therapy is generally methylprednisolone.[ References: Chronic GVHD is a syndrome that may involve a single organ system or several organ systems, with clinical features resembling an autoimmune disease.[ Organ Manifestations of Chronic GVHD The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is based on clinical features (at least one diagnostic clinical sign, e.g., poikiloderma) or distinctive manifestations complemented by relevant tests (e.g., dry eye with positive results of a Schirmer test).[ The tissues that are commonly involved include the skin, eyes, mouth, hair, joints, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Other tissues such as lungs, nails, muscles, urogenital system, and nervous system may also be involved. Tables 5 to 9 list organ manifestations of chronic GVHD, including a description of findings that are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Biopsies of affected sites may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.[ Common skin manifestations include alterations in pigmentation, texture, elasticity, and thickness, with papules, plaques, or follicular changes. Patient-reported symptoms include dry skin, itching, limited mobility, rash, sores, or changes in coloring or texture. Generalized scleroderma may lead to severe joint contractures and debility. Associated hair loss and nail changes are common. Other important symptoms that should be assessed include dry eyes and oral changes such as atrophy, ulcers, and lichen planus. In addition, joint stiffness along with restricted range of motion, weight loss, nausea, difficulty swallowing, and diarrhea should be noted. |Organ or Site||Diagnosticb||Distinctivec||Other Featuresd||Common (Seen With Both Acute and Chronic GVHD)| | a Reprinted fromBiology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Volume 11 (Issue 12), Alexandra H.

Children who received HLA-mismatched grafts, received PBSCs, were older than 10 years, or had platelet counts lower than 100,000/\u00b5L at diagnosis of chronic GVHD have an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality. Nonrelapse mortality was 17% at 1 year, 22% at 3 years, and 24% at 5 years after diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Many of these children required long-term immune suppression. By 3 years after diagnosis of chronic GVHD, about a third of children had died of either relapse or nonrelapse mortality, a third were off immune suppression, and a third still required some form of immune suppressive therapy.[ Older literature describes chronic GVHD as either limited or extensive. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Workshop in 2006 broadened the description of chronic GVHD to three categories to better predict long-term outcomes.[ Thus, high-risk patients include those with severe disease of any site or extensive involvement of multiple sites, especially those with the following: One study demonstrated a much higher chance of long-term GVHD-free survival and lower treatment-related mortality in children with mild and moderate chronic GVHD than in children with severe chronic GVHD. At 8 years, the probability of continued chronic GVHD in children with mild, moderate, and severe chronic GVHD was 4%, 11%, and 36%, respectively.[ Treatment of Chronic GVHD Steroids remain the cornerstone of chronic GVHD therapy; however, many approaches have been developed to minimize steroid dosing, including the use of calcineurin inhibitors.[ Other approaches, including extracorporeal photopheresis, have been evaluated and show some efficacy in some patients.[ Besides significantly affecting organ function, quality of life, and functional status, infection is the major cause of chronic GVHD-related death. Therefore, all patients with chronic GVHD receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, common encapsulated organisms, and varicella by using agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, penicillin, and acyclovir. Transplant-related complications account for 70% of the deaths in patients with chronic GVHD.[ References: The highest incidence of mortality after HSCT occurs in the first 2 years and is mostly caused by relapse. A study of late mortality (2 years posttransplant) in children with malignancies who underwent HSCT showed that approximately 20% of the 479 patients who were alive at 2 years suffered a late death. Late mortality in the allogeneic group was 15% (median follow-up, 10.0 years; range, 2.0-25.6 mainly caused by relapse (65%). A total of 26% of patients suffered a late death after autologous HSCT (median follow-up, 6.7 years; range, 2.0-22.2 years),[ Another study reviewed the causes of late mortality after second allogeneic transplantation.[ A study focused on late mortality after autologous HSCT in children showed that mortality rates remained elevated compared with those of the general population more than 10 years after the procedure, but they approached the rates of the general population at 15 years. The study also showed a decrease in late mortality in the more current treatment eras (before 1990, 35.1%; 1990-1999, 25.6%; 2000-2010, 21.8%; P = .05).[ References: Data from studies of child and adult survivors of HSCT have shown a significant impact of treatment-related exposures on survival and quality of life.[ Methodological Challenges in the Study of Late Effects After HSCT Although the main cause of death in patients who have undergone HSCT is from relapse of the primary disease, a sizeable number of these patients die from infections related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), second malignancies, or cardiac or pulmonary issues.[ Before studies aimed at decreasing the incidence and severity of these effects are initiated, it is important to understand what leads to the development of these complications: Individuals differ in their susceptibility to specific organ damage from chemotherapy or in their risk of GVHD on the basis of genetic differences in both the donor and recipient.[ Cardiovascular System Late Effects Although cardiac dysfunction has been studied extensively in non-HSCT settings, less is known about the incidence and predictors of congestive heart failure following HSCT in childhood. Potentially cardiotoxic exposures unique to HSCT include the following:[ HSCT survivors are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, partly as a result of exposure to TBI and prolonged immunosuppressive therapy after allogeneic HSCT or related to other health conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism or growth hormone deficiency).[ Rates of cardiovascular outcomes were examined among nearly 1,500 transplant survivors (surviving 2 years) who were treated in Seattle from 1985 to 2006. The survivors and a population-based comparison group were matched by age, year, and sex.[ Survivors also had an increased cumulative incidence of related conditions that increased their risk of developing more serious cardiovascular disease (i.e., hypertension, renal disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes).[ In addition, cardiac function and pre-HSCT exposures to chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been shown to significantly impact post-HSCT cardiac function. In evaluating post-HSCT patients for long-term issues, it is important to consider levels of pre-HSCT anthracycline and chest irradiation.[ For more information, see the Late Effects of the Cardiovascular System section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Neurocognitive Late Effects A preponderance of studies report normal neurodevelopment after HSCT, with no evidence of decline.[ Researchers from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have reported on the largest longitudinal cohort to date, describing remarkable stability in global cognitive function and academic achievement during 5 years of posttransplant follow-up.[ A number of studies, however, have reported some decline in cognitive function after HSCT.[ For more information, see the Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Digestive System Late Effects Gastrointestinal, biliary, and pancreatic dysfunction Most gastrointestinal late effects are related to protracted acute GVHD and chronic GVHD (see Table 10). For more information, see the Hepatobiliary section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. As GVHD is controlled and tolerance is developed, most symptoms resolve. Major hepatobiliary concerns include the consequences of viral hepatitis acquired before or during the transplant, biliary stone disease, and focal liver a Reprinted fromBiology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Volume 17 (Issue 11), Michael L.

Inflammatory conditions such as GVHD also increase gastrointestinal iron absorption. Non-HSCT conditions leading to iron overload can lead to cardiac dysfunction, endocrine disorders (e.g., pituitary insufficiency, hypothyroidism), diabetes, neurocognitive effects, and second malignancies.[ The effects of iron overload on morbidity post-HSCT have not been well studied; however, reducing iron levels after HSCT for thalassemia has been shown to improve cardiac function.[ Although data supporting iron reduction therapies (such as phlebotomy or chelation after HSCT) have not identified specific levels at which iron reduction should be performed, higher levels of ferritin and/or evidence of significant iron overload by liver biopsy or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ Endocrine System Late Effects Thyroid dysfunction Studies show that rates of thyroid dysfunction in children after myeloablative HSCT vary, with larger series reporting an average incidence of about 30%.[ Pretransplant local thyroid radiation contributes to high rates of thyroid dysfunction in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.[ Higher rates of thyroid dysfunction occur with single-drug prophylaxis than with three-drug GVHD prophylaxis.[ Growth impairment Growth impairment is generally multifactorial. Factors that play a role in failure to achieve expected adult height in young children who have undergone HSCT include the following: The incidence of growth impairment varies from 20% to 80%, depending on age, risk factors, and the definition of growth impairment used by reporting groups.[ Patients younger than 10 years at the time of HSCT are at the highest risk of growth impairment, but they also respond best to growth hormone replacement therapy. Early screening and referral of patients with signs of growth impairment to endocrinology specialists can result in significant restoration of height in younger children.[ For more information, see the Growth hormone deficiency section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Abnormal body composition and metabolic syndrome After HSCT, adult survivors have a 2.3-fold higher risk of premature cardiovascular-related death compared with the general population.[ In studies of conventionally treated leukemia survivors compared with those who underwent HSCT, transplant survivors are significantly more likely to manifest metabolic syndrome or multiple adverse cardiac risk factors, including central adiposity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.[ For more information, see the Metabolic Syndrome section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Sarcopenic obesity The association of obesity with diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in the general population is well established, but obesity as determined by body mass index (BMI) is uncommon in long-term survivors after HSCT.[ Preliminary data from 119 children and young adult survivors and 81 healthy sibling controls found that HSCT survivors had significantly lower weight but no differences in BMI or waist circumference when compared with siblings.[ Musculoskeletal System Late Effects Low bone mineral density A limited number of studies have addressed low bone mineral density after HSCT in children.[ Some studies in adults have shown improvement over time in low bone mineral density after HSCT;[ Treatment for children has generally included a multifactorial approach, with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, minimization of corticosteroid therapy, participation in weight-bearing exercise, and resolution of other endocrine problems. The role of bisphosphonate therapy in children with this condition is unclear. For more information, see the Osteoporosis and Fractures section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Osteonecrosis Reported incidence of osteonecrosis in children after HSCT has been 1% to 14%; however, these studies were retrospective and underestimated actual incidence because patients may have been asymptomatic early in the course of the disease.[ In one prospective report, risk factors by multivariate analysis included age (markedly increased in children older than 10 years; odds ratio, 7.4) and presence of osteonecrosis at the time of transplant. It is important to note that pre-HSCT factors such as corticosteroid exposure are very important in determining patient risk. In this study, 14 of 44 children who developed osteonecrosis had the disease before HSCT.[ Treatment has generally consisted of minimization of corticosteroid therapy and surgical joint replacement. Most patients are not diagnosed until they present with symptoms. In one study of 44 patients with osteonecrosis lesions in whom routine yearly MRI was performed, 4 resolved completely and 2 had resolution of one of multiply involved joints.[ For more information, see the Osteonecrosis section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Reproductive System Late Effects Pubertal development Delayed, absent, or incomplete pubertal development commonly occurs after HSCT. Two studies showed pubertal delay or failure in 16% of female children who received cyclophosphamide alone, 72% of those who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide, and 57% of those who underwent fractionated TBI. In males, incomplete pubertal development or failure was noted in 14% of those who received cyclophosphamide alone, 48% of those who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide, and 58% of those who underwent TBI.[ Fertility Women Pretransplant and transplant cyclophosphamide exposure is the best-studied agent affecting fertility. Postpubertal women younger than 30 years can tolerate up to 20 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide and have preserved ovarian function; prepubertal females can tolerate as much as 25 g/m2 to 30 g/m2. Although the additional effect added by pretransplant exposures to cyclophosphamide and other agents has not been specifically quantitated in studies, these exposures plus transplant-related chemotherapy and radiation therapy lead to ovarian failure in 65% to 84% of females undergoing myeloablative HSCT.[ Studies of pregnancy are challenging because data seldom indicate whether individuals are trying to conceive. Nonetheless, a large study of pregnancy in pediatric and adult survivors of myeloablative transplantation demonstrated conception in 32 of 708 patients (4.5%).[ Men The ability of men to produce functional sperm decreases with exposure to higher doses and specific types of chemotherapy. Most men will become azoospermic at a cyclophosphamide dose of 300 mg/kg.[ Effect of reduced-toxicity, reduced-intensity, or nonmyeloablative regimens On the basis of clear evidence of dose effect and the lowered gonadotoxicity of some reduced-toxicity chemotherapy regimens, the use of reduced-intensity, reduced-toxicity, or nonmyeloablative regimens will likely lead to a higher chance of preserved fertility after HSCT. Because use of these regimens is relatively new and mostly confined to older or sicker patients, most reports have consisted of single cases. Registry reports are beginning to describe pregnancies after these procedures.[ A second study compared serum concentrations of antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B in 121 children who survived more than 1 year following a single HSCT and received a treosulfan-based regimen (treosulfan; low-toxicity), myeloablative). Mean age at HSCT was 3.6 years; mean age at follow-up was 11.8 years. Mean length of follow-up was 9.9 years. Mean AMH standard deviation scores (SDS) were significantly higher after treosulfan (-1.047) and Flu/Mel (-1.255) than after Bu/Cy (-1.543), suggesting less ovarian reserve impairment after treosulfan and Flu/Mel than after Bu/Cy. Mean serum AMH concentration significantly with treosulfan (>1.0 g/l) than with Flu/Mel or Bu/Cy. In males, mean inhibin B SDS was significantly higher after treosulfan (-0.506) than after Flu/Mel (-2.53) or some Bu/Cy (-1.23). The authors concluded that treosulfan-based regimens may confer a more favorable outlook for gonadal reserve in both sexes than Flu/Mel or Bu/Cy regimens.[ Respiratory System Late Effects Chronic pulmonary dysfunction The following two forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction are observed after HSCT:[ The incidence of both forms of lung toxicity can range from 10% to 40%, depending on donor source, the time interval after HSCT, definition applied, and presence of chronic GVHD. In both conditions, collagen deposition and the development of fibrosis in either the interstitial space (restrictive lung disease) or the peribronchiolar space (obstructive lung disease) are believed to underlie the pathology.[ Obstructive lung disease The most common form of obstructive lung disease after allogeneic HSCT is bronchiolitis obliterans.[ Historically, the term bronchiolitis obliterans has been used to describe chronic GVHD of the lung and begins 6 to 20 months after HSCT. Pulmonary function tests show obstructive lung disease with general preservation of forced vital capacity (FVC), reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and associated decreases in the FEV1/FVC ratio with or without significant declines in the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans include the following:[ The clinical course of bronchiolitis obliterans is variable, but patients frequently develop progressive and debilitating respiratory failure despite the initiation of enhanced immunosuppression. Standard treatment for obstructive lung disease combines enhanced immunosuppression with supportive care, including antimicrobial prophylaxis, bronchodilator therapy, and supplemental oxygen, when indicated.[ Restrictive lung disease Restrictive lung disease is defined by reductions in FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), and DLCO. In contrast to obstructive lung disease, the FEV1/FVC ratio is maintained near 100%. Restrictive lung disease is common after HSCT and has been reported in 25% to 45% of patients by day 100.[ The most recognizable form of restrictive lung disease is bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), more recently called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). Clinical features include dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Radiographic findings show diffuse, peripheral, fluffy infiltrates consistent with airspace consolidation. Although reported in fewer than 10% of HSCT recipients, the development of BOOP/COP is strongly associated with previous acute and chronic GVHD.[ Patients with restrictive lung disease have limited responses to multiple agents such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and azathioprine.[ For more information, see the Respiratory complications associated with HSCT section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Urinary System Late Effects Renal disease Chronic kidney disease is frequently diagnosed after transplant. There are many clinical forms of chronic kidney disease, but the most commonly described ones include thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, acute kidney injury, and GVHD-related chronic kidney disease. Various risk factors associated with the development of chronic kidney disease have been described; however, recent studies suggest that acute and chronic GVHD may be a proximal cause of renal injury.[ In a systematic review of 9,317 adults and children from 28 cohorts who underwent HSCT, approximately 16.6% of patients (range, 3.6% to 89%) developed chronic kidney disease, defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 24.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 within the first year after transplant.[ It is important to aggressively treat hypertension in patients post-HSCT, especially in those treated with prolonged courses of calcineurin inhibitors. Whether post-HSCT patients with albuminuria and hypertension benefit from treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers requires further study, but careful control of hypertension with captopril, an ACE inhibitor, did show a benefit in a small study.[ Quality of Life Health-related quality of life (HRQL) HRQL is a multidimensional construct, incorporating a subjective appraisal of one's functioning and well-being, with reference to the impact of health issues on overall quality of life.[ Pre-HSCT factors, such as family cohesion and a child's adaptive functioning, have been shown to affect HRQL.[ A report that investigated the impact of specific HSCT complications indicated that HRQL was worse among children with severe end-organ toxicity, systemic infection, or GVHD.[ Functional outcomes Physician-reported physical performance Clinician reports of long-term disability among childhood HSCT survivors suggest that the prevalence and severity of functional loss is low, as described in the following studies: Self-reported physical performance Self-reported and proxy data among survivors of childhood HSCT indicated similar low rates of functional loss in the following studies: Other studies that have reported functional limitations include the following: Measured physical performance Objective measurements of function in the pediatric HSCT patient and survivor population hint that loss of physical capacity may be a bigger problem than revealed in studies that rely on clinician or self-report data. Studies measuring cardiopulmonary fitness have observed the following: Predictors of poor physical performance The BMTSS found associations between poor physical performance outcomes and chronic GVHD, cardiac conditions, immune suppression, or treatment for a second malignant neoplasm.[ Published Guidelines for Long-term Follow-up Several organizations have published consensus guidelines for follow-up for late effects after HSCT. The CIBMTR, along with the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplant (ASBMT), and in cooperation with five other international transplant groups, published consensus recommendations for screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors of HSCT.[ Although some pediatric-specific challenges are addressed in these guidelines, many important pediatric issues are not. Some of these issues have been partially covered by general guidelines published by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and other children's cancer groups (United Kingdom, Scotland, and Netherlands). The COG has also published more specific recommendations for late effects surveillance after HSCT.[ Although international efforts at further standardization and harmonization of pediatric-specific follow-up guidelines are under way, the PBMTC summary and guideline recommendations provide the most current outline for monitoring children for late effects after HSCT.[ References: The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.
