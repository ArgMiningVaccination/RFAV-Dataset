The effectiveness of many vaccines currently in use is due in part to adjuvants, molecules that have little immunogenicity by themselves but which help enhance and appropriately skew the immune response to an antigen. The development of new vaccines necessitates the development of new types of adjuvants to ensure an appropriate immune response. Herein, we review commonly used vaccine adjuvants and discuss promising adjuvant candidates. We also discuss various other immunomodulators(namely cytokines, Toll-like receptor agonists, and host defense peptides) that are, or have potential to be, useful for antimicrobial therapies that exert their effects by boosting host immune responses rather than targeting pathogens directly. Keywords: adjuvant; immunomodulator; vaccine; antimicrobial Immunomodulators of vaccination by Edward Jenner in the 1700s was one of the most important medical discoveries in history. T oday, vaccination remains the safest and most cost-effective medical way of pre-venting infectious diseases. Although vaccines have had tremendous successes, including the eradication of smallpox in 1979 and the substantial reductionin polio incidence, many infectious diseases remain for which effective vaccines have not yet been de- veloped, such as malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeciency virus (HIV). One major hurdle that stands in the way ofgenerating such vaccines is the need for adjuvants that can promote and sustain immune responses against antigens of interest. Herein, promising ad-vances in adjuvant development are discussed. History and background on adjuvants Adjuvants were discovered in the 1920s by a French veterinarian named Gaston Ramon. Ramon noticedthat the addition of certain substances, particularly aluminum salts, to vaccines increased their efcacy.Since then, adjuvants have become an increasinglyinvaluable component in the eld of vaccinology. The word \"adjuvant\" is derived from the Latin ad- juvare , \"to help.\" Adjuvants, although often not particularly immunogenic by themselves, serve topromote and enhance immune responses to vac- cine components, thereby lessening the required dose of said vaccine and prolonging immunologicalmemory. Vaccines containing live-attenuated or inacti- vated viruses or bacteria signal through T oll-likereceptors (TLRs) and therefore generally induce an appropriate immune response without the use of adjuvants. However, as we move more toward usingmore puried antigens that lack the immunostim- ulatory potential of a whole organism, adjuvants have become necessary to achieve an appropriateimmune response. Furthermore, commonly used vaccine adjuvants elicit primarily a humoral (antibody-mediated/T H2) response, which is inef- fective at controlling many types of infections, es-pecially those involving intracellular pathogens. Adjuvants can act at several different stages of the immune response, although they all influence doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05787.x 46 Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Adjuvants can act at multiple different stages of the immune response. Some adjuvants, such as alum, aid in antigen capture and uptake (A). They may activate APCs, often via TLR stimulation (B), as is the case with MPL. Some, such as saponins, may aid in antigen presentation to T cells (C) and can enhance costimulation (D), as can be the case for certain cytokines. Ultimately,adjuvants enhance the immune response and polarize the T H1/T H2 balance (E). MPL, monophosphoryl lipid A. antigen presentation, be it directly or indirectly (re- viewed in Ref. 1). They may aid in the recruitment to the site of immunization, antigen recognition, and activation of antigen-presenting and other ancilliarycells (APCs), particularly dendritic cells (DCs), re- sulting in the production of key cytokines, and can promote antigen presentation. 1Figure 1 illustrates stages of the immune response where adjuvants typ- ically act. Qualities of the ideal adjuvant and related challenges A great challenge in the eld of vaccinology is the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of vaccine adjuvants. Many adjuvants have been discoveredempirically, and a common function has thus been difcult to determine. For some time, the mecha- nism of action of vaccine adjuvants was somewhatof a mystery, although the discovery of TLRs and an improved understanding of innate immunity have allowed scientists to begin to elucidate how adju-vants work. Although mechanisms of action of ad- juvants are varied, there exist a number of important qualities that must be considered when designingnew adjuvants.Quality and type of immune response Different types of immune responses are required to effectively clear different types of infections. A humoral (T H2) response is effective at promoting an immune response that will neutralize bacterial toxins and help combat extracellular infections. In- tracellular infections, on the other hand, requirea cell-mediated (T H1) immune response for clear- ance, although viral infections tend to require amore balanced immune response. 2The actions of TH1 cytokines, (IL)-12 and sub- sequently interferon gamma (IFN- /H9253), oppose those of T H2 cytokines (mainly IL-4 and IL-10), resulting in the polarization toward either a cell-mediated im-mune response or a humoral response, respectively.Any vaccine must recruit and activate cells appro- priately and, ideally, elicit an appropriately balanced T H1/T H2 response. Compatibility with antigen(s) Because adjuvants often act by increasing uptakeof antigens, a physical association between adju- vants and antigens may be necessary. For exam- alum adjuvanted vaccines, antigens are ad-sorbed onto particles, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences. 47Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy Nicholls et al. interactions and exchange between phosphate and hydroxyl groups.3Clearly, this interaction depends upon the antigen used, and can be further influ- enced by factors, such as pH, buffer strength, and various in vivo factors.3In such a case, an inadequate physical association between antigen and adjuvant may cause a vaccine to fail.3 Safety Av a r i e t yo fa d j u v a n t sh a v eb e e nc r e a t e dt h a th e l pelicit a strong immune response, but most of these are far too toxic for use in humans, as it is often difcult to separate immunogenicity from reacto-genicity. For example, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), an oil-in-water emulsion containing dead mycobacteria, is a potent inducer of cell-mediatedresponses in mice but causes toxic side effects such that it cannot be used in humans. The ideal adju- vant is sufciently and appropriately immunogenic, but does not cause excessive inflammation or other immunopathologies. Stability and cost In order for vaccines to be administered to large populations, particularly those in developing coun- tries, they must be available at low cost, especiallybecause vaccines are usually administered to pre- vent prospective disease rather than being used to treat specic known diseases. It is clearly of greatimportance that potential vaccine adjuvants can be made inexpensively. The use of adjuvants can sig- nicantly reduce the amount of antigen required for an effective immune response, presumably reducing production costs, and also allows for antigen spar-ing in times when demand exceeds supply. Further- more, it is far easier (and thus more cost-effective) to administer vaccines that are stable at room temper-ature, and stability is therefore of high importance when considering an adjuvant for use in vaccines. Another factor that affects the cost of vaccinationis the enormous potential of vaccines that need a smaller number of doses to achieve protection, with the Holy Grail being single-shot vaccines that wouldnot require boosters; it is felt that adjuvants can help achieve this end. Adjuvants currently employed in human vaccines In live and killed vaccines, adjuvanticity is intrinsic, and the addition of exogenous adjuvants is not typ-ically required. However, as there is a greater trendtoward the use of recombinant and highly puried antigens, which are generally safer but more weakly immunogenic, the need for effective adjuvants hasbecome quite apparent. Currently, there exist just a handful of adjuvants that are currently employed in vaccines. Aluminum salts The usefulness of aluminum-containing adjuvants(typically aluminum phosphate or aluminum hy-droxide gels, generally referred to as alum) as ad- juvants was discovered empirically when it was ob- served that contaminants in vaccine formulations could actually enhance vaccine effectiveness. Alum has been used in a variety of human vaccines, in-cluding tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and inactivated polio, and is currently the only adjuvant approved for use in the UnitedStates. 4 Alum has several mechanisms of action (dis- cussed in Ref. 5). It was initially believed that theadjuvant activity of alum was due to its retention of immunogenic molecules at specic sites in the body, allowing for their slow release and consequently aprolonged immune response, the so-called \"depot effect.\" Alum also appears to exert its adjuvantic- ity by keeping antigens in a particulate (rather thansoluble) form, thereby enhancing phagocytosis of antigens by APCs. 6Recently, it has become evident that aluminum salts are capable of directly activat-ing immune cells. Alum can induce maturation of monocytes/macrophages into DC-like cells, and thisprocess is dependent on the activation of NOD- like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), part of the inflammasome, which causesproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 7,8The activation of NLRP3 may be direct, or alum may actindirectly by causing release of uric acid, which thenactivates NLRP3. 9 Although alum is effective for many types of vac- cines and is widely used, it elicits primarily a T H2 response (including IL-4/5 production and IgG 1and IgE production by B cells), which is ineffective forvaccination against many types of pathogens. Fur-thermore, it has been known to cause side effects, such as allergic reactions and granulomas, in cer- tain individuals. Thus, alum will continue to be useful for many vaccines, but other adjuvants will be needed for vaccines that require a more cellularresponse. 48 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences.Nicholls et al. Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy emulsions. AS03, produced by GlaxoSmith-Kline (London, UK), is used in the influenza vaccine Prepandrix R/circlecopyrt, which has demonstrated excellent ef- cacy and safety.10MF59 is made by Novartis (for- Basel, Switzerland) and is currentlyused in Fluad R/circlecopyrt, an influenza vaccine used primarily in Europe in people aged 65 and over. MF59 was alsoused in trials of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2 vac- cine but elicited transient monocyte dif- ferentiation and antigen by DCs and is capable of elicitingboth T H1- and T immune responses.12 Monophosphoryl lipid A The TLR4 agonist an outer membrane component of gram-negative bac- teria, is a potent inducer of inflammation and innateimmune responses and is an excellent immunolog- ical adjuvant, but is far too toxic for use in vaccines. Administration of LPS can lead to the onset of sys-temic inflammatory response syndrome and septic shock. Thus, substantial efforts have been made to modify LPS in such a way that it will retain im-munogenicity but limit its toxic effects mediated by inflammation. The lipid A portion of LPS is respon- sible for the endotoxicity of LPS, and modicationof the lipid A structure can thus result in an LPS-like molecule that is not very endotoxic. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is a derivative ofSalmonella Minnesota R595 LPS. MPL is made by removing a phosphate group and an acyl chain from the LPS molecule. Like LPS, MPL activates TLR4, b u ti ti so v e r1 0 0t i m e sl e s st o x i c . 13This dramatic reduction in toxicity is not merely a reduction in potency. Rather, MPL appears to trigger the Trif- dependent pathway, but its ability to signal through MyD88 is dramatically reduced, compared to LPS.14 AS04 is a combination of MPL and either alu- minum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate.15AS04 is used in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccineFENDrix R/circlecopyrtand in the human both from GlaxoSmith-Kline Biologicals. 5,15,16AS04 appears to function by activating DCs, causing the production of cytokines and increase in costimulatory molecules.17 Although caution must clearly be used when em- ploying immunostimulants, extensive analyses haverevealed no effect of AS04 vaccines onthe development of autoimmune disorders. 18In fact, MPL can be used to treat allergies, due to its ability to dampen T H2 responses.19Various other combinations and formulations of MPL have beenused in clinical trials, with promising results (re-viewed in Ref. 5). Virosomes Virosomes, a type of liposome, are a relatively newoption for vaccine adjuvants. Virosomes are empty reconstituted influenza virus envelopes, and because they contain hemaglutinin, they can bind sialic acidon DCs and macrophages, thereby enhancing anti- gen availability to, and uptake by, these cells. 5,20 InflexalR/circlecopyrt, produced by Crucell (Leiden, the Nether- lands), is an influenza virus vaccine that is approvedfor use in many countries. 21It has also been shown that inactivated HAV adsorbed to the surface of vi-rosomes (Epaxal R/circlecopyrt, also produced by Crucell) is ca- pable of inducing an immune response that is as effective as the traditional hepatitis A vaccine, but with fewer side effects.22 Other vaccine adjuvants with therapeutic potential Many types of adjuvants are currently at the preclin- ical and clinical stages of development. Several keyvaccine adjuvant candidates are discussed later, and are also listed along with currently used adjuvants in Table 1. TLR ligands The discovery of TLRs and an overall greater under-standing of innate immunity has allowed for greatprogress in the understanding and development of adjuvants. The immune system has evolved to re- act swiftly to the presence of foreign microbes andpathogens. This is accomplished by the host devel- opment of a wide array of sentry receptors, collec- tively termed as the pattern recognition receptors(PRRs), which include TLRs, NOD-like receptors, and RNA helicases such as retinoic acid inducible gene-I. Of these PRRs, the signaling mechanismsand immune functions of the TLR family are the best characterized. TLRs recognize a range of microbe- specic signature molecules, including nucleic acidsfound in bacterial and viral pathogens, as well as protein and lipid components of microbial cell walls and membranes. Activation of TLRs results in com-plex signaling cascades that rapidly trigger the onset Ann. N.Y. Acad.

In addition, the type of reaction elicited depends on the distinct TLRs activated. TLR ligands are attractive vaccine adjuvant can- didates, as they elicit a primarily T H1-type immune response.23The downside to using TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants is that they can actually work toowell and induce toxic levels of inflammation. 24How- ever, if TLR ligands can be modied in a way that maintains adjuvanticity without producing exces- sive inflammation, effective vaccine adjuvants canbe developed. For instance, as discussed earlier, MPL has shown promise as a vaccine adjuvant, particu- larly as part of AS04. Other TLR be suitable adjuvants. oligodeoxynucleotides cells through TLR9, resulting inthe production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and overall inducing a T H1 response. Studies in vari- ous animal models showed that CpG ODNs im-prove and balance immune responses when admin-istered in combination with currently used vaccine- adjuvant combinations. 25The adjuvant potential of CpGs is currently being investigated in clinical trials. TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by single-stranded RNA sequences found in many viral species as well as the small molecules imiquimod and re- siquimod, leading to the downstream induction ofantiviral responses, including type I IFN of T H1-mediated by viral dsRNA and poly- inosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic RNA that mimics viral RNA. Poly(I:C), imiquimod and resiquimod all exhibit promise as potential vac-cine adjuvants (discussed in Ref. 26). Although TLR agonists show denite promise as vaccine adjuvants, concern does persist regardingthe safety of such molecules in that they could ex- acerbate or even cause autoimmune disorders (dis- cussed in Ref. 27), and/or could exacerbate natural 50 Ann.

Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy inflammatory responses to infectious agents leading to hyperinflammation. A Phase III trial of Heplisav, an HBV vaccine containing a CpG sequence, was re-cently halted due to a study participant developing Wegener's granulomatosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the vascular system. 28 Montanides Montanides are squalene-based water-in-oil emul-sions; they are similar to incomplete Freund's ad- juvant, but are biodegradable and therefore much less toxic. 5Both ISA 51 and ISA 720 have been used in several clinical trials.29Montanide ISA 720 has been used in Phase I clinical trials for malaria vac-cines. 30-32Montanide ISA 51 was also tested for use in a malaria vaccine, but the vaccine was quite reac- togenic and the Phase I trial was halted,33although another malaria vaccine containing ISA 51 has beentested in nonhuman primates, and efforts are under way to begin clinical trials with this vaccine. 34One major drawback, however, of using Montanides for large-scale vaccination is their high manufacturing cost.5 Saponins Saponins are natural detergent-like molecules thataid in and cellular immu- nity, but are hemolytic and cytotoxic toward hu- man cells. 35,36Q u i lAi sah e t e r o g e n e o u se n r i c h m e n t of saponins from the bark of Quillaja saponaria ,a tree found in South America. Quil A has shownpromise in veterinary vaccines, but is too toxic foruse in humans. 36,37The saponin derivative QS-21 is far less toxic than Quil A, and is a good in-ducer of T H1 responses. It appears to have adju- vant activity by improving antigen presentation and promote cell-mediated immunity. GlaxoSmithKline has developed two adjuvant formulations, AS01 shown to elicit both humoral and cell- mediated immune responses, causing both high an- tibody titers and IFN- /H9253levels, whereas AS01 pro- motes H1 response.15A recent detailed review of saponins as adjuvants is provided by Sunet al. 37 Cytokines Because a major challenge when designing or choos-ing an adjuvant for a given vaccine is ensuring thatthe resulting immune response has the appropriate T H1/T H2 balance, a logical approach would be to ad- minister appropriate cytokines to skew the immune response in the desired direction. Use of cytokines as vaccine adjuvants has so far been limited. However, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF) has shown promise as a vaccine adju- vant. GM-CSF is known to activate DCs, and stud- ies have shown that the addition or preadministra- tion of GM-CSF to the HBV vaccine improves the response to this vaccine in Polyphosphazene Polyphosphazenes are water-soluble polymers. Poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy) phosphazene] (PCPP) has been shown to enhance antibody responses in mice to an influenza vaccine, while being negligibly reac- togenic. 39Similar results were observed in a Phase I trial of PCPP . CpG ODN and polyphosphazenes are a potent adjuvant combination when administered concomitantly, implying that polyphosphazene may be most useful when combined with other adju-vants. 25 Polysaccharides A promising new option is the use of adjuvants based on inulin, a storage polysaccharide found in plants. Such adjuvants can elicit as potent T H1a n dT H2i m - mune responses as CFA without the problem of se- vere toxicity, as has been demonstrated with a range of antigens and animal models.40,41Microparticu- late inulin (MPI) is a known activator of the alter- nate complement pathway and is able to promote cell-mediated immunity; MPI-based adjuvants havedemonstrated success in a variety of animal models. 42 Host defense peptides Host defense peptides (HDPs) are a large family of molecules and are an evolutionarily conservedcomponent of the immune system of many species, including insects, animals, and plants. Although HDPs are diverse in sequence and structure, theyshare certain characteristics. Generally, HDPs are short molecules, 12-50 amino acids in length, with a net positive charge, +2-9. 43Initial interest in HDPs focused on their potent activity against a widerange of microbes, ranging from bacteria to fungi in vitro . However, it is now well-known that the HDP family possesses many members with unique Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The ability of HDPs to regulate aspects of the immune system has made them potential candi-dates as vaccine adjuvants. HDPs have been shown to regulate cytokine responses, DC and lymphocyter e c r u i t m e n ta n dm a t u r a t i o n ,a sw e l la sT Hcell polar- ization, immune functions that play a major role inthe development of an adaptive immune response. Animal studies have shown that human neutrophil defensins are able to signicantly promote and en-hance adaptive, antigen-specic, immunity when used in vaccine formulations. 44,45Recent studies have investigated the effects on adaptive responses by HDPs used in combination with CpG ODNs. In- dolicidin, a responses and promoted cell-mediated compared to CpG ODN with EMULSIGEN R/circlecopyrt(MVP Labora- tories, Inc., Omaha, NB), an adjuvant frequently used in veterinary vaccines.46Similarly, bactenecin derivative innate defense regulator (IDR)-HH2, in complex with CpG ODN within a pertussis tox- oid vaccine formulation, synergistically induced the production of chemokines and signicantly en- hanced the production of toxoid-specic antibodies in mice.47This formulation demonstrated responses indicative of a balanced T H1/T H2 response. Intrigu- ingly, potent immune responses were observed evenafter a single application of adjuvanted pertussis tox-oid and animals became protected against pertus- sis infections with this formulated vaccine. These studies demonstrate that HDPs and their derivativesmay be used in vaccine formulations to promote an effective, long-lasting, and balanced protective re- sponse. Immunomodulators as anti-infective therapies The ever-present threat of infectious diseases re- quires continued development of novel therapeutics to combat microbial pathogens. Traditional antibi-otics are becoming increasingly incapable of keep- ing pace with the development of drug-resistant bacteria. A novel strategy is to manipulate hostimmune responses to combat infection. Unlike an- tibiotics, immunomodulation would enhance a pre- existing system that is designed to have broad spec-trum antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, using anantimicrobial system with multiple mechanisms of action minimizes the development of antimicro- bial responses as pathogens try to counter multiplemodes of attack against a system that has been ef- fective in keeping them at bay for millions of years. Currently, methods of regulating host immune re-sponses via immunomodulatory molecules are be- ing discovered and developed into candidate thera- peutics, some of which are listed inTable 2. Overall these investigations appear to indicate that there are substantial parallels between the molecules used asadjuvants and those that have therapeutic efcacy possibly reflecting the requirement of induction of an appropriate innate immune response. A major obstacle in the use of immunomodu- lators is the challenge of manipulating a systemicresponse to combat infections, many of which arelocalized, with minimal toxic effects to the host and maximal anti-infective efcacy. Many types of im- munomodulators, which are locally used to counterinfections, are currently in use, including the topi- cal administration of TLR agonists against dermal infections. However, systemic administration of im-munomodulatory agents may lead to systemic acti- vation or suppression of immune responses, which can lead to multiple adverse host effects. Indeed, some systemically administered immunomodula- tors in use today, including IFNs and TLR ligands,elicit unwanted inflammatory symptoms, such as fever and hypotension. On the other hand, other im- munomodulators show minimal toxic effects withgreat efcacy, such as CSFs or vaccine adjuvants. Al- though it is possible that immunomodulators can potentially cause widespread toxic effects with lowefcacy against localized targets, many factors must be considered. First, many infectious diseases re- quire systemic treatment, including bacteremia orwidespread viral infection. Otherwise local infec- tions with systemic inflammatory symptoms may require the systemic use of immunomodulators torein in immune responses. As well, immune ef- fects during infection, although extensively acti- vated, tend to effectively concentrate at the site of infection via a wide range of mechanisms, including greater recruitment of cells and immune mediators,and increased blood flow to the site of infection. In short, although modulation of the immune re- sponse can be extensive and systemic in nature, thereis a general priming of immune functions that are activated at the site of infection.

A classic ex- ample of this is the use of CSFs to bolster immunecell functions that are only used when pathogens are encountered. In essence, the use of immunomodu- lators in anti-infective therapy is situationally de-pendent on the function of the immunomodulators and the disease or disease symptoms they are being used to treat. Development of future immunomod- ulators must take these issues into account and a greater understanding of the immune system willallow for the discovery or creation of modulating agents with increased selective action against in- fection while minimizing the induction potentiallyharmful immune responses. Endogenous immunomodulators: cytokines The adaptability of immune response functions is dependent on multiple complex regulatory net-works. One such network consists of the actions of cytokines, cell-to-cell signaling mediators, which play a major role in the coordination and orches-tration of immune system functions. The cytokine family encompasses a range of peptides and proteins that have profound regulatory effects on immunity. Pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate the onset of inflammation, promoting recruitment and activa-tion of immune cells. Cytokines are also essential in the development of the adaptive response in that they determine the T H1/T H2 balance. Regulatory cytokines, such as anti-inflammatory mediators IL- 10 and tumor growth factor beta, act to regulate and limit the potentially harmful effects of immunity aswell as mediating the resolution of the immune re- sponse. The actions of cytokines regulate virtually all aspects of the immune system. Thus, they are primecandidates for the development of immunomod- ulators, which can benecially boost the immune response. Interferons IFNs are a subfamily of cytokines originally notedfor their potent antiviral properties. IFNs are also capable of potentiating a number of antimicrobial defenses during an immune response. In humans,IFNs are grouped into three distinct classes: IFN type I, II, and III. Currently, the classication and mechanisms of action of type III IFNs are not wellu n d e r s t o o d .T y p eIa n dI II F N sa r ew i d e l yu s e da santi-infective agents in a wide variety of clinical ap- plications. Type I IFN .Type I IFNs consist of a number of structurally homologous proteins including 13 IFN- /H9251subtypes, IFN- /H9252,I F N - /H9254,I F N - ,I F N - /H9260,I F N - /H9270, and IFN-/H9275 . 48Type I IFNs are produced in response to microbes by a number of cell types, includingmacrophages, DCs, and endothelial cells. 49These IFNs bind the type I IFN receptor of neighboring cells, activating members of the Janus activated ki- nase (JAK) family. This leads to the downstreamdimerization of STAT proteins and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which mediate type I IFN antiviral functions. 48The result is the inhibition of protein synthesis, production of RNA digesting enzymes, and the promotion of cellular apoptosis, all serving to inhibit viral replication.49 IFN-/H9251 and IFN-/H9252 have gained prominence as therapeutic agents against viral infections. IFN-/H9251derivatives are widely used to treat patients with infection by HBV and HCV . ConventionalIFN-/H9251 treatment results in modest improvement to disease outcomes. 50,51PEGylation, the addi- tion of polyethylene glycol chains, to IFN- /H9251im- proves its stability and signicantly improves its im-munomodulatory activity. 52As such, PEG-IFN-/H9251 is commonly used in the treatment of chronic HBVand HCV infections in combination with other an-tiviral agents, including lamivudine and ribavirin. IFN-/H9252 is used in the treatment of multiple scle- rosis (MS), due to its reduction of inflammation in the central nervous system. IFN-/H9252 also reduces thein vitro replication rate of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), a neurotropic virus that may have a role inexacerbating MS pathogenesis. 53This trend is also seen in vivo when monitoring HHV-6 replication in IFN-/H9252 -treated MS patients. Thus, it is conceivable that the improvements seen with IFN- /H9252treatment owe a large part to its antiviral properties. Type II IFN .In humans, the sole member of the type II IFN family is IFN- /H9253. The production of IFN- /H9253is limited to a small number of cell types, namely T-lymphocytes (especially helper and cytotoxic T cells), DCs, and NK cells.49IFN-/H9253 binds the type II IFN receptor, leading to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.48Differential activation by type I and II IFNs of JAK-STAT family members leads to differ-ent downstream gene transcription. Although manyISGs are regulated by both type I and II IFNs, there 54 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences.Nicholls et al. Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy exist subsets of genes distinctly regulated by each IFN class, resulting in differences in biological func- tions between the two.48Although IFN-/H9253 displays modest antiviral activity, it has signicant regula- tory effects on other aspects of immunity. IFN- /H9253 can activate macrophages and NK cells, leading to increased microbicidal activity against pathogens via enhancement of phagocytosis and ox- idative metabolism.49IFN-/H9253 also strengthens cell- mediated immunity by promoting T H1h e l p e rc e l l responses during infection. IFN-/H9253 is widely used as an anti-infective agent in patients suffering from chronic granulomatousdisease (CGD). Individuals with CGD are un-able to mount a proper oxidative burst response, specically the production of superoxide anion, in their immune cells, and thus suffer from an in-creased frequency of microbial infection. IFN- /H9253 treatment signicantly reduces the frequency of bac-terial and fungal infections in CGD patients. 54,55 However, whether the protective effects of IFN- /H9253 are due to the correction of superoxide produc-tion or through another mechanism is still poorlyunderstood. 56,57 IFN-/H9253 is also being considered as a potential antifungal. IFN-/H9253 can enhance the antifungal ca- pabilities reduced infection levels of Cryptococcus neoformans , and caused an even greater reduction when used in conjunction with antifungal agentamphotericin. 60,61A Phase II clinical trial of AIDS patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis demon-strated that IFN-/H9253 , in addition to the standard ther- apy of amphotericin and fluconazole, increased rates of clearance of C. neoformans and reduced the levels of fungal antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid. 62 Colony-stimulating factors CSFs are a group of cytokines that play an essen- tial role in the proliferation and differentiation of leukocyte effector cells from hematopoietic pre- cursors. There CSFs: granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which both cell CSFs also extensivelyregulate the antimicrobial functions of their targetcell types and are currently used as anti-infective immunomodulatory treatments. G-CSF .G-CSF is primarily produced by endothe- lial cells, monocytes/macrophages, and broblasts in response to host stressors, including micro- bial infections and physical trauma. 63G-CSF binds receptors on myeloid precursor cells in the bone marrow, resulting in cellular proliferation and dif- ferentiation into mature granulocytes.64G-CSF also enhances neutrophil phagocytic activity, the respi- ratory burst response, and the expression of surface adhesion molecules required for effective chemo- taxis.64The ability of G-CSF to generate antimi- crobial responses has led to its investigation as a potential anti-infective agent. G-CSF is commonly used to combat microbial infections in neutropenic individuals. Neutropeniacan have a variety of causes including cytotoxic chemotherapy, viral infections, immunosuppressive agents, and hereditary defects, resulting in an in-creased frequency of microbial infections. The abil- ity of G-CSF to stimulate the production of granu- locytes has been exploited to treat neutropenia withgreat success and minimal adverse effects. Treat- ment with lgrastim or lenograstim, both recom- binant forms of human G-CSF, results in increasedneutrophil counts in neutropenic individuals and a decrease in microbial infections. 65,66In addition, lgrastim has been shown to improve neutrophil an-timicrobial functions that are compromised in HIV infected individuals, including neutrophil respira-tory burst, chemotaxis, and expression of cellular adhesion molecules. 67 Efforts to develop G-CSF as treatments outside of neutropenic conditions have had mixed success.In rodent models of bacterial pneumonia, G-CSF decreased bacterial clearance and increased lung in-jury in Escherichia coli andKlebsiella pneumoniae infected animals but improved clearance and de-creased lung injury in Staphylococcus aureus infected animals. 68,69A systematic review of clinical stud- ies investigating the efcacy of recombinant G-CSFproducts as an adjunctive therapy for pneumoniashowed no signicant change in mortality rates in G-CSF-treated individuals. 70In contrast, numer- ous animal models demonstrate that G-CSF, eitheralone or in conjunction with an antibiotic, leads to improved survival and bacterial clearance inbacterial-induced sepsis models. 71,72 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences. 55Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy Nicholls et al. G-CSF is also being considered as a potential anti- fungal therapy. In numerous animal models, G-CSF exhibits protective effect against a range of fungaldiseases, including candidiasis and aspergillosis. 73,74 A Phase II clinical investigation suggests that lgras-tim, in combination with fluconazole, can decreaserecovery time when used to treat candidiasis in non- neutropenic individuals, but more clinical studies are required to determine the efcacy of G-CSF as an antifungal therapeutic. 75 GM-CSF .GM-CSF is produced by a range of cell types, including endothelial cells, broblasts,and macrophages, in response to infection or pro- inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1 and tumornecrosis factor alpha. 76Binding of GM-CSF to its receptor on myeloid precursor cells promotes theirdifferentiation into granulocytes and monocytes.Like G-CSF, GM-CSF also plays a major regulatory role in the functions of immune cells. GM-CSF is thought to prime and enhance pro-inflammatory responses of stimulated macrophages. 76Due to these abilities, GM-CSF is already used as an ad- juvant in vaccine therapy. However, the ability of GM-CSF to enhance the antibacterial and antifun- gal activity of immune cells in vitro , via priming of the oxidative and phagocytic responses, has led to its investigation as a potential anti-infective im- munomodulatory therapeutic.77 GM-CSF has been used to counts in immunosuppressed individuals, including thosesuffering from leukopenia, while decreasing the fre-quency of infectious complications. 78,79In non- neutropenic settings, GM-CSF has displayed mixedpreclinical results as a potential anti-infective ther-apy. Animal studies investigating the effects of GM- CSF on various infection models have demonstrated that GM-CSF has little effect on Listeria monocyto- genes clearance and may actually worsen infection by mycobacteria. 80,81However, numerous in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that GM-CSF, in combination with antifungal drugs, can boost im- mune protection against fungal diseases, includingcandidiasis, suggesting its an antifungal on dif- ferentiation into the monocyte/macrophage lin-eage. 76M-CSF is also a regulator of macrophage-lineage cells, modulating survival, and prolifera- tion responses. In contrast to GM-CSF, M-CSF does not augment pro-inflammatory responses inmacrophages. Rather, it promotes M2-macrophage- like responses that include the dampening of the in- flammatory response, increased phagocytic activity,and promotion of T H2 cytokines.76M-CSF po- tentiates functions, including chemo-taxis, cytokine production, superoxide production, and antimicrobial activity. 84 Clinical experience with M-CSF as an anti- infective has been limited. Animal studies haveshown that M-CSF treatment, in combination with other antifungal drugs, can lead to improved out-comes in acute Candida albicans infection and chronic candidiasis. 85,86A Phase I clinical trial in healthy individuals showed an increase in circu-lating monocytes counts in response to M-CSF treatment. 87 Exogenous immunomodulators: TLR agonists Activation of TLRs leads to the activation of NF- /H9260B, a family of transcription factors that plays an es- sential role in initiating the inflammatory response. However, certain TLRs, through subtly different sig-nal transduction pathways, can specically enhance the activity of antiviral and cell-mediated immune responses. The ne balance of TLR activation duringinfection, and their downstream signaling activity, leads to an immune response that can be tailored to combat specic types of infections. As such, articialactivation and manipulation of TLRs is currently a strategy for the robust stimulation of immune re- sponses for the purpose of anti-infective therapy. TLR4 agonists LPS has been shown to boost resistance to viral andbacterial infection in numerous animal models. Al- though the TLR4 agonist MPL is used as an adjuvant in vaccines, its efcacy as an anti-infective agent ina clinical setting is not yet known. However, nu- merous animal models demonstrate the potential for TLR4 agonists in combating infectious diseases.MPL has been shown to elicit prophylactic pro- tection against a wide range of infections, includ- ing bacteria, viruses, and parasites. 88Aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates, a distinct family of syn- thetic lipid A derivatives demonstrate protection in murine models of L. monocytogenes , influenza, and 56 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences.Nicholls et al. Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy Yersinia pestis infections when used as a prophylac- tic.88,89Preliminary trials indicate that these ago- nists are well tolerated in humans, and clinical trials are under way to determine the ability of TLR4 ag- onists to counter infection. TLR7/8 agonists Synthetic TLR7/8 agonists are used for treatment of numerous skin cancers and topical treatmentof various infectious diseases. Imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, is widely used for the treatment of geni- tal and perianal warts tion, imiquimod shows efcacy diseases caused by viruses, including molluscum contagiosum.90Similarly, topical administration of resiquimod, a TLR7/8 agonist, shows re- ducing individ- with genital HSV-2 infection.91The efcacy of these synthetic agonists against systemic viral infections is still poorly understood and clinical tri- als have yielded mixed results. The major limitation of using resiquimod or imiquimod systemically is their relatively poor safety proles. A clinical studyinvestigating the effects of orally administered im- iquimod on asymptomatic HIV-infected patients showed variable effects on viral load. 92However, patients exhibited adverse flu-like symptoms, simi- lar to those observed during IFN therapy, including fatigue, fever, vomiting, and hypotension. A PhaseII clinical trial investigating the efcacy of orally administered resiquimod in HCV-infected patients showed similar effects. However, a study demon-strated that intravenously administered isatoribine, a TLR7 agonist, is effective in reducing viral load in chronic hepatitis C patients with mild side effects. 93 TLR9 agonists TLR9 activation leads to the initiation of cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens, including the induction of of NK cells. 94As considered as anti-infective thera- peutics against a range of intracellular pathogens. Numerous animal models demonstrate the safetyand efcacy of CpG ODNs in combating a large range of intracellular bacterial and viral species (re- viewed in Ref. 94). A Phase I clinical trial demon-strated the ability of CpG ODN monotherapy to reduce viral RNA levels in HCV-infected patients. 95 However, the Phase III trial for the same indica- tion failed to demonstrate and ribavirin, signi- cantly decreased viral RNA load and increased the frequency of viral negativity in HCV-infected pa-tients compared to PEG-IFN and ribavirin treat- ment alone. 94CpG ODNs may also have potential as antiparasitic agents. Studies have demonstrated that CpG ODN treatment, prophylactically or ther- apeutically, increased host resistance infection healthy and simian immunodeciencyvirus-infected macaques. 96,97These promising re- sults underscore the agonists as antiviral and antiparasitic agents. HDPs as immunomodulators Some HDPs, such as human cathelicidin LL-37, can selectively modulate immune responses. HDPs play an essential role in the activation and progression of the immune response. They can promote chemo-taxis and induce the production of chemokines, leading to overall enhancement of leukocyte recruit- ment to the site of infection. 43HDPs also regu- late the production of a range of cytokines, leading to profound downstream effects on immunity, in- cluding the regulation of leukocyte activation, DCdifferentiation, and T Hcell polarization.43HDPs also help limit the harmful aspects of immune re-sponses. Many HDPs have been shown to suppressthe production of inflammatory mediators induced by microbes or microbial components. 43Indeed, certain HDPs have been shown to decrease mortal-ity in animal models of microbially induced sepsis. HDPs also play a role in the induction of manywound healing responses, including the promotion of angiogenesis, and the recruitment and prolif- eration of epithelial cells. 43These unique regula- tory properties of HDPs have made them promis- ing candidates as anti-infective therapeutics, which are potentially safer and more effective than classicimmunomodulators. Currently, numerous HDPs are in various stages of clinical development as direct antimicrobialagents or regulators of inflammatory or immune disorders. The use of immunomodulatory HDPs in clinical anti-infective applications is a more re-cent eld of study. Key studies involving IDRs, HDP derivatives with immunomodulatory prop- erties and minimal antimicrobial activity, have demonstrated that immunomodulation by HDPs represents a viable anti-infective strategy. In oneof the rst proof-of-principle studies, IDR-1 was Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1213 (2010) 46-61 c/circlecopyrt2010 New York Academy of Sciences. 57Adjuvants for vaccines and antimicrobial therapy Nicholls et al. shown to protect mice against infection bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. au- reus and recruitment of im- mune effector cells to the site of infection, aswell as the suppression of harmful inflammatory responses with no discernable cytotoxicity as is sometimes seen with natural HDPs. More recently, IDR-1002, a derivative of bovine bactenecin, was shown to exhibit improved protection in mice chal-lenged with S. aureus orE. coli . 99Again this pro- tection correlated ofchemokines and enhancement of leukocyte recruit- ment. T o date, a number of immunomodulatory HDP-derivatives are in the early stages of clinical de-velopment. This includes the immunomodulatory peptide IMX942, an IDR-1 derivative developed by Inimex Pharmaceuticals (Burnaby, Canada), whichis currently being developed as a potential clin- ical anti-infective against surgical site infections, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and pneumonia. In addition, the human lacto- ferricin fragment hLF1-11 possesses a range of im- munomodulatory activity, including the regulation of macrophage differentiation and potentiation of macrophage antimicrobial activity. 100Its safety has been established in Phase I clinical trials as a poten- tial anti-infective therapeutic in immunocompro- mised patients (AM-Pharma, Bunnik, the Nether-lands). Although clinical experience with regulatory peptides is still in its early stages, immunomodula- tory HDPs represent a reservoir of potential anti-infective agents. Conclusion The idea of modulating host responses for clinical benet is not new. However, it is a concept that is gaining prominence over time, in credit to itssuccesses in many applications listed above. Like any other clinical drug treatment, immunomodu- lation also comes with its set of dangers and lim-itations. Nevertheless, as an increasing number of immunomodulators are discovered and their mech- anisms of actions elucidated, we steadily gain anunderstanding of the complex network that makes up the host immune system. This understanding, coupled with the many clinical successes of exist-ing immunomodulators, will lead to the discoveryof future immunomodulatory agents that are more effective, safer, and more cost-effective, opening the doors for the development of superior vaccines andanti-infective therapeutics.
