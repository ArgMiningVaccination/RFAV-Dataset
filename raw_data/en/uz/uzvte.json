Ashes! In recent times we have seen the ashes of devastation from forest fires in the northwest and in California. Communities turned to ashes... totally turned to ashes. Gritty and dirty and a visible image of destruction. Have we felt sometimes that our lives, or the lives of others',have turned to ashes? There are some days like that, too, when we feel our time has turned to ashes. There are even sometimes when we think that our country has turned to ashes. We call them days or times when we have reached rock bottom...not a glimpse of hope. I know, it sounds terrible and it may be hard to continue reading. And this is what sometimes happens in our lives. We hesitate to continue reading that marvelous story of our lives, that marvelous novel with its mysteries and intricacies. But, what happens next? We have to draw strength from above; we pray without even knowing we are praying. Someone comes to help us, a kind presence of someone we love or of someone we just have met, a big hug. It transforms like magic. This is what the Lenten Season means to us: a YES to the possibility of transformation ...a YES response to the Lord who will teach us the transforming power of prayer as when He prays in the desert. The transforming power of asking for forgiveness; the transforming power of suffering. Walking in the way of the cross to reach the glorious transformation of Resurrection. How can I transform my life? How can I help others transform theirs? Who, in our lives, is asking for that help? It is worth taking the time to think about it. Chaplain Margarita Roque, CNHS3February 15 Truth: Lent's 20 Carat Diamond In current times, some may agree that truth is often buried in misconception and cultural rhetoric. Truth, some argue is what you decide it is for yourself within the context of your individual reality . Some philosophers state that the only road to happiness and success is through living our own defined truths. With so many living their self -defined truths, why then do so many experience life mired in anxiety, worry, and hopelessness at the very core of our existence? The period of spiritual preparation during Lent provides us opportunity to rediscover truths; veracities that promise us a solid foundation of core principles and values. As God's truths are revealed to us during the Lenten period through our commitment to deliberate self -sacrifice, alms giving and prayer, we find that previous deceptions are replaced; and a profound renewal and hopefulness is experienced. As we sacrifice comforts and fast, we are reminded that it is only God whom we can truly rely for spiritual and physical sustenance. In this truth we discern that God will always provide us our needs. In giving of alms to protect people's dignity in times of crisis, we experience the importance of giving to humanity through compassion and sympathy. In this truth we deeply realize God's willingness to give to us, as we must give to others. Dedicated prayer time allows us to hear our Father's voice; through His counsel, forgiveness and hope. In this truth we know that every prayer is heard and answered in God's time and will.

I am the Lord, Lord is my name. (Isaiah 42:6-8a) Contemplate the power of the words of Isaiah. We are charged to be a people of action and strength. We have the example of Jesus' actions and strength: resisting Satan's temptations, healing the sick, giving sight to the blind man, raising Lazarus from the dead and compassion and protection of the small, widowed and alone to give us confidence. Isaiah tells us we were formed by him and that our hand is held by God, like a child guided by a parent. We are not alone. Be brave and strong. Call upon Jesus to give you strength to honor the call of the Lord. Nancy H Klein, BSN, RN, CPN 5February 17 A Lenten Reflection Mark is the Gospel highlighted in the Revised Common Lectionary shared by many Protestant traditions. What I find so interesting about Mark's Gospel is that the last 6 chapters (or one quarter) of the Gospel is dedicated to that last week of Jesus' life. Chapter 11 starts with Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday). What many scholars believe to be the original ending to the Gospel (chapter 16 verses 1-8a), has the women, having encountered Jesus at the tomb, fleeing in terror and amazement saying nothing to anyone. Yet, in spite of this, the good news of Jesus' resurrection still spreads throughout the known world, this after surely hearing time and time again that this was the way it was going to happen. To us, Lent is an annual event. We know what happens at the end of the story. We know the tomb is empty. It happens that way every year. Yet in our lives, how often have we encountered the greatness of God and been expected to live out changed lives only to be to paralyzed to do so? We are called to continue Jesus' story to a broken world, to, as Francis of Assisi said, 'Preach the world at all times, and when necessary, use words.' In spite of humanness; in spite of our feeling that we are too small, too common, too broken; we are called to live changed lives of what happened for us that first Easter morning. Rev. Matthew Schlageter, Staff Chaplain, CNHS 6February 18 Be Still and Know The Lenten season is a time of inner reflection and sacrifice. Some people chose to spend time in meditation and prayer, coupled with fasting. Others dive deep into the New Testament scriptures, and place themselves on a spiritual journey as they remember the events leading up to Jesus' death and resurrection. No matter which course you take, remember to be still and listen for Jesus' instruction; feel the power of the Holy Spirit, and see His grace manifest in your life. It is a sensory experience. \"Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.\" Psalms 46:10 (KJV) Michele Grady, Patient Experience Liaison for Surgery, CNHS 7February 19 Lent is about transformation. The Lord says it is not the external which counts, it is the intentionality of our acts. During these days of reflection and internal search we think about the many aspects of our lives which need to be transformed. We also have to think about the transformation of the world we live in. I remember clearly that, when I was 14 I was once taken to the tenth floor of a new building on a hill close to the city I lived in. Most of the city could be seen from there. I was full of energy, and dreamt of changing the world. I thought about trying to become the mayor of the city and order all houses to be painted; that would have made my city prettier. Sometimes we think about transformation of the external and, often, we tend to think in grandiose terms. The Gospel tells us something very different. If we want to transform the world: visit the incarcerated, give water to the thirsty, cloth the naked. Visit with love, give water with love, clothe with love. Because love has the power to transform ashes into LIFE. Who are the incarcerated close to us? A neighbor? A co-worker? Our - selves, incarcerated in an ideology or way to doing things? Who is the naked? Who needs the shelter of our love and care? Who is the thirsty? The one seeking justice? How shall we stand with, and advocate for our brother or sister seeking justice? Can we do this with LOVE? Chaplain Margarita Roque, CNHS8February 20 God's Wheel GOD says to me with a kind of smile, \"Hey how would you like to be God awhile And steer the world?\" \"Okay,\" says I, \"I'll give it a try. Where do I set? How much do I get? What time is lunch? When can I quit?\" \"Gimme back that wheel,\" says GOD. \"I don't think you're quite ready YET.\" by - Shel Silverstein How many times has this thought crossed your mind? \"I'd like to \"steer the world?\" Jim Carrey's character, \"Bruce\" in the 2003 movie Bruce Almighty, thought he would take over for God. He found out quickly that the job was way too much for him to handle. Too many prayers to answer; too many problems in the world for one imperfect human being to handle. Psalm 62:6 says, \"He [God] alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.\" God is the only one who can take care of ALL of God's people. On the other hand, God also calls us to be the hands and feet of Christ - to see Christ in others; to take care of others. Not to BE God, but to follow in God's footsteps and love one another. It is saddening to think of how many people have given up on this concept because it just seems lik e TOO MUCH to accomplish. But here's a crazy idea: What if we TRUST that God will lead us in our lives? If we do that, maybe helping and loving others won't seem like such a daunting task. During this reflective Lenten season, let us take a moment to remember how much God does for us, listens to us...LOVES us. And remember while we were made in God's image, we are NOT God, but we can be thankful that God IS God. We can be thankful that God has the wheel. Amen! Rev. Sara Varnado, Homeless Services Advocate, Community Connections9February 21 If you and I are going to be faithful followers of the One who calls us into this journey of faith, we are going to have to realize a few things. To be a faithful follower means that our experience will not be what we expect it to be. We will be surprised and humbled along the way. There will be many times that we are wrong about our beliefs, about other people, ourselves, and about the Sacred One we are following. Life will not be what or how we always want it to be. We will fail. And we cannot do it without Creator's help. Do you want to be a faithful follower? Really? It's going to be a struggle. A-throw-yourself-on-the-ground-before God-kind- of-struggle. \"Please God, you know what I want, but if I can't have that, give me your will even when I don't want or understand it,\" kind of struggle. I am sorry to share this hard news with you. I am sorry to hear it myself . I wish it was easier, but it's not. The example has been set. The good news is we don't have to do it alone. Malcolm Marler, from malcolmmarler.com 10February 22 ON THE ROAD AGAIN (selections) by Walter Brueggemen, A Way Other than Our Own The defining journey of biblical faith begins in the departure of Abraham and Sarah back in the book of Genesis. They were dispatched by God to leave their safe place, to go to a new land yet to be given, to get a new name, to be blessed by God, and to be a blessing to the others around them. They went! And their family, generation after generation, has gone, And we, finally in their wake, must also travel beyond safe places to the gifted end that God intends, hopefully to be blessed and a blessing on the way. And if we ponder our destination, perhaps it is to be to the neighborhood of shalom, the neighborhood of shared resources, of inclusive politics, of random acts of hospitality and intentional acts of justice, of fearless neighborliness that is not propelled by greed or anxiety or excessive self-preoccupation. I imagine Lent for you and for me as a great departure from the antineighborliness of our [world]. And then an arrival in a new neighborhood, because it is a gift to be simple, it is a give to be free; it is a gift to come down where we ought to be. I lift up my eyes to the hills- from where will my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Psalm 121:1-2 Self-giving God, call us to walk the road of newness - a new self, a new society, a new world, one neighbor at a time. May we have traveling mercies this Lenten season. Amen.11February 23 In these days of reflection, leading up to Easter and spring, I've been thinking about beginnings, endings, and renewal. In my work, I meet people of all ages who are living with serious illnesses, and I learn from them every day. When every moment is precious, it's a gift to be able to look around you with gratitude and wonder. But it's hard to move through a day without being exposed to or engaging in angry talk about differences - there's little life and no renewal in those discussions. So, I've been searching for words to express these feelings and came across this poem from Rumi - look at love how it tangles with the one fallen in love look at spirit how it fuses with earth giving it new life why are you so busy with this or that or good or bad pay attention to how things blend why talk about all the known and the unknown see how the unknown merges into the knownwhy think separately of this life and the next when one is born from the last look at your heart and tongue one feels but deaf and dumb the other speaks in words and signs look at water and fire earth and wind enemies and friends all at once the wolf and the lamb the lion and the deer far away yet together look at the unity of this spring and winter manifested in the equinox you too must mingle my friends since the earth and the sky are mingled just for you and me be like sugarcane sweet yet silent don't get mixed up with bitter words my beloved grows right out of my own heart how much more union can there be Mowlana Jalaluddin Rumi Born September 30, 1207 Died December 17, 1273 Lynn Hardesty LCSW-C Supervisory Social Worker NIH Clinical Center 12February 24 My Pastor once told me that Jesus is the ultimate comeback route. Not being a football person, my husband painstakingly explained to me that a comeback route is a football term describing an offensive player's getting away from the defender and moving back towards the quarterback. He said that a good quarterback can get the ball into the receiver's hands without interference. I think this is a profound and inspiring description of what God did for us. He knew that Adam and Eve would sin, so he provided the ultimate comeback route, the ultimate way out of trouble for us. Have you ever watched one of those nail biting football games in which the losing team comes back in the last few minutes of the game to win the championship? Jesus did this for us. If Jesus had not been born, if he had not been willing to suffer and die for us - where would we be? The great thing about His sacrifice is that we once we receive Him as our Lord and Savior, we'll know the outcome of every upcoming game, challenge, or situation. With Jesus as our ultimate comeback route, we always win. I urge you to take this time to remember Jesus' willing sacrifice and what his sacrifice provided for us. All we have to do is accept it-and run with it. Allegra Burrell, MSN, RN, CCM Case Manager II Goldberg Center for Pediatrics, CNHS 13February 25 God is not remote form us . He is at the point of my pen, my shovel , my paint brush, my needle and my heart and my thoughts. TEILHARD DE CHARDIN Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit paleontologist who worked to understand evolution and faith. He was born May 1, 1881, and died on April 10, 1955. Between these days Teilhard fully participated in a life that included priesthood, living and working in the front lines of war , field work exploring the early origins of the human race, and adventurous travels of discovery in the backlands of China. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin also participated fully in an intellectual life through the development of his imaginative, mystical writings on the evolutionary nature of the world and the cosmos. The line quoted above is so typical of Chardin's deep spirituality. God does not leave us alone in the world to serve. In our simplest acts God is present, in our work, in our leisure, in our pleasure, in our mourning. When we think, when our ideas come together to form some whole, some new and exciting possibility, God has been a part of that process. When we question, when we notice that the usual answers are insufficient God has moved with, and within, us. When we see beyond rules and laws to become clear that justice is absent, God is a part of our perception. When we bring something good into the world - a garden, a piece of art, a soft cloth, a song, a statement of hope or wonder, God has been our hands, our voices, our spirits. Lent has always been a traditional time of giving-up, yet these words of Chardin's suggest a different discipline: taking up our awareness of the magnitude of God's presence in all we are and do. Chaplain Margarita Roque, Staff Chaplain and Rev. Kathleen Ennis-Durstine, Senior Chaplain, CNHS14February 26 The man who never lied An African folktale Once upon a time there lived a wise man by the name of Mamad. He never lied. All the people in the land, even the ones who lived twenty days away, knew about him. The king heard about Mamad and ordered his subjects to bring him to the palace. He looked at the wise man and asked: \" Mamad, is it true, that you have never lied?\" \" It's true.\" \"And you will never lie in your life?\" \" I'm sure in that.\" \"Okay, tell the truth, but be careful! The lie is cunning and it gets on your tongue easily.\" Several days passed and the king called Mamad once again. There was a big crowd: the king was about to go hunting. The king held his horse by the mane, his left foot was already on the stirrup. He ordered Mamad:\"Go to my summer palace and tell the queen I will be with her for lunch. Tell her to prepare a big feast. You will have lunch with me then.\" Mamad bowed down and went to the queen. Then the king laughed and said:\"We won't go hunting and now Mamad will lie to the queen. Tomorrow we will laugh on his behalf.\" But the wise Mamad went to the palace and said:\"Maybe you should prepare a big feast for lunch tomorrow, and maybe you shouldn't. Maybe the king will come by noon, and maybe he won't.\" \"Tell me will he come, or won't he?\" - asked the queen. \"I don't know whether he put his right foot on the stirrup, or he put his left foot on the ground after I left.\" Everybody waited for the king. He came the next day and said to the queen:\"The wise Mamad, who never lies, lied to you yesterday.\" But the queen told him about the words of Mamad. And the king realized, that the wise man never lies, and says only that which he saw with his own eyes. May we be as wise as Mamad, as cautious as he with our words, and as scrupulous as he with our loyalty.15February 27 Lenten Fasting Lent is not just about retreat, it's also about fasting. Fasting is a somewhat lost spiritual discipline in the modern era but it is an amazing tool for digging deep into ourselves. The process of fasting is more than just an act of self-discipline. It is a deeply revealing spiritual. Theologian Richard Foster wrote a book some years back called The Celebration of Discipline where he shares the practices of several mostly lost spiritual disciplines. In it, he talks about fasting in a way that has always stayed with me and informed my own attempts at fasting. He said that when we fast, there is a tendency to dismiss our feelings but that the feelings are precisely the point. If we are agitated or short tempered or sad when we've not eaten, it's not because we have not eaten. We have those feelings because the spirit of anger or sadness lives within us. Without food to cover it up, those feelings come to the surface. So, fasting provides an amazing opportunity to look our unresolved feelings and issues in the e ye and do something about them. Fasting can come in many forms though. It doesn't only have to be about food. Regardless of how we use fasting though, the outcome should reveal something of meaning to us. It should help us grow. I imagine Jesus stared down a lot of fears and doubts during this 40-day period of fasting. I imagine it was a period of great growth with the combination of fasting and isolation. There would have been nowhere to hide from any inner angst. And it is that same experience we seek when we engage lent. We want to draw nearer to our faith, cut off distractions, and focus on cultivating the lived experience of \"Christ with us.\" May our Lenten fasts be ones that bring us a true experience of being the living body of Christ! Rev. Lavender Kelley, Staff Chaplain, CNHS16February 28 Micah 6:8 \"And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.\" Such an inspiring verse\u2014I envision a very personal conversation, God was not talking only to the people of Israel but to us all. Lent provides us with a time of contemplation. We can look at a change of heart, a newness and sense of calm during the year ahead. Without a focused heart can we truly live a life with a sense of what is just? A verse that I contemplate as I walk the quiet staircase up to the unit, centering my heart for the day ahead---reaching the scared children and their anxious families, for coworkers placing their personal struggles in a box, sealed tight to help them stay focused on their team--- recognizing that it is together the work team achieves more for the patients, our skill and leadership demonstrating integrity and determination. Our caring and healing vocations provide us with the opportunity to reflect, caring for all children, the very images of God. Let our lives demonstrate justly, love in mercy, and walk our days humbly as a true reflection of God. Dianne, CNHS 17March 1 Lent Darkness Dragons lurk in desert spaces, penetrating the mind with evil claw. Serpent's teeth seek out the chinks insidiously, relentlessly, gnawing on the bone; searching out the interstices of muscle and sinew. Such is the pain of the wilderness. Alone, alone, alone, Christ sits in the waste place of abandoned pleas and questions until exhausted. Finally at last the realization comes that in the end there is only God. In the nighttime of our fears, in the present reality of abandonment, when family and friends turn and run, be present, ever-present God. Be present with those camped out in the fields of hopelessness with refugees and homeless, those who live lives of quiet desperation. Be present until the desert places blossom like the rose and hope is born again. Galloway, K. (1996). The Pattern of Our Days: Worship in the Celtic Tradition from the Iona Community. Submitted by Rev. Matthew Schlageter, Staff Chaplain, CNHS18March 2 Mark 10:28-31 Peter said to him, :We have left everything to follow you!\" \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or broth - ers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields - and with them, perse - cutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" Again, Jesus and his disciples are engaged in a discussion about what the disciples are going to get out of their discipleship. This is a recurrent theme in the Gospel of Mark. Peter seems to be saying that some reward is deserved for giving up so much to be a part of Jesus' ministry. Unlike the rich young man (in the prior verses) who would not give up his wealth to join Jesus, the disciples were willing to give up all their possessions and relationships. But Jesus says \"no.\" The Gospel itself is its own reward. Friendship, righteousness, \"things,\" - but also hardship and persecution. Can they not live in the joy that they are doing good? That God loves them? That the covenant is being remade for all eternity? Can we live this sort of discipleship? Never being sure of what tomorrow will bring except the love of God, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the promise of eternal life? Can we give of our gifts readily and joyfully until it feels good? Not needing to be recognized, but content that we are truly disciples of Christ working to bring God's kingdom of peace and justice to earth? Rev. Kathleen Ennis-Durstine, Senior Chaplain, CNHS 19March 3 Gieb mir die Hand Give Me Your Hand Rainer Maria Rilke, Book of Hours God speaks to each of us as he makes us, then walks with us silently out of the night. These are the words we dimly hear: You, sent out beyond your recall, go to the limits of your longing. Embody me. Flare up like flame and make big shadows I can move in. Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final. Don't let yourself lose me. Nearby is the country they call life. You will know it by its seriousness. Give me your hand. The Story of Jumping Mouse by Hyemeyohsts Storm Native American Lore A Story of Hope, Wisdom, Courage, and New Life Day 1 March 4 Once there was a Mouse. He was a Busy Mouse, Searching Everywhere, Touching his Whiskers to the Grass, and Looking. He was Busy as all Mice are, Busy with Mice things. But Once in a while he would Hear an odd Sound. He would Lift his Head, Squinting hard to See, his Whiskers Wiggling in the Air, and he would Wonder. One Day he Scurried up to a fellow Mouse and asked him, \"Do you Hear a Roaring in your Ears, my Brother?\" \"No, no,\" answered the Other Mouse, not Lifting his Busy Nose from the Ground. \"I Hear Nothing. I am Busy now. Talk to me Later.\" He asked Another Mouse the same Question and the Mouse Looked at him Strangely. \"Are you Foolish in your Head? What Sound?\" he asked and Slipped into a Hole in a Fallen Cottonwood Tree. The little Mouse shrugged his Whiskers and Busied himself again, determined to Forget the Whole Matter. But there was that Roaring again. It was faint, very faint, but it was there! One Day, he Decided to investigate the Sound just a little. Leaving the Other Busy Mice, he Scurried a little Way away and Listened again. There It was! He was Listening hard when suddenly, Someone said Hello. Hello little Brother,\" the Voice said, and Mouse almost Jumped right Out of his Skin. He Arched his Back and Tail and was about to Run. \"Hello,\" again said the Voice. \"It is I, Brother Raccoon.\" And sure enough, It was! \"What are you Doing Here all by yourself, little Broth - er?\" asked the Raccoon. The Mouse blushed, and put his Nose almost to the Ground. \"I Hear a Roaring in my Ears and I am Investigating it,\" he answered timidly. 2021The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 2 March 5 Little Mouse was terribly Afraid, but he was Determined to Find Out Once and for All about the Roaring. \"I can Return to my Work,\" he thought, \"after this thing is Settled, and possibly this thing may Aid me in All my Busy Examining and Collecting. And my Brothers All said it was Nothing. I will Show them. I will Ask Raccoon to Return with me and I will have Proof.\" \"All right Raccoon, my Brother,\" said Mouse. \"Lead on to the River. I will Walk with you.\" Little Mouse Walked with Raccoon. His little Heart was Pounding in his Breast. The Raccoon was Taking him upon Strange Paths and little Mouse Smelled the Scent of many things that had Gone by his Way. Many times he became so Frightened he almost Turned Back. Finally, they Came to the River! It was Huge and Breathtaking, Deep and Clear in Places, and Murky in Others. Little Mouse was unable to See Across it because it was so Great. It Roared, Sang, Cried, and Thundered on its Course. Little Mouse Saw Great and Little Pieces of the World Carried Along on its Surface. \"It is Powerful!\" little Mouse said, Fumbling for Words. It is a Great thing,\" answered the Raccoon, \"But here, let me Introduce you to a Friend.\" In a Smoother, Shallower Place was a Lily Pad, Bright and Green. Sitting upon it was a Frog, almost as Green as the Pad it sat on. The Frog's White Belly stood out Clearly. \"Hello, little Brother,\" said the Frog. \"Welcome to the River.\" \"I must Leave you Now,\" cut in Raccoon, \"but do not Fear, little Brother, for Frog will Care for you Now.\" And Raccoon Left, Looking along the River Bank for Food that he might Wash and Eat. Little Mouse Approached the Water and Looked into it. He saw a 22The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 3 March 6 \"No, answered the Frog, \"I am not Afraid. I have been Given the Gift from Birth to Live both Above and Within the River. When Winter Man Comes and Freezes this Medicine, I cannot be Seen. But all the while Thunderbird Flies, I am here. To Visit me, One must Come when the World is Green. I, my Brother, am the Keeper of the Water.\" Amazing!\" little Mouse said at last, again Fumbling for Words.\" Would you like to have some Medicine Power?\" Frog asked.\" \"Medicine Power? Me?\" If it is Possible.\" \"Then Crouch as Low as you Can, and then Jump as High as you are Able! You will have your Medicine!\" Frog said. Little Mouse did as he was Instructed. He Crouched as Low as he Could and Jumped. And when he did, his Eyes Saw the Sacred Mountains . Little Mouse could hardly Believe his Eyes. But there they were! But then he Fell back to Earth, and he Landed in the River! Little Mouse became Frightened and Scrambled back to the Bank. He was Wet and Frightened nearly to Death. \"You have Tricked me,\" little Mouse Screamed at the Frog!\" \"Wait,\" said the Frog. \"You are not Harmed. Do not let your Fear and Anger Blind you. What did you See?\" \"I,\" Mouse stammered, \"I Saw the Sacred Mountains!\" \"And you have a New Name!\" Frog said. \"It is Jumping Mouse.\" \"Thank you. Thank you,\" Jumping Mouse said, and Thanked him again. \"I want to Return to my People and Tell them of this thing that has Hap - pened to me.\" \"Go. Go then,\" Frog said. \"Return to your People. It is Easy to Find them. Keep the Sound of the Medicine River to the back of your Head. Go Opposit e to the Sound and you will Find your Brother Mice. \"23The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 4 March 7 Jumping Mouse Returned to the World of the Mice. But he Found Disappoint - ment. No One would Listen to him. And because he was Wet, and had no Way of explaining it because there had been no Rain, many of the other Mice were Afraid of him. They believed he had been Spat from the Mouth of Another Animal that had Tried to Eat him. And they all Knew that if he had not been Food for the One who Wanted him, then he must also be Poison for them. Jumping Mouse Lived again among his People, but he could not Forget his Vision of the Sacred Mountains. The Memory Burned in the Mind and Heart of Jumping Mouse, and One Day he Went to the Edge of the Place of Mice and Looked out onto the Prairie. He looked up for Eagles. The Sky was Full of many Spots, each One an Eagle. But he was Determined to Go to the Sacred Mountains. He Gathered All of his Courage and Ran just as Fast as he Could onto the Prairie. His little Heart Pounded with Excitement and Fear. He Ran until he Came to a stand of Sage. He was Resting and trying to Catch his Breath when he Saw an Old Mouse. The Patch of Sage Old Mouse Lived in was a Haven for Mice. Seeds and many things to be Busy with. \"Hello,\" said Old Mouse. \"Welcome.\" Jumping Mouse was Amazed. Such a Place and such a Mouse. \"You are Truly a great Mouse.\" Jumping Mouse said with all the Respect that he could Find. \"This is Truly a Wonderful Place. And the Eagles cannot See you here, either,\" Jumping Mouse said. \"Yes,\" said Old Mouse,\" and One can See All the Beings of the Prairie here: the Buffalo, Antelope, Rabbit, and Coyote. One can See them All from here and Know their Names.\" \"That is Marvelous,\" Jumping Mouse said. \"Can you also See the River and the Great Mountains?\" \"Yes and No,\" Old Mouse Said with Conviction. \"I Know the Great River, But I am Afraid that th e Great Mountains are only a Myth. Forget your Passion to See Them and Stay here with me. There is Everything you Want here, and it is a Good Place to Be. \"24The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 5 March 8 \"How can he Say such a thing?\" Thought Jumping Mouse. \"The Medicine of the Sacred Mountains is Nothing One can Forget.\" \"Thank you very much for the Meal you have Shared with me, Old Mouse, and also for sharing your Great Home,\" Jumping Mouse said. \"But I must Seek the Mountains.\" \"You are a Foolish Mouse to Leave, there is Danger on the Prairie! Just Look up there!\" Old Mouse said, with even more Conviction. \"See all those Spots! They are Eagles, and they will Catch you!\" It was hard for Jumping Mouse to Leave, but he Gathered his Determination and Ran hard Again. The Ground was Rough. But he Arched his Tail and Ran with All his Might. He could Feel the Shadows of the Spots upon his Back as he Ran. All those Spots! Finally he Ran into a Stand of Chokecherries. Jumping Mouse could hardly Believe his Eyes. It was Cool there and very Spacious. There was Water, Cherries, and Seeds to Eat, Grasses to Gather for Nests, Holes to be Explored and many, many Other Busy Things to do. And there were a great many things to Gather. He was Investigating his New Domain when he Heard very Heavy Breathing. He Quickly Investigated the Sound and Discovered its Source. It was a Great Mound of Hair with Black Horns. It was a Great Buffalo. Jumping Mouse could hardly Believe the Greatness of the Being he Saw Lying there before him. He was so large that Jumping Mouse could have Crawled into One of his Great Horns. \"Such a Magnificent Being,\" Thought Jumping Mouse, and he Crept Closer. \"Hello, my Brother,\" said the Buffalo. \"Thank you for Visiting me.\" \"Hello Great Being,\" said Jumping Mouse. \"Why are you Lying here?\" \"I am Sick and I am Dying\" the Buffalo said. \"And my Medicine has Told me that only the Eye of a Mouse can Heal me. But little Brother, there is no such Thing as a Mouse.\" Jumping Mouse w as Shocked. \"One of my Eyes!\" he Thought. \"One of my Tiny Eyes. \" He Scurried back into the Stand of Chokecherries. But the breathing came Harder and Slower. \"25The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 6 March 9 \"He will Die.\" Thought Jumping Mouse. \"If I do not Give him my Eye. He is too Great a Being to Let Die.\" He Went Back to where the Buffalo Lay and Spoke. \"I am a Mouse.\" he said with a Shaky Voice. \"And you, my Brother, are a Great Being. I can - not Let you Die. I have Two Eyes, so you may have One of them.\" The minute he Said it, Jumping Mouse's Eye Flew Out of his Head and the Buffalo was Made Whole. The Buffalo jumped to his Feet, Shaking Jumping Mouse's Whole World. \"Thank you, my little Brother,\" said the Buffalo. \"I Know of your Quest for the Sacred Mountains and of your Visit tot he River. You have Given me Life so that I may Give-Away to the People. I will be your Brother Forever. Run under my Belly and I will Take you right to the Foot of the Sacred Mountains, and you need not Fear the Spots. The Eagles cannot See you while you Run under Me. All they will See will be the Back of a Buffalo. I am of the Prairie and I will Fall on you if I Try to Go up the Mountains.\" Little Mouse Ran under the Buffalo, Secure and Hidden from the Spots, but with only One Eye it was Frightening. The Buffalo's Great Hooves Shook the Whole World each time he took a Step. Finally the Came to a Place and Buffalo Stopped. \"This is Where I must Leave you, little Brother,\" said the Buffalo. \"Thank you very much,\" said Jumping Mouse. \"But you Know, it was very Frightening Running under you with only One Eye. I was Constantly in Fear of your Great Earth-Shaking Hooves.\" \"Your Fear was for Nothing,\" said Buffalo, \"For my Way of Walking is the Sun Dance Way, and I Always Know where my Hooves will Fall. I now must Return to the Prairie, my Brother, You can Always Find me there.\" 26The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 7 March 10 Jumping Mouse Immediately Began to Investigate his New Surroundings. There were even more things here than in the Other Places, Busier things, and Abundance of Seeds and Other things Mice Like. In his Investigation of these things, Suddenly he Ran upon a Gray Wolf who was Sitting there doing absolutely Nothing. \"Hello, Brother Wolf,\" Jumping Mouse said. The Wolf's Ears Came Alert and his Eyes Shone. \"Wolf! Wolf! Yes, that is what I am, I am a Wolf!\" But then his mind Dimmed again and it was not long before he Sat Quietly again, completely without Memory as to who he was. Each time Jumping Mouse Reminded him who he was, he became Excited with the News, but soon would Forget again. \"Such a Great Being,\" thought Jumping Mouse, \"but he has no Memory.\" Jumping Mouse Went to the Center of his New Place and was Quiet. He Listened for a very long time to the Beating of his Heart. Then Suddenly he Made up his Mind. He Scurried back to where the Wolf Sat and he Spoke. \"Brother Wolf,\" Jumping Mouse said. .... \"Wolf! Wolf,\" said .... \"Please Brother Wolf,\" said Jumping Mouse, \"Please Listen to me. I Know what will Heal you. It is One of my Eyes. And I Want to Give it to you. You are a Greater Being than I. I am only a Mouse. Please Take it.\" When Jumping Mouse Stopped Speaking his Eye Flew out of his Head and the Wolf was made Whole. Tears Fell down the Cheeks of the Wolf, but his little Brother could not See them, for now he was Blind. \"You are a Great Brother,\" said the Wolf, \"for Now I have my memory. But Now you are blind, I am the Guide into the Sacred Mountains, I will Take you there. There is a Great Medicine Lake there. The most Beautiful Lake in the World. All the World is reflected there. The People, the Lodg es of the People, and all the Beings of the Prairies and Skies. \"27The Story of Jumping Mouse Day 8 March 11 \"Please Take me there,\" Jumping Mouse said. The Wolf Guided him through the Pines to the Medicine Lake. Jumping Mouse Drank the Water from the Lake. The Wolf Described the Beauty to him. I must Leave you here,\" said Wolf, \"For I must Return so that I may Guide Oth - ers, but I will Remain with you as long as you Like.\" Thank you, my Brother,\" said Jumping Mouse. \"But although I am Frightened to be Alone, I Know you must Go so that you may Show Others the Way to this Place.\" Jumping Mouse Sat there Trembling in Fear. It was no use Running, for he was Blind, but he Knew an Eagle would Find him Here. He Felt a Shadow on his Back and Heard the Sound that Eagles Make. He Braced himself for the Shock. And the Eagle Hit! Jumping Mouse went to Sleep. Then he Woke Up. The surprise of being Alive was Great, but Now he could See! Everything was Blurry, but the Colors were beautiful. \"I can See! I can See!\" said Jumping Mouse over again and again. A Blurry Shape Came toward Jumping Mouse. Jumping Mouse Squinted hard but the Shape Remained a Blur. \"Hello, Brother,\" a Voice said. \"Do you Want some Medicine?\" Medicine for me?\" asked Jumping Mouse. \"Yes! Yes!\" \"Then Crouch down as Low as you Can,\" the Voice said, \"and Jump as High as you Can.\" Jumping Mouse did as he was Instructed. He Crouched as Low as he Could and Jumped! The Wind Caught him and Carried him Higher.\" \"Do not be Afraid,\" the Voice called to him. \"Hang on to the Wind and Trust!\" Jumping Mouse did. He Closed his Eyes and Hung on to the Wind and it Car - ried Higher and Higher. Jumping Mouse Opened his Eyes and they were Clear, and the Higher he Went the Clearer they Became. Jumping Mouse Saw his Old Friend upon a Lily Pad on the Beautiful Medicine Lake. It was the Frog. \"You have a New Name,\" Called the Frog. You are Eagle\" (The END, or Perhaps a new Beginning) {The capitalizations are direct from the original script}28March 12 God of sea and sky, God of earth and wind, your bow of colors in the heavens is the sign of the everlasting covenant between you and all creation. You have promised to care for all your creatures, that never again will you destroy the earth for the sins of humankind. And yet we hear daily of flood and earthquake, storm and disaster, famine and disease. Your creatures cry out to you in distress: we cry out with all who are in pain and beg you for mercy. We pray for release for all who are captive to misery and sorrow; for all who fear and all who grieve; for all who hunger and thirst; for all who live with rage and violence. As we bring our prayers for ourselves and for others whether aloud or in the silence of our hearts, remember your promise, Holy One, and save this broken world. -Calling on God by Peter Bankson & Deborah Sokolove Submitted by Lauren Michelle Stevens, Chaplain Resident29March 13 Matthew 8:1-3 The Man With Leprosy When he came down from the moutainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\" Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" I have often wondered at this passage. It's a story of healing. it's a story of faith. This man suffered from a disease which made him \"unclean.\" And it was an obvious disease, spread over his skin for all to see. Being unclean meant that he was deprived of his home, his family , and his faith community. He could not enter the temple. He could not reach out to touch another humanbeing because the risk of infection was high. And others were forbidden to touch him. Even to be in his presence was dangerous. To come into contact with the unclean meant becoming unclean one' s self. While there were rituals to purify the person who was not afflicted, there was a social stigma that remained, and the fear that the \"healthy\" person was not truly healthy. There were times when those who came into contact with lepers (a word that was used for a large number of skin diseases) were forced to remove themselves from the community and live apart in the colony with the lepers. The healing here, for me, comes in Jesus' willingness to see, to hear, and to reach out to this man who was outcast and reviled. Frankly, it matters little me whether the man's leprosy was healed or not. His spirit was healed. Jesus said to him, \"I see you.\" \"God sees you\" \"You are whole.\" I wonder who I might encounter this season who needs to be seen? Whose spirit needs healing as much, or more, than their disease? Will I reach out? Rev. Kathleen Ennis-Durstine, Senior Chaplain, CNHS Picture by Ann Lukesh 30March 14 As Winter Trees As winter trees stretch out bare arms to a dark sky, we stretch out in the darkness to find the touch of love. as snowdrops turn their gentle faces to the sun, we long to find in that warmth the promise of peace. as the fire breaks the shell of the seed, so may our pain break the shell of isolation that protects us from ourselves. in the security of darkness, the warmth of sunshine, the promise of fire, may be blossom anew in the miracle of your saving love, O God.

O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love.

Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ on my right, Christ on my left, Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ when I arise, Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me, Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me, Christ in every eye that sees me, Christ in every ear that hears me. St. Patrick34March 18 Jesus Turns His Face Toward Jerusalem When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. Luke 9:51 Jackson was 2 years , playful and happy. He loved looking out of the hospital windows because he could see trains, planes, and cars on two different interstates. His parents, by contrast, were nearly despondent. They knew he was at risk for developing Leukemia and had lived in fear of it for years. \"This\", his mother extolled, \"is our worst nightmare. What are we going to do?\" They were overwhelmed and inconsolable. One week after my initial visit, I saw Jackson's parents again. I was surprised to find them in a very different place. They were bright and outgoing, even chipper. They welcomed me into their room and talked about how very good their son was coping with treatment, about the games they'd been playing with him, and about all of the new peo - ple they had met. I was totally surprised. I had expected to continue to work with them to help them find their courage and their strength. When I gathered my thoughts, I asked them, \"What happened? You guys seem like different people.\" Their response was matter of fact. \"We just decided that we really didn't have a choice. This is a disease our son has and we can be miserable or we can turn and face it. Since we made the decision to face it with him, we've been amazed by how well he's doing. If a two year old can do this, we're not going to let him do it alone!\" I left amazed and wondering, \"What things do I live in dread of? What might I need to turn and face?\" Perhaps this season ... this time of Lent, is the time to turn and face those things. My hope? That I, like Jackson's parents, will find that I have the cour - age I never imagined once I discover I am not alone facing the journey ahead. Rev. Paul Byrd, Staff Chaplain, Children's of Alabama35March 19 The Three Trees: A Folktale for Lent Once upon a time, three little trees stood in a forest high on a mountain, dreaming of what they would be when they were grown. The first little tree looked up at the stars twinkling like diamonds in the night sky. \"I want to hold treasure,\" it said. \"I want to be filled with gold and decorated with jewels. I will be the most beautiful treasure chest in the world!\" The second little tree looked down the mountainside at the ocean far below. \"I want to be a strong sailing ship,\" it said. \"I want to travel mighty waters and carry powerful kings. I will be the strongest ship in the world!\" The third little tree said, \"I don't want to leave this mountaintop at all. I want to grow so tall that when people stop to look at me their eyes will raise up to heaven, and they will think of God. I will be the tallest tree in the world!\" Years passed, and the trees grew. And then one day, three woodcutters climbed the mountain. One woodcutter looked at the first tree and said, \"This tree is beautiful! It is perfect for me.\" With a dozen swoops of his axe, the first tree fell. \"Now I shall be made into a beautiful treasure chest,\" thought the first tree. \"I shall hold marvelous treasures!\" Another woodcutter looked at the second tree and said, \"This tree is strong! It is perfect for me.\" With a dozen swoops of his axe, the second tree fell. \"Now I shall sail mighty waters,\" thought the second tree. \"I shall be made into a strong ship fit for powerful kings!\" The third tree felt its heart sink as the last woodcutter approached. It stood straight and tall and pointed bravely towards heaven. But the last woodcutter never even looked up. \"Any kind of tree will do for me,\" he muttered. With a dozen swoops of his axe, the third tree fell. (continued)36March 20 The Three Trees The first tree rejoiced when the woodcutter took it to a carpenter's shop. But the carpenter was not thinking about treasure chests. Instead, he cut and carved the tree into a simple feedbox. The once-beautiful tree was not filled with gold or decorated with jewels. It was covered with dust, and filled with hay for hungry farm animals. The second tree rejoiced when the wookcutter took it to a shipyard. But the shipbuilder was not thinking about mighty sailing ships. Instead, he hammered and sawed the tree into a simple fishing boat. The once-strong tree was too weak to sail the ocean. It was taken to a little lake, where every day it carried loads of dead, smelly fish. The third tree was confused when the woodcutter took it to a lumberyard, where it was cut into strong beams and then left alone. \"What happened?\" the once-tall tree wondered. \"All I ever wanted to do was stay on the mountaintop, grow tall, and make people think of God.\" Years passed, and the three trees nearly forgot their dreams. 37March 21 The Three Trees But then one still and silent night, golden starlight poured over the first tree, as a young woman placed a newborn baby into the feedbox. \"I wish I could make a cradle for him,\" her husband whispered. The mother squeezed his hand and smiled as the starlight shone on the clean and shining wood. \"This manger is beautiful,\" she said. And suddenly the first tree knew it was holding the greatest treasure in the world. And then one humid and cloudy day, a tired traveller and his friends crowded into the small fishing boat. The traveler fell asleep as the second tree sailed quietly out into the lake. But a thundering storm arose, and the second tree shuddered, knowing that it did not have the strength to carry so many passengers safely through the fierce wind and rain. The tired traveler awoke. He stood up, stretched out his hand, and said with a strong voice, \"Peace, be still.\" The storm stopped as quickly as it had began. And suddenly the second tree knew it was carrying the King of heaven and earth. 38March 22 The Three Trees And then one terrible Friday morning, the third tree was star - tled as its beams were yanked from the old lumberyard. It flinched as it was carried through an angry, jeering, spitting crowd. It shuddered when soldiers nailed a man's hands and feet to her. It groaned as the man cried out in agony and died. It felt ugly and harsh and cruel. But at dawn the next Sunday, on the first Easter morning, the earth trembled with joy beneath the third tree, and it knew that God's love had changed everything. It had made the first little tree a beautiful treasure chest. It had made the second little tree a strong sailing ship. And every time people looked upon the third little tree, they would think of God. That was even better than being the tallest tree in the world.39March 23 True Refuge Psalm 91:1-6 You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, will say to the LORD, \"My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.\" For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence; he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day, or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, or the destruction that wastes at noonday. Lent is so much more than retreating to the wilderness waiting for God to reveal something new to us. It is a time of examining ourselves, our beliefs, and our actions as people of faith. And we do this with the hope that we emerge from Lent into the glory of Easter with greater clarity , direction, and assurance about who and whose we are. Yet all that is so much easier said than done because we still experience the pestilence and terrors of the night that the Psalmist did just in different forms. So what does it mean to take refuge in God? It certainly doesn't mean that we will never experience suffering. But it does mean that we are never alone in our suffering. And though the brokenness of the world still ravages many, there is a kind of ultimate safe harbor in God. This Lent I'm seeking ways claim that refuge even in the midst of the pain and suffering. I'm seeking to recognize when others are in need of refuge and being a safe harbor for them. I'm seeking to shed the distractions that prevent me from seeing the need and being part of God's answer. May this Lent be one where we become more attune to recognizing, experiencing, and embodying refuge. Rev. Lavender Kelley, Staff Chaplain, CNHSMarch 24 Great is Thy Faithfulness If you are reading this, thank God for His faithfulness. He protected you during your slumber and gave you new life to see the dawning of a new day. God is the guiding force that protects us and provides for us. The ultimate gift was giving us His darling son, Jesus Christ, who is the living sacrifice without blemish and without sin. What a gift! Jesus' death and resurrection are the greatest testaments of God's love. Let's show Him our faithfulness for . . . \"all I have needed, Thy hand hath provided. Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!\" \"O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name; for Thou hast done wonderful things; Thy counsels of are faithfulness and truth.\" I saiah 25:1 (KJV) Hosanna As our Lord entered into Jerusalem to fulfill the prophesy that the Son of God would be accused, beaten judged, and bear the sins of the world on the cross . . . the people glorified and praised Him. They waived palms and shouted, \"Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that commeth in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\" Matthew 21:9 (KJV). Little did they know that this scene would play out in our lives for over 2000 years. We continue to remember Jesus' agony and His love for us. We all have our own crosses to bear during our periods of hardship and pain. Nevertheless, we can look to Jesus for deliverance because as the hymn writer said, \"Jesus paid it all. All to Him I owe, my sin had left this crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.\" Michele Grady, Patient Experience Liaison for Surgery, CNHS 40 41March 25 Mark 11:7-10 Palm Sunday When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the read, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, \"Hosanna!\" \"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!\" \"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!\" \"Hosanna in the highest!\" But how quickly they forget! These people who shouted hosannas and wel - comed Jesus were impressed with him because of his humility, his teaching, the hope he instilled for a world of justice and equality, brought about by the consideration people showed for one another. But they were also a people with a history of exile, of occupation and oppression. They longed for the age of messias - a return to the sovereignty of the lineage of David. Even though Jesus would not claim kingship, a worldly kingship at any rate, the y hoped. But he disappointed. He would not use power and might to overthrow the R omans - he submitted! He permitted himself to be arrested! He did nothing to stop them from killing him! It was in the aftermath of his death that the disciples, the apostles, and then the Christian Church lifted up his sacrifice as his redeeming quality. At the time - he offended the people who wanted him to be, well - who the y wanted him to be. I know that I still sometimes try to squeeze Jesus into the image of who and what I want him to be. I love him - as long as he fulfills what I hope for . But when difficulties of life press in, I want him to be someone else - do something powerful. But - truly, in order for any Christian life to have meaning, we need to let Jesus be who he is. Understanding that can be the work of a lifetime. Rev. Kathleen Ennis-Durstine, Senior Chaplain, CNHS 42March 26 Earth teach me stillness as the grasses are stilled with light. Earth teach me suffering as old stones suffer with memory. Earth teach me humility as blossoms are humble with beginning. Earth teach me caring as the mother who secures her young. Earth team me courage as the tree which stands all alone. Earth teach me limitation as the ant which crawls on the ground. Earth teach me freedom as the eagle which soars in the sky. Earth teach me resignation as the leaves which die in the fall. Earth teach me regeneration as the seed which rises in the spring. Earth teach me to forget myself as melted snow forgets its life. Earth teach me to remember kindness as dry fields weep with rain. Ute Prayer from: Earth Prayers From Around the World, edited by Elizabeth Roberts and Elias Amidon43March 27 Imagine following Jesus into the desert. Imagine watching him, wondering why he seemed so tormented, seeing him pray with undivided attention. Imagine trying to imitate him. Feeling exhausted, frightened, insecure. Looking for strength and courage. Facing temptations. Perhaps at the end of the watch, yours and his, he might turn to you and say: \"We've had a lot to think about out here, haven't we?\" Jesus smiled. \"Let's head back. We know what we need to do now.\" As we walked together, he talked about his own temptations. And he invited me to talk about mine. When we reached my house, he thanked me. He thanked me! \"I know you'll accompany me again,\" he said. \"Not into the desert, but into your busy life of service. This is love, my friend.\" excerpted from: Following Jesus Into the Desert at https://www.ignatianspirituality. com/25389/following-jesus-into-the-desert 44March 28 THE DRAMA OF LENT (Selections) Walter Brueggeman, in: A Way Other Than Our Own The core truth of our faith is this: the God of the gospel brings life out of death. We can line out the move from death to life physically, historically, literally, metaphorically, symbolically. . .any way you want. But the truth is a rock-bottom acknowledgment that God can probe into our deepestnegations and create new possibility, new space for life, new energy for obedience, new waves of joy. It is this God of the gospel who took primordial chaos in hand, who said, \"Let there be light\" and formed a dry, ordered, fruitful land. And since that first moment, this God has been taking our dismal modes of chaos and forming them into launching pads for new life. That is life out of death! It is this God of the gospel who came to that barren, hopeless couple Abraham and Sarah, in their old age, and gave them a child, an heir, and opened a future for them. And since then, the God of the gospel has been giving people futures when they thought there was no possibility for newness. That is life out of death! This is the drama of Lent, is it not? It is the journey of relinquishment of old visions of reality that are failed and being surprised by new life given in glad, inconvenient obedience. It is to this move that the God of the gospel invites us, again and again. This God is ready to give new life, more ready, as we say, to give than we are to receive. You are the God who makes a way when there is no way. Free us from our anxious intransigence and our impoverished imaginations. Open us to your newness, the gospel gift given over and over and over again. Amen45Maundy Thursday March 29 Mark 14:17-19 When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me - one who is eating with me.\" They were saddened, and one by one they said to he, \"Surely not I? \" This phrase is read in countless services around the globe; it echo es and reechoes in many hearts. It is the one scripture that, without exception, brings me to tears. \"Is if I, Lord?\" Each disciple was so fearful of being the one who would betray Jesus. What frightened them so? All but Judas had to know that they had not made a plan to become betrayers. But they worried. And, I believe, each one, in his own heart, knew that in some way he had, indeed, betrayed Jesus. And that is why when the passage is read, I always repeat to myself, \"Is it I, Lord?\" For I KNOW that it is! I have betrayed Jesus by being angry for the wrong reasons. I have betrayed Jesus by running from responsibility and from fearing to confront evil where I have encountered it. I have betrayed Jesus when I have turned my back on others. I have betrayed Jesus when I have denied his Gospel edicts to protect my security and comfort. But, when I repeat that phrase, I also know that I am forgiven and loved. That my betrayals are known, even expected. And, that my willingness to have my heart broken again by this question, means that I can still be His disciple. Rev. Kathleen Ennis-Durstine, Senior Chaplain, CNHS 46Good Friday March 30 Cross-carrying Jesus Cross-carrying Jesus, As you stagger on your lonely journey time slips worlds reel.

Submitted by: Matthew Schlageter, Staff Chaplain, CNHS47Holy Saturday March 31 \"The Lord is my Shepherd\" Psalm 23 is not a \"typical\" Lenten scripture, but it is one that comes to mind for me during this season of waiting and reflection - verse four especially, \"Even though I walk through the dark - est valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff - they comfort me.\" (NRSV) When I endure difficult times, I wonder, \"Why God?\" I don't like pain - any kind. Painful times remind me of what the Psalmist says in verse four - walking through dark valleys. Those valleys are forbidding. The darkness surrounds me and I cannot find my way. When will the light come? When will I find my way out? And when I am in the middle of the pain, it is hard to even think about when it will end. It is easier to sit and be absorbed by it. When I lived in Nashville, TN, I used to speak to a homeless man named Larry about walking through the dark valleys in life. He would always remind me of the other part of that verse - that God is still with us, regardless of how dark it is. God will always lead us through to the light. On Holy Saturday we may feel like the darkness has surrounded us and will be forever consuming us, but we can have hope. We know Sunday is coming - a second chance at new life! We sit and wait on Holy Saturday - just like the early followers of Christ did - and they didn't have the luxury of knowing what we know now! We wait in the valley and, though it is painful, we can rejoice that God is still with us - even in the darkness. The light is coming. God HAS overcome the darkness and WILL again! Rev. Sara Varnado, Homeless Services Advocate, Community ConnectionsEASTER EVE March 31 Messiah: The Trumpet Shall Sound NO. 48 AIR (Bass) The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 4849Easter April 1 ALLELUIA! Based on the Hebrew word, hallelu yah, meaning \"Praise the Lord,\" alleluia has been a word of great praise to God in the life of the church and was prominent in early Christian liturgies since at least the fifth century CE. Because of the penitential character of the season of Lent in the Western church, singing or saying the word \"alleluia\" has historically been suspended during Lent's forty days. On Easter morning it rises again to our lips: \"Alleluia! Christ the Lord is risen! Alleluia!\" Words have great power to shape reality. During Lent, it is not that we are omitting recognition of God and God's worthiness to be praised, but we are keeping the focus on ourselves - so to speak. On our words of \"I'm sorry,\" and of \"Forgive me.\" On our words of \"Open my eyes and open my heart.\" On the words which we use to identify and describe one another. Leaving alleluia out of our liturgies reminds us that we should not, perhaps, move too rapidly to praising God for our redemption until we understand how and why we need that redemption. A once-for-all sacrifice does not absolve us from examining our behaviors and attitudes to see how they align or misalign with Christ. But when we have done that work, alleluia! is the appropriate acclamation. God, you have seen us, you have helped us see ourselves, you have set the task of atonement before us, you have delivered to us your mercy. Hallelujah! Halleluhah! And He shall reign for ever and ever. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Rev.
