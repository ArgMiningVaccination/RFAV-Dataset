Situated at the end of each strand of the DNA, they are similar to a cap that protect our chromosomes. As we age, our telomeres length gets shorter which causes our cells to age and to stop functionning properly. The link between telomeres and cellular aging is known for nearly 40 years and thousands of studies have been conducted and published about this topic. Dedicated to provide thoroughly science-backed solutions, an independent lifescience study was conducted on the [CLP Holistic Complex](https://stage.cliniquelaprairie-hh.com/holistic-health-complex/), which is at the core of each categories of the HH supplements. The results have shown that HH supplements have a proven protective role on telomere shortening and therefore, on healthy aging.
