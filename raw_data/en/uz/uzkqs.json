Many people have doubted in the past that a selection of 35 scientific papers, even if they would be of excellent quality, would attract a large audience over the years. There is one man in particular who never doubted that this would happen. Back in 1987, and even some years before that, this man, like Martin Luther King, had a dream. He had a dream of a Society for Vascular Surgery that would allow the presentation of top quality papers, in the mirror image of the American SVS/ISCVS meetings, but also competitive to these meetings in the sense that our researchers in Europe would be proud to present their work at a European Forum, instead of bringing it to our American colleagues, with all due respect for the quality of their meetings. These top quality papers should, according to his dream, be published in an European Journal of equally high quality. Mr. President, members, you may have guessed already that this man with a dream is no-one else than Prof. Roger Greenhaigh. He has been without any doubt the driving force behind the creation and the success of both the European Society for Vascular Surgery and the European Journal of Vascular Surgery. For 6 years he has been the Chairman of the Editorial Board, and as such an Officer of the Society. This has not been an easy task, and he has had to work very hard for it. And because of his high sense of quality he made other people work very hard too, according to the same standards. The difference with Martin Luther King is that Roger's dream came true, and we, members of the Society, are both the witnesses and the judges of that reality. It is not easy to express our feelings of thankfulness for all the things Roger has done for our Society. One of the easy ways would have been to nominate him for President of the Society, in recognition of his work. However, he has made it quite clear to the Council of the ESVS that he did not want to become a next President of our Society. Not out of false modesty, but because he genuinely wanted to make it quite clear to everybody, both within and outside our Society, that he did not create this Society with the side-purpose of becoming President at some time. We simply have to respect his feelings in this regard. However, the Council of the ESVS unanimously wants to recommend to the members that Prof. Roger Greenhalgh will become the first European \"Honorary Member\" of his European Society for Vascular Surgery. - Eropean Society for Vascular Surgery award in recognition for founding the Society, 2002 - Honorary Citizen of Kranidi Greece, 2006 LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS - Lifetime Achievement Award Arizona Heart Institute. 2011 - Lifetime Achievement Award Miami Heart Institute. 2012 - Lifetime Achievement Award Society for Vascular Surgery, June 2018 -citation by Enrico Ascher The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) has introduced a new award, the International Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognises \"outstanding contribution to vascular surgery\" and global acclaim. Enrico Ascher (NYU Langone Health, New York, USA), who describes it as \"the Nobel Prize of vascular surgery\", presented the award to Roger Greenhalgh (London, UK) at the SVS Vascular Annual Meeting (VAM; 20-23 June, Boston, USA). Ascher\u2014who is a former vice president, president-elect and president of the SVS\u2014tells Vascular News, \"I think this is probably the most prestigious award [in vascular surgery] that exists nowadays, because of the process\u2014not because the SVS is sponsoring it, but because actually all the societies are involved.\" The selection process is drastically different to the long-standing general SVS Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognises one member of its society each year. Instead, the society's International Research Committee accepted nominations for the award from \"every major and regional society, as well as government agencies\" worldwide, with strict eligibility requirements. Following the externally-led nomination process, the SVS committee chose its top candidates to be considered by the society's Executive Board, which selects the final recipient of the award. \"The nomination process is not easy,\" Ascher said at the Vascular Annual Meeting, highlighting the \"severe\" eligibility requirements for receiving the award and the scale of the international selection process. \"One vascular surgeon not only meets all the expectations, but indeed surpasses them,\" Ascher noted before presenting Greenhalgh as the recipient. Accepting the award, Greenhalgh highlighted the many American vascular surgeons and pioneers of the field that shaped his career and his life. Greenhalgh described how he learned and benefitted greatly from mentors such as Michael DeBakey, John Bergen, James Yao and many others. \"I was privileged to learn from the masters, and tried to reproduce the SVS,\" ultimately leading to creating the Charing Cross Symposium\u2014now 40 years running. In founding the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS), Greenhalgh further stated, \"All I did was listen to DeBakey and Jesse Thompson, and copy the SVS.\" The inspiration from across the Atlantic can be seen in the details of Greenhalgh's legacy, from the name of the leading European society and journal he helped establish: a society for vascular surgery and a journal of vascular surgery. In his parting contribution as chairman of the board for the European Journal of Vascular Surgery, Greenhalgh said, \"I persuaded them with a narrow vote to become the journal of vascular and endovascular surgery; that is the one difference.\" \"We are proud of this award and we are lucky that we were able to get Professor Greenhalgh,\" Ascher told Vascular News. \"To me, he has been something close to one of my idols, in every aspect possible. He is not only a leader in vascular surgery, he is a moral leader, which makes him unique. \"He leads by example. Not only by his contributions, or his political influence, or his knowledge, or trials, but actually as a person. As a person who is totally committed to his profession, to his family, to his friends, to his peers. He thinks first about them, and not about himself. That is what makes him a moral leader, and what sets him apart.\" Greenhalgh is also set to receive an honorary fellowship of the American College of Surgeons later this year.

Makaroun, MD, FACS Prof. Roger Greenhalgh is a vascular surgeon from London, U.K. He is recognized internationally for his major contributions to education, training, and research in vascular surgery. He is emeritus professor of surgery at the Imperial College in London and head of its Vascular Surgery Research Group. Professor Greenhalgh was educated at Cambridge University and at St. Thomas Hospital in London. He spent a year in the U.S. in Boston, MA, and Denver, CO. He has served as department head, and later as dean, of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, London. He played critical roles in the formation and governance of the European Board of Surgery, and the European Board of Vascular Surgery, as well as the European Society for Vascular Surgery and the Journal of Vascular Surgery. He championed the new pathway for vascular surgery training in the U.K. and started the Charing Cross Symposium, one of the best-attended vascular symposia in the world, which this year celebrated its 40th anniversary. He has received 30 international honorary memberships, prizes, and awards, and, most recently, an International Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Vascular Surgery. He has published more than 400 manuscripts and books. Professor Greenhalgh's most significant contributions were in promoting level one evidence in vascular surgery practice. He led more than a dozen trials, many of these in prospective randomized studies, in the field of aneurysm management. The U.K. Small Aneurysm Trial, EVAR [endovascular aneurysm repair]1, EVAR2, and IMPROVE Patient with Rupture: Open Versus Endovascular repair] have shaped our understanding of the natural history and treatment options for aortic aneurysms and form the basis of many societal practice guidelines. Professor Greenhalgh is a distinguished surgeon, educator, scientist, friend, and colleague. He has been the mentor and inspiration for a whole generation of vascular leaders in Europe and richly deserves honorary fellowship in our American College of Surgeons. The U.S. vascular community extends its congratulations to Dr. Greenhalgh, his wife Karin, and his children, Stephen and Christina, for this singular honor. memberships - Honorary Member, Vascular Surgical Society of South Africa. 1989 - Member, Hellenic Surgical Society. 1991 - Honorary Member, The Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery. 1991 - Honorary Member, Polish Surgical Society. 1991 - Honorary Member, Mediterranean League of Angiology and Vascular Surgery. 1991 - Honorary Member, Vascular Surgical Society of Germany. 1992 - Honorary Member, Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery. 1993 - Honorary Member, European Society for Vascular Surgery. 1993 - Member, Council Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. 1993 - 2008 - Honorary Member, Hellenic Vascular Surgical Society. 1995 - Member, Mediterranean League of Vascular Surgeons. 1996 - Member of MRC College of Experts, Medical Research Council. 2002- - Honorary Member, Vascular Surgical Society of Austria. 2002 - Honorary Member, Society of Clinical Vascular Surgeons, Orlando, USA. 2011 PUBLICATIONS Professor Greenhalgh has long focussed upon on the causation and optimal management of aneurysmal arterial disease. After early publications on basic causation, he led the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT) which findings were confirmed by 3 additional trials, ADAM, CAESAR and PIVOTAL with similar protocols all suggesting that 5.5cm is the threshold for intervention for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Population screening became feasible based upon these data and the MASS trial. The next need was to determine the place of endovascular repair and he became Principal Investigator of the two Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) trials, the first in the world and the largest so far. He has also dedicated 41 years of research to the effect of tobacco smoke and advancement in the knowledge and treatment of arterial disease. Professor Greenhalgh worked actively as chief investigator in the Mild to Moderate Intermittent Claudication (MIMIC) trial and Vein Graft Surveillance (VGST) trials as well as other research projects on aortic imaging. His work on a 20-year programme of aortic research was an example of global \"impact\" of research in the Imperial College Research Assessment Framework submission 2014-2020. The statistical analyses of this programme were based at Cambridge University. Both Imperial College and Cambridge University are ranked in the top 10 Universities in the world. Professor Greenhalgh's book \"Born to be a surgeon\" compiles an autobiographical view of what has driven him to continue his urge to see advance in patient management. At a recent oration by a co-worker it was questioned whether he had brought about even more value from his writings than his technical management of many NHS but also Nobel prize winners, Heads of State and Prime Ministers all operated upon by him and expert team at Charing Cross Hospital now part of Imperial College.

His series of annual books began then also. The symposium's main objective is to discuss Controversial topics within the vascular and endovascular fields, Challenge the evidence and reach Consensus among participants. The symposium started in 1978 and over the years has become one of the top 4 global vascular meetings in the world, 2 being driven by endovascular surgeons and 2 by interventional cardiologists. The Charing Cross International Symposium was held at Imperial College until 2012, always in April, during the Easter College recess. Since 2013, due to its record numbers of attendance exceeding 4000, it is held at Olympia Grand in the west of London, UK. At its 40th meeting of \"looking forward\", it nevertheless celebrates the convening of the European Society for Vascular Surgery at CX on 6th May 1997 after a huge initiative from within the then Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Attendance at CX was from 86 different countries in 2017.
