With this focus on energy levels and vitality, it's no wonder that the organs associated with Winter are the kidneys and bladder. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the kidneys are particularly important. They act like a rechargeable battery for Qi, or energy, in the body. This vital energy is held in reserve so that it may be used in times of stress and illness. While a balance of activity is necessary all year round, Winter is the powering down season, for rest rebuilds qi. The kidneys play an even deeper role in our physical, mental and spiritual health. Take a moment to dig in and get familiar with some of the kidneys' other functions, as well as tips. Store Essence (Jing) Known as \"The Root of Life\" in TCM, the kidneys store Essence, both our power source and genetic inheritance. This is an extraordinary function that is nuanced and rich, and we could spend years studying only this aspect of the kidneys. Essence or jing, is our qi life force in concentrated form. This vital and precious substance is inherited from our parents. Jing defines our basic constitution and is connected to our growth and maturation. While the gradual depletion of jing is expected, outside forces such as illness, trauma, injury, fear and frustration can lead to weakened Essence. It is for this reason that we are placing so much focus on rest and replenishment this season. Practical Application: When we know our constitutional weaknesses and strengths, we are better able to boost and harness our jing with diet and lifestyle choices. At your next visit, talk to your acupuncturist about specific recommendations tailored to your individual needs. Growth, Maturation The Kidneys are also responsible for the production of marrow, which in Chinese Medicine consists of bones, bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. Therefore, a person's growth, maturation, and aging process is governed by the kidneys. During early childhood, kidney essence is plentiful so that we can do things like grow hair, teeth, and bones at a rapid pace. Conversely, these same events reverse as we age when Essence is less plentiful. When the kidneys are healthy, hair is strong and lustrous. Kidney deficiency can lead to dry, brittle hair, or hair loss (think of hypothyroidism in Western Medicine). Hot Tip: Black sesame seeds strengthen the kidneys and are also recognized by Western nutritionists as a food that functions to balance hormones, specifically to boost progesterone production. Cognition Due to the kidney's connection to the brain, when Kidney Essence is strong, so is memory, concentration, thinking, intelligence, skill, and sight. Plant Medicine: Used for thousands of years in TCM, Lion's Mane Mushroom has been shown to increase brain function and focus. It is currently being studied as a recovery tool for both dementia and Alzheimer's in the West. Add a bit of tincture to coffee for a lasting brain boost! Foundation of Yin & Yang Yin and Yang - complementary, but opposing forces. When these energies are harmonized, there is health. When imbalanced, illness occurs. All organs have the opportunity to find yin and yang balance, which yields a specific result. However, Kidney jing is the foundation of yin and yang for all the body's organs. Therefore, kidney balance is particularly important. Yin is nourishing, still, cool, calm, downward, slow. When Kidney Yin is deficient, one may experience heat, restlessness, night sweats, disrupted sleep. Yang is activating, energetic, hot, dry, upward, fast. When Kidney Yang is deficient, one may experience fatigue, cold feet, edema, lack of willpower or motivation Kidney Tonic: Goji berries are traditionally used in Chinese medicine to strengthen Jing. They are considered a longevity tonic that supports vitality and relieves fatigue. Goji berries are also used to balance Yin and Yang, relieving night sweats and mild dizziness that can occur when Kidney Yin is deficient. Grasp Qi While the lungs control respiration, the kidneys assist by allowing the air to penetrate deeply into the body. We call this completion of a breath cycle \"grasping Qi.\" Try Box Breathing: Close your eyes and breath in through your nose for 4 counts, observing your lungs fill with air. Gently hold that breath for 4 counts, then slowly exhale through your mouth for 4 counts. Hold at the bottom for 4 counts. Repeat until blissed out. You can also breathe along to this short animation. Store Will Power (Zhi) Zhi, the spirit of the Water element, is housed in the kidneys. It is known as one's Will power, ambition, purpose, and destiny. Zhi is a force that allows a person to move along their destined path without much conscious thought or effort. And, it's thought to be the innate power of life itself - life that wants to live, strives to stay alive and survive. A potent energy for the harsh winter months. There are two aspects of the Will (zhi): The Yang Will: This is a person's Fire, the force that moves one forward on their path. The Yang Will shows itself in decisive actions, commitments, and taking responsibility for one's life experience. The Yang Will drives how you show up in the world and create your reality. The Yin Will: This is one's destiny, the deep mystery unfolding in every person's unique life. The Yin will is inevitable, gently nudging us forward without effort, so that we can recognize our fate in life (and death). If our Yin Will is strong, we hold the virtue of Wisdom as we embrace the unknown with complete trust. When Yin Will is weak, we feel the emotion of Fear, because we are unable to trust the unknown, resisting the unfolding of our own destiny. When both aspects of the Will are harmonized, we have fulfilling lives as we meet our destiny, while harnessing the power of the Yang Will, moving through life without Fear. Rest is KEY: Remember that the adrenals are found on the kidneys. The ancients knew that \"overworking damages the kidneys,\" which could show up today as \"adrenal fatigue.\" Rest is the key to longevity and having a strong will! Your Acupuncturist has most certainly encouraged you to prioritize rest, this is why! The kidneys are the Root of Life, the Foundation of Yin and Yang, and SO MUCH MORE! We encourage you to continue to find ways to rest, restore and nourish this winter. Come in for a yin nourishing treatment and be sure to talk to your provider about other ways to boost your health based on your unique constitution. "}
