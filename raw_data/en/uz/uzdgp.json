You wrote about a compound called I3C found in broccoli. I'd like to take this to protect against breast cancer, but I'd rather eat it than supplement. How much broccoli should I eat per day? --P.G., Denver A. The answer is about 2 pounds! If you think you can eat that every single day, think again. This diet is impossible to maintain. Try explaining to the produce manager why you pulled up a chair and turned their produce bin into a trough. Now, if you're the ambitious sort and refuse supplementation, you can get excited because it's not just broccoli that's good for you. All of the vegetables in the brassica family are loaded with the powerful cancer buster I3C and its sister compound DIM. These lip-smacking veggies include cabbage, bok choy, kale, chard, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and turnips. Eat them raw or lightly steamed. Most people can't tackle such an eating extravaganza. That's why a healthy diet should be supplemented with about 300 milligrams of I3C per day. For men protecting their prostate, 400 milligrams may be a better dosage. Q. I read your column on grapefruit interactions. I'm a 66-year-old sailor in good health, but I have an enlarged prostate, high cholesterol and a mechanical St. Judes heart valve. I take Coumadin (warfarin) and Lipitor. Can I replace that orange with half a grapefruit every morning for breakfast? --J.K., Portsmouth, Va. A. Because grapefruits contain lycopene, which is very beneficial to the prostate, it's not a bad idea. But if you change fruits, do so carefully and integrate a little more grapefruit each week. Of course, get off your ship on a regular basis so you can be properly monitored by your physician. Grapefruit interacts to a large degree with just a few drugs, including two other cholesterol busters, Mevacor and Zocor. The interaction with Lipitor is much less likely to occur. In fact, it's not necessarily a bad thing. You may end up needing less drug because grapefruit makes it work more efficiently. It's the same deal with warfarin and those green leafy vegetables they warn you to avoid. People shouldn't give up healthy foods. Just moderate your intake and make it consistent. Get routine blood tests so your doctor can regulate your drug dosage as your body adjusts to the good food. Q. You mentioned a state-of-the-art home test kit for diabetics called Metrika A1C. My pharmacy hadn't heard of it, nor do they stock it. Can you help me get it? --J.S., Crystal Lake A. This test kit assesses your average blood sugar during the previous months, and you can do it with a finger stick at home. That's an advantage over most blood sugar monitors, which test an instant in time. To order, call Metrika at 877-212-4968. If you can wait two weeks, your pharmacy can order the A1C Now Test Kit for you. For more information, visit www.a1cnow.com. Did you know? Many insurance companies have stopped paying for Claritin because it's available over the counter now. ---------- This information is not intended to treat, cure or diagnose your condition.
