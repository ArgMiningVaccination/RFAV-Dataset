Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. It treats patients by inserting thin needles into acupuncture points in the skin and is based upon the same belief as [reflexology](/blog/reflexology-in-the-spotlight); that energy, or Qi, flows through the body in channels, called meridians, and if disrupted can cause illness. When the needles are inserted into the appropriate points it is said that one's flow of energy starts to be brought back into balance and therefore relieves the patient of their illness. Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of health conditions but is also used as a more general healing method. Each treatment is custom-designed to tailor to a patient's needs, correcting imbalances, strengthening, calming, cleansing and building deep vitality. By promoting the natural flow of Qi in the body, acupuncture regulates spiritual, emotional, mental and physical balance. During a typical acupuncture session, taking the pulse on both arms and an inspection of the tongue will follow an initial consultation. Depending on the type of treatment, sessions can last between 10 and 60 minutes. Many people assume that inserting a needle into the skin will be a painful experience and shy away from trying the treatment. However, during the treatment, sensations such as warmth and pressure may be felt but these clearly differentiate from pain. Clients who have undergone the treatment during a [solo holiday](/singles-holidays) have said that the feeling is unfamiliar but not unpleasant and ultimately relaxing. The needles are very fine, about hair width, and nothing is inserted into the skin through them. Their purpose is to alleviate stress in the body, improve circulation and stimulate the [immune system](/advice/topics/boost-your-immune-system/boost-your-immune-system-with-acupuncture-maureen-cromey).
