She is the Founder of Emerging Energy Acupuncture. As a teenager with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, she understood how illness can hold us back from fulfilling our dreams. With holistic medicine and nutritional support, she recovered and made it her mission to help people overcome illness. At this time, she was drawn to study Eastern Philosophy and Meditation. Dr. Dilks entered Loyola University in Chicago where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy. Always inquisitive, this basis of theoretical thinking has proven invaluable as a framework for her practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Dr. Dilks entered the field of Integrative Medicine in 1999 while working at American Whole Health in Chicago with Dr. David Edelberg, an internist who is highly respected in his field working with patients with Fibromyalgia and chronic illnesses. Watching other patients manage and even beat chronic illness using complementary medicine including Traditional Chinese Medicine solidified Mary Claire's desire to study it further. Dr. Dilks enrolled in the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine, the largest Traditional Chinese Medicine college in the U. S., where she studied at both the Chicago and the New York City campuses. In total, the rigorous 4 year Master's program involved over 3000 hours of clinical and didactic study including both Chinese as well as Western Medicine Sciences. Dr. Dilks opened Emerging Energy Acupuncture in 2004 in Providence, Rhode Island, where she lives with her husband, son, two siamese cats and standard poodle, Lucy. Since completing her degree in Chinese Medicine, Dr. Dilks has completed several graduate mentorship programs in Advanced Herbal Training and continues to study with renowned herbalist Sharon Weizenbaum. She applies the theories of Classical Chinese Medicine to address many modern conditions. In 2008, Dr. Dilks studied Channel Palpation with Dr. Wang Ju-Yi as well as several of his apprentices in order to more fully understand the meridian system. In the fall of 2017, Dr. Dilks completed a year long course of study with world renowned Dermatologist from the UK, Mazin Al-Khafaji. In passing a rigorous 5 hour exam in 2018, she earned her Diploma in Dermatology and is listed a member on the prestigious International Register of Chinese Medicine Dermatology. In 2019, Dr. Dilks studied Neuropuncture with Dr. Mike Corradino and uses this method of modern neuroscience acupuncture as well as other acupuncture systems to effectively treat many conditions. Nearly two decades later, Dr. Dilks believes it is her mission to help people find renewed health and balance. In her free time, she enjoys cooking using natural, local food, hiking with her family, gardening, making jewelry, and crafting natural skincare and aromatherapy products.
