UC San Diego. University Communications Public Relations Materials, 1956-2020 (RSS 6020) Extent: 91.8 Linear feet (218 archives boxes and 4 oversize folders), + 10.23 GB of digital files University Communications and Public Affairs (UCPA) serves the campus, the community and the news media as a source of information about the campus, about matters that affect the campus and about matters that affect American education. Its staff informs the public about teaching, research, administration, public services, and student life at the University and stays abreast of developments in government and the community that could affect the University. UCPA develops news releases, features and reports about the University. University Communications has experienced periodic reorganization since the Publications and Public Information Office (PPI) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography moved to Urey Hall and was renamed Public Affairs. On February 1, 1965, Cy W. Greaves was appointed manager of Campus Relations which included public information, community relations, publications, and gifts and endowments. In July 1965, a Scripps office under the direction of Nelson Fuller was created. The Public Affairs Office managed public relations functions for all university units except the University Hospital of San Diego County, which maintained its own public relations office (1969), later designated as Public Information -- University Hospital (1971). After the School of Medicine (SOM) opened in 1967, a public relations office funded by SOM was created and named the School of Medicine, Public Affairs Office. In 1976, the Public Affairs Office was renamed the Public Information Office and Paul West headed the office until 1985 when he was succeeded by Winifred Cox. The office was again reorganized in the late 1980s to centralize and incorporate units of the Medical Center. The Public Information Office became known as University Communications with divisions to represent individual campus units. In 1989, the public information offices at the School of Medicine and the UCSD Medical Center were merged into a single unit called Health Sciences Communications, a division of University Communications. Clare Kristofco directed University Communications (now named University Communications and Public Affairs) from 2004 until 2017. Jeff Gattas currently leads UCPA. Public relations materials created and collected by University Communications, the UCSD administrative office responsible for informing the public about teaching, research, administration, public services, and student life at the University. The collection includes national and regional newspaper clippings (1961-1999) about UCSD; clippings on sports at UCSD (1963-1970, 1975-1984 and 1986-1992); news releases for the general campus (1956-1999); and subject files on campus-related events, the development of programs and colleges, Camp Matthews, La Jolla Farms Stables, and important early UCSD dedications and groundbreaking ceremonies. Additionally, the records include photographs of campus events, major campus buildings, aerial views of campus, and portraits of campus administrators and faculty. The materials are arranged in seven series: 1) NEWS CLIPPINGS, 2) NEWS RELEASES AND FEATURES, 3) PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS, 4) PHOTOGRAPHS, 5) SUBJECT FILES, 6) VIDEORECORDINGS, and 7) PUBLICATIONS. News releases 2000-2011 were collected from the Communications website which was soon to be retired. Many of the webpages were no longer functioning. The HTML was used to create PDF versions of the news releases modeled after reformatted content already in DAMS. Born-digital news releases in the DAMS can be searched by using the keyword \"scanewsrel.\" Born-digital news features in the DAMS can be searched by using the keyword \"scafeat.\" This collection has additional unprocessed materials not described in this finding aid.
