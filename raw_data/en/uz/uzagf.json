We aimed to measure the prevalence of herbal medicine use in a gro up of pregnant women attending a public tertiary maternity hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Seco ndary aims were to expl ore why women took the herbal medicine, where they received advice, what form the supplements took and if they perceived the supplements to be helpful. Methods: Consecutive pregnant women were approached in the antenatal clinic and the birth centre at around 36-38 weeks gestation. A questio nnaire was developed and self-administered in English, as well as being translated into the four most common languages of women attending the hospital: Cantonese, Vietnamese, Turkish and Arab ic. Back translation into English was undertaken by different professional translators to verify a ccuracy of both words an d concepts. Data collected included demographic informat ion, model of pregnancy care and herbal supplement use. Descriptive statistics were used initially, with stratified and regression analysis to compare sub- groups. Results: Of 705 eligible women, 588 (83%) agreed to participate. Of these, 88 (15%) completed the questionnaire in a language other than English . Thirty-six percent of wo men took at least one herbal supplement during the current pregna ncy. The most common supplements taken were raspberry leaf (14%), ginger (12%) and chamomile (11%). Women were more likely to take herbal supplements if they were older, tertiary educat ed, English speaking, non-smokers and primiparous. Conclusion: Use of herbal supplements in pregnancy is likely to be relati vely high and it is important to ascertain what supplements (if an y) women are taking. Pregnancy care providers should be aware of the common herbal supplements used by women, and of the evidence regarding potential benefits or harm.Published: 19 June 2006 BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2006, 6:21 doi:10.1186/1471-2393-6-21Received: 03 November 2005 Accepted: 19 June 2006 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 \u00a9 2006 Forster et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

There are limited data onthe extent of women's use of either herbal or vitamin sup- plements during pregnancy [7], despite the fact that knowledge of the potential side effects of many of theseproducts is limited, particularly with respect to their use inpregnancy [8-11]. Although regulation of alternative med-icines has improved in Australia herbal medicines are stillnot subject to the same scrutiny in terms of safety, efficacy and constituents as conventional medicines [2], although many consumers assume or expect this to be the case [12].Many consumers do not inform their primary care pro-vider about their use of these alternative medicines [2,12]. Cross-sectional surveys in one Australian state in 1993, 2000 and 2004 demonstrated high levels of use of CAMs and CAM therapists [1,2,12]. While overall use of CAMs was stable, with approximately 50% of respondents usingat least one non-medically prescribed alternative medi-cine in the previous year, there was an increased numberof women using herbal medicines [12]. Users of CAM aremore likely to be female, better educated, employed [2,13,12] and have a higher income [2,12]. Several papers specifically report on the use of herbal sup- plements or medicines in pregnancy, and the studies aresummarised in Table 1. Herbal use reported in pregnancyranged from 7% to 96%. When considering only studies from Australia, use of herbal medicine in pregnancy ranged from 10-56%. There is a trend that smaller studieshave found higher prevalence of herbal medicine usage.Pinn and Pallett [14] reported a relatively low prevalence(12%), but only asked women in mid-pregnancy, whereasNordeng and Havnen [10] found that use of herbal sup- plements increased as pregnancy progressed, supporting trends noted in a previous Finnish study [15]. Characteristics of women more likely to take herbal sup- plements in pregnancy include being older [16]; married[8]; primiparous [8,17]; having tertiary level education[8]; previous herbal use [9]; being white [9]; and being less educated [9]. One study found older women were less likely to be taking herbal supplements [10]; anotherreported that the only predictor of increased use of herbalmedicine in their study of nausea in pregnancy wasincreased severity of nausea and vomiting [18]. The use of herbal supplements during pregnancy may be pregnancy related, for example for nausea and vomiting[19,7,8], reflux [7], candida [7], nutritional [10], or to pre-pare for labour [8]; or may be for unrelated health issuessuch as colds and respiratory illnesses [10] or skin prob- lems [10]. Reasons reported for ceasing herbal medicine supplements during pregnancy include concerns for thehealth of the fetus/baby [8,16,19], the 'condition' improv-ing [8], the supplement not helping [8] and advice from ahealth care provider [16]. Herbal supplement use in pregnancy has been reported to be recommended by health care providers [16,19], natu-ral/alternative medicine practitioners [18,19] or pharma-cists [18]; suggested by friends or family [8,10,16,18,19];based on information from media sources [19]; or basedon women's own information and knowledge [15,16]. Women may choose to use herbal supplements because they consider them safer during pregnancy than pharma-ceutical products [18]. MacLennan et al. [2] reported thatnine percent of their sample considered that alternativemedicines were safe to use in pregnancy, and 36% consid-ered they were unsafe, with the remainder unsure (28%)or varying depending on the medication 27%. Information on herbal use may not be specifically elicited during pregnancy care. One study found that 75% ofwomen reported their supplement use during pregnancyto their primary care provider [19], and another reportedthat the use of herbal supplements were documented in only two (1%) of the women's medical records where women had reported taking herbal supplements duringstudy data collection [8]; it is not stated whether this wasbecause women did not tell pregnancy providers orwhether providers did not document the information. Inan Australian study only 36% of participants informed their primary medical carer of alternative medicine usage [13]. Our aim was to explore patterns of herbal medication use including dietary supplements in pregnant women. Weexpected that in keeping with the increased use of herbal and alternative medicines in the community generally, we would find a relatively high proportion of women attend-ing for pregnancy care were using herbal medicines peri-conceptionally, during pregnancy, labour or in thepuerperium. We also expected that the use of herbal rem-edies might differ between cultural groups. This paperpresents the findings relating to herbal medicine use in pregnancy. Ethics approval was obtained from the Mercy Health and Aged Care Research Ethics Committee. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was used.

There are approximately 5,000 births per year at the MHW, and 80% book for maternity care as public patients. Private patients access antenatal care inthe private rooms of their chosen provider.Participants Any woman attending a public antenatal clinic at the MHW, who had reached approxi-mately 38 weeks gestation and who was able to speak and read English, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish or Vietnamese was eligible for inclusion in the study. The only exclusion criteriaBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2006, 6:21 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 Page 4 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)were if a woman or fetus were known to be very ill at the time of recruitment. Research midwives recruited women in the standard antenatal clinic as well as the Family BirthCentre clinic while the women were waiting for pregnancycheck-ups. Women from the four language groups whereinformation was translated were recruited with the assist-ance of interpreters where necessary, and used the trans- lated questionnaires if they preferred or if it was necessary. Sample size We initially sought to recruit approximately 10% of the population of women going through the MHW each year,which would be 500 women. This covered a range of dif- ferent sample size calculations for prevalence of herbal supplement use within the population. There were a widerange of variables being measured, and with many ofthem we had limited data from which to estimateexpected prevalence. We looked at a variety of estimatesfrom 5% to 50% (within which limits we estimated thetrue prevalence was likely to lie for the main supplements, based on previous studies), using a 95% confidence level and allowing for a 5-10% variation. The greatest numberneeded for this was 387. Allowing for missing data withinfields, as well as sub-group analysis, we rounded to 500.Sample size calculations were undertaken using EpiInfo[20]. We aimed that 30% of the sample would comprise women from non English-speaking backgrounds, to rep- resent the proportion of women booking to the MHW. Data collection A structured questionnaire was designed by the researchteam specifically for the project. The questionnaire was self-administered and took about 20 minutes to complete. Question areas included demographic factors (e.g. age,country of birth, religion, education, smoking status,income, marital status); and obstetric factors (e.g. parity,gestation, pregnancy losses, model of maternity care). Alist of supplements and herbal preparations which we thought women were likely to take was included as a check list. These included ginger, raspberry leaf, chamo-mile, garlic, evening primrose oil, blue digestive bitters and slippery elm. Other supple-ments could be listed by the participants. Data on vitaminsupplement use (e.g. folic acid) were also collected and will be reported elsewhere. Information was collected on dosage and form of supplements, duration and timing oftreatment, who recommended the supplements andwhether women thought that the supplement was effec-tive. The questionnaire was piloted with a sample ofwomen in the postnatal wards, and modifications made as necessary. Final piloting was undertaken using preg- nant women in the antenatal clinic.Approximately one third of the women booking into the MHW each year are from a non-English speaking back- ground. The largest groups are Vietnamese, Chinese, Turk-ish and Arabic speaking women, and the questionnairewas translated into these four languages by qualifiedexternal translators. Translation back to English wasundertaken by different translators to verify the content and to ensure that the concepts of the questions had not changed. Data analysis Data were entered on an Access database [21]. Quantita-tive data were analysed using Stata [22], and analysis included frequencies and summary descriptive statistics. Where logisitic regression was undertaken, variables wereretained in at the univariate level if the p-value was 0.2, then in the main model if the p-value was 0.05 [23]. A range of checks were done on final models. Data fromopen-ended responses were coded and presented asthemes that best represented the data. Results The translated versions of the questionnaire took longerthan anticipated to be finalised, so recruitment and datacollection was in two phases. Women who could use theEnglish version were recruited from May-October 2003. Women unable to complete the questionnaire in English were considered ineligible during this phase. There were617 women eligible for the study and 500 (81%) com-pleted the survey. Eleven women declined participationand 107 were missed during the clinic due to scheduledactivities, particularly medical, midwifery or ultrasound appointments. Arabic, Chinese, Turkish or Vietnamese speaking women were recruited between February andMay 2004. There were 35 Vietnamese, 27 Chinese, 6 Turk-ish and 18 Arabic-speaking women. Other women fromthese language groups did participate but used the Englishversion of the questionnaire, and were recruited in the first phase. The final sample size was 588. The background characteristics of the participants are pre- sented in Table 2. The majority of women were married,or living with a partner, had completed secondary educa-tion and did not smoke. Slightly less than half had com-pleted a degree and had a household taxable income > $50,000 (AUD). Just over half of the women were having their first baby. Sixty-five percent of women had Englishas their first language Table 3 shows the breakdown of the proportion of women who took herbal supplements; 36% of our sample took at least one herbal medicine supplement. The most common supplements used were raspberry leaf (13.9%);ginger (11.6%); 2006, 6:21 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 Page 5 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Table 2: Background characteristics of participants(n = 588) Characteristic No. % Age (median, range) 32 (18-46) Marital status (n = 584) Married 422 72.3 Living with partner 118 20.2 Has partner, not cohabiting 17 2.9 Single 21 3.6 Separated or divorced 5 0.9 Widowed 1 0.2 Secondary schooling (n = 584) Completed secondary school to final year (12)475 81.3 Did not complete secondary school 97 16.6 Attended primary school only 10 1.7 Did not attend primary school 2 0.3 Higher education (n = 560) Degree or higher 235 42.0 No degree 325 58.0 Taxable income for the household for last year, AUD (n = 516)* < $20,000 82 15.9 $20,000-$30,000 75 14.5 $30,000-$40,000 66 12.8 $40,000-$50,000 63 12.2 > $50,000 230 44.6 Country of birth (only top 7 listed) (n = 583) Australia 314 53.9 Vietnam 66 11.3 China 31 5.3 New Zealand 18 3.1 India 15 2.6 UK and Eire 13 2.2 Turkey 10 1.7 If not born in Australia, years in Australia (n = 256) Mean (SD) 10 (sd 9.2) Median (range) 8 (0-36) English first language (n = 581) Yes 378 65.1 Religion (n = 505) Christian 237 46.9 Muslim 55 10.9 Buddhist 49 9.7 Hindu 8 1.6 Other 4 0.8 None 152 30.0 Pre-pregnancy smoking (579) None 436 75.3 1-9 83 14.3 10-19 40 6.9 20-29 16 2.8 30-39 4 0.7 >40 0 - Gestation at recruitment (n = 575) Mean (sd) 38.45 (sd 1.28) Median (range) 38 (29-42) First baby (n = 582) Yes 310 53.3 Previous pregnancy losses (could tick more than one option) Termination of pregnancy 134 22.8 Miscarriage (including ectopic pregnancies) 113 19.2BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2006, 6:21 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 Page 6 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Stillbirth >20 weeks gestation 6 1.0 Neonatal death 1 0.2 None of these 353 60 Model of pregnancy care (n = 586) Public hospital clinic (doctor or midwife) 280 47.7 Shared care (majority of care with local family doctor)171 29.2 Team midwifery or midwives clinic 93 15.9 Family Birth Centre 41 7.0 * Australian average annual income for those is currently employed is $42,484 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, Feb 2006, http: //www.abs.gov.au ); for those not currently employed, Government pens ions and allowances provide income support of up to approxima tely $10-12,000 per y ear http:// www.centrelink.gov.auTable 2: Background characteristics of participants(n = 588) (Continued) Table 3: Herbal supplement s women reported using during pregnancy (n = 588) Herb taken No % Most common form of supplement*Most common reason/s for use reported by women**Gestation commenced (if applicable)Who recommended supplement use*% who reported the supplement helped?

Other herbal sup-plements mentioned by five or less women were fish oiltablets, herbal teas, blue cohosh, acidophilus tablets, ombeshi plums, homeopathic drops, peppermint and St John's Wort. For each herbal supplement they used, women were asked to describe what form of the supplement they used; whythey used it; when they commenced taking it; when the supplement was ceased; who recommended the supple- ments use; and if they considered the supplement hadbeen of help. These findings are also shown in Table 3. Inmost instances the woman herself made a decision to usea supplement - primary maternity care providers wererarely cited as the person recommending supplement use. With most of the herbal remedies there was no pattern to the gestation at which they were commenced, with theexceptions of raspberry leaf, which was used from 30weeks gestation or later in the 89% of cases, and ginger,where 98% of women commenced taking it in early preg-nancy. Reasons for supplement use were relatively consist-ent for each herbal remedy for example, raspberry leaf tea used as a uterine tonic, ginger used for relief of nausea and vomiting. The form in which each herbal supplement wastaken varied with all except garlic (tablets used) andchamomile (tea used). Comparing women who used interpreted versions of the survey compared with those who did not, 12% of the women who used a translated version took herbal medi-cine in pregnancy compared with 40% of the women whoused the English version. When considering this as thosewho had English as a second language compared with those who reported English as a first language, the trendwas the same: 43.7% of women whose first language wasEnglish used herbal medicine whereas 22.7% of women first language was other than English reported using herbal medicine in pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to explore who was more likely to take herbal supplements of any kind during preg-nancy. Demographic factors (age, marital status, second- ary and tertiary education, income, Australian-born compared to not, English as first language, non-Englishspeaking background, pre-pregnancy smoking, parity) aswell as if the current pregnancy was planned and if thewoman had experienced previous pregnancy losses wereeach tested against the outcome variable of 'using at least one herbal supplement' in this pregnancy. Variables that had a Wald statistic P-value of 0.2 were retained in the preliminary model [23]. These were: having having a firstbaby. Only observations with no missing values in these variables were included in the model (n = 513). Age was retained as a continuous variable after checking it had alinear association with the outcome variable. Variableswere eliminated one at a time, with variables onlyretained if the Wald statistic P-value was 0.05. The like- lihood ratio test was used to test each subsequent model to ensure the newer simpler one did not differ signifi- cantly from the previous model.Table 4: Factors predicting any use of herbal supplements (n = 513) Unadjusted Odds Ratio 95% CI Adjusted Odds Ratio 95% CI Interpreted version used No (ref) 1 1 Yes 0.23 (0.11, 0.49) 0.43 (0.18, 0.98) Age (10.23, 11.02) 10.66 (10.23, 11.12) Degree Has degree not have degree 0.42 (0.29, 0.61) 0.56 (0.38, 0.82)LanguageEnglish first language (ref) 1 not first language 0.39 (0.26, 0.58) 0.51 (0.31, 0.83) Smoking 0.44 (0.22, 0.88) 0.41 (0.20, 0.85)ParityFirst baby (ref) 1 Subsequent baby 0.59 (0.41, 0.85) 0.56 (0.37, 0.84) *All demographic factors entered into model (including whether it was a planned pregnancy and if they had had a previous miscar riage), and only those remaining significant are presentedBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2006, 6:21 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 Page 8 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Regression analysis outcomes Table 4 shows that after adjusting for demographic factors and clinical variables such as previous miscarriage orwhether the current pregnancy was planned, the womenless likely to used herbal supplements were those who: used an interpreted version of the questionnaire (OR0.43; 95% CI 0.18, 0.98); had a language other than Eng- lish as their first language (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.31, 0.83); had not completed a degree 95% CI 0.38, 0.82);smoked during pregnancy (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.20, 0.85);or those having other than their first baby (OR 0.56; 95%CI 0.37, 0.84). Women who were older were more likelyto take herbal supplements, and this association increased with increasing age (OR per 10 year increase in age 10.66; 95% CI 10.23, 11.12). Discussion Thirty-six percent of the women in this sample used atleast one herbal supplement during their current preg-nancy. The most common herbal supplements taken were raspberry leaf (14%), ginger (12%) and chamomile (11%). The prevalence of herbal supplementation in ourdata sit within the proportions reported in Australianstudies, which ranged from 10-56%. The characteristicsof the women more likely to take herbal supplements inthis study were also in keeping with other reports; women who were older, tertiary educated, English-speaking, non- smokers and primiparous were more likely to take herbalsupplements. Of the women who reported taking herbal supplements, the majority said they did so for pregnancy related reasons (Table 3), whereas one study reported that only 13% of herbal medicine use in pregnancy was for pregnancy-related problems [10] and in another the most commonreason for the use of herbal supplements was for sleep orrelaxation [24]. Women most commonly reported thatthey had chosen to take the supplements based on their own knowledge, or advice from friends, with naturopaths being the next most common source of advice. Pregnancycare providers such as midwives, general practitioners andobstetricians were rarely reported to have advised herbalsupplement use. We expected that women from different cultural groups may have different patterns of herbal medicine use, and our study included 35% of women where English was nottheir first language, 17% of who used a translated ques-tionnaire. We found that women of English-speakingbackground were more likely to take herbal supplements,with no difference in vitamin supplement uptake. In the majority of studies identified women of non-English speaking background (or not speaking the most commonlanguage in the study context) have not been included[8,10]. Others report including women only if there is aninterpreter available [7]; or including two languages only [16]. One study specifically excluded women of differing cultural backgrounds because they anticipated that differ-ent groups may have different practices in the use ofherbal medicine [10]. A limitation of the current study was that we did not ask women if they reported their herbal supplement use to their maternity care provider during pregnancy. A recentAustralian study found that more than half of CAM usersdid not report their use to a doctor prescribing conven-tional medicines [12]. This important given our relativelack of knowledge of effects of CAMs as well as the poten- tial interactions of CAMs with conventional medicines [12]. Given the high prevalence of the use of complemen-tary therapies and medicines in our community, and therelative lack of evidence of either efficacy or harm, it isimportant that health care providers do ask about the use of alternative medicines and therapies as a routine. Rea-sons for not telling may be that patients felt that doctors (or other care providers) may reject the idea of the alter- native therapies [25], or that women may assume that if asupplement is 'natural' it is therefore safe. We made an a priori decision not to include model of care in the regression model as we wanted to know factors related to the women predicted use of herbal supple- ments, regardless of model of care. We expected that ingeneral women who chose midwifery models of care (andin particular birth centre care) would be more likely to useherbal supplements, and stratified analysis confirmed thisassumption. The data also demonstrated that providers of care were not a major influence on why women took herbal supplements. This is an exploratory study in an area where there is lim- ited existing knowledge. This study therefore adds to whatis known on the topic, and may guide clinicians when they are seeking to understand what (if any) supplements women in similar populations may be taking in preg-nancy. Conclusion Use of herbal supplements in pregnancy is likely to be rel-atively high and it is important to ascertain what supple- ments (if any) women are taking. Pregnancy care providers should be aware of the common herbal supple-ments used by women, and of the evidence regardingpotential benefits or harm. It is important that care pro-viders do not prescribe any treatments, medications orherbal supplements where they are unaware of the evi- dence supporting their use.Publish with BioMed Central and every scientist can read your work free of charge \"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for disseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\" Sir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK Your research papers will be: available free of charge to the entire biomedical community peer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance cited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central yours \u2014 you keep the copyright Submit your manuscript here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.aspBioMed centralBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2006, 6:21 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/21 Page 9 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Competing interests The author(s) declare that they have no competing inter- ests.
