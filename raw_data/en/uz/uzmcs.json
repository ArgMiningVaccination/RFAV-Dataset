This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate antibiotic residues in raw and pasteurized milk in Iran. Data were collected through searching the databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SID, and Magiran using the following keywords: \"pasteurized milk\", \"raw milk\", \"milk\", \"antibiotic residues\", \" antibiotic\", and \"Iran\". Finally, 40 eligible studies were selected for the systematic review and meta-analysis. According to the reviewed studies, the prevalence of antibiotic residues in raw and pasteurized milk was 26% (95% CI: 20-33%) and 21% (95% CI: 15-27%), respectively. It seems that the control measures are inefficient in dairy industry and milk collection centers for the presence of antibiotic residues and the time of antibiotic withdrawal during milk delivery. Permanent control of milk in the collection centers by the responsible organizations along with implementation of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system in milk factories can be very effective in reducing antibiotic residues.", "sitename": "AIMS Agriculture and Food", "date": "2022-04-11", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || Sen C, Ray PR, Bhattacharyya M (2021) A critical review on metabolomic analysis of milk and milk products.
