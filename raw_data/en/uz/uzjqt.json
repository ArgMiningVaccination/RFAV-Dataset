Pediatric bone sarcomas are rare and difficult to diagnose, with common sites for osteosarcoma including the distal femur and proximal tibia. Patients typically present with chronic localized pain that is intermittent, often with no fever, weight loss, or malaise. Because the presentation can be similar to what a clinician would expect for tendonitis and other benign pathologies, patients frequently receive physiotherapy rather than referral to a tertiary care centre for further workup.

It is a time of anxiety and fear, leading to many a grim thought. During this period of negativity and darkness, I would like to celebrate a positive source of light. After 36 years of dedicated service, Kashmira Suraliwalla, senior editorial and production coordinator at the BCMJ, has announced her retirement. Kash, as she is affection- ately known, grew up in Bombay, India, and immigrated to Vancouver as a young adult. An avid traveler and global citizen she's an active member of the Zoroastrian community here on the West Coast. She started as an editorial assistant at the BCMA, as Doctors of BC was formerly known, in 1983. As the journal grew, she became the production coordinator, and then started her current position, which sees her working in such diverse areas as Editorial Board wrangling, finance, ad sales, and article submissions (to name a few). She has adjusted Farewell, Kash to many changes in journal publishing and our organization over the years, not to mention be- ing a line of continuity for four editors and six managing editors. In addition to her excellent work at the BCMJ, she is also the production coordinator of the Report to Members (for - merly the White Report). She is well known around Doctors of BC because of her help with many social and charitable projects, such as the annual staff summer picnic and the Canadian Cancer Society's Daffodil Campaign. Kash is always ready to contribute to other people's efforts, and is of- ten the instigating force behind a fundraiser or charitable endeavor, whether for earthquake relief, hurricane relief, a humanitarian crisis, or other worthwhile cause. To my mind, the BCMJ and Kash are forever linked as she has been serving our journal with patience and humor since long before I arrived on the scene. The physicians of BC owe her a debt of gratitude, and I would personally like to thank her for her years of dedicated service. The physicians of BC owe her a debt of gratitude. I will miss her insightful suggestions and ob- servations on both our organization and the provincial medical system. We wish Kash the very best in the next chapter of her life. n \u2014dave richar dson, M d Expand your practice to #virtualCARE by seeing patients via phone and video.

I hope that my fears today do not become our reality when this is read in the May issue of the BCMJ . Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, today's reality for many front-line physicians consists of virtual office visits, virtual meetings, virtual contact with friends and loved ones, and virtu- ally being on the edge of panic every day. We physicians in this province have been told to keep our heads down, to keep calm, and to not publicly disagree with the official statements coming from the various levels of government and the medical profession's rep- resentative and regulatory bodies with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand the logic behind this message; they don't want the public to panic. The unintended consequence is that many health care providers are currently in a state of panic. Those of us who are exposing ourselves daily to people who could potentially make us very sick or even kill us are feeling very stressed. It doesn't help when we know that things are worse than they are being made out to be. It doesn't help when the news from Italy is of civil unrest and the news from New York is that refrigeration trucks are being used to store bodies. It doesn't help when the news from our My pandemic fears 31 March 2020 During the early stages of the pandemic in BC, the physicians with whom I work were aware of community spread of the disease sev- eral days before it was announced officially. During the early stages of the pandemic in BC, some staff were wearing masks at all times in the hospital (not only during patient contact), but they were reprimanded by hospital administration for doing so. A couple of weeks later, we were told by the same people that it was advis- able to wear a mask at all times in the hospital. Last week, I had hospital rounds for my group. My daily ritual after hospital rounds was to shower and change clothes and shoes before going to my office. I now wear a mask and eye protection all the time when I am in public or at work. Many physicians in our hospital had to buy eye protection for themselves, as I did. I clean my hands multiple times a day. Yet, I fear that is not enough to avoid getting the virus. Today, without any obvious stimulus, my fear ramped up to such a high level that I imagined this editorial to also be my obituary. If this pandemic can be likened to a war, and health care workers are the army, then it feels as if we are being sent into battle without bullets and without adequate body armor. I apologize to readers for the gloomy na- ture of this editorial, and I apologize to those trying to keep everyone calm. The only miti- gating factor, perhaps, is that by the time you read this my words will either seem hopelessly pessimistic and overdramatic, or the situation will be much worse and these words will seem calm compared with how everyone is actually feeling. I hope it's the former. n \u2014david B. Chapman, MBChBinternational colleagues is that even though they took all the necessary protective measures, they too are getting sick with COVID-19. It doesn't help that we feel as though we may run out of personal protective equipment. It doesn't help when the published sta- tistics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 do not take into account that we stopped testing the gen- eral population 2 weeks ago. Of course, the num-ber of confirmed cases will appear to be fewer if you change your testing criteria. In my opinion\u2014 shared by epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists throughout the world, and annunciated by the World Health Organization\u2014the keys to containing this dis- ease are rigorous testing and contact tracing, strict controls on people's movement (border controls and social distancing), and enforced quarantine of high-risk individuals. Unfortu- nately, we stopped testing widely, and the con- trols on people's movement were perhaps 1 or 2 weeks too late, and they are too weak. The keys to containing this disease are rigorous testing and contact tracing, strict controls on people's movement (border controls and social distancing), and enforced quarantine of high-risk individuals. 127 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020127 president's comment CoV id-19 r eflections It is 2 April 2020 as I write this President's Comment. Across Canada the first wave of the coronavirus crisis is beginning to take off. Using frameworks fine-tuned through other pandemics, we have been implementing stronger and stronger public health measures to slow the spread. And yet the numbers are slowly rising. I feel like I am standing on the beach watching the water drain away ahead of the tsunami. Last month I messaged all of you to mobi- lize our profession in amplifying the orders of one of our own, Dr Bonnie Henry, our provin- cial health officer. I cannot imagine a calmer and more organized physician to lead our health care system and the public through this time\u2014 providing information that is timely, relevant, factual, and free from alarmist tone. Many of you joined the communication stream to add your professional knowledge, personal experi- ence, and credibility to ensure the public got the message to self isolate and practise physical distancing. This is a time unlike any we have seen before, and one I hope we will not see again in our lifetime. Physicians' tireless work in responding to the pandemic has been supported by public health, government, health authorities, health care leaders, health care workers, and the public. Canadians have weathered an unprecedented disruption to our lives and to the health care system, which has mobilized to meet the nec-essary changes in a way that many would not have thought possible over such a short time. Virtual care ramped up seemingly overnight in support of COVID-19 screening and longi- tudinal care. Our front-line primary care and specialist providers have been working with all partners to ensure that patients can still ac- cess care for their usual medical conditions and ensure that our most vulnerable patients stay connected to necessary services. Physicians and health care leaders inside our facilities have put aside differences and pulled together to nimbly solve critical issues involv- ing physical space, beds, ventilators, oxygen supplies, testing processes, staff shortages, and shortages of personal protective equipment. No one has been idle. Physicians have rallied together to share knowledge about processes that were successful, and those that were less so. You have created Facebook, Slack, and WhatsApp groups to sup - port each other, plan next steps, and debrief about critical situations and the ongoing stress of being in a hazardous environment. Untold numbers of physicians and other health care providers have shown up to work every day facing the threat that they would fall ill. Many may still fall ill, and some may not survive. Tough decisions lie ahead about the rationing of critical care if our resources are outpaced. Knowing this, you all continue to come to work anyway. All of you are heroes. I hope by the time this is published we will see the light at the end of the darkness, and we will have conquered the first wave of the coronavirus. We know the virus will come back for a second wave, and I'm confident you will rise to face this challenge with the same coura- geous and innovative spirit you've all embodied thus far. I will be standing there with you, provid- ing hands-on care, all the while doing my best to keep those I work with and care for, safe from harm. \u2014Kathleen ross, M d P resident, d octors of BC President Dr Kathleen Ross President-Elect Dr Matthew Chow Board Chair Dr Jeff DresselhuisDirector-at-Large General PracticeDr Adam Thompson Director-at-Large General Practice Dr Lawrence Director-at-Large Specialist Dr Lloyd OppelDirector-at-Large SpecialistDr Barb Blumenauer Director-at-Large Specialist 1 year Dr Andrew Yu Director-at-Large Specialist Dr Sophia Wong2019-20 D OCTORS Of BC B OARD O f Di R e CTORS128 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020128 Asking \"Is our society ready to go digital?\" may seem absurd considering that digital technolo - gies are core to almost every aspect of our daily lett ers to the editor we w elcome original letters of less than 300 words; we may edit them for clarity and length. lett ers may be emailed to journal@doctorsofbc.ca, submitted online at bcmj.org/submit-letter, or sent through the post and must include your mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

Mr Dhinsa is an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. Dr Mahon is a clinical assistant professor in the School of Nursing at UBC. Dr Strahlendorf is a clinical associate professor in the Division of Hematology and Oncology in the Department of Pediatrics at UBC. This article has been peer reviewed.of research on delays in appropriate management of pediatric bone tumor and to increase awareness of osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Methods: Six pedia tric pa tients a t BC Childr en's Hospital who were diagnosed with either osteo - sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma in 2018 were identified from the oncology database. The dates of their interactions with the health care system were used to create patient journey maps. Results: Each patient saw an average of four health care pr ofessionals bef ore r eferral t o BC Childr en's Hospital, and three patients spent 4 to 9 weeks receiving physiotherapy. on average, 114 days elapsed from the time patients had their first symp - toms to when they received chemotherapy, and 81% of this time was spent within the primary care system. Conclusions: The study reveals an overall delay in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bone tumors and highlights the need for general practitioners to further consider sarcomas in the differential diag- nosis when patients present with chronic localized pain, especially when patients are in the at-risk age group and the pain is localized to one of the common sites. Practitioners should be even more suspicious if there is a history of night pain, an atypical pain pattern following minor trauma, or a soft tissue mass on examination. Background Bone sarcomas make up 6% of all pediatric cancers, with the most common being osteo- sarcoma and the second most common being Ewing sarcoma.1,2 Osteosarcoma is a malig- nant mesenchymal neoplasia characterized by the production of osteoid or bone by the ma- lignant cells.3 Ewing sarcoma is part of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, which share histological characteristics and chromosomal translocations. Ewing sarcomas are small round blue cell tumors that can develop in bone or soft tissue.3 The peak incidence for both os- teosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma coincides with the adolescent growth spurt. Most cases are identified in individuals age 13 to 16 years, and females tend to present at a younger age than males.1 Both diseases most commonly occur in the metaphyses of long bones.4,5 One large population-based series suggested that as many as 75% of osteosarcomas originate in the distal femur.6 Other femur. 4131 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020131 Clini CalPatients often present with chronic localized pain that is intermittent. Clinical diagnosis is difficult because there is often no family his - tory to consider, no fever, no weight loss, and no malaise. The pain is often first noticed after trauma to the site. 7 A bone sarcoma patient's presentation will frequently be similar to what a clinician would expect for tendonitis, muscle injury, Osgood-Schlatter disease, meniscal le-sions, and other benign pathologies. 7 The ob- scure nature of bone sarcomas can result in patients receiving inadequate pain management and attending physiotherapy sessions rather than being referred to a tertiary care centre for further workup. Early identification of patients is important because bone tumors frequently metastasize. Before treatment protocols changed to include both neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, 80% to 90% of patients with osteosarcoma died as a result of their disease metastasizing. It has been hypothesized that the majority of these patients had subclinical metastases that went undetected.8,9 The current treatment protocol for osteo- sarcoma is surgery combined with 12 weeks of neoadjuvant and 29 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy.10 Ewing sarcoma is more sen- sitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy than osteosarcoma, so radiation can be considered in place of or in addition to surgery.11 As a result of modern multimodal therapies for osteosarcoma, 66% of patients without metastases, 50% with limited pulmonary metastases, and 25% with more advanced metastases are expected to be long-term survivors.12 System-wide awareness of osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma is needed along with timely referral. Only seven articles about delays in ap- propriate management of pediatric bone tumors have been published to date, and none of them are based on research in Canada or the United States.7,13-18 A quality improvement observa- tional study of patients treated at BC Children's Hospital (BCCH) was proposed to address this lack of research and to expedite the identifica-tion and referral of affected individuals. Methods To prevent biased selection of study subjects, the last six pediatric patients diagnosed in 2018 at BCCH with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma were identified in the hospital's oncology da- tabase. The medical records of these patients were then reviewed to determine the dates of appointments, imaging, and interventions. Pa- tient journey maps were created to illustrate all relevant interactions with the health care system from the time of first symptoms to the initia- tion of chemotherapy. The visual representations of important events for all patients were then compared to determine if there were patterns that might help physicians considering these diagnoses. Information that could be used to identify patients or the health care professionals involved in their care was not included in the research records. The study was approved by the UBC Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics Board. Results One of the patient journey maps created using BCCH data reveals that the patient saw pri- mary health care physicians seven times before being referred to tertiary care [Figure 1]. Before referral, the patient saw walk-in clinic physi - cians, family physicians, and a sports medicine physician. In addition, this patient received 9 weeks of physiotherapy. Another patient saw all the professionals named above as well as an emergency room physician before referral. 7 Visit to walk-in clinic0 First recollected symptoms Central line placedeGFR10 Physio- therapy (9 weeks)27 Visit to walk-in clinic21 Visit to walk-in clinic 65 Visit to sports medicine Initiation of chemotherapy103Visit to sports medicine, positive imaging, referral to BCCH First appointment at BCCH, CT, PET Echocardio- gram, biopsy35 Visit to family doctor 45Visit to family doctor 93 10295 97 101 FIgUrE 1 .

The six patients whose records were reviewed had an average of four interactions with health care professionals, not including regular physiotherapy. Physiotherapists were seen by three of the six patients for 4 to 9 weeks. On average, patients were seen 1.5 days after referral to BCCH and began chemotherapy 10.5 days after their first appointment. A symptom common among all patients was chronic localized pain that progressed to be- come very severe. Three of the patients recalled night pain and two noted that they began to notice the pain after minor trauma. Conclusions Bone sarcoma is often overlooked as a possible diagnosis. The patient journey maps created from BCCH data reveal an overall delay in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bone tu- mors, with most of the delay in the primary care setting. This accords with findings from Widhe and Widhe, and Goedhart and colleagues, who conclude that timely care of bone sarcoma pa-tients is needed between the first primary care visit and referral to a tertiary care centre. 7,13 In fact, Widhe and Widhe found that when bone sarcomas were identified on radiographs, the ra- diographs had usually been ordered to assess for more common pathologies such as fractures.7 Existing studies have found it difficult to correlate the delays in diagnosis and manage- ment with worse prognoses, as more aggres - sive tumors are usually diagnosed before less aggressive ones.13,14 However, when metastases are due to a delayed diagnosis, earlier detec- tion would increase survival and the possibility of limb-saving procedures.7,16 Also, as treat- ment modalities improve, the speed of diagno- sis may play a more important role in patient prognoses. 17 Study limitations The size of our study population was limited by the rarity of the diseases studied. As well, the patient journey maps created from BCCH records do not reveal the emotional and physical tolls that delays have on patients and their fami - lies, which can be inferred but not quantified from the time depicted between health care encounters. Despite these limitations, the study findings still point to the importance of iden-tifying bone tumor cases sooner. Recommendations While the early diagnosis of a bone sarcoma is difficult, we believe that increased aware- ness could reduce delays. General practitioners should be aware that bone sarcoma patients typically present with localized chronic inter-mittent pain at the age of 13 to 16 years. The onset of the pain may follow a minor traumatic injury to the region with the sarcoma. Moreover, as Widhe and Widhe note, the post-trauma pain history of bone sarcoma patients is atypical because the pain from trauma seems to resolve over several days only to return in a more pro- gressive and severe form. Nocturnal pain should increase suspicion.15 General practitioners conducting physi- cal examinations should look for a tender soft tissue mass that is firmly fixed to the underly-ing bone, even though in the majority of cases these masses are not palpable on a patient's first visit.7 Common sites for osteosarcoma in order of prevalence the is the recom- mended first step in the workup when bone tu- mors are a possibilty.19 Goedhart and colleagues suggest that delays in care could be reduced if general practitioners lower the threshold at which they order plain radiographs.13 If the radiograph findings are negative but suspicion remains high, a CT or MRI scan is warranted. The definitive diagnosis is made after biopsy, but it can be accurately predicted by considering clinical features with imaging results.12 Summary General practitioners should further consider bone sarcomas in the differential diagnosis for chronic localized pain, especially when patients are in the at-risk age group and the pain is localized to one of the common sites. Practi- tioners should be even more suspicious if there is a history of nocturnal pain, an atypical pain pattern following minor trauma, or a soft tissue mass on examination. In accord with Goedhart and colleagues, we recommend that general practitioners consider lowering the threshold at which they order plain radiographs.

As I washed my hands I noted the in- structions above the sink encouraging hand washing to prevent influenza and other infec- tious diseases, and then I turned to leave. To exit the washroom I had to pull on the handle of a heavy metal door. Being familiar with the saying that the doorknob is the second-dirtiest part of the washroom, I pondered my options for a germ-free exit. I quickly discounted the window; it was too high. Instead, I resolved to use local materials to escape. As there were no paper towels, I used toilet paper to make a glove with which to grab the door handle. I pulled the door open\u2014wide enough to allow me to exit with a graceful pir - ouette\u2014and carried on my way. As I drove away I wondered about the slow adoption of new building standards that eliminate the touching of shared surfaces. Awareness of the role that urban design plays in disease prevention is hardly new. Fa-mously, in 1854 English physician John Snow demonstrated that an outbreak of cholera in London was attributable to water drawn from a single well. At the time, sewage was carried in street gutters or pits scattered around resi- dential areas, leading to fecal contamination of drinking water. The subsequent adoption of piping systems that brought clean water directly into houses is recognized as a landmark example of how This article is the opinion of the Environmental Health Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.proper urban design can reduce contagion. Sim - ilarly, an important tool in the fight against tuberculosis was the provision of adequate in- door ventilation.1 Reduction of infectious diseases is not the only health benefit that can be achieved with proper design of living spaces and communities. Urban design can be used to promote active trans- portation, access to shade, opportunities for social interaction, clean air, and many other benefits. While much of the progress in preventing infections has come from providing clean air and water, the role of fomites (objects that are touched by multiple people) is another factor. In some instances, the role of fomites is clear: we don't reuse needles or tongue depressors because of the obvious risk of trans- mitting disease. There are a host of pathogens that can be deposited on surfaces, then trans- mitted to whoever else touches that surface. E. Coli, Streptococcus, MRSA, yeast, norovirus, and influenza are all examples. When it comes to colds and flu, however, the role of fomites is somewhat less clear. 2 Although studies have demonstrated the ability to recover viruses from surfaces (espe- cially nonporous surfaces) days after initial de- position,3 the recovery of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily mean that those surfaces are a significant source of transmission, and good ventilation, personal spacing, and hand washing may be the mainstay of preventive measures. Nevertheless, given the evolving state of un- derstanding of the role that touched surfaces play in the spread of COVID-19 (let alone the other pathogens that are present), policies that promote environmental hygiene are thought to be justified.4It is fair to ask whether we have done enough in our buildings to limit the risks posed by everyday objects. Doorknobs, light switches, toilet handles, faucet knobs are all unbiquitous, but are they necessary? Researchers in Singapore studied COVID-19 patients' living spaces and found that the virus was present on toilets, sinks, door han- dles, and light switches.5 Current events will place more focus on opportunities to design washrooms and other living spaces in ways that reduce surface contacts. Motion-sensing light switches, doors that swing outward on exit, self-flushing toilets, pedal- operated sinks, and sensor-triggered hand dry- ers are all options that offer ways to make the built environment a bigger ally in the reduction of disease. n \u2014lloyd opp el, M d ref erences 1.

Multimorbidity has been one of the most complex phe- nomena in health care sys- tems around the world in recent times. It affects all age groups, but a geriatric focus in health research is prominent owing to high- er prevalence among old- er adults.1 Moreover, the co-occurrence of multiple diseases leads to greater chances of complications and greater severity compared to single diseases, and the combined burden of multimorbidity and the health care resources required to manage it may be much greater than the sum of single diseases. 2,3 Due to Canada's aging population, multi- morbidity is increasingly becoming a key public health and primary care issue in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.4 Cana- dian adults 20 years and older who were sur-veyed with a list of nine self-reported chronic conditions had a multimorbidity prevalence of 12.9% in 2011/12.3 BCCDC's recent analy- sis of 16 chronic diseases, as defined in BC's chronic disease registries, showed nearly one third (28.6%) of BC residents 20 years or older had multimorbidity (2+) in 2014/15.2 Another Canadian study using data for five conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, mental illness, hypertension, and diabetes) with Measuring multimorbidity to support chronic disease management and prevention This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.nationally validated case definitions revealed multimorbidity prevalence rates of 26.5% and 24.8% in Canada and BC, respectively, in 2011/12.5 While these Canadian and BC prevalence rates are substantial, a fixed set of well-defined chronic con- ditions is needed, along with use of a standardized surveillance methodology to improve measurement of multimorbidity that would consistently in- form practice, program, and policy planning.4 Recently we intro- duced an indicator mea- suring multimorbidity prevalence2 in individuals living with two or more chronic conditions from a list of 16 chronic diseases listed in chronic disease registries. The indicator is intended for use in health surveillance on a periodic ba- sis to support management and prevention of chronic diseases in BC. The chronic diseases with identified case definitions5,6 selected for the multimorbidity indicator are: Asthma Chronic kidney disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Dementia Diabetes Epilepsy Heart failure Hospitalized stroke Hypertension Ischemic heart disease Mood and anxiety disorders Multiple sclerosis Osteoarthritis Osteoporosis Parkinsonism Rheumatoid arthritis The age-standardized prevalence rate of multimorbidity among individuals having two or more chronic diseases is calculated for the indicator. The measurement is expected to en-hance our understanding of the epidemiology of multimorbidity to inform prevention efforts, reduce disease burden, and align health care services with holistic patient needs.4 This also underscores the importance of monitoring mul- timorbidity to provide insights to broaden our mindset of single disease-centric approaches to management of chronic disease in the primary care setting and prevention as part of public health. Furthermore, the risk and protective fac- tors and socioeconomic determinants of health associated with most chronic conditions indi-vidually are common but can be tackled con- sidering multimorbidity as a composite disease entity for planning upstream prevention. n \u2014dr ona rasali, Ph d, FaC e BCC d C, Provincial Health Services authorit y (PHS a) \u2014 Crystal l i, MSc BCC d C, PHS a \u2014 Caren r ose, Ph d BCC d C, PHS a , u BC School of Population and Public Health ref erences 1.

Public health officials have instructed us to practise social distancing, stay home, avoid crowds, and refrain from touching one another. In 1963, when Edward Hall, a cultural an- thropologist, coined the term proxemics to define studies about social distancing in everyday life, nobody thought that a virus, 100 times smaller than even a bacterium, would make human closeness a big problem. Hall's concern was that closer distances between two persons may increase visual, tactile, auditory, or olfactory stimulation to the point that some people may feel intruded upon and react negatively. Today we are worried about becoming exposed to a viral attack. Hall proposed four main zones of space between individuals: Intimate d istance (le ss t han h alf a m etre), s uch as in giving or receiving a hug. Personal d istance ( about 1 m etre), u sually r eserved for family or good friends. Social distance (2 to 3 metres), when meeting strangers. Public d istance ( more than 5 metres), such as in public presentations. Under ordinary cir- cumstances, the interper- sonal distance chosen by people depends on atti- tudes toward each other, as well as gender, age, and even climate. In addition, \"contact cultures\" use closer interpersonal dis- tances and engage in more touching; \"noncon- tact cultures\" exhibit opposite preferences. In ordinary times the amygdala is suspected of processing strong reactions to violations of so- cial spaces. Now we are facing compulsory social distancing beyond the amygdala and proxemics. We are ordered by public health authorities to create distances between households, neighbor- hoods, cities, and even countries. Overall, people are resilient to short-term social distancing, although individuals who al- ready have problems with loneliness, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, or other health issues are likely to be vulnerable to even more problems. In the short run, understanding the purpose of prolonged isolation and having pride in being a good citizen by following the advice of professionals may help. A 2015 study suggested that long-term so- cial isolation (in the absence of a threat like the current viral infection) increased the risk of mortality by 29% for people with chronic conditions such as heart disease, depression, and dementia. There are no studies about the unintended side effects of enforced long-term social dis- tancing. Confinement of families with chil - dren may result in unexpected interpersonal tensions. The physical closeness may exacer- bate domestic violence. Missing the coping mechanisms provided by the emotional expe- riences of sporting or artistic events, or reli- gious ceremonies, may be a problem for many people. Anxiety about finances secondary to job losses and the interrup- tion of schooling are only part of a predictable rise in mental health prob- lems. And this is only a short list of what a submi- croscopic lifeless protein can do when it burrows itself into the cells of our body to copy and copy and copy itself, multiply- ing to wreak havoc in our lives, and even kill us. n Suggested reading Kennedy DP , Gl\u00e4scher J, Tyszka JM, Adolphs R.

Follow-up of living kidney donors: A call for collaboration Kidney donation in British Columbia is on the rise,1 and that means the number of kidney donors in the province who require routine or specialized follow-up is becoming increasingly prevalent. While donors are chosen because of their excellent health status, after kidney dona- tion, these individuals require medical vigilance to keep them in optimal health. According to a recent environmental scan, the majority of kidney transplant programs in Canada do not have standardized donor follow-up. In BC, the current informal model relies heavily on family physicians to follow kidney donors on an annual basis to ensure that their basic kidney health parameters are satisfactory. If health concerns arise, the fam-ily physician will either manage the condition or, if necessary, refer the donor to a specialist. The Vancouver Transplant Nephrologists and Canadian Blood Services have teamed up to improve and standardize the care and follow-up of people who donate a kidney. Our strategy to have the best possible medical care for kidney donors in the months and years after donation will be achieved through education and col- laboration. Our collaborative efforts include stakeholder engagement with family physicians, kidney donors, and the care teams involved in living kidney donation. We are seeking input from and partner - ship with physicians who either have kidney donors under their care, or have an interest in the care of kidney donors. Your involvement in the initiative can range from singular input to continuous participation.

Digestive symptoms present in mild COVID-19 disease, sometimes without fever A preprint study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology suggests patients with new-onset digestive symptoms after a possible COVID-19 contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or fever. This is the first analysis of gastrointestinal symptoms reported by COVID-19 patients with mild disease rather than those with moder- ate or critical illness and finds a unique subgroup with low-severity disease marked by presence of digestive symptoms, most notably diarrhea. The authors from Union Hospital and Tongji Medical College in Wuhan, China, report that among some of the patients included in the study, these digestive symptoms, particularly diarrhea, were the presentation of COVID-19, and were only later, or never, present with respi - ratory symptoms or fever. The study represents the 80% or more of patients who do not have severe or critical disease. This is about people in the community struggling to determine if they might have COVID-19 because of new-onset diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. The analysis included 206 patients with low- severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the two groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom about one in five expe - rienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of over 5 days and a frequency around four bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62% of patients with a digestive symptom, mean- ing that nearly one-third did not have a fever. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16 day vs 11 day delay, P < 0.001). Authors concluded: Digestive s ymptoms a re c ommon i n the community, and most instances of new-onset diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or low appetite are not from COVID-19. Nonetheless, c linicians s hould r ecognize that new-onset, acute digestive symptoms in a patient with a possible COVID-19 contact should at least prompt consideration of the illness, particularly during times of high COVID-19 incidence and prevalence. Failure t o r ecognize t hese p atients e arly a nd often may lead to unwitting spread of the disease among outpatients with mild illness who remain undiagnosed and unaware of their potential to infect others. The data in this study highlight the presence and features of this subgroup of COVID-19 patients and should be confirmed in larger international studies. The preprint study, \"Digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity: Psychological PPE: Peer support beyond COVID-19 In response to physicians' growing concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Physi- cian Health Program (PHP) has launched a virtual peer-support group available to all BC physicians. Peer-to-peer connections promote shared learning, resiliency, and hope. Weekly sessions are co-facilitated by psychiatrist Dr Jennifer Russel and manager of clinical services Roxanne Joyce. To be as accessible and physician-centred as possible, the sessions are drop-in with no commitment required. The focus is peer support, not psychiatric care, and all participants have the option to join anonymously. Conversations so far have explored wellness, work-life balance, pressures of working within COVID-19, acknowledging feelings of helplessness and anger, mindfulness, breathing strategies, working with limited PPE, and more. Many have also shared moments of joy and inspiration. The PHP program of BC helps physicians, resident doctors, and medical students, as well as their families. When doctors and their families reach out for support, we are there to understand their situation, to support, and to advocate, both individually and collectively, as they strive to improve their mental and physical health.

Researcher Dr Brodie Sakakiba- ra, who is affiliated with the Rehabilitation Research Program at the GF Strong Reha - bilitation Centre, sought to discover possible connections between lifestyle and the devel- opment of cardiometabolic multimorbidity. Ultimately, individuals with little-to-no physi- cal activity and high stress levels have greater odds of acquiring two or three cardiometabolic conditions. The research is published in BMC Public Health and highlights the critical need to bet-ter understand how individuals progress from having one to two or all three conditions and how to prevent such a decline in health.

Possible role for voice analysis in telemed and patient care The need for telemedicine has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic for cardiac patients suf- fering from congestive heart failure who want to avoid contracting the highly contagious virus. Published recently in the Journal of the American Heart Association , a study led by Dr Elad Maor of Sheba Medical Center in Israel, in collabora- tion with the Mayo Clinic, uses telemedicine voice recognition technology to assess patients' risk for heart failure from the comfort of their own homes. Using voice-processing techniques, audio recordings can identify high-risk patients, allowing telemedicine centres to allocate more resources to these individuals. Dr Maor ex- pects the technology to be available for use in risks without inhibiting progress? When do we choose evolution and when do we choose revo- lution to address persistent problems through disruption? We must ask ourselves: Can we be more nimble and less risk adverse? How do we open the door to culture change in health care? What's stopping us?

Continued from page 128 knowledge translation are vital for scalability and positive societal impact of technology so- lutions. Multisectoral collaboration is essential to address gaps and choose digital health solu- tions wisely. In the digital age, health professionals are more than knowledge purveyors; they are in- terpreters of information. Let's use this oppor- tunity to build relationships with our patients and not sacrifice the humanity in health care in favor of medical technocracy. Health profes- sional training must emphasize digital health and how to use it to build relationships with patients. Patients and family caregivers need to bring their lived experience to all aspects of digital health transformation.

How do we take calculated 141 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020141worksafeB c Concussion is considered to be a rela- tively benign injury with an expected full recovery within 4 weeks; however, up to 20% of those diagnosed with a concussion will experience ongoing symptoms and related disability. These delayed or incomplete recover- ies are associated with heightened emotional distress, loss of or impaired function, and an inability to return to preinjury work levels. In 2017, WorkSafeBC had over 2700 claims accepted for concussion. Approximately 50% of workers with a concussion injury returned to work within 2 weeks; however, up to 35% experienced greater than 12 weeks of work dis- ability after their injury. While there are currently no gold-standard treatment protocols for concussion, evidence shows that early education, reassurance, and resumption of normal activities are associated with improved outcomes. New early concussion management program The Early Concussion Assessment and Treat- ment (ECAT) program is a new Work S afeBC- sponsored health care program designed to support injured workers in BC. A network of 26 providers has been established to deliver the ECAT program across BC. The Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation Guidelines for Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Persistent Symptoms1 was used as a primary resource. Additionally, the program was designed in collaboration with physical therapists, occupational therapists, neu- ropsychologists, and physicians with expertise in concussion management. ne w wor kSafeBC early concussion and assessment program This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.The ECAT program provides early as- sessment, education, reassurance, and inter - vention, when indicated, for injured workers with confirmed or suspected concussions. The ECAT program is delivered by a treatment team consisting of an occupational therapist and a physical therapist. During the intake assessment, the occupa- tional therapist will identi- fy cognitive, psychosocial, and vocational barriers that interfere with daily activities, while the physi- cal therapist will complete a musculoskeletal and vestibular assessment. Education, support, and reassurance are embedded in the assessment process, and the team develops a treatment plan in collabo- ration with the injured worker. The intake re- port, which includes the clinical findings and treatment plan, is sent to the injured worker's primary care physician. Treatment options can be customized to an injured worker's unique clinical needs for up to 6 weeks, and may include: Phone s upport f or a n i njured w orker w ho h as remained job attached or has a plan in place for return to work. Return-to-work s ervices i ncorporating job site visits and return-to-work planning, implementation, and monitoring. Structured r ehabilitation w ith c linic-based treatment for an injured worker who has safety-sensitive jobs or barriers that must be addressed before returning to work. These services may also include community inte - gration or group sessions. The ECAT program is rooted in evidence- based practice and provides education, support, and reassurance to injured workers within weeks of sustaining their injury, with the goal of sup- porting recovery of function and a safe, sustain- able return to work. The ECAT program also aims to identify injured workers who demon- strate signs of potential chronicity so that they can receive comprehensive assessment and treatment. How to access the program for your patient Primary care physicians play an important role in identifying and manag- ing injured workers with concussions. We encour- age collaboration and communication with the ECAT program to provide consistent messag- ing, guidance, and reassurance to help injured workers feel positive and safe in their recovery. Participation in the ECAT program requires a referral from a WorkSafeBC officer. Physi- cians can support this process by identifying appropriate patients on the Physician's Report (Form 8/11). For further information about the ECAT program and other WorkSafeBC programs, please contact a WorkSafeBC medical advisor at any WorkSafeBC office. n \u2014luisa Johns , BSc, PT ref erence 1.

He trained in general surgery in the celebrated program at the University of Alberta, finishing in 1966. He met his wife, Betty, while doing a year of surgical training in St. John's, Newfoundland, in 1963. She describes him as charming and humorous. They have four children\u2014Michele, Scott, Cindy, and Craig. I met Jim in 1966 when I started an intern- ship at the University of Alberta Hospital. Jim was just finishing as chief resident in surgery and was going to Cold Lake, Alberta, until he completed the fellowship exams in the fall. In 1969 I met Jim again when I started a 6-year stint in general practice in Kitimat, BC. Most of Jim's professional life was spent there, and he was an indispensable member of the medical community. He was available 24/7 to carry out a wide variety of surgical procedures, includ- ing cesarean sections, and he would volunteer to help out the GP covering emergency if the workload was excessive. Jim also introduced me to curling. Jim was the skip at a rink that was all, or nearly all, Going homeThe end of a dayAnd we're on the wayOver the hillIn the still hazeOf setting sun, work donephysicians. Thanks to his patient teaching style and a rather busy playing schedule, I managed to learn the game and we often did well. Some- times two members of the team would be called simultaneously to emergencies, so we would have to forfeit, but we could play one man short and still do well. Jim d ied i n Q uesnel, B C, o n 2 F ebruary 2020. Those of us privileged to have worked, played, sung, and curled with Jim cherish the time we spent with him. We extend our love and sympathy to his wife, Betty, and their children. \u2014ian l. Macdonald, M d, F rCPC Vancouver dr M axwell (Max) Schultz 1923-2020 Dr Maxwell Schultz died on 16 February 2020 in South Delta, BC. Dr Schultz was a Northern Ontario boy (Thessalon, if you know the area), adventurous soul, debater (usually switching tacks 180 degrees at some point just to stir things up), jokester with a wicked sense of humor, lover of nature, raconteur, masterful sketcher, skier, horseback rider, occasional calf rounder-upper, anesthesiologist, and generous loving dad and family man. He graduated from Queen's Univ ersity (MD 1946) just as the war ended. He was a member of the accelerated wartime class of Meds '47, which completed 6 years of medical school in just 4\u00bd years. Ini- tially a lumber company doctor in Kapuskasing, Ontario, then a GP in Thunder Bay, he then (to quote him) shoved off for an adventure out west. He was one of the first to train in anesthesia at Vancouver General Hospital. There he stayed, enjoying working with his colleagues and the staff in the Associated Anaesthesia Service and the nurses and orderlies and shepherding thousands of patients through their operations with skill and kindness. Max is remembered as a marvellous colleague. He never made anyone feel bad about asking for advice and was always eager to help. He was a superb anesthesiologist. His sense of humor was unparalleled. While he maintained his roots and ties to the east and his family, Max loved the west\u2014the mountains, where he taught himself and his kids to ski, the hikes, the trails for horseback riding, and the ocean for boating. Max is pre-deceased by his wife, Anne, and leaves behind to mourn and miss and be thankful for him his five children, eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. \u2014Karen Schultz, M d, C CFP , FCFP Kingston, on tario143 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020143DrOP-IN COVID -19 P hySICIAN PEE r S u PPO rT SESSIONS O nline (Tue & Thu) Effective Tuesday, 7 April, the BC Physician Health Program (PHP) is offering free drop-in Physician Peer Support Sessions every Tuesday and Thursday from 4-5 p.m. PST via Zoom.

Several times a year, the BCMJ presents a theme issue devoted to a particular discipline or disease entity. We welcome letters, blog posts, articles, and sci- entific papers from physicians in British Columbia and elsewhere. Manuscripts should not have been submitted to any other publication. Articles are subject to copyediting and editorial revisions, but authors remain responsible for statements in the work, including editorial changes; for accuracy of references; and for obtaining permissions. The cor- responding author of scientific articles will be asked to check page proofs for accuracy. The BCMJ endorses the \"Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals\" by the Inter- national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (updated December 2016), and encourages authors to review the complete text of that document at www.icmje.org.

The general criteria for acceptance include accuracy, relevance to practising BC physicians, validity, originality, and clarity. The editor contacts authors to inform them whether the paper has been rejected, conditionally accepted (that is, accepted with revisions), or accepted as submitted. Authors of letters are contacted only if the letter is accepted and editorial staff need further information. Scientific papers and other articles typically take 5 to 10 months from the date of receipt to publication, depending on how quickly authors provide revisions BCMJ Guidelines Guidelines for authors and on the backlog of papers scheduled for publica- tion. Manuscripts are returned only on request. The BCMJ is posted for free access on our website. For all submissions Avoid unnecessary formatting, as we strip all for- matting from manuscripts. Double-space all parts of all submissions. Include your name, relevant degrees, email ad dress, and phone number. Number all pages consecutively. Opinions BCMD2B (medical student page).

I don't need to be early; the clinical skills staff set up the room the day be- fore. The gowns, robes, and drape sheets are set out, as are the tissue, lubricant, paper trays, and prostate models. Three sizes of gloves are in the dispensers on the wall. The anatomical charts are in place. Everything is ready. I wait patiently for the male clinical teaching associ- ate (MCTA) whom I'll be working with, the students, and the tutor to arrive. Thursday mornings: My experience as a practising patient Helping medical students on their path to becoming physicians. ed M artin, B a Originally from San Diego, California, Mr Martin earned his BA in history from San Diego State University before spending 9 years in Japan teaching English conversation. Currently a flight attendant for a major US carrier, Mr Martin enjoys hiking on Vancouver's North Shore and attending the Vancouver Symphony in his free time. This article has been peer reviewed.As I change out of my street clothes into a robe, I recollect how it is that I've come to be here on a Thursday morning to help instruct second-year medical students on how to per- form the male genital and urinary exam. If someone had told me 3 years ago that this is how I would be spending some of my Thursday mornings, I wouldn't have believed them. The teaching aspect isn't new to me\u2014I spent 9 very interesting, productive years in Japan teaching English as a foreign language prior to becoming a flight attendant\u2014but I never thought of myself as being particularly good at science. Yet life is full of opportunities and challenges that you'd never expect. One September day in 2009 I was read- ing an article in Maclean's about a new way of interviewing potential medical students.1 Rather than placing candidates before a panel of three, the new multiple mini-interview (MMI) process moved the candidates through up to 12 different interviewers who would evaluate them as they answered a short, specific ques-tion or interacted with an actor. The questions have no right or wrong answer. Candidates excel by demonstrating how well they think on their feet and deal with ethical, moral, or other dilemmas. The interviewers are drawn from a pool of volunteers from a cross-section of society\u2014doctors, other health care providers, academics, and members of the general public. Something intrigued me about this process and the prospect of helping select the next class of medical students. Shortly after reading the article, I contacted the University of British Columbia's Faculty of Medicine to ask if they used the MMI and if I could contribute some- how. I was happy to learn that they did, and I was placed on a list of potential interviewers for 2011. On a Friday evening in February 2011, I joined a group of fellow interviewers for our training session. Our role was explained clear- ly, as were the logistics. And did it ever run smoothly! In my whole working career, I'd never felt better looked after or supported. It was a remarkable experience that inspired me to re-turn year after year. As for the substance of the interviews, I cannot share any questions (they remain con-fidential), but I can tell you that they are chal- lenging on many levels for the candidate and the 151 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 4 | MAY 2020151Back pa G e interviewer. Speaking with bright, enthusiastic, and, yes, nervous young people does give one hope. They show a strong desire to help their fellow humans and burn with idealism that gives reason to be hopeful for the future. Following my first year of interviewing, a co-chair of the writing group asked me to join the group of academics, clinicians, and members of the public who devel- op the questions that are posed to the applicants in the MMI. Attending the editorial meetings in which the writers present and discuss their ideas is one of the most in- teresting and intellectually challenging things I have ever done. Ideas are examined from every angle with one goal in mind: will an interviewer be able to fully assess a candidate if a certain question is asked? During one of my writing group meetings I learned about the standardized patient (SP) program. Making up an eclectic group of people of all ages and backgrounds but populated with a large number of actors, SPs play the role of patients in teaching situations and clinical skills exams. Roles can involve a patient's history, a physical exam, or a mix of the two. Guided by a talented group of trainers, SPs are well prepared in training sessions for the case they are ex- pected to present. The standardized part comes from the need to have multiple actors playing a certain patient role the same way so that each student in a large class can have a similar expe- rience. I've had fun playing various roles as an SP , each one teaching me about a large range of medical conditions, some of which I would not have otherwise known about. But what gives me the greatest satisfaction is being part of a team of dedicated people working to help train the physicians of tomorrow. Ready in my robe, I open the door of the clinical skills room and the first of eight second-year students arrives. We make small talk while the others file into the room. It's early September, and the academic year has just started. I smile to myself as I overhear the students' excited conversations about their recent experiences shadowing physicians in their offices and the procedures they've observed or patients they interviewed. They are gain- ing skills and experience gradually from both simulated and actual patients, and learning how complex people really are, physically and emotion- ally. I am pleased to hear how focused they are to do their best and learn as much as they can. Beyond wanting to acquire skills and knowledge, I also see their interest in the expe- riences of their fellow stu- dents. I take this as a good sign that a team-based ap- proach to medicine is developing. As a potential future patient, I couldn't be happier. The last student and the tutor (physician) arrive, so our Thursday morning begins. The tutor and I have worked together many times, so we are accustomed to each other's teaching style. We start with a demonstration of the exam for the students as it is performed on a patient. The tutor gives a brief explanation as an introduction to the rest of the teaching session. Once the demonstration is over, we divide into two groups: four students with two MCTAs per room. The tutor moves between the rooms to answer students' questions that go beyond the MCTA's curriculum. I am joined by a fellow MCTA; we have worked together before. We start with some general information about the exam\u2014the use of chaperones, glove size options, and how to set up supplies so the exam will move smoothly. Then we move on to the exam itself. One of the four students volunteers to go first. I can see the nervousness as they begin examining me, but it passes quickly as I explain how to perform the exam step by step and guide the student to first observe, then palpate for the appropriate structures in a systematic way. The curriculum stresses the importance of check- ing in with the patient by looking directly at their face for signs of discomfort. I use this part of the curriculum to assess the student's level of understanding. As we proceed, the student gains confidence, and by the end of the session all show a level of proficiency. When it comes time for them to perform the exam on a patient, they will be ready. Thursday mornings are now a favorite part of my week. Helping young medical students on their path to becoming a physician is a great honor. Throughout my involvement as an inter- viewer and writer for the MMI, I've also come to appreciate the care and attention given by the Faculty of Medicine to every part of the work they do, and I'm honored to be involved. I dedicate this essay to the memory of my fellow MCTA, Mr Alex Wong, and medical school tutor, Dr Richard Wadge. n ref erence 1. M illar E. Let's all play doctor.
