To quote Nicki herself, [yikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOVxwVvUe_c). It started when Minaj [responded](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437509201228492800?s=20) to a tweet lamenting the rapper's lack of public appearances over the past year. \"I have an infant with no nannies during COVID,\" she wrote. \"Not risking his health to be seen.\" A fine and understandable response! Then, Minaj proceeded to say she got [COVID while prepping for the VMAs](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437525002123808772?s=20) and begun posting a series of strange tweets espousing a range of [COVID conspiracies and misinformation](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/anti-vaxx-conspiracy-theory-covid-vaccine.html). \"They want you to get vaccinated for the Met,\" she tweeted. \"If I get vaccinated it won't [be] for the Met. It'll be once I feel I've done enough research.\" She also said that Drake told he contracted COVID after being vaccinated. It is true that the COVID-19 vaccine, like other vaccines, is not 100% effective at preventing infection. However, your chances of contracting coronavirus after receiving the vaccine drop to around [one in 5,000,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/briefing/risk-breakthrough-infections-delta.html) according to a recent report from the New York Times. When one person responded to Minaj's tweets saying the vaccine [ helps prevent more serious symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html), she responded, \"Babe. That's not true. I had the exact same symptoms as ppl with the damn vaccine.\" This overlooks the fact that the vaccine helps keep people who contract COVID out of already [overcrowded hospitals](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/19/1029378744/hospital-beds-shortage-covid-coronavirus-states). Additionally, a new CDC report found that [unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die of COVID](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/10/moderna-most-effective-covid-vaccine-studies/) than those who are vaccinated. Perhaps her strangest claim is was that a friend of a relative became impotent after getting vaccinated. \"My cousin in Trinidad won't get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent,\" she [tweeted](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441?s=20). \"His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding.\" There is currently no evidence to support any link between the [COVID-19 and infertility](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57552527). The notion that the [vaccine causes miscarriages](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983?articleTools=true) or leads to [erectile dysfunction](https://sbuhb.nhs.wales/coronavirus-covid-19/information/vaccine-in-swansea-and-npt/covid-19-vaccinations-three-minute-myth-buster/covid-19-vaccinations-myth-buster/myth-6-the-vaccines-cause-impotence-in-men/) is rooted in misinformation. However, some early studies suggest that [ contracting coronavirus could lead to erectile dysfunction](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210513/coronavirus-lingers-in-penis-and-could-cause-impotence#1) and impotence. She did later walk back her stance on the vaccine a bit, saying that [she would likely get vaccinated](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437534182117306368?s=20) when she goes on tour. She also [posted a poll](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437543611717931009?s=20) on which vaccine people would recommend. (Pfizer is currently in the lead, if Twitter polls are the kind of peer research you require.) Ultimately, Minaj said does not care about anti-vax speculation on The Blogs \u2014 this one included, I'm assuming. \"Who cares what blogs gon do?\" she [wrote](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437528562836258817?s=20). \"This my real fkn life. They can choke.\" There are rumors of [other unvaxxed celebs](https://www.gawker.com/celebrity/blind-items-met-gala-2021) missing the Met Gala or procuring [fake vaccine cards](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/08/anti-vax-influencer-charged-with-selling-fake-vax-cards.html) in order to attend. Hopefully, these are just rumors given the over [650,000 people in the U.S. who have died](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) from coronavirus to date. God/Rihanna forbid this year's Met "}
