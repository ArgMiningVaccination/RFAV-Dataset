It is an adaptation of a report published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine 2000;161:S221 -S247.vi MMWR June 9, 2000Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 1 Targeted Tuberculin Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection This Official Statement of the American Thoracic Society was adopted by the ATS Board of Directors, July 1999. This is a Joint Statement of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This Statement was endorsed by the Council of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), September 1999, and the sections of this Statement as it relates to infants and children were endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), August 1999. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This statement provides new recommendations for targeted tuberculin testing and treatment regimens for persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and updatespreviously published guidelines ( 1,2). This statement is issued in recognition of the importance of these activities as an essential component of the TB Elimination Strat-egy promoted by the U.S. Public Health Service Advisory Council on the Elimination ofTuberculosis, and reports the deliberations of expert consultants convened by theAmerican Thoracic Society (ATS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Isoniazid for 6-12 mo has been the mainstay of treatment for LTBI in the United States for more than 30 yr. However, the application of isoniazid for LTBI has beenlimited because of poor adherence, due to the relatively long duration of treatmentrequired, and because of concerns about toxicity. Therefore, there has been interest inthe development of shorter, rifampin-based regimens as alternatives to isoniazid forthe treatment of LTBI. During the past decade, a series of studies of \"short-course\"treatment of LTBI in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection hasbeen undertaken. The results of these trials have recently become available, and the in-depth analyses of these and prior studies of isoniazid form the scientific basis of thetreatment guidelines presented in this report. In addition, many changes to previousrecommendations regarding testing for and treatment of LTBI are presented (Table 1). Targeted Tuberculin Testing Targeted tuberculin testing for LTBI is a strategic component of tuberculosis (TB) control that identifies persons at high risk for developing TB who would benefit bytreatment of LTBI, if detected. Persons with increased risk for developing TB includethose who have had recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and those who have clinical conditions that are associated with an increased risk for progression ofLTBI to active TB ( see Tables 2 and 3). Following that principle, targeted tuberculin testing programs should be conducted only among groups at high risk and discour-aged in those at low risk. Infected persons who are considered to be at high risk fordeveloping active TB should be offered treatment of LTBI irrespective of age. Based on the sensitivity and specificity of the purified protein derivative (PPD) tu- berculin skin test and the prevalence of TB in different groups, three cut-points havebeen recommended for defining positive tuberculin reaction: /G17910 mm, /G17915 mm of induration ( see Table 7). For persons who are at highest risk for developing active TB if they are infected with M. tuberculosis (i.e., persons with HIV infection, who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, who have had recent close contact withpersons with infectious TB, or who have abnormal chest radiographs consistent withprior TB), /G1795 mm of induration is considered positive. For other persons with an in- creased probability of recent infection or with other clinical conditions that increase therisk for progression to active TB, /G17910 mm of induration is considered positive. These include recent immigrants (i.e., within the last 5 yr) from high prevalence countries;injection drug users; residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (includ-ing health care workers with exposure to TB); mycobacteriology laboratory personnel;persons with clinical conditions such as silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal fail-ure, leukemias and lymphomas, carcinoma of the head or neck and lung, weight loss of/G17910% ideal body weight, gastrectomy, and jejunoileal bypass; and children younger than 4 yr of age or infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high-riskcategories. For persons at low risk for TB, for whom tuberculin testing is not generallyindicated, /G32/G17915 mm of induration is considered positive. Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection In this report, treatment recommendations use an adaptation of the rating system from recent U.S. Public Health Service documents ( 3) that grades the strength of the recommendation (A, B, or C) and the quality of evidence supporting the recommenda-tion (I, II, or III). Four regimens are recommended for the treatment of adults with LTBI.( See Tables 8 and 10 for detailed recommendations, dosages, and contraindications.) The isoniazid daily regimen for 9 mo is recommended because prospective, ran- domized trials in HIV-negative persons indicate that 12 mo of treatment is more effec-tive than 6 mo of treatment. However, in subgroup analyses of several trials the maxi-mal beneficial effect of isoniazid is likely achieved by 9 mo, and minimal additionalbenefit is gained by extending therapy to 12 mo. When compared with placebo, both 6-mo and 12-mo regimens are effective in HIV-positive patients; however, these regi-mens have not been compared with each other in randomized trials. Although a 9-mo regimen of isoniazid is the preferred regimen for the treatment of LTBI, a 6-mo regimen also provides substantial protection and has been shown to besuperior to placebo in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive persons.

Thus, based on local conditions, health departments orproviders may conclude that a 6-mo rather than a 9-mo course of isoniazid is preferred. Both the 9-mo and 6-mo isoniazid regimens may be given intermittently (i.e., twice weekly). When isoniazid is given intermittently, it should be administered only as di-rectly observed therapy (DOT). The 2-mo daily regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide is recommended on the basis of a prospective randomized trial of treatment of LTBI in HIV-infected persons thatshowed the 2-mo regimen to be similar in safety and efficacy to a 12-mo regimen ofisoniazid. Twice-weekly treatment with rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 or 3 mo maybe considered when alternative regimens cannot be given. This intermittent regimenshould always be administered as DOT. Some experts recommend that the 2-mo regi-men of daily rifampin and pyrazinamide also be given by DOT, which can consist of fiveobserved and two self-administered doses each week. In situations in which rifampincannot be used (e.g., HIV-infected persons receiving protease inhibitors), rifabutin maybe substituted.Table 1.

This option may be especially useful for patients who cannot tolerateisoniazid or pyrazinamide. Before beginning treatment of LTBI, active TB should be ruled out by history, physi- cal examination, chest radiography, and, when indicated, bacteriologic studies. Special considerations for treatment of LTBI apply to the following populations: GWhen isoniazid is chosen for treatment of LTBI in persons with HIV infection or those with radiographic evidence of prior TB, 9 mo rather that 6 mo isrecommended. GFor pregnant, HIV-negative women, isoniazid given daily or twice weekly for 9 or 6 mo is recommended. For women at risk for progression of LTBI to disease,especially those who are infected with HIV or who have likely been infectedrecently, initiation of therapy should not be delayed on the basis of pregnancyalone, even during the first trimester. For women whose risk for active TB islower, some experts recommend waiting until after delivery to start treatment. GFor children and adolescents, isoniazid given either daily or twice weekly for 9 mo is the recommended regimen. GFor contacts of patients with isoniazid-resistant, rifampin-susceptible TB, rifampin and pyrazinamide given daily for 2 mo is recommended, and forpatients with intolerance to pyrazinamide, rifampin given daily for 4 mo isrecommended. GFor persons who are likely to be infected with isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant (multidrug) TB and who are at high risk for developing TB, pyrazinamide andethambutol or pyrazinamide and a ofloxacin) for6-12 mo are recommended. Immunocompetent contacts may be observed ortreated for at least 6 mo, and immunocompromised contacts (e.g., HIV-infectedpersons) should be treated for 12 mo. Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring Once patients have been identified and then tested for LTBI, they should receive an initial clinical evaluation. They should also receive follow-up evaluations at leastmonthly (if receiving isoniazid alone or rifampin alone) and at 2, 4, and 8 wk (if receiv-ing rifampin and pyrazinamide). This evaluation should include questioning about sideeffects and a brief physical assessment checking for signs of hepatitis. Patients shouldbe educated about the side effects associated with treatment of LTBI and advised tostop treatment and promptly seek medical evaluation when they occur. Baseline laboratory testing is not routinely indicated for all patients at the start of treatment for LTBI ( see Table 8). Patients whose initial evaluation suggests a liver disor- der should have baseline hepatic Baseline testing isalso indicated for patients with HIV infection, pregnant women, and women in theVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 5 immediate postpartum period (i.e., within 3 mo of delivery), persons with a history of chronic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B or C, alcoholic hepatitis, or cirrhosis), personswho use alcohol regularly, and persons at risk for chronic liver disease. Baseline testingis not routinely indicated in older persons. However, such testing may be consideredon an individual basis, particularly for patients who are taking other medications forchronic medical conditions. Active hepatitis and end-stage liver disease are relativecontraindications to the use of isoniazid or pyrazinamide for treatment of LTBI. Routine laboratory monitoring during treatment of LTBI is indicated for persons whose baseline liver function tests are abnormal and other persons at risk for hepaticdisease. Laboratory testing may also be indicated for the evaluation of possible ad-verse effects that occur during the course of treatment (e.g., liver function studies forpatients with symptoms compatible with hepatotoxicity or a uric acid measurement toevaluate complaints of joint pain). Some experts recommend that isoniazid should bewithheld if transaminase levels exceed three times the upper limit of normal ifassociated with symptoms and five times the upper limit of normal if the patient isasymptomatic. INTRODUCTION History of Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection and Relevance to Tuberculosis Control For more than three decades, treatment of persons with latent Mycobacterium tu- berculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent the development of active disease has been an essential component of tuberculosis (TB) control in the United States (4 ). In the UnitedStates and other countries with a low incidence of TB, most new, active cases haveoccurred among persons who were once infected, contained this infection, and thenlater developed active TB (5 ). The identification and treatment of infected persons athighest risk for developing disease benefit both infected persons and susceptible per-sons in their communities. Until recently, isoniazid was the only drug proven effectiveand thus recommended for treatment of LTBI. Shortly after isoniazid was found to be effective for the treatment of TB, clinical trials were begun to assess the ability of the drug to prevent progression of primarydisease in children. When it was found that this intervention was highly effective, largertrials were begun to evaluate the drug for treatment of infected contacts of TB patientsand of other persons at high risk (e.g., those with radiographic evidence of prior, un-treated TB) ( 6). In 1965, isoniazid treatment of LTBI was first recommended for general use by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) ( 7). This initial statement recommended isoniazid for persons with evidence of previously untreated TB and persons with recenttuberculin skin test conversions, including all children younger than 3 yr of age with apositive tuberculin skin test. In 1967, ATS and PHS broadened the recommendations toinclude all persons who had had a purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin-testreaction of /G17910 mm. The recommendations stated that chemoprophylaxis is manda- tory for a) persons with inactive cases of TB who were not previously treated and theircontacts, b) persons with tuberculin skin test conversions, c) persons with specifiedmedical conditions, and d) all persons younger than 20 yr of age who had had positive6 MMWR June 9, 2000 tuberculin skin tests ( 8). With widespread use of such an inexpensive drug that had \"virtually no side effects,\" it was believed that \"chemoprophylaxis [could] reduce fu-ture morbidity from TB in high risk groups by some 50 to 75 percent\" ( 8). However, despite this belief, the goal of reducing TB morbidity by such a substantial percentage through the administration of isoniazid was never reached. In 1970, amongseveral thousand persons who began isoniazid treatment as a result of an outbreak ofTB on Capitol Hill in the District of Columbia, 19 persons developed clinical signs ofliver disease and two persons died of hepatic failure attributed to isoniazid ( 9). The recognition that isoniazid was associated with potentially fatal hepatitis led to the de-velopment of guidelines regarding pretreatment screening and monitoring to mini-mize the risk for severe complications ( 10). In 1974, following a study to quantify the risk for isoniazid-related hepatitis ( 11), guidelines for treatment of LTBI were updated. The revised guidelines excluded low-risk persons aged older than 35 yr of age as can-didates for treatment ( 12). Subsequent controversy over the appropriate age cut-off for these low-risk, tuber- culin-positive persons ensued, with one group concluding that the risks of treatment ofLTBI outweighed the benefits for young adults ( 13). This controversy and resulting confusion led to a decrease in the use of isoniazid for treating persons with LTBI\u2014evenpersons at high risk for whom treatment was indicated ( 14). In 1983, the guidelines were further revised to recommend routine clinical and laboratory monitoring for per-sons aged older than 35 yr of age and other persons at risk for hepatotoxicity ( 15). Recent studies have suggested that since the advent of routine monitoring, the risk forsevere hepatotoxicity has been substantially reduced ( 16). Because widespread use and the potential impact of isoniazid treatment of LTBI became limited by actual and perceived toxicity and patient nonadherence because ofthe relatively long period of treatment required, alternatives to isoniazid were sug-gested ( 17). The introduction of rifampin, which appeared to be a better sterilizing agent than isoniazid, suggested the possibility that rifampin-based regimens might besafer, more effective, and shorter. The occurrence of the human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) epidemic and the need to evaluate the efficacy of treatment for LTBI in per-sons coinfected with HIV and M. tuberculosis led to a series of studies of short-course treatment of LTBI in HIV-infected persons ( 18). The results of these studies have re- cently become available and have contributed substantially to guidelines on treatmentof LTBI in persons with HIV infection ( 3). Relationship of Tuberculin Testing to Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection As the rate of active TB in the United States has decreased, identification and treat- ment of persons with latent infection who are at high risk for active TB have becomeessential components of the TB elimination strategy promoted by the PHS AdvisoryCouncil on the Elimination of Tuberculosis ( 19). Because testing persons for infection and provision of treatment are interrelated, these recommendations include sectionson program activities aimed at identifying high-risk infected persons and tuberculinskin testing, as well as recommendations on the use of new, short-course treatmentregimens.Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 7 Change in Nomenclature Identification of persons with LTBI has previously been accomplished by widespread tuberculin skin testing of individuals or groups at variable risk for TB. In many situa-tions, this screening was done with limited consideration of the risk for TB in thepopulation(s) being tested. To focus on groups at the highest risk for TB, the term \"tar-geted tuberculin testing\" is used in these guidelines to encourage directed programactivities. Although the terms \"preventive therapy\" and \"chemoprophylaxis\" have been used for decades, they have also been confusing. \"Preventive therapy\" has referred to theuse of a simple regimen (usually isoniazid) to prevent the development of active TBdisease in persons known or likely to be infected with M. tuberculosis , but it rarely results in true primary prevention (i.e., prevention of infection in persons exposed topersons with infectious TB). To describe the intended intervention more accurately, thisreport uses the terminology \"treatment of LTBI\" rather than \"preventive therapy\" or\"chemoprophylaxis.\" This change in nomenclature will hopefully promote greater un-derstanding of the concept for both patients and providers, resulting in more wide-spread implementation of this essential TB control strategy. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE Targeted Tuberculin Testing Groups at Risk and Risk Factors for Infection with M. tuberculosis Targeted tuberculin testing for LTBI identifies persons at high risk for TB who would benefit by treatment of LTBI, if detected. Persons at high risk for TB (i.e., risk substan-tially greater than that of the general U.S. population) have either been infected re-cently with M. tuberculosis or have clinical conditions that are associated with an in- creased risk of progression of LTBI to active TB (Tables 2 and 3). Screening of low-riskpersons and testing for administrative purposes (e.g., certification of school teachers)should be replaced by targeted testing. Persons or groups with presumed recent M. tuberculosis infection . Persons infected with M. tuberculosis are at greatest risk for developing disease shortly after infection has occurred (Table 2). In two controlled trials examining the efficacy of treatment ofLTBI among contacts of persons with active TB and among patients in mental hospitals,the tuberculin skin tests of 1472 participants in the placebo groups of the trials con-verted from negative to positive. Among persons whose tests converted, 19 developeddisease in the first year of follow-up (12.9 cases per 1000 person-years) compared with17 persons in the subsequent 7 yr of follow-up (1.6 cases per 1,000 person-years) ( 6). In a study of TB vaccines given to British schoolchildren, 2550 unvaccinated participants'tuberculin skin tests converted. Of these, 121 (4.7%) developed clinical TB within 15 yrof entry into the study: 54% developed disease during the first year after infection and82% developed disease within 2 yr of infection ( 20). In designing and planning targeted testing programs, several groups of persons can be identified as being at increased risk for being recently infected with M. tubercu- losis . A high prevalence of either LTBI or active TB has been documented among close8 MMWR June 9, 2000 contacts of persons with infectious pulmonary TB ( 21); both of these characteristics are likely attributable to recent contact with infectious persons. Likewise, persons whosetuberculin skin tests convert from negative to positive within a period of 2 yr are pre-sumed to have been infected recently. Persons who have immigrated from areas of the world with high rates of TB have incidence rates that approach those of their countries of origin for the first several yearsafter arrival in the United States ( 22). This high rate likely results from infection with M. tuberculosis in the native country before immigration and progression to disease soon after arrival in the United States. This hypothesis is supported by a) DNA fingerprintingstudies with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) interpreted to correlatewith low rates of recent transmission of TB among foreign-born case patients in theUnited States ( 23) and b) other data indicating that with time, the incidence of TB in foreign-born persons declines to approach that of the U.S. population ( 24). Children, especially those younger than 5 yr of age, who have a positive tuberculin skin test are likely to be in the early stage of LTBI and are at high risk for progression toactive disease, with the potential for disseminated TB ( 25). The risk for developing active TB is also increased in adolescents and young adults ( 25). Recent U.S. studies (including RFLP studies) have helped characterize certain epide- miologically defined groups of persons with high rates of TB transmission and increasedrisk for being recently infected (e.g., homeless persons, those with HIV infection, andinjection drug users) ( 23,26 ). In addition, persons who reside or work in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, andresidential homes for patients with AIDS [ 27]) with persons at risk for TB may have an ongoing risk for acquiring TB infection. However, the risk for transmission varies greatly,and the likelihood that a specific institution is a site of transmission of M. tuberculosis can be determined only by local epidemiological data. Clinical conditions associated with progression to active tuberculosis. HIV infection contributes most to an increased risk for progression of LTBI to active TB. Rates ofTable 2.

In a prospective cohort study of persons with HIV infection in the United States, the annual risk of active-TB among persons witha positive tuberculin test was 45 cases per 1000 person-years ( 29). Injection drug users also have an increased risk for progressing to active TB (10 cases per 1000 person-years) ( 30), and this risk is even greater for injection drug users coinfected with HIV and TB (76 cases per 1000 person-years) ( 31). These higher rates may reflect increased transmission, more recent infection in this population, and the increased risk associ-ated with injection drug use and HIV infection. The risk for active TB is also increased in a) persons with pulmonary fibrotic lesions seen on chest radiographs (presumed to be from prior, untreated TB) and b) under-weight persons. Persons with fibrotic lesions on chest radiographs consistent with prior,healed TB have a risk for progression to active 2.0-13.6 per 1000 person-years ofobservation ( 32-34 23,541 U.S. Naval recruits with tuberculin reactions /G17910 mm demonstrated that recruits who were /G17915% underweight from the standard weight for their height had a risk of progression to disease that was twofold that ofpersons who were within 5% of the standard weight for their height and more thanthreefold that of persons who were overweight ( 35). Studies indicate that several other clinical conditions increase the risk for active TB, although participants in these studies were not stratified by tuberculin-test status (Table3). Table 3.

Persons with diabetes mellitus have a risk for developing active TB that is twofold to fourfold greater than persons without diabetes mellitus, and this risk is likely greaterin persons with insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes ( 42-44 ). Other clinical conditions that have been associated with active TB include gastrectomy with atten-dant ( 51,52 ) transplantation, carcinoma of the head or neck ( 53), and other neo- plasms (e.g., lung cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia [ 54]). Persons receiving prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and other immunosup- pressive agents may be at risk for reactivation of TB, but the exact risk is unknown ( 1).10 MMWR June 9, 2000 Because prednisone lower doses or those given intermittently are not associated with TB, this dose is likely the lower limit that could predispose persons todevelop TB ( 57). Reactivation of TB is more likely to occur in persons receiving higher doses of corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, especially in populations at highrisk for TB, but specific thresholds of dose and duration that could increase the risk forTB are unknown ( 58). Persons who use alcohol may be at increased risk for acquiring or developing TB, but given the many other potential risk factors that commonly occuramong such persons, alcohol use has been difficult to identify as a separate risk factorfor TB ( 2,42,59,60 ). Operational Considerations In A Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Tuberculosis in The United States , pub- lished by CDC in 1989 ( 61), the responsibility for detection and treatment of LTBI in high-risk groups was assigned directly to public health agencies. At that time, the ad-ministration of skin tests, interpretation of test results, and intensive follow-up requiredto ensure adherence with and to prevent side effects of isoniazid treatment were be-lieved to be beyond the scope of most private health care providers. However, in 1995, CDC published recommendations on targeted testing and treat- ment of LTBI that emphasized the importance of health departments in assisting localproviders in the development, implementation, and evaluation of TB screening pro-grams appropriate for their communities ( 2). This recommendation was based on the recognition that changes in the organization, delivery, and financing of health care inthe United States have led to most routine tuberculin testing being done outside of thepublic health system ( 62). For example, populations that previously received clinical services, including diagnosis of LTBI, at public health clinics are now increasingly beingenrolled as members of managed care organizations. Because health departments might lack access to high-risk populations and the re- sources necessary to undertake targeted testing programs, the participation of otherhealth care providers is essential to ensure the successful implementation of commu-nity efforts to prevent TB in high-risk groups. Community sites where persons at highrisk may be accessed and where targeted testing programs have been evaluated in-clude neighborhood health centers ( 63), jails ( 64), homeless shelters ( 65), inner-city ( 66), methadone ( 67) and syringe/needle-exchange programs ( 68), and other community-based social service organizations ( 69). Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Tuberculin Skin Testing The tuberculin skin test is the only proven method for identifying infection with M. tuberculosis in persons who do not have TB disease. Although the available tuberculin skin-test antigens are <100% sensitive and specific for detection of infection with M. tuberculosis , no better diagnostic methods have yet been devised. Proper use of the tuberculin skin test requires knowledge of the antigen used (tuberculin), the immuno-logic basis for the reaction to this antigen, the technique(s) of administering and read-ing the test, and the results of epidemiologic and clinical experience with the test. De-tailed information on these topics is provided in the ATS/CDC Statement Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children (70).Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 11 Immunologic basis for the tuberculin reaction . Infection with M. tuberculosis pro- duces a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to certain antigenic components (tuber-culins) that are contained in extract of culture filtrate of the organism. Purified proteinderivative (PPD) tuberculin, which is used for most skin testing, is isolated from culturefiltrate by protein precipitation. The reaction to intracutaneously injected tuberculin is a delayed-type (cellular) hy- persensitivity (DTH) reaction, and infection by M. tuberculosis usually results in a DTH response to PPD tuberculin that is detectable 2-12 wk after infection (71 ). However, aDTH reaction to PPD tuberculin may also indicate infection with various nontuberculousmycobacteria or vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), to tuberculin usually 5-6 h after injection, reach a maximum at 48-72 h, andsubside over a period of a few days, although positive reactions often persist for up to1 wk ( 72). Sensitivity and specificity of skin-test reactions . Knowledge of tuberculin-test sensi- tivity and specificity, as well as positive predictive value, is required to interpret skin-test reactions properly. For persons with LTBI and normal immune responsiveness, testsensitivity approaches 100% ( 73). However, false-positive tuberculin tests occur in per- sons who have been infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria and in persons whohave received BCG vaccine. These false-positive reactions result in a lower specificityand a low positive predictive value in persons who have a low probability of LTBI. Thegeneral U.S. population currently has an estimated M. tuberculosis infection rate of 5- 10%, and children entering school in many areas of the country have a 0.1-1% preva- lence of infection. Even if the test has a specificity approaching 99%, testing of persons in such low-prevalence groups would result in most positive tests being false-positivetests ( 71). However, the specificity of the test is also dependent on the criterion used to define a \"positive\" test. The specificity can be improved by progressively increasingthe reaction size that separates positive from negative reactors (at the expense of de-creasing test sensitivity) ( 73). Previous BCG vaccination . Intracutaneous inoculation with BCG is currently used in many parts of the world as a vaccine against tuberculosis. Tuberculin reactivity causedby BCG vaccination generally wanes with the passage of time but can be boosted bythe tuberculin skin test. Periodic skin testing may prolong reactivity to tuberculin invaccinated persons ( 74). No reliable method has been developed to distinguish tuber- culin reactions caused by vaccination with BCG from those caused by natural myco-bacterial infections, although reactions of /G17920 mm of induration are not likely caused by BCG ( 75). HIV infection and anergy testing . HIV-infected persons may have a compromised ability to react to tuberculin skin tests because of cutaneous anergy associated withprogressive HIV immunosuppression ( 76). However, the usefulness of anergy testing in selecting tuberculin-negative, HIV-infected persons who might benefit from treat-ment of LTBI has not been demonstrated ( 77). Chest Radiographs In persons with LTBI, the chest radiograph is usually normal, although it may show abnormalities suggestive of prior TB. Previous, healed TB can produce various radio-graphic findings that usually differ from those associated with active TB. Dense pulmo-nary nodules, with or without visible calcification, may be seen in the hilar area or12 MMWR June 9, 2000 upper lobes. Smaller nodules, with or without fibrotic scars, are often seen in the upper lobes, and upper-lobe volume loss often accompanies these scars. Nodules and fibroticlesions of previous, healed TB have well-demarcated, sharp margins and are oftendescribed as \"hard.\" Bronchiectasis of the upper lobes is a nonspecific finding thatsometimes occurs from previous pulmonary TB. Pleural scarring may be caused byprior TB but is more commonly caused by trauma or other infections. Nodules andfibrotic scars may contain slowly multiplying tubercle bacilli with substantial potentialfor future progression to or basal pleural thickening pose a lower risk for future progres-sion to active TB. Sputum Examinations The presumptive diagnosis of active pulmonary TB is often made on the basis of microscopic examination of a stained sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Confir-mation of the diagnosis usually requires identification of M. tuberculosis in culture. In asymptomatic persons with normal chest radiographs, AFB are rarely seen on sputumsmear examination, and tubercle bacilli are not found in cultures of respiratory speci-mens. However, some HIV-infected persons with sputum culture-positive TB have beendescribed as having normal chest radiographs. Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Isoniazid Experimental studies . Before clinical trials of isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI were begun in the United States, its efficacy was demonstrated in guinea pigs. In a studyconducted by PHS, guinea pigs receiving varying doses of isoniazid were challengedwith virulent tubercle bacilli ( 78). Those animals receiving a daily dosage of at least 5 mg/kg were protected (i.e., survival was comparable to control animals who were notchallenged with the bacillus). On the basis of these studies, the dose of 5 mg/kg waschosen for clinical studies in humans. Clinical trials in HIV-negative persons . Many randomized, controlled clinical trials of isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s ( 6). These trials were conducted in seven countries, both industrialized and developing, and in-volved more than 100,000 participants at risk for TB, including children with primaryTB, contacts of active case patients, persons who had had tuberculin skin reactions,institutionalized patients with mental disease, and persons with inactive TB. Most stud-ies compared 12 mo of isoniazid with placebo. The outcomes measured in these stud-ies included progression of primary TB, tuberculin conversion in uninfected contacts,prevention of TB in infected persons, and recurrence of disease. The effectiveness oftreatment, as measured by the decrease in TB among all persons participating in thesetrials, varied from 25 to 92%. However, when analysis was restricted to persons whowere compliant with the medication, the protective efficacy was approximately 90%.Substantial protection was conferred even if pill taking was irregular but sustained,suggesting the possibility that intermittent treatment may be efficacious. Only one trial, conducted by the International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) ( 32), was designed to evaluate various durations of isoniazid. In this trial, a placeboVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 13 regimen was compared with isoniazid regimens lasting for 3, 6, and 12 mo among persons with fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with inactive TB. The 5-yr incidencerates of tuberculosis were 1.43% for placebo compared with 1.13, 0.50, and 0.36% forthe 3-, 6-, and 12-mo regimens, respectively (Table 4). The rates indicated a 65% effec-tiveness for the 6-mo isoniazid regimen and 75% effectiveness for the 12-mo regimen;persons who received 6 mo of isoniazid had a 40% higher risk for TB compared withthose who received 12 mo of therapy.

The difference in the two regimens is magnified when study subjects who received \"almost all\" of the monthly drug allotments for their scheduled duration of therapy andwho were believed to have taken /G17980% of the medication each month were compared. In this subgroup, which constituted 78% of the entire study population, the resulting 5-yr incidence rates were 1.5% for persons receiving placebo compared with 1.0, 0.5, and0.1% for the 3-, 6-, and 12-mo regimens, respectively. In this analysis, isoniazid takenfor 6 mo was 69% efficacious and for 12 mo was 93% efficacious; participants on the 6-mo regimen had a fourfold higher risk for TB than those on the 12-mo regimen. Al-though the incidence of TB was similar for persons with small lesions (<2 cm 2) as- signed the 6-mo and 12-mo regimens, such persons were less adherent to treatment.The 12-mo regimen provided a substantial reduction in risk compared with the 6-moregimen among compliant persons with small lesions (Table 4). Additional information on the efficacy and effectiveness of different lengths of therapy with isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI has been derived from a randomizedstudy of household contacts conducted by PHS (21 ). Among persons believed to havetaken /G17980% of their assigned medication during the months they took isoniazid, those who took medication for at least 10 mo experienced a 68% reduction in TB (Table 5). In14 MMWR June 9, 2000 contrast, among persons who took /G17980% of the medication for <10 mo, only a 16% reduction in the TB rate occurred. The same data can be further examined to determinewhether reduction in the rate of TB was affected more by duration of therapy or theamount of medication. The effectiveness of isoniazid decreased slightly for less com-pliant patients who took 40-79% of the prescribed medication during the 10-mo period(52-57% reduction compared to 68% reduction), suggesting that even an intermittenttreatment regimen would be effective if taken for at least 10 mo (Table 5). In a community-based study conducted in Bethel, Alaska ( 79), persons who took <25% of the prescribed annual dose had a threefold higher risk for TB than those who took /G17950% of the annual dose. However, a more recent analysis of study data indicated that the efficacy decreased significantly if <9 mo of isoniazid was taken (Figure 1) ( 80). Effectiveness data from the IUAT study, published data on isoniazid-associated hepa- titis, and cost information obtained from a survey of U.S. TB programs were used toassess the cost effectiveness of various durations of isoniazid ( 81). The cost per case of TB prevented with the 6-mo regimen was determined to be half of the cost as either the3-mo or 12-mo regimens. This cost-effectiveness analysis was largely responsible forthe widespread adoption of the 6-mo regimen of isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI inHIV-seronegative persons with normal chest radiographs ( 82). However, the protection conferred by taking at least 9 mo of isoniazid is greater than that conferred by taking 6mo; it is not likely that further protection is conferred by extending the duration oftreatment from 9 to 12 mo ( 80). Clinical trials in HIV-positive persons . Seven randomized, controlled trials have evalu- ated different regimens for the treatment of LTBI infection in persons with HIV infection(Table 6). Five of these studies evaluated isoniazid regimens using comparison groupsthat either received a placebo or were not actively treated. In the first study, conducted in Haiti during 1986-1992, 12 mo of daily isoniazid re- sulted in a substantial reduction in TB (83%) among tuberculin-positive persons ( 83). Protection was constant over the 4 yr of follow-up after treatment. Two other studies,which evaluated 6 mo of isoniazid taken daily by tuberculin-positive persons, had dif-fering results: the drug provided a significant level of protection in Uganda (68%) ( 84) but did not provide a significant level of protection in Kenya (40%) ( 85). A fourth study evaluated a 6-mo, twice-weekly regimen of isoniazid in both tuberculin-positiveTable 5.

Although the level of protection among tuberculin-positive personswas higher (70%), it was not significant because of the limited number of persons inthis group. The Uganda study also evaluated the 6-mo regimen of daily isoniazid in anergic persons, as did the fifth study conducted in the United States ( 87). In both studies, the level of protection against TB was low, and neither study demonstrated a significantlevel of protection. Additional evaluations of isoniazid were conducted in tuberculin-negative persons who were not assessed for anergy ( 83,85,86 ). The level of protection provided by iso- niazid among this population was not significant in any of the studies. Thus, for HIV-infected persons, treatment should be targeted at tuberculin-positive persons. A re-cently published metaanalysis of these trials supports this conclusion ( 88). Safety and tolerability . In 1965, when isoniazid was first recommended in the United States for treatment of LTBI, it was not thought to cause severe toxicity. In the PHSstudies conducted among TB contacts, the percentage of persons stopping treatmentbecause of suspected drug reactions was low and approximately equivalent for theplacebo and isoniazid groups ( 21). The occurrence of hepatitis was rare and was not assumed to be caused by isoniazid. However, studies conducted in the late 1960s16 MMWR June 9, 2000 suggested that isoniazid did cause hepatitis and indicated that asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases occurred among persons receiving the drug ( 89). It was not until the 1970s, when several persons receiving isoniazid for LTBI died from hepatitis,that the likelihood of isoniazid hepatitis was understood ( 9). The largest and most comprehensive study of isoniazid hepatitis was conducted by PHS during 1971-1972 ( 11). In this survey, nearly 14,000 persons who received iso- niazid were monitored for the development of hepatitis. The overall rate of probableisoniazid hepatitis was 1%, but it was age related, with no cases occurring among per-sons younger than 20 yr of age and the highest rate (2.3%) occurring among personsolder than 50 yr of age. An association of hepatitis also was found with alcohol con-sumption, with rates being fourfold higher among persons consuming alcohol dailythan among those who did not drink alcohol. Rates among males and females wereTable 6.

Hepatitis rates were lower among participants inthe IUAT trial, although the same positive association with age was observed ( 32). In the PHS surveillance study, eight deaths from hepatitis occurred among the partici-pants, seven of which were among persons living in Baltimore. Several years aftercompletion of the study, a review of death certificates showed a marked increase indeaths from cirrhosis during 1972 in Baltimore and surrounding counties, suggestingthat another cofactor may have been associated with the cluster of deaths observed inthe study ( 90). A comprehensive analysis of deaths from isoniazid-associated hepatitis in the United States found that women may be at increased risk of death ( 91). Other reports have suggested that the risk for isoniazid-associated hepatitis may be increased by the ad-ministration of the drug to pregnant women in the third trimester and the immediatepostpartum period ( 92) or by the concomitant administration of acetaminophen ( 93). Although experimental evidence suggests that acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is po-tentiated by isoniazid ( 94), a more detailed study of deaths from isoniazid-associated hepatitis did not implicate acetaminophen as a factor ( 95). Isoniazid-related deaths continue to be reported. However, the likelihood of this oc- currence can be greatly reduced by careful monthly monitoring and stopping of medi-cation if symptoms occur ( 96). In a recent study, seven of eight patients receiving a liver transplant following the development of fulminant, isoniazid-related hepatitis con-tinued to take the drug for a least 10 d after onset of symptoms of hepatotoxicity ( 97). Following the PHS surveillance study, guidelines on the use of isoniazid for the treat- ment of LTBI were revised to recommend that low-risk persons older than 35 year of age with reactive tuberculin skin tests not be treated, that no more than 1 mo drugsupply be issued at a time, and that monthly questioning and education about signsand symptoms of hepatitis should be routine ( 12). The guidelines were further revised to recommend baseline and periodic liver-function tests for persons at risk for hepato-toxicity, including persons aged 35 yr of age or older ( 15). More recently, a survey found that many public health TB clinics now use clinical, rather than biochemical, monitoring for hepatotoxicity during treatment of LTBI ( 98). Clinical monitoring is based on educating patients about the symptoms of hepatotoxic-ity and instructing them to stop treatment immediately if such symptoms occur and toreport to the clinician for evaluation. After using clinical monitoring exclusively, onepublic health TB clinic reported only 11 cases of clinical hepatotoxicity (one of whichrequired hospitalization) and no deaths among more than 11,000 persons with LTBIduring isoniazid treatment over a 7-yr period ( 99). Based on this emerging experience with clinical monitoring, some authorities have called for the establishment of newrecommendations for drug toxicity monitoring \"that are congruent with establishedtherapeutic/toxicity relationships\" ( 98). Recent studies of LTBI in HIV-infected persons have demon- strated that the medication was well tolerated and not associated with substantial in-creases in hepatic side effects. In a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials,adverse drug reactions were slightly but not significantly more common among per-sons receiving isoniazid ( 88). Despite the high efficacy and relative safety of isoniazid treatment for LTBI, its use has been frequently debated; much literature has been published regarding whetherand when to prescribe isoniazid ( 13,100-102 ). However, because the arguments18 MMWR June 9, 2000 embodied in that literature emerged more than two decades ago, in a different envi- ronmental context with different risks and contingencies, its appropriateness to cur-rent circumstances is uncertain. Although the likelihood that a patient treated with isoniazid would develop hepatitis was low, it presented a valid argument against the use of isoniazid among persons whohad no increased risk for developing active TB. Most of the arguments concerning theuse of this drug, which appeared from the 1970s through the early 1980s, focused onpersons at low risk for reacting to tuberculin, primarily those 35 yr of age or older whowere likely at higher risk for isoniazid-associated hepatitis than younger patients. Because the debate over whether to prescribe or withhold isoniazid for persons older than 35 yr of age at low risk for reacting to tuberculin involved a trade-off be-tween risk for developing active TB versus risk for developing isoniazid-induced hepa-titis, decision analysis was used by most investigators ( 103). Despite many analyses, the decision to treat persons at low risk for reacting to tuberculin at any age continuedto be controversial. Although various analyses supported both sides of the debate,none of the calculated benefits of isoniazid was substantial. Short-course Regimens Experimental studies in animals . Because of high rates of nonadherence with the long duration of isoniazid (i.e., 6-12 mo) and the rare occurrence of fatal isoniazid hepa-titis, short-course, rifampin-containing treatment regimens have recently been evalu-ated. The studies evaluating rifampin were based on data from several studies in mousemodels of chronic TB. One study compared isoniazid ( 104). The rifampin-only regimen sterilized lung and spleen tissues within 4 mo, and the combina-tion of rifampin and pyrazinamide sterilized tissues within 2 mo. The isoniazid, rifampin,and pyrazinamide regimen was of intermediate efficacy, taking longer than the rifampinand pyrazinamide regimen to sterilize tissues. The isoniazid regimen had not sterilizedtissues by the end of 6 mo. The apparent superiority of the rifampin-pyrazinamide regimen over the regimen containing the same two drugs plus isoniazid might be explained by impaired absorp-tion of rifampin when given simultaneously with other drugs in mice ( 105). Support for this hypothesis came from a study using a Cornell mouse model ( 106) that compared 6-wk regimens of rifampin, rifampin-isoniazid, rifampin-pyrazinamide, and rifampin-pyrazinamide-isoniazid, with delayed administration of rifampin when given with otherdrugs. The efficacy of all three regimens was similar, with trend toward a lower colonycount in spleens of animals given more drugs, and lower colony counts in the lungs ofmice given rifampin-isoniazid. Experimental studies have also suggested that rifabutinalone, taken daily, and rifabutin-isoniazid, taken twice weekly, may effectively treatLTBI in 3 mo ( 107). Clinical trials in HIV-negative persons . The only randomized clinical trial to evaluate rifampin-containing regimens among HIV-seronegative persons was conducted in tu-berculin-positive persons with silicosis in Hong Kong ( 36). In this study, daily regimens of 6 mo of isoniazid, 3 mo of rifampin, or 3 mo of isoniazid and rifampin were comparedwith a 6-mo placebo control. Analyzing only those patients who were assumed to becompliant yielded an estimate of efficacy in preventing TB of 63% for the 3-mo rifampinregimen, 48% and 41% for the 3-mo isoniazid-rifampinregimen. All of these differences were significantly different from the placebo regimenVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 19 but were not statistically different from each other. The annual incidence rate was about 7% per year in the placebo group and about 4% per year in the three active-treatmentregimens combined. The largest programmatic experience using rifampin-based treatment of LTBI comes from Blackburn, England, where children at increased risk of TB have been treated withdaily rifampin-isoniazid since 1981 ( 108). During 1981-1996, the treatment duration was shortened from 9 to 3 mo, and the proportion of pediatric TB case patients as apercentage of all reported cases decreased from 25 to 4%. Although not a controlledclinical trial, these data suggest that this intervention has been highly effective in re-ducing the rate of childhood TB in this city. Thus, this regimen is currently recommendedfor the treatment of both adults and children with LTBI in the United Kingdom ( 109). Clinical trials in HIV-positive persons . Most clinical trials of rifampin-based treat- ment of LTBI have been conducted among HIV-infected persons (Table 6); two wereplacebo controlled. The Uganda study also evaluated regimens of isoniazid-rifampinand isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide taken daily for 3 mo in tuberculin-positive per-sons ( 84). The isoniazid-rifampin regimen provided 59% protection, and the three- drug regimen with pyrazinamide provided 57% protection\u2014levels similar to thoseprovided by 6 mo of isoniazid alone. The Zambia study also evaluated a self-adminis-tered regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide taken twice weekly for 3 mo ( 86). The level of protection was 42%, similar to that conferred by the 6-mo, twice-weekly iso-niazid regimen. Among tuberculin-positive persons, the level of protection conferredby rifampin and pyrazinamide was 70%, comparable with that conferred by 6 mo ofisoniazid taken twice weekly, but not statistically significant. In two trials, rifampin and pyrazinamide regimens have been compared with regi- mens of isoniazid alone in tuberculin-positive persons. A second study conducted inHaiti during 1990-1994 compared twice-weekly regimens of 6 mo of isoniazid and 2 moof rifampin and pyrazinamide, with half of the doses directly observed ( 110). Protec- tion at 12 mo was similar in the two groups, and, compared with the rate of TB ob-served among patients who received placebo in the earlier Haiti trial, the twice-weeklyregimens were estimated to have reduced the risk for TB by approximately 80%. Amultinational study comparing a 12-mo regimen of isoniazid taken daily with a 2-moregimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide taken daily was conducted in the United States,Haiti, Brazil, and Mexico ( 111). A total of 1583 patients were enrolled and followed for an average of 3 yr. The annual risk of culture-confirmed TB was 0.8% for patients as-signed the 2-mo 1.1% for patients assigned the 12-mo isoniazid regimen,a difference that was not significant. In conclusion, as evidenced by the large multinational study, a 2-mo regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide taken daily provides protection against TB equivalent to a12-mo regimen of isoniazid taken daily. The data supporting the use of a twice-weeklyrifampin and pyrazinamide treatment regimen are less conclusive. The only study thathas evaluated a rifampin-alone regimen, the Hong Kong study in persons with silicosis,suggests that daily rifampin for 3 mo provides similar protection to that conferred from6 mo of isoniazid ( 36). In the Uganda study, 3-mo regimens of isoniazid and rifampin and b) isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide provided protection equivalent to that of6 mo of isoniazid ( 84). All of the studies of treatment of LTBI in HIV-infected persons included death and/or progression of HIV disease as endpoints. In the earlier Haiti study, isoniazid likely con-ferred protection against progression of HIV disease among tuberculin-positive20 MMWR June 9, 2000 subjects ( 83). In the multinational study, persons receiving the 2-mo regimen had lower mortality rates and less progression of HIV disease, although these differences werenot statistically significant ( 111). In none of the other studies was active treatment protective against death or HIV progression. Safety and tolerability . Before the conduct of the studies in HIV-infected persons, a pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability of short-course regimens was ). Participants were random- ized to receive either 2 mo of rifampin and pyrazinamide, 4 mo of rifampin only, or 6 moof isoniazid. The rifampin-pyrazinamide regimen was associated with a higher numberof AST elevations of >100 IU (17 compared with only one in the rifampin group and fivein the isoniazid group) and more frequent adverse reactions resulting in drug discon-tinuation (15 compared with none in the rifampin group and two in the isoniazid group).The rates of adverse reactions and abnormal AST elevations were higher than thosereported in studies involving HIV-positive populations and those described in a clinicaltrial of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for the treatment of active TB inHIV-seronegative persons ( 114). Two smaller pilot studies of rifampin and pyrazinamide treatment of LTBI using identical protocols were conducted in adults in Poland ( 115) and children in Germany (116). The results of the study in Poland were similar to those in the study in North America; the children in Germany tolerated the regimens well and did not experiencechanges in hepatic function. In the Hong Kong study of patients with silicosis, no significant differences were noted in the occurrence of severe adverse reactions in the three drug regimens studied ( 36). However, patients receiving isoniazid had a higher incidence of abnormal liver function tests during treatment. In the clinical trials involving HIV-infected persons, a trend of increased adverse reactions occurred among persons taking a daily regimen that included pyrazinamide.The Uganda study reported that persons taking the three-drug, pyrazinamide-containing regimen had higher rates of paresthesias, arthralgias, and significant in-creases in serum AST ( 84). The multinational study reported minimal increases in the number of persons receiving the 2-mo rifampin and pyrazinamide regimen who hadthe drugs permanently discontinued, most commonly because of nausea and vomitingand narcotic withdrawal ( 111). However, abnormal liver function tests were more com- mon among patients taking isoniazid. In the Haiti study conducted during 1990-1994 and the Zambia study, regimens of twice-weekly rifampin and pyrazinamide were well tolerated. In the Haiti study, no se-vere adverse reactions were observed; rates of abnormal liver function were low(1-3%) and did not differ by regimen ( 110). In the Zambia study, 3% of persons given isoniazid stopped treatment because of an adverse reaction compared with 4% of thosegiven rifampin and pyrazinamide ( 86). Biochemical hepatitis was more frequent in the isoniazid group, whereas rash was more common in persons receiving rifampin andpyrazinamide. Adherence Testing for and treating LTBI requires several steps, including administering the test, reading the test, medically evaluating infected persons, initiating treatment, andcompleting therapy. Because persons with LTBI are not clinically ill and may not beVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 21 motivated to undergo treatment, nonadherence occurs commonly in all steps of the treatment process. The health care system can compromise patient adherence to testing and treatment of LTBI ( 117). A lengthy referral process may discourage patients from being evaluated for a positive tuberculin test or initiating treatment for LTBI. Long waiting times in theclinic may also discourage patients from attending follow-up visits. Other factors thatmay affect adherence with testing and treatment include the clinic's hours of operation,distance of the clinic from the patient's home, the cleanliness of the clinic, and theattitude of clinic staff. Since the advent of effective chemotherapy for active TB, adherence to treatment regimens has been recognized as a substantial problem for TB control\u2014especially fortreatment of LTBI. Recent data reported to CDC indicate that only 60% of patients whostart treatment for LTBI complete at least 6 mo of treatment (CDC, TB Program Manage-ment Reports); adherence is influenced by the length of therapy, complexity of theregimen, and side effects of the medications. Adherence to treatment decreases withtime, whereas the efficacy of the regimen increases with the length of therapy ( 32). Patients may be more adherent to the 2-mo regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamidebecause of the shorter length of therapy; however, this regimen also involves takingmultiple medications, and patients may not tolerate this regimen as well as isoniazid,thus potentially resulting in nonadherence. The Haiti study of rifampin and pyrazinamide taken twice weekly and the multina- tional study both reported better adherence with the shorter, 2-mo regimens. In theHaiti study, 74% of persons assigned to the 2-mo rifampin and pyrazinamide regimen were believed to have taken /G17980% of the prescribed medication compared with 55% of persons taking isoniazid for 6 mo ( 110). Nonadherence was similar during the first 2 mo of therapy for both groups. The multinational study reported an 80% completionrate for persons assigned to the 2-mo comparedwith 69% for the 12-mo regimen ( 111). In the pilot study of HIV-seronegative persons, during the first 2 mo of therapy about 60% of those assigned to the rifampinand pyrazinamide regimen were judged to be nonadherent, compared with about 20%of those assigned to the 6-mo isoniazid regimen ( 113). However, overall completion rates were lower for the isoniazid regimen because of continued nonadherence duringthe last 4 mo of therapy. Determinants of adherence to treatment of TB and LTBI are not well understood ( 118). For example, demographic factors are not reliable predictors of adherence. How- ever, culturally influenced beliefs and attitudes may result in misinformation about TBand may adversely affect adherence ( 119). The main strategies that have been em- ployed to promote adherence with treatment of LTBI are patient education ( 120), the use of lay health workers from the patient's social and/or cultural group ( 118,121 ), incentives (e.g., cash payments) ( 122), and directly observed therapy (DOT) ( 64). The intervention most likely to improve adherence for treatment of LTBI has been DOT, which requires direct observation of the patient ingesting each dose of medica-tion and usually includes the provision of comprehensive services that attempt to meetthe patient's basic needs and the use of incentives and enablers ( 123-125 ). Although randomized trials have yet to be reported, available information suggests that DOTleads to higher rates of completion than self-supervised therapy, and, under certaincircumstances, is more cost effective ( 67).22 MMWR June 9, 2000 RECOMMENDATIONS Implementation of Targeted Tuberculin Testing Decision to Tuberculin Test Is Decision to Treat Targeted tuberculin testing programs should be designed for one purpose: to iden- tify persons at high risk for TB who would benefit by treatment of LTBI. Following thatprinciple, targeted tuberculin testing programs should be conducted among groups atrisk for recent infection with M. tuberculosis and those who, regardless of duration of infection, are at increased risk for progression to active TB (Table 7). With the exceptionof initial testing of persons at low risk whose future activity will place them at increasedrisk of exposure (e.g., employment in a setting where TB transmission may occur),screening of low-risk persons is discouraged because it diverts resources from activi-ties of higher priority. In addition, a substantial proportion of tuberculin-test-positivepersons from low-risk populations may have false-positive skin tests ( 73). Testing is also discouraged unless a plan has been developed to complete a course of treatment in persons found to have LTBI. Such planning should include arrange-ments for medical evaluation (e.g., chest radiographs) of persons with positive skintests and for the medical supervision of the course of treatment. Identification and Access to High-risk Groups A flexible approach to identifying high-risk groups is recommended, and state and local public health agencies are encouraged to analyze their TB case reports and dataobtained from tuberculin skin testing to identify high-risk groups based on local trendsin the epidemiology of TB. Thus designing and conducting skin-test-screening surveysto determine whether population groups are at high risk for TB may be desirable. Popu-lations at risk can be accessed at HIV treatment facilities, drug treatment centers, home-less shelters, community health centers and schools serving foreign-born persons, andselected community-based organizations. Mandated skin-testing programs (e.g., thosethat formerly were conducted among teachers and foodhandlers) should be discour-aged unless the targeted groups contain substantial proportions of persons at high risk( 126). Role of the Health Department In this community-based approach to targeted testing and treatment of LTBI, the health department TB program should be instrumental in planning and coordination,setting performance standards, and overseeing quality of service. The health depart-ment is responsible for assessing the community's TB problem, identifying high-riskgroups based on the local epidemiology of TB, and ascertaining the sites of most con-venient access to those groups. In addition, the health department should assumeresponsibility for organizing the community-based approach, recruiting health profes-sionals, educating such professionals about TB, and motivating them to institute tar-geted testing and treatment programs. The health department should also serve asadvisor, consultant, and facilitator to community providers and institutions thatconduct testing and treatment programs. The health department should assist in iden-tifying potential funding sources and ensure linkages with essential clinical andVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 23 consultation sources. It should provide in-service training on tuberculin skin testing and treatment, written protocols for activities including patient tracking and skin test-ing, and patient and provider educational material translated into appropriate lan-guages. The health department may also need to provide chest radiography and subsi-dize the supply of antituberculosis drugs. Finally, the health department should be re-sponsible for providing or facilitating the ongoing evaluation of community-based tar-geted testing and treatment programs, including development and monitoring of pro-gram indicators (e.g., rates of skin tests administered that are read, proportion of testsread that are positive, and initiation and completion rates of treatment). The healthdepartment should also routinely collect and review these data to determine yield andrelative effectiveness of targeted testing and treatment of LTBI in the community. To achieve a high rate of acceptance of testing and completion of treatment in a community-based program, barriers to success should be anticipated, identified, andmanaged. The concept of taking drugs to treat a latent infection that is not causingcurrent health problems is unfamiliar to most persons, and education of the patient isessential ( 120). Other known barriers include culturally derived health beliefs that dif- fer from those of Western medicine, inability to communicate with medical providers inone's primary language, inability to afford the costs of medical evaluation and treat-ment, and lack of access to medical care ( 118). Patients should not be expected to pay directly for public health interventions (e.g., testing, evaluation, and treatment of LTBI).The more convenient this process of testing and treatment, the more likely patients willadhere to therapy\u2014especially as targeted testing and treatment of LTBI are extendedbeyond the province of public health TB clinics to sites where primary health care is delivered. Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Tuberculin Skin Testing Administering and reading tests . The tuberculin test, like all medical tests, is subject to variability, but many of the inherent variations in administering and reading testscan be avoided by careful attention to details. The preferred skin test for M. tuberculo- sis infection is the intradermal, or Mantoux, method. It is administered by injecting 0.1 ml of 5 tuberculin units (TU) PPD intradermally into the dorsal or volar surface of theforearm. Tests should be read 48-72 h after test administration, and the transversediameter of induration should be recorded in millimeters. Multiple puncture tests (i.e.,Tine and Heaf) and PPD strengths of 1 TU and 250 TU are not sufficiently accurate andshould not be used. Interpreting skin-test reactions . Based on the sensitivity and specificity of the tuber- culin skin test and the prevalence of TB in different groups, three cut-off levels havebeen recommended for defining a positive tuberculin reaction: /G1795 mm, /G17910 mm, and /G17915 mm of induration (Table 7). For persons who are at highest risk for developing TB disease if they become infected with M. tuberculosis , a cut-off level of /G1795 mm is recom- mended. Persons who are immunosuppressed because of disease (e.g., HIV infection)or drugs (e.g., systemic corticosteroids) have a high likelihood of developing TB dis-ease if they are infected with M. tuberculosis . Likewise, persons who have had recent close contact with an infectious TB case patient and those with abnormal chest24 MMWR June 9, 2000 radiographs consistent with prior TB are at high risk for TB. Thus, to ensure that per- sons at highest risk are evaluated and appropriately treated, the sensitivity provided bya /G1795 mm cut-off for a positive test is appropriate. A reaction of /G17910 mm of induration should be considered positive for those persons with an increased probability of recent infection or with other clinical conditions thatincrease the risk for TB (e.g., recent immigrants from high-prevalence countries andinjection drug users) (Table 7). In addition to those groups listed, high-prevalence popu-lations identified by analysis of local epidemiologic data should be targeted for testing. Routine tuberculin testing is not recommended for populations at low risk for LTBI. However, if these persons are tested (e.g., at entry into a work site where risk for expo-sure to TB is anticipated and a longitudinal tuberculin testing program is in place), ahigher cut-off of /G17915 mm is recommended. Skin-test conversion . For persons with negative tuberculin skin-test reactions who undergo repeat skin testing (e.g., health care workers), an increase in reaction size of/G17910 mm within a period of 2 yr should be considered a skin-test conversion indicative of recent infection with M. tuberculosis .Table 7. Criteria for tuberculin positivity, by risk group Reaction /G1795 mm of induration Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons Recent contacts of tuberculosis (TB) case patients Fibrotic changes on chest radiograph consistent withprior TB Patients with organ transplants and other immunosuppressedpatients (receiving theequivalent of /G17915 mg/d of prednisone for 1 mo ormore)*Reaction /G17910 mm of induration Recent immigrants (i.e., within the last 5 yr) from high prevalencecountries Injection drug users Residents and employees of the following high-risk congregatesettings: prisons and jails, nursinghomes and other long-term facilitiesfor the elderly, hospitals and otherhealth care facilities, residentialfacilities for patients with acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),and homeless shelters Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Persons with the following clinical conditions that place them at highrisk: silicosis, diabetes mellitus,chronic renal failure, some hemato-logic disorders (e.g., leukemias andlymphomas), other specificmalignancies (e.g., carcinoma of thehead or neck and lung), weight lossof /G17910% of ideal body weight, gastrectomy, and jejunoileal bypass Children younger than 4 yr of age or infants, children, and adolescentsexposed to adults at high-riskReaction /G17915 mm of induration Persons with no risk factors for TB *Risk of TB in patients treated with corticosteroids increases with higher dose and longer duration.

MMWR 1995;44(No. RR-11):19-34.Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 25 Previous with BCG . Tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for persons who have been vaccinated with BCG, and the skin-test results of such personscan be used as described to support or exclude the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infec- tion. However, no method can reliably distinguish tuberculin reactions caused by vac-cination with BCG from those caused by natural mycobacterial infections. Therefore, apositive reaction to tuberculin in BCG-vaccinated persons indicates infection with M. tuberculosis when the person tested is at increased risk for recent infection or has medi- cal conditions that increase the risk for disease (Table 7). Anergy testing in persons infected with HIV . Anergy testing is not recommended for routine use in persons who are infected with HIV or otherwise immunocompromised( 77). However, it may assist in guiding individual treatment decisions in selected situations. Chest Radiographs A chest radiograph is indicated for all persons being considered for treatment of LTBI to exclude active pulmonary TB. Children younger than 5 yr of age should haveboth posterior-anterior and lateral radiographs. All other persons should receive pos-terior-anterior radiographs; additional radiographs should be performed at thephysician's discretion. Because of the risk for progressive and/or congenital TB, preg-nant women who have a positive tuberculin skin test or who have negative skin-testresults but who are recent contacts of persons with infectious TB disease should havechest radiographs (with appropriate shielding) as soon as feasible, even during the firsttrimester of pregnancy. If chest radiographs are normal and no symptoms consistent with active TB are present, tuberculin-positive persons may be candidates for treatment of LTBI. If radio-graphic or clinical findings are consistent with pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB, fur-ther studies (e.g., medical evaluation, bacteriologic examinations, and a comparison ofthe current and old chest radiographs) should be done to determine if treatment foractive TB is indicated. Sputum Examinations Sputum examination is not indicated for most persons being considered for treat- ment of LTBI. However, persons with chest radiographic findings suggestive of prior,healed TB infections should have three consecutive sputum samples, obtained on dif-ferent days, submitted for AFB smear and culture. Most persons with radiographs thatshow only calcified pulmonary nodules do not require bacteriologic examination. HIV-infected persons with respiratory symptoms who are being considered for treatment ofLTBI should also have sputum specimens submitted for mycobacterial examination,even if the chest radiograph is normal. If the results of sputum smears and cultures arenegative and respiratory symptoms can be explained by another etiology, the person isa candidate for treatment of LTBI. If bacteriologic results are negative but the activity oretiology of a radiographic abnormality is questionable, further evaluation with bron-choscopy or needle aspiration biopsy should be undertaken. Single drug treatment ofLTBI should not be started until active TB has been excluded. In such situations,multidrug therapy can be started and continued pending results of sputum cultures. Arepeat chest film should be obtained to exclude active TB, as indicated by improve-ment in the abnormality even in the presence of negative cultures.26 MMWR June 9, 2000 Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Individual Drugs Isoniazid . Isoniazid is the most widely used of the antituberculosis agents\u2014it is bac- tericidal, relatively nontoxic, easily administered, and inexpensive. Isoniazid is highlyactive against M. tuberculosis (most strains being inhibited in vitro by concentrations of 0.05-0.20 \u00b5g/ml). Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is nearly complete, withpeak serum concentrations of 2-5 \u00b5g/ml occurring 0.5-2.0 h after administration of a300-mg dose. The drug penetrates well into all body fluids and cavities, producingconcentrations similar to those found in serum. Hepatitis is the most severe toxic effectof isoniazid, and alcohol consumption may increase toxicity (Table 8). Peripheral neur-opathy, caused by interference with metabolism of pyridoxine, is associated with iso-niazid administration but is uncommon at a dose of 5 mg/kg. In persons with conditionsin which neuropathy is common (e.g., diabetes, uremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, andHIV infection), pyridoxine should be given with isoniazid. Pregnant women and per-sons with seizure disorders should also take both pyridoxine and isoniazid. Mild centralnervous system effects are common with isoniazid and may necessitate adjustments inthe timing of administration of the drug to enhance compliance. The interaction ofisoniazid and phenytoin increases the serum concentration of both drugs. When thesedrugs are given concomitantly, the serum level of phenytoin should be monitored. Noknown interactions exist between isoniazid and the antiretroviral medications used forthe treatment of HIV infection. Rifampin . Rifampin is a rifamycin derivative that is bactericidal for M. tuberculosis . Most strains of M. tuberculosis are inhibited in vitro by concentrations of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml. It is quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak serum concentrations of 7-14 \u00b5g/ml occurring 1.5-3.0 h after ingestion. Although approximately 75% of the drug isprotein bound, it penetrates well into tissues and cells. Penetration through noninflamedmeninges is poor, but therapeutic concentrations are achieved in cerebrospinal fluidwhen the meninges are inflamed. The most common adverse reaction to rifampin isgastrointestinal upset. Other reactions include skin eruptions, hepatitis, and, rarely,thrombocytopenia (Table 8). The frequency of these reactions is low. Because rifampininduces hepatic microsomal enzymes, it may accelerate clearance of drugs metabo-lized by the liver (e.g., methadone, coumadin derivatives, hypoglycemic agents, digitalis, cyclosporin). By accelerating the metabolism of estrogen, rifampinmay interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. In persons with HIV infec-tion who are taking HIV protease inhibitors, rifampin is usually contraindicated becausedrug interactions between rifampin and these agents can lead to increased rifampinlevels and decreased protease-inhibitor levels, resulting in increased risk for rifampintoxicity and decreased protease-inhibitor efficacy. Rifampin is also contraindicated orshould be used with caution in HIV-infected patients who are taking non-nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Intermittent administration of doses ofrifampin be associated with thrombocytopenia, an influenza-like syn-drome, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure. However, these reactions are un-common at the recommended dose of 10 mg/kg/d. Rifampin is excreted in urine, tears,sweat, and other body fluids and colors them orange. Patients should be advised ofdiscoloration of body fluids and of possible permanent discoloration of soft contactlenses.Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 27 Pyrazinamide . Pyrazinamide is bactericidal for M. tuberculosis in an acid environ- ment. The drug is active against organisms in macrophages, presumably because ofthe acid environment within the cell. At a pH of 5.5, the minimal inhibitory concentra-tion of pyrazinamide for M. tuberculosis is 20 \u00b5g/ml. Absorption from the gastrointesti- nal tract is nearly complete, with peak serum concentrations of 30-50 \u00b5g/ml occurringapproximately 2 h after ingestion with doses of 20-25 mg/kg. The most common sideeffect of pyrazinamide is gastrointestinal upset (Table 8). The most severe adverse re-action is liver injury. No substantial increase in hepatotoxicity results from adding 15-30 mg/kg of pyrazinamide to a regimen of rifampin during 2 mo of therapy for active TB( 114). Hyperuricemia also occurs, but acute gout is uncommon ( 127). No known inter- actions exist between pyrazinamide and antiretroviral medications. Rifabutin . Rifabutin is another rifamycin that is highly active against M. tuberculo- sis. Its mechanism of action is the same as that of rifampin, so that most rifampin- resistant strains are also resistant to rifabutin. Most strains of M. tuberculosis are inhib- ited by concentrations of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml. A dose of 300 mg results in peak serum concentra-tions of 5 \u00b5g/ml after 2-3 h. The major advantage of rifabutin is the longer serum half-life and reduced hepatic induction of microsomal metabolism compared with that ofrifampin. Rifabutin is extensively metabolized in the liver (and to a lesser extent in theintestinal wall); only 8% of a dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Doses of up to300 mg daily are usually well tolerated. Side effects attributed to rifabutin include rash,gastrointestinal intolerance, neutropenia, rifabutin cause drug-induced hepatitis. Rates of side effects increase whenrifabutin is administered with a CYP-3A4 inhibitor (e.g., clarithromycin); side effectsthat have been noted under these circumstances include uveitis ( 128) and abnormal skin pigmentation ( 129). Similar to rifampin, rifabutin can also decrease and clinical efficacy of methadone, coumadin oral hypoglycemic as well as itraconazole, \u00df-blockers, and theophylline.Doses of these medications may have to be increased when administered with rifabutin.When administered with rifabutin, protease inhibitors, used for the treatment of HIVinfection, may lead to increased levels of rifabutin and decreased levels of the proteaseinhibitor; however, these effects are generally less than those that occur with rifampinand can be accommodated by dose adjustments (Table 8). NNRTIs, used for the treat-ment of HIV infection, may also necessitate rifabutin dose adjustment. Treatment Regimens Treatment of LTBI is an essential part of the strategy to eliminate TB in the United States. Persons with LTBI who are included among those at increased risk for TB shouldbe offered treatment. The choice of the specific treatment regimen is based on manyconsiderations as detailed in the following sections. U.S. Public Health Service Rating System . To help clinicians make informed treat- ment decisions based on the most current research results, evidence-based ratings areassigned to the drug treatment recommendations (general recommendations have norating) (Table 9). The ratings system is similar to that used in previous PHS documents( 3) and includes a letter and a Roman numeral: the letter indicates the strength of the recommendation, and the Roman numeral indicates the quality of the evidencesupporting the recommendation. Thus, clinicians can use the ratings to differentiate28 MMWR June 9, 2000Table 8.

HIV infection, history of liver disease, alcoholism, and pregnancy. \u00a7If nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, or ritonavir is concentrations of these protease inhib itors decrease. Thus, the dose of rifabutin is reduced from 300 mg to 150 mg/d when used with nelfinavir, indinavir, or amprenavir; and to 150 mg (two or three times a wee k) when used with ritonavir. If efavirenz is administered with rifabutin, blood concentrations of rifabutin decrease. Thus, when rifabutin is used concurrently with efavirenz, the daily dose of rifabutin should be increased from 300 mg to 450 mg or 600 mg. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that rifabutin might be given at usual doses with nevirapine. It is not currently known whether dose adjustment of rifabutin is required when used concurrently with soft-gel saquinavir. For pa tients receiving multiple PIs or a PI in combination with an NNRTI, drug interactions with rifabutin are likely more complex; in such situations, the use of rifabuti n is not recommended until additional data are available.Adverse reactions Rash HepatitisFeverThrombocytopeniaOrange-colored body fluids (secretions,urine, tears) With increased of rifabutin Severe arthralgiasUveitisLeukopenia Gastrointestinal upset HepatitisRashArthralgiasGout (rare)30 MMWR June 9, 2000 between recommendations based on data from clinical trials and those based on the opinions of experts familiar with the relevant clinical practice and scientific rationalefor such practice (when clinical trial data are not available). Recommended regimens . Four regimens are recommended for the treatment of adults with LTBI (Table 10). The antituberculosis medications used in these regimenshave varying doses, toxicities, and monitoring requirements (Table 8). All patients be-ing given twice-weekly treatment should receive DOT, because nonadherence to inter-mittent dosing results in a larger proportion of the total doses missed than does dailydosing. DOT should be used whenever feasible, especially with 2-mo regimens and in certain settings (e.g., some institutional settings, community outreach programs, and for some persons living in households with patients who are receiving home-basedDOT for active TB). Isoniazid for 9 mo. The isoniazid daily regimen for 9 mo receives an A recommenda- tion. Prospective, randomized trials of up to 12 mo of therapy in HIV-uninfected per-sons suggest that the maximal beneficial effect of isoniazid is achieved by 9 mo; mini-mal additional benefit is gained by extending treatment to 12 mo. Thus, this updatedrecommendation represents a shortening of the previous recommendation of isoniaziddaily for 12 mo for HIV-infected persons and a lengthening of the previously recom-mended 6 mo for HIV-uninfected persons 1). Both 12-mo and 6-mo regimens of niazid have substantially of TB in HIV-infected persons compared withplacebo ( 88), but the 6-mo regimen has not been directly compared with the 12-mo regimen in HIV-infected persons. Thus, the recommendation for 9 mo of isoniazid inHIV-infected persons is based on extrapolation of available data. Intermittent dosing of9 mo of isoniazid for treatment of LTBI has not been studied comparatively. However,analogous with the continuation phase of treatment for active TB (where twice-weeklydosing is equivalent to daily dosing), twice-weekly dosing of isoniazid is also accept-able for treatment of LTBI, but is recommended at the B level as an acceptable alterna-tive regimen. Isoniazid for 6 mo. Although a 9-mo regimen of isoniazid is the preferred treatment of LTBI for an individual patient, a 6-mo regimen also provides substantial protectionand has been demonstrated to be superior to placebo in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons ( 32,84 ). From a societal perspective, treatment for 6 mo rather than 9 mo may provide a more cost-effective outcome ( 81). Thus, based on individual situations, health departments or other providers may prefer to concentrate efforts inTable 9.

Some experts would use rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 moas an alternative regimen in HIV-infected pregnant women, although pyrazinamide should be avoided duringthe first trimester. \u00b6Rifabutin should not be used with hard-gel saquinavir or delavirdine. When used with other protease inhibitorsor NNRTIs, dose adjustment of rifabutin may be required (see Table 8).32 MMWR June 9, 2000 ensuring the implementation of a 6-mo rather than a 9-mo course of isoniazid. Iso- niazid for 6 mo, taken either daily or twice weekly, is recommended at the B level forHIV-negative persons and at the C level for HIV-positive persons. The shorter regimenis not recommended for children or persons with radiographic evidence of prior tuber-culosis. Rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 mo. The 2-mo daily regimen of rifampin and pyrazi- namide is recommended on the basis of a prospective randomized trial of treatment ofLTBI in HIV-infected persons that demonstrated the 2-mo regimen to be similar in safetyand efficacy to a 12-mo regimen of isoniazid ( 111). Although this regimen has not been evaluated in HIV-uninfected persons with LTBI, the efficacy is not expected to differsignificantly. However, the toxicities may be increased ( 113); therefore, the recommen- dation is made at the A level for HIV-infected persons and at the B level for HIV-uninfected persons until further data are available. Two randomized, prospective trialsof intermittent dosing of rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 and 3 mo, respectively, havebeen reported in HIV-infected persons ( 86, 110 ); in neither case was the sample size adequate to conclude with certainty that efficacy was equivalent to daily dosing. More-over, both studies compared the twice-weekly pyrazinamide given twice weeklyfor 2-3 mo may be considered when alternative regimens cannot be given. This recom-mendation is made at the C level. Rifampin for 4 mo. Rifampin given daily for 3 mo has resulted in better protection than placebo in treatment of LTBI in HIV-uninfected persons with silicosis in a random-ized prospective trial ( 36). However, because the patients receiving rifampin had a high rate of active TB (4%), experts have concluded that a 4-mo regimen would be more prudent when using rifampin alone. This 4-mo rifampin regimen is recommended atthe B level for both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. This option may be usefulfor patients who cannot tolerate isoniazid or pyrazinamide. Choice of regimen . Because more than one regimen can be used to treat LTBI, health care providers should discuss options with the patient, and, when possible, help pa-tients make the decision, unless medical indications dictate a specific regimen. Discus-sion should include the length and complexity of the regimens, possible adverse ef-fects, and potential drug interactions. Completion of treatment . Completion of therapy is based on total number of doses administered\u2014not on duration of therapy alone. The 9-mo regimen of daily isoniazidshould consist of 270 doses, at minimum, administered within 12 mo, allowing forminor interruptions in therapy. The 6-mo regimen of isoniazid should consist of at least180 doses administered within 9 mo. Twice-weekly isoniazid regimens should consistof at least 76 doses administered within 12 mo for the 9-mo regimen and 52 doseswithin 9 mo for the 6-mo regimen. The daily regimen of rifampin (or rifabutin) andpyrazinamide should consist of at least 60 doses to be administered within 3 mo. Theregimen of daily rifampin alone should consist of at least 120 doses administered within6 mo. Ideally, patients should receive medication on a regular dosing schedule until completion of the indicated course. However, in practice some doses may be missed,requiring the course to be lengthened. When reinstituting therapy for patients whohave interrupted treatment, clinicians might need to continue the regimen originallyprescribed (as long as needed to complete the recommended duration of the particularVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 33 regimen) or renew the entire regimen if interruptions were frequent or prolonged enough to preclude completion of treatment as recommended. In either situation, whentherapy is restored after an interruption of more than 2 mo, a medical examination torule out active TB disease is indicated. Special considerations. Treatment of HIV-infected persons. Recommendations for HIV-infected adults largely parallel those for HIV-uninfected adults, although the quality of evidence and strengthsof the recommendations vary (Table 10). However, when isoniazid is chosen for treat-ment of LTBI in persons with HIV infection, 9 mo is recommended rather that 6 mo. Inaddition, rifampin is generally contraindicated or should be used with caution in per-sons who are taking protease inhibitors (PIs) or NNRTIs ( 169). Experts have recom- mended that for HIV-infected persons who are candidates for treatment of LTBI andneed PI or NNRTI therapy, rifabutin can be substituted for rifampin in some circum-stances; rifabutin safely be used but is advised ifrifabutin is administered with soft-gel saquinavir, because data regarding use of rifabutinwith soft-gel saquinavir or nevirapine are limited. No specific data have been generated for treatment of LTBI with rifabutin- containing regimens, but such a recommendation is supported by analogy with treat-ment for active TB (where rifabutin can be substituted for rifampin with no loss ofefficacy) and by experimental studies in mice ( 107,130 ). Rifabutin can be administered at one half the usual daily dose (i.e., reduced from 300 mg to 150 mg/d) with indinavir,nelfinavir, or amprenavir or at one-fourth the usual dose (i.e., 150 mg every other day or three times a week) with ritonavir. The daily rifabutin dose is 450 mg or 600 mg when used with efavirenz; pharmacokinetic studies suggest that rifabutin might be given atusual doses with nevirapine. For patients receiving multiple PIs or a PI in combinationwith an NNRTI, drug interactions with rifabutin are likely more complex; in such situa-tions, the use of rifabutin is not recommended until additional data are available. Thesubstitution of rifapentine for rifampin is not recommended because rifapentine's safetyand effectiveness have not been established for patients infected with HIV ( 131). Fur- thermore, the drug interactions between rifapentine and HIV protease inhibitors havenot been studied in detail, although one study has indicated that rifapentine causessubstantial reduction in the serum level of indinavir when the drugs are given together( 132). In tuberculin-negative, HIV-infected persons, treatment of LTBI has not been effec- tive ( 3). However, most tuberculin-negative HIV-infected contacts of patients with ac- tive TB should receive treatment for presumptive LTBI\u2014even when repeat testing aftercontact has ended is not indicative of LTBI. Furthermore, some experts recommendtreatment of possible LTBI for HIV-infected residents of institutions that pose an ongo-ing high risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis (e.g., prisons, jails, and homeless shel- ters). Persons with fibrotic lesions/suspected disease. For patients who have a chest ra- diograph demonstrating old fibrotic lesions thought to represent previous infectionwith TB and a positive tuberculin skin test ( /G1795 mm) without evidence of active disease and no history of treatment for TB, three acceptable regimens can be used for treat-ment. These regimens include 9 mo of isoniazid, 2 mo of rifampin plus pyrazinamide,or 4 mo of rifampin (with or without isoniazid), providing that infection with drug-resistant organisms is judged to be unlikely. Patients who begin multidrug therapy for34 MMWR June 9, 2000 suspected pulmonary TB but are subsequently determined not to have active disease (i.e., AFB cultures are negative and chest radiographs are stable) should complete treat-ment with at least 2 mo of a regimen containing rifampin and pyrazinamide if the tuber-culin skin test is positive and other causes of the radiographic abnormalities have beenexcluded. Persons with evidence suggestive of not atincreased risk for TB. Their risk for TB and need for treatment of LTBI should be deter-mined by consideration of other risk factors and the size of the tuberculin reaction(Table 7). Pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy has minimal influence on the pathogenesis of TB or the likelihood of LTBI progressing to disease ( 133, 134 ). Although one study demonstrated a decrease in lymphocyte reactivity to tuberculin during pregnancy ( 135), other studies have not demonstrated an effect of pregnancy on cutaneous delayedhypersensitivity to tuberculin ( 136, 137 ). The current classification scheme for inter- preting the Mantoux tuberculin skin test is likely valid in pregnancy, although it has notbeen verified in this group of women. There is no evidence that the tuberculin skin testhas adverse effects on the pregnant mother or fetus ( 138). Pregnant women should be targeted for tuberculin skin testing only if they have a specific risk factor for LTBI or for progression of LTBI to disease. Although the need fortreatment of active TB during pregnancy is unquestioned, the treatment of LTBI in preg-nant women is more controversial. Some experts prefer to delay treatment until afterdelivery because pregnancy itself does not increase the risk of progression to disease, and two studies suggest that women in pregnancy and the early postpartum period may be vulnerable to isoniazid hepatotoxicity ( 91, 92 ). However, because conditions that promote hematogenous spread of organisms to the placenta (e.g., recent infectionand HIV infection) or progression of LTBI to disease can endanger both the mother andbaby ( 139), many experts agree that pregnant women with these conditions and LTBI should be treated during pregnancy and have careful clinical and laboratory monitor-ing for hepatitis. The possible risk for isoniazid hepatotoxicity must be weighed againstthe risk for developing active TB and the consequences to both the mother and herchild should active disease develop. Extensive use of isoniazid during pregnancy has indicated that although it readily crosses the placental barrier, the drug is not teratogenic even when given during thefirst 4 mo of gestation ( 140). Regarding rifampin, one study revealed that 3% of 446 fetuses exposed in utero to rifampin had abnormalities (i.e., limb reductions, central nervous system abnormalities, and hypoprothrombinemia) compared with 2% forethambutol and 1% for both isoniazid and controls ( 138). Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn has been described following the use of rifampin in the mother ( 141). How- ever, extensive experience with the use of rifampin to treat TB in pregnant womensuggests it is safe in most circumstances. Although pyrazinamide has been used totreat TB in pregnant women, no published data exist concerning the effects of the drugon the fetus. Thus, although pyrazinamide may be considered after the first trimester inwomen with HIV infection ( 142), it should otherwise be avoided. The preferred regimen for treatment of LTBI in pregnant women is isoniazid, admin- istered either daily or twice weekly. Although rifampin is probably safe, no efficacy datasupport its use. For women at high risk for progression of LTBI to disease, especiallyVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 35 those who are infected with HIV or who have been infected recently, initiation of therapy should not be delayed on the basis of pregnancy alone, even during the first trimester.For these women, careful clinical and/or laboratory monitoring for hepatitis shouldbe undertaken. Pregnant women taking isoniazid should receive pyridoxinesupplementation. Toxic effects of antituberculosis drugs delivered in breast milk have not been re- ported. One study concluded that a breastfeeding infant would develop serum levels ofno more than 20% of the usual therapeutic levels of isoniazid for infants and <11% ofother antituberculosis drugs ( 143). Breastfeeding is not contraindicated when the mother is being treated for LTBI. However, infants whose breastfeeding mothers aretaking isoniazid should receive supplemental pyridoxine. The amount of isoniazid pro-vided by breast milk is inadequate for treatment of the infant. Children and adolescents. Several fundamental aspects of the natural history and treatment of LTBI in children must be considered when making recommendations abouttherapy. Infants and young children (i.e., those younger than 5 yr of age) with LTBI havebeen infected recently, and are at high risk for progression to disease. Data suggest thatuntreated infants with LTBI have up to a 40% likelihood of developing TB ( 144). The risk for progression decreases gradually through childhood. Infants and young children aremore likely than older children and adults to develop life-threatening forms of TB,especially meningeal and disseminated disease. Children with LTBI have more years atrisk to develop TB than adults. Isoniazid therapy for LTBI appears to be more effectivefor children than adults, with several large clinical trials demonstrating risk reduction of70-90% ( 145,146 ). The risk for isoniazid-related hepatitis is minimal in infants, chil- dren, and adolescents, who generally tolerate the drug better than adults ( 147,148 ). Isoniazid therapy is widely accepted for use in children. Because of differences in patho-genesis of TB infection and disease in children compared with adults, information fromclinical trials involving adults cannot be applied directly to children without confirma-tory pediatric trials. The only published efficacy trials of treatment of LTBI in childrenhave studied isoniazid alone. The only recommended regimen for treatment of LTBI in HIV-uninfected children is a 9-mo course of isoniazid as self-administered daily therapy or by DOT twice weekly.Routine monitoring of serum liver enzyme concentrations is not necessary but shouldbe considered in children at risk for hepatic disease. When children taking antitubercu-losis therapy develop hepatitis, a search for causes other than isoniazid or other drugsshould be undertaken and the therapy discontinued. Routine administration of pyri-doxine is not recommended for children taking isoniazid, but should be given to ( 1) breastfeeding infants, ( 2) children and adolescents with diets likely to be deficient in pyridoxine, and ( 3) children who experience paresthesias while taking isoniazid. Isoniazid given twice weekly has been used extensively to treat LTBI in children, especially schoolchildren and close contacts of case patients ( 125). On the basis of clinical experience, this method of administration is safe, but its effectiveness has notbeen established definitively. DOT should be considered when it is unlikely that thechild and family will be adherent to daily self-administration. In the United States, rifampin alone has been used for the treatment of LTBI in in- fants, children, and adolescents when isoniazid could not be tolerated or the child hashad contact with a case patient infected with an isoniazid-resistant but rifamycin-susceptible organism ( 149). However, no controlled clinical trials have been conducted.36 MMWR June 9, 2000 A 3-mo regimen of rifampin and isoniazid has been used in England, with program- matic data suggesting that the regimen is effective ( 108). No reports have been pub- lished concerning the efficacy of rifampin and pyrazinamide therapy in children withLTBI, although a randomized study involving a limited number of children indicatedthat this regimen was well tolerated ( 116). No studies have been published regarding the efficacy of any form of treatment for LTBI in HIV-infected children. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recom-mends a 9-mo course of isoniazid ( 150). Most experts recommend that routine moni- toring of serum liver enzyme concentrations be performed and pyridoxine given whenHIV-infected children are treated with isoniazid. The optimal length of rifampin therapyin children with LTBI is not known; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics rec-ommends 6 mo of treatment ( 150). Contacts of patients with tuberculosis. GContacts of patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Persons who are contacts of patients with drug-susceptible TB and who have positive tuberculin skin-test reac-tions ( /G1795 mm) should be treated with one of the recommended regimens\u2014regardless of age (Table 10). In addition, some tuberculin-negative contacts should be consideredfor treatment. Because of susceptibility to severe disease, children younger than 5 yr ofage with negative skin tests should be treated and another skin test performed 8-12 wkafter contact has ended. If the repeat skin test is positive, treatment should continue forthe recommended period of time; if the repeat skin test is negative, the treatment shouldbe stopped. Immunosuppressed persons, including those with HIV infection, who arecontacts of persons with active TB should also receive treatment, even if repeat skin testing does not indicate LTBI. GContacts of patients with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis. No definitive data exist concerning treatment of contacts who have been exposed to patients with probable orconfirmed isoniazid-resistant TB. A decision analysis and Delphi methodology havebeen used to recommend either rifampin alone or in combination with isoniazid orethambutol when the risk of isoniazid-resistant infection is >50% ( 151). An expert panel has recommended use of rifampin for vulnerable contacts (e.g., those with HIV infec-tion) of patients with isoniazid-resistant TB ( 152). In an outbreak of isoniazid- and streptomycin-resistant TB among homeless per- sons, six (9%) of 71 persons with skin tests that converted who received no preventivetherapy developed TB, compared with three (8%) of 38 who received isoniazid, andzero of 98 persons who received rifampin or isoniazid and rifampin ( 153). Similarly, of 157 high school students who took rifampin after being exposed to a patient with iso-niazid-resistant, active TB, none developed TB during the second year of the study( 149). However, one episode of rifampin prophylaxis failure was reported among con- tacts of a case patient with isoniazid-resistant TB in a community outbreak ( 154). For contacts of patients with isoniazid-resistant, rifampin-susceptible TB, a 2-mo regimen of rifampin and recommended. For patients with intoleranceto pyrazinamide, a 4-mo regimen of rifampin alone is recommended. In situations inwhich rifampin cannot be used, rifabutin can be substituted. GContacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The occurrence of out- breaks of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) (i.e., TB caused by strains of M. tuberculosis resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin) and the rise in resistance rates worldwidehave focused attention on options for treatment of persons exposed to and presumedVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 37 to be infected by such organisms ( 155). As with exposure to isoniazid-resistant TB, this problem has not been evaluated in prospective studies. A Delphi technique among 31experts failed to achieve consensus on the management of such persons ( 156). Persons infected with isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant organisms are unlikely to benefit from treatment with regimens containing these agents. Therefore, use of a regi-men containing other agents active against M. tuberculosis should be considered. When possible, selection of drugs for such a regimen should be guided by in vitro susceptibil- ity test results from the isolate to which the patient was exposed and is presumedinfected. For persons who are likely to be infected with MDR TB and at high risk of developing TB, pyrazinamide ethambutol or pyrazinamide and a fluoroquinolone (i.e.,levofloxacin or ofloxacin) for 6-12 mo are recommended, if the organisms from theindex case-patient are known to be susceptible to these agents ( 157). Immunocompe- tent contacts may be observed without treatment or treated for at least 6 mo;immunocompromised contacts (e.g., HIV-infected persons) should be treated for 12mo. Side effects of pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones include gastrointestinal symp-toms and hepatic ). All persons with suspected MDR TBinfection should be followed for at least 2 yr, irrespective of treatment. Expert consulta-tion should be sought for the treatment of persons exposed to patients with MDR TB. No studies have been published regarding treatment of LTBI in children following exposure to multidrug-resistant TB. Ethambutol at 15 mg/kg is safe in children ( 159). The combination of pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9-12 mo is recommended if theisolate is susceptible to both drugs. Long-term use of fluoroquinolones in children should be avoided. Deleterious effects on growing cartilage have been observed in animals treated with fluoroquinolones ( 160), although no defects in bone growth oc- curred among a limited number of children with with ciprofloxacinor ofloxacin ( 161). When pyrazinamide and ethambutol cannot be used, many experts recommend using a combination of two other drugs to which the infecting organism islikely susceptible ( 162, 163 ). Low-risk tuberculin test reactors. When treatment of LTBI is being considered for persons who are at low risk for developing TB, the decision should be based on factorssuch as likelihood of drug toxicity if treatment is given and likelihood of TB transmis-sion to vulnerable contacts (e.g., infants and HIV-infected persons) if treatment werenot given and the patient were to develop active TB. Included in this decision are thepatient's preferences and values. When the assessed risk of drug toxicity exceeds theanticipated benefits of therapy, treatment for LTBI is not usually appropriate. BCG-vaccinated persons. A history of BCG vaccination, with or without a BCG scar, should not influence the decision regarding whether to treat LTBI. The criteria previ-ously described should be applied without modification (164 ). Directly observed therapy and measures to increase adherence. Any regimen that is given intermittently (i.e., twice weekly) should be given only under direct observa-tion. Some experts recommend that the 2-mo regimen of daily rifampin and pyrazina-mide also be given by DOT, which, for ease of administration, may consist of five ob-served and two self-administered doses each week. Patients with the highest priority for DOT are those at the highest risk of progression from latent to active TB, including persons with HIV infection and young children whoare contacts of infectious patients with pulmonary TB. DOT may be conveniently and38 MMWR June 9, 2000 effectively used for the treatment of household contacts of patients receiving DOT for active TB and for treatment observed by staff members in certain facilities (e.g., schoolsand homeless shelters). If it is not possible to provide DOT to enhance adherence with treatment of LTBI, the prescribed regimen should be incorporated into patients' daily routines. Medical pro-viders can encourage adherence to treatment by establishing rapport with patients.Providers should explain in simple, clear language what LTBI is, the health threat itpresents, and how it is eradicated. Patients should be encouraged to ask questions.Patient education should ideally be conducted in the patient's primary language, orthrough a medical interpreter, if necessary. Each visit between patient and medicalprovider during therapy is an opportunity to reinforce the patient's understanding ofLTBI and its treatment. In addition to education about potential drug toxicity, patients should be told about common side effects and counseled on drug management. (For example, medicationsshould be taken with food when gastrointestinal symptoms have occurred after medi-cation was taken on an empty stomach, and salicylic acid can be used for symptomatictreatment of arthralgia caused by pyrazinamide.) Most interventions to improve adherence require substantial financial resources. Providing flexible clinic hours, reducing waiting times for patients, spending time withpatients to counsel and educate, and directly observing patients ingesting medicationsincrease operating expenses. Even the least intensive approaches to improve adher-ence increase program costs. The costs of these approaches to improving patient ad-herence underscore the need to target tuberculin testing and treatment of LTBI to those groups with an increased risk for recent infection or those persons at high risk for progression to active TB, if infected. In addition, programs should invest in approachesto increase adherence, especially for those persons who are at greatest risk for pro-gressing to disease. Better success in motivating patients to accept and to completetreatment is necessary to achieve the full potential of this intervention to protect per-sons from TB and to reduce the incidence of the disease in the community. Pretreatment Evaluation and Monitoring of Treatment Pretreatment evaluation . The pretreatment evaluation of persons who are targeted for treatment of LTBI provides an opportunity for health care providers to a) establishrapport with patients, b) discuss the details of the patients' risk for TB, c) emphasize thebenefits of treatment and the importance of adherence to the drug regimen, d) reviewpossible adverse effects of the regimen, including interactions with other drugs, ande) establish an optimal follow-up plan. The evaluation should include an interview con-ducted in the patients' primary language with assistance of qualified medical interpret-ers, if necessary. The patient history should document risk factors for TB, prior treatment for TB or LTBI, and preexisting medical conditions that constitute a contraindication to treat-ment or are associated with an increased risk for adverse effects of treatment. A de-tailed history of current and previous drug therapy should be obtained, with particularattention to previous adverse reactions to drugs contemplated for treatment of LTBI,and to current use of drugs which may interact with the drugs used for treatment.Women receiving rifampin and oral contraceptives are at increased risk for becomingpregnant and should be advised to consider an additional form of contraception. Prac-titioners should consider using a standardized history form to ensure that all elementsVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 39 of the pretest evaluation are thoroughly covered for each patient. Baseline laboratory testing is not routinely indicated for all patients at the start of treatment for LTBI (Table 8). Patients whose initial evaluation suggests a liver disordershould have baseline hepatic measurements of serum AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) andbilirubin. Baseline testing is also indicated for patients infected with HIV, pregnantwomen and those in the immediate postpartum period (i.e., within 3 mo of delivery),persons with a history of liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B or C, alcoholic hepatitis or cir-rhosis), persons who use alcohol regularly, and others who are at risk for chronic liverdisease. Baseline testing is no longer routinely indicated in persons older than 35 yr ofage. However, such testing may be considered on an individual basis, particularly forpatients who are taking other medications for chronic medical conditions. Active hepa-titis and end-stage liver disease are relative contraindications to the use of isoniazid orpyrazinamide for treatment of LTBI. Monitoring of treatment. Clinical monitoring is indicated for all patients; this in- volves education of patients about the symptoms and signs that can result as adverseeffects of the drug(s) being prescribed and the need for prompt cessation of treatmentand clinical evaluation should symptoms occur. These include any of the following:unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistentparesthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever lasting 3 ormore days, abdominal tenderness (especially right upper quadrant discomfort), easybruising or bleeding, and arthralgia (Table 8). Clinical monitoring begins at the first visitand should be repeated at each monthly visit. At monthly visits, patients should beinstructed to interrupt therapy and contact their providers immediately upon the onset of such symptoms or any unexplained illness occurring during treatment. Patients being treated for LTBI should receive a clinical evaluation, including a brief physical assessment checking for signs of hepatitis, at least monthly if receiving iso-niazid alone or rifampin alone and at 2, 4, and 8 wk if receiving both rifampin andpyrazinamide (Table 8). These evaluations represent opportunities to review the indica-tions for treatment, adherence with therapy since the last visit, symptoms of adversedrug effects and drug interactions, and plans to continue treatment. As with the baselineevaluation, a standardized questionnaire may facilitate those interviews. Routine laboratory monitoring during treatment of LTBI is indicated for patients whose baseline liver function tests are abnormal and for other persons at risk for he-patic disease (Table 8). In addition, laboratory testing (e.g., liver function studies forpatients with symptoms compatible with hepatotoxicity or a uric acid measurement toevaluate patients who develop acute arthritis) should be used to evaluate possibleadverse effects that occur during the course of treatment. Some experts recommendthat isoniazid be withheld if a patient's transaminase level exceeds 3 times the upperlimit of normal if associated with symptoms and five times the upper limit of normal ifthe patient is asymptomatic. Reporting of serious adverse events. Practitioners and other health professionals should report serious adverse events associated with the treatment of LTBI to the U.S.Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch program.

However, the specificity of the test is decreased by cross reactions from BCG vaccination andsensitization by nontuberculous mycobacteria. When used in populations in which therisk for TB is low, the test's positive predictive value is poor. In addition, the require-ment that the person tested return for the test to be read 48-72 h after test administra-tion creates operational problems. Thus, more specific and sensitive tests are neededto diagnose LTBI and to identify persons at greatest risk for progressing to active dis-ease. Especially useful would be tests that distinguish skin-test reactions caused by TBinfection from those caused by BCG vaccination or infection with nontuberculous my-cobacteria, tests that correlate with the presence of living organisms, and tests thataccurately identify LTBI in immunodeficient persons. Operational Research Acceptability, Tolerability, and Effectiveness of Daily Rifampin and Pyrazinamide More data are needed regarding the acceptability, tolerability, and effectiveness of the 2-mo regimen of daily rifampin and pyrazinamide in HIV-negative persons. Data areespecially needed from older adults and children. Intermittent Rifampin-containing Regimens No studies of rifampin alone taken twice weekly for the treatment of LTBI have been conducted. Data from two studies in HIV-infected persons that included intermittent(i.e., twice weekly) rifampin and pyrazinamide administration suggested that these regi-mens were effective ( 86,110 ). Before additional trials of intermittent rifampin regimens are undertaken, animal model data are needed to compare these regimens with regi-mens using other longer-acting rifamycin derivatives ( see Efficacy Studies of New Drugs). Isoniazid Taken Twice Weekly It is unlikely that a formal efficacy study of intermittent isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI will be undertaken, unless it is included as a control arm for studies of newerregimens. However, several TB-control programs have had considerable experienceusing this regimen. Data from these programs should be examined, especially as theyrelate to acceptability and completion of treatment. The analysis of aggregate dataavailable in TB programs may also be useful in estimating the effectiveness of thisregimen. Studies in Children and Pregnant Women Studies are needed to provide information regarding the use of newer regimens for the treatment of LTBI in children and pregnant women. The safety of pyrazinamide forpregnant women and their fetuses should be determined. More information is neededVol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 41 regarding hepatotoxicity of isoniazid in pregnant and postpartum women. Studies are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of rifampin alone and rifampin pluspyrazinamide for treatment of LTBI in infants, children, and adolescents. The best tar-get populations for these studies would be HIV-infected children in places in which TBis prevalent and household contacts of TB case patients. In addition, the effectivenessof twice-weekly regimens for treatment of LTBI in children should be confirmed. Dataconcerning the safety and effectiveness of alternative therapies for MDR LTBI in chil-dren are needed. Finally, epidemiologic research to determine the best tools to identifychildren at high risk for LTBI should be undertaken. Reporting and Monitoring in New Settings These recommendations call for the establishment of LTBI treatment programs in new community settings (e.g., managed care organizations and neighborhood clinics).Consequently, operational research will be needed to evaluate the implementation ofthese programs in settings other than health departments. These studies should assessthe knowledge base of treating clinicians and identify the obstacles to be overcome forthe successful implementation of community-based LTBI treatment programs. Combination Rifampin and Pyrazinamide Preparations If field and programmatic data establish the effectiveness and acceptability of the rifampin and pyrazinamide regimen for the treatment of LTBI, the availability of a com-bination product would facilitate its administration. However, the argument concerningthe usefulness of combination products in preventing the emergence of drug resis- tance in patients with active TB is not as compelling for persons being treated for LTBI. Nonetheless, methods to facilitate provision of this treatment and increase adherence(e.g., blister packs containing medication for 2 wk of treatment for several differentbody weights) would be useful. Efficacy Studies of New Drugs No novel compounds currently can be considered candidates for the treatment of LTBI. However, several rifamycin derivatives with half-lives substantially greater thanrifampin are of interest because of the possibility of widely spaced, intermittent admin-istration. In experimental studies involving mice, the combination of rifapentine andisoniazid given once weekly for 3 mo was as active as rifampin and pyrazinamide givendaily for 2 mo ( 165). Rifalazil, which has an even longer half-life, is more active than rifapentine and perhaps could be dosed less frequently without compromising efficacy( 166). The class of nitroimidazole compounds is also of interest because of their poten- tial activity against dormant tubercle bacilli ( 167). Unfortunately, no animal models of LTBI exist that optimize the preclinical evaluation of new drugs. Studies of Immunomodulators and Vaccines Recent studies have indicated that immunotherapy with specific cytokines and immunomodulators may be beneficial to response to TB treatment. However, theirapplication in the treatment of LTBI is uncertain. Some epidemiologic studies havesuggested that high levels of certain cytokines (e.g., interferon gamma) may protectagainst the development of active TB. If further studies support this finding,42 MMWR June 9, 2000 interventions that stimulate production of protective cytokines may have a role in the treatment of LTBI. The development of a postinfection vaccine to be administered topersons with LTBI has been given high priority ( 168). Decision/Cost-Effectiveness Analyses Focus on Testing for and Treatment of Latent TB Infection in High-risk and Diverse Populations Future decision and cost-effectiveness analyses should be expanded to include tar- geted testing. Instead of beginning at the \"treat-don't-treat\" point, new models mightbe most useful if they begin with the decision of whether to test. These studies shouldfocus on groups at high risk and specific subgroups characterized by varied risks andbenefits of treatment. Using this conceptual framework will help place decision model-ing more clearly into a \"real world\" context, incorporating the linked contingenciesthat exist. Comparison of Strategies Using Both Shorter and Longer Treatment Regimens Future decision and cost-effectiveness analyses should compare the shorter course regimens to the longer, 9-mo regimen of daily isoniazid. These analyses will benefitfrom investigations of the toxicities and efficacies of shorter regimens. In addition, al-though adherence presumably will be better with shorter treatment regimens, therifampin and pyrazinamide regimen may be less well-tolerated in some groups of pa-tients, thus resulting in low adherence. Decision and cost-effectiveness analyses shouldexplore a range of toxicities in the models until investigations better establish theserisks. By investigating the effect of a range of toxicities and adherence on the decisionoutcome, studies can help identify priority areas for research. Updated analyses on theuse of alternate regimens for the treatment of drug-resistant LTBI are also needed. Use of Multiple Analytic Perspectives When two different perspectives are relevant for a decision, both perspectives should be modeled and analyzed. For example, when the benefits to an individual person withLTBI are different from the benefits to the public, both perspectives must be madeexplicit in decision models. When decision analysis is inadequate to deal with publichealth issues (e.g., reduction in contagion), additional models are needed to augmentviews of the benefits and costs of following each viable course of action. Policies designed to target and treat populations at high risk for TB are motivated by the need to benefit the individual patient as well as the health of the public by avertingactive disease in persons most likely to develop it. As policies are instituted that iden-tify high-risk groups for testing and treatment, the social and ethical ramifications ofthese policies must be considered. The individual persons who comprise many of thehigh-risk groups targeted for testing and treatment often represent disenfranchisedsegments of urban populations (e.g., persons who are homeless, incarcerated, andmedically underserved, and residents in long-term care facilities). Ideally, the outcomesand utilities that are used in these decision models will incorporate the values andpreferences of these patients and the outcomes important to the general public.Vol. 49 / No. RR-6 MMWR 43 Acknowledgment The Writing Group wishes to express their appreciation to Elisha Freifeld of the ATS for admin- istrative assistance and to Rachel Wilson of the MMWR for editorial assistance.
