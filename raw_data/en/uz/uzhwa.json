They don't often get much advice about how they could help themselves. So, we spoke to professionals and looked at academic research. Then we drew up a list of strategies young people use (you can see the process in this [self-care infographic](/media/8502/final_infographic_self_care.pdf)). We also published a [report](/mental-health-professionals/anna-freud-learning-network/self-or-community-approaches/) following a consultation with young people and their families online. We're sharing these strategies with you to help you to manage your wellbeing. It's up to you to decide what helps. If it works, keep doing it. If it doesn't, stop and try something else. And you can help us build an evidence-base for these activities by letting us know what works by clicking on the 'Did this activity help your mental wellbeing' button on each page. This will help us decide which ones to research further. We've also created a [booklet](/media/15030/my-self-care-plan-secondary.pdf) to help you create your own self-care plan as part of our and another booklet with [advice for young parents and carers on looking after their wellbeing](/media/12208/selfcarepc-final.pdf). These activities are not a substitute for seeing a mental health professional. Sometimes we need outside help and advice. Getting help is good. No-one should feel bad about it. That's what this site is about. This self-care section was developed by [Common Room](http://commonroom.uk.com/) and young people from mental health support group Hearts & Minds. These strategies were identified by young people aged 11-25 though some strategies might not be appropriate for all ages without support or guidance of a trusted adult.
