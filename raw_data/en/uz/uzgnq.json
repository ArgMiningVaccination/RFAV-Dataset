Although many scholars try to connect TCM with precision medicine or apply new methods and technology to integrate TCM with modern medicine, the misunderstandings and gap between TCM and modern medicine limit the development of evidence-based TCM. Traditional Chinese medicine is actually a medical science encompassing not only medicine but also philosophy and art in direct contrast to molecular-based modern medicine. As more and more multidisciplinary studies are being published, finding ways to integrate TCM with modern or precision medicine through artificial intelligence, new study design and technology may become a critical issue. This article aims to briefly review the unique philosophy of TCM and its conflicts with modern medicine, with a focus on the potential integration of TCM and modern medicine. We also provide insight for the key attributes of TCM and the associated investigation with Western research approaches. Copyright \u00a9 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.
