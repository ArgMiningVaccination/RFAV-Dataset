{"title": "Uncommon Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination in the Pediatric Population", "author": "Trupti Pandit; Ramesh Pandit; Lokesh Goyal", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Introduction The rapid development of vaccines followed the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is still significant vaccine hesitancy, especially among parents. Large-scale pediatric population-based studies or reviews about vaccine side effects are limited. Data sources and methods The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends recipients or their providers notify possible adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We evaluated Delaware state data from the VAERS system for the pediatric age group. Results A total of 111 reports were reviewed, with summaries of the reported key side effects discussed, including seizures, myocarditis, stroke, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), chest pain, hematuria, menstrual disorder, appendicitis, behavioral and otological side effects, etc. Conclusions We noted the approximate prevalence of reported adverse events to be <0.2%. Further studies with larger sample sizes or those focused on each key side effect are needed to evaluate these side effects in detail. An open discussion about the possible side effects and reinforcing the individual, family, and community benefits are key to promoting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-10-13", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
