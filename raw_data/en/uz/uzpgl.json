Immunisation - why you should By law, a child must have an Immunisation History Statement from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) to enrol in primary school. Children starting school are exposed to a large number of people and a range of potentially dangerous diseases. Immunisation is a proven and safe way to protect children against diseases that cause serious illness and sometimes death. Enrolling in primary school is a good time to check that a child's vaccinations are up to date. Immunisation History Statements An Immunisation History Statement from the AIR is a statement showing the vaccinations a child has received. By law, an Immunisation History Statement from the AIR must be provided to the primary school when enrolling a child, even if it shows that the child has not received any vaccinations. The school keeps a copy of the Immunisation History Statement so that, if there is a disease outbreak, unvaccinated children can be quickly identified and excluded from school until the risk of infection has passed. If the Immunisation History Statement from the AIR is not provided to the school, a child may be excluded from school during a disease outbreak because their immunisation status is unknown. Homeopathic treatment is not a legally recognised form of immunisation.
