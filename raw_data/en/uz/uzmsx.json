SHINGRIX contains the active ingredient glycoprotein E (gE) powder mixed with AS01B adjuvant suspension. SHINGRIX is a vaccine. SHINGRIX is used to protect adults against herpes zoster (also called shingles) as well as the long-lasting nerve pain that can follow shingles called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. SHINGRIX can be given to: - adults from the age of 50 years and above - adults from the age of 18 years and above who are at increased risk of shingles What is shingles and what are the complications related to shingles? Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox (primary varicella infection), the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus can become active again and causes shingles (secondary varicella infection). SHINGRIX cannot be used to prevent chickenpox (primary varicella infection). Shingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several weeks. It may lead to complications such as long-lasting pain (PHN) and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. What is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)? After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting nerve pain is called PHN. PHN is the most common complication of shingles. How does the vaccine work? SHINGRIX helps your body to build its own protection against shingles and its complications. SHINGRIX cannot be used to treat shingles or the pain associated with shingles. It is for the protection against shingles only. 2. What should I know before I am given SHINGRIX?
