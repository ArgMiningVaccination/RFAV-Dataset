The meeting was chaired by Dr. Albert Nana-Arthur, the acting President of the Ghana Association of Alternative Medicine practitioners. Dr. Nana-Arthur was happy that the meeting was held successfully, and called on other alternative medicine associations to also merge to help unify the profession. Prof. Raphael Nyarkotey Obu, on his part, said this is a new era of promoting modern naturopathy, and the merger is a great sign of good things to happen in the naturopathic profession in Ghana. He emphasised that standardisation is very important in any profession and this merger presents a platform to discuss national standards in naturopathy to meet the global standards as advocated by the World Naturopathic Federation, Canada. He further said the new association will be sent to the World Naturopathic Federation for acceptance as a member at the global level. "}
