More and more \"Baby Boomers\" are being told they have Liver Disease, including Hepatitis C. And the \"solution\" is worse than the disease, assuming you actually have it. If you have Liver concerns, knowing what is causing the concerns and developing a well thought out plan of action versus medicating to mask symptoms would be important. To Request an Action Plan to Address Liver Disease [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Fatty Liver Disease What is Fatty Liver Disease? Fatty liver disease means you have extra fat in your [liver](liver-disease.asp). You might hear your doctor call it hepatic steatosis. Heavy drinking makes you more likely to get it. Over time, too much alcohol leads to a buildup of fat inside your liver cells. This makes it harder for your liver to work. But you can get fatty liver disease even if you don't drink a lot of alcohol. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) There are two different types of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Simple fatty liver: This means you have fat in your liver, but you may not have any inflammation in your liver or damage to your liver cells. It usually doesn't get worse or cause problems with your liver. Most people with NAFLD have simple fatty liver. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): This is much more serious than a simple fatty liver. NASH means you have inflammation in your liver. The inflammation and liver cell damage that happen with NASH can cause serious problems such as fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are types of liver scarring, and liver cancer. About 20% of people with NAFLD have NASH. Alcohol-Related Fatty Liver Disease (ALD) Alcoholic fatty liver disease is preventable. It usually gets better when you stop drinking alcohol. If you keep drinking, ALD can cause serious problems. These include: Alcohol-related fatty liver disease usually comes first. It can then get worse and become alcoholic hepatitis. Over time, it may turn into alcoholic cirrhosis. If you drink heavily, talk with your doctor. It's confidential, and they can help you get your drinking under control to save your health. Symptoms of Fatty Liver Disease With ALD and NAFLD, there are usually no symptoms. Some people may have signs such as tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the belly where your liver is. If you have NASH or get cirrhosis, you may have symptoms such as: Causes and Risk Factors For ALD, the cause is too much alcohol. You may be even more likely to get it if you drink a lot and The reason why some people with NAFLD have simple fatty liver and others get NASH isn't known. Genes may be a reason. NAFLD or NASH is more likely if: There are also some less common reasons why you may get NAFLD or NASH. They include: Diagnosis Because most people don't have symptoms, these conditions aren't easy to diagnose. Your doctor may use different methods to find out if you have fatty liver disease. Some of the things your doctor may use to diagnose fatty liver disease are: Treatment for Fatty Liver Disease There are no medications approved for NAFLD, though some are in clinical trials. Usually the first line of treatment is to lose weight. It helps reduce fat, inflammation, and scarring in your liver. Losing just 3% to 5% of your body weight can cut down on how much fat is in your liver. Weight loss surgery is also an option if you have a lot to lose. You'll also need to quit drinking. It's the only way you can keep liver damage from getting worse. You may even be able to undo some of the liver damage that's already happened. Talk to your doctor about how you can get help. You may need a medically supervised detox program to safely quit drinking and manage withdrawal symptoms. If you have complications due to NASH, such as cirrhosis or liver failure, you may need to have a liver transplant. In general, people with NASH who get a liver transplant do very well. Do You Have An Angry Liver? I wrote that title with a point in mind. If one appreciates the importance of the Liver, and the fact that its chief emotion is that of Anger when one suffers from imbalances of the Liver, there is a good chance the emotion of Anger, or one of its cohorts is present. Anger can be expressed outwardly or repressed and kept in, but either way, it will be present. Certainly, it is much better to express your anger in a healthy fashion, as anger acts as a great motivator. Its natural emotional expression supports a movement. It's used by the body to move things around when normal processes aren't working properly. For example, the body will use anger to clear a blocked artery or bowel. Pathologically though, the emotional expression is explosiveness. Involved anger fueled by other emotions or belief systems will cause extensive damage, such as ruptured arteries or broken bones. The surplus will also be stored in the connective tissue to be released later. Does the condition [Fibromyalgia](fibromyalgia-fibrositis.asp) sound familiar to anyone? This is stored emotion within the connective tissue leading to pain because it isn't being released. A common form of pathological emotion is when it is used to 'move' something in our way. A person may be behaving in a way we do not like, so we use anger to move them out of the way. Appreciating other aspects of the Liver are important for overall health. The Liver can be equated to the \"Grand Central Station\" of the body, as everything will eventually need to pass through the Liver at one point or another. The Liver/Gallbladder together function as a partnership and are known in Traditional Chinese Medicine as the Wood Element. They represent the consciousness of the Soul, the storage site of all experience. The Liver is responsible for planning, with metabolic activity and life adaptation. Muscles associated with the Liver are the Rhomboids that hold the shoulder-blades back against the body wall, and the Pectoralis Major Sternal muscles of the chest. The body areas governed by the Liver are the muscles, joints, tendons, and ligaments. Appreciating that piece, you should also appreciate that All Arthritis is a by-product of too many toxins in the Liver. It is because of these toxins overwhelming the Liver, that causes them to be deposited in the tendons and ligaments of the joints, leading to irritation and inflammation. For that reason, it is vitally important for the health of your joints that you keep your Liver clean and balanced. The main People who develop a need for glasses as they get older need to appreciate that it is because they have too many toxins in their Liver, and it is manifesting in the eyes. Most vision problems as one gets older can be equated to Arthritis of the eye. The lens doesn't expand and contract as it once did. It has become more rigid. This can be helped by restoring balance to the Liver. The fluid association for the Liver is the tears, as this helps to bathe the eyes. The taste associated with the Wood Element is sour. The other emotions associated with the Liver that I mentioned earlier are Anger, Irrationality, Frustration, and Aggression. Experiencing any of these on a regular basis will create Liver stress. If you appreciate that there is a natural flow of energy associated with the body, the energy is highest in the Liver between the hours of 1 am and 3 am. Therefore, if you are one who finds yourself waking between those hours of the night, it indicates that you are having trouble keeping your Liver energy balanced. Possible causes of this energy imbalance are usually due to experiencing one or more of the emotions just mentioned, on a regular basis. A good solution to these imbalances would be to come to the office and allow me to restore balance to your Liver by utilizing a very effective and simple technique called [Neuro Emotional Technique](https://www.netmindbody.com). Through NET, I can eliminate the underlying reason for why you are storing these emotions within your Liver and the areas associated with the organ. This will allow you to release them in an agreeable way. I will also help you to develop a plan to change yourself, so you aren't experiencing those emotions on a regular basis. Ask yourself the following questions: If so, you have Liver stress. If you suspect that you have Liver problems, you should come into the office and have [The Liver Detox Evaluation](timetotakeoutthegarbage.asp). It's simply letting me evaluate some of the different reflexes associated with the Liver. If the two of us discover a Liver weakness, we can then determine, through simple muscle tests, all the different components to the Liver weakness. This could include Emotions, Toxicity, Nutritional Deficiencies, Allergies, Structural components or Physiological Imbalances. And if any or all are contributing to the Liver weakness, then we can develop a plan of attack to naturally resolve any of these imbalances, and restore balance to your Liver Probably the most common condition associated with Liver imbalance is [elevated cholesterol levels](high-cholesterol.asp). Since the Liver manufactures cholesterol, too much indicates a Liver imbalance. This is why when the MD's recommend \"Statin drugs,\" they will want to monitor the enzyme levels within the liver to be sure Liver pathology isn't starting to occur. Appreciate that Statin drugs suppress the normal functioning of the Liver which will lead to other complications. The most common of these is [Diabetes.](diabetes.asp) This is not something I recommend doing to yourself. As mentioned earlier, All Arthritis is controlled by the Liver. This includes the inflammatory ones like [Rheumatoid](rheumatiod-arthritis.asp), Metabolic types like [Gout](gout.asp), and Degenerative Osteoarthritis, or Old Age Arthritis.
