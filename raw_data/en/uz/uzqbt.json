MY MOTIVATION TO STAY ON TRACK [View Transcript](#) SHAWN: Hey, guys. It's Shawn again and I want to share with you a little bit about after I started DUPIXENT. When I was prescribed the DUPIXENT medication I- I was told to check out the DUPIXENT MyWay website. And from there, I reached out and arranged for a nurse to come out to my house and walk me through giving myself the injection. And I'd never given myself an injection before, was a little uncomfortable about it. But after she came out and guided me through the steps for efficiently giving myself an injection, I felt a lot more comfortable. They continued following up with me every month, making sure that I- I was comfortable, making sure that I was receiving the medication. And even further, they made sure that even as I switched insurance carriers along the way that anything that they could do to support that process of pre-approval, making sure that I didn't get a lapse in- in medication was really, really important because I had finally found something that worked for me. And like you, I've been struggling to find that for along time. Thanks for hearing about my experience with the DUPIXENT MyWay program. You know, I hope your experience is as helpful as it was for me and certainly wish you the best of luck on your journey.

[View Transcript](#) Transcript DUPIXENT\u00ae (dupilumab)\u2014a medicine with special storage requirements\u2014is what's known as a specialty medicine. That means it may be delivered to you by a specialty pharmacy instead of your local pharmacy. That also means you can expect the process for getting your prescription filled to be different from other medicines you may pick up from your local pharmacy. It will go something like this: First, your doctor writes a prescription for DUPIXENT. Be sure to ask your doctor about enrolling in DUPIXENT MyWay\u00ae, which can provide additional support for you. You or your doctor can download the enrollment form on DUPIXENT.com or call 1-844-DUPIXENT, option 1 to enroll. Next, your prescription may have to be authorized by insurance. This is called prior authorization and is common for specialty medicines. Your insurance company will work with your doctor to get any additional medical information they need. It might feel like this part takes a while, but hang in there. If you have enrolled in DUPIXENT MyWay, you will receive a welcome call from a Nurse Educator while your insurance benefits are being confirmed. Once DUPIXENT is approved by your insurer, a specialty pharmacy works with you to schedule the shipments of DUPIXENT to your home or other preferred location, so be sure to answer their calls to prevent delays. They will not ship your medicine without first confirming delivery details with you. And while everyone's working through the details, look to DUPIXENT MyWay for additional support. You can connect with DUPIXENT MyWay Nurse Educators by phone to receive supplemental injection training, help scheduling deliveries and prescription refills, or help navigating financial support options, such as copay assistance. As a reminder, with all of these folks helping to get you off to good start with DUPIXENT, you may receive phone calls from your doctor's office, specialty pharmacy, and a DUPIXENT MyWay Nurse Educator. Remember to quickly respond to these calls to avoid delays in receiving DUPIXENT. So, now you know what to expect from prescription to delivery. For more information on how to properly store DUPIXENT after delivery, please review the DUPIXENT Instructions for Use at DUPIXENT.com. [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) Because DUPIXENT is a specialty medicine, your prescription will be delivered to you. It also means the process can take a little longer than you're used to.

You can change your perspective to help stay the course. When you're thinking about doing something you consider difficult...or that is just...out of your comfort zone, it's not uncommon to feel nervous or uneasy. But...what happens when those feelings lead to thoughts like, \"I'll never be able to do this\" or \"It's just too hard?\" Thoughts like these can be overwhelming, and may not be helpful. In fact, unhelpful thoughts can negatively affect what you're trying to accomplish...they may even keep you from trying it at all. So, how can you help keep these thoughts from getting in your way? Remember that thoughts are not always facts. If you change how you look at them, you may be able to take their power away. See if you can do that by changing your perspective and looking at this situation a little differently. Try to focus on what you are trying to do and why. What's the reason for doing it? Think about another difficult situation you've overcome. How did that situation affect you? Recognize that you don't have to take on challenges alone. Who or what can support you in this situation? Take time to get familiar with the task at hand. What resources can you use to help guide you? Taking this different view might just be what's needed to help you stay the course and give this thing a try! Of course, even after you decide to do it, nervous feelings and unhelpful thoughts might still come up...but that's OK! Just remind yourself: Thoughts are not always facts. And if you can change how you view them, you may be able to change how you feel and help keep yourself on track. Before long\u2014and with proper training and practice\u2014you can start feeling more confident to tackle the challenge, time and again. You may even notice that what you saw before as unfamiliar and intimidating might not be as difficult to navigate as you thought. So...let's do this! See if you can change your thoughts to help build your confidence and work toward your goal. Whenever you are facing a situation that's making you feel nervous, remember: You have the power to change your thoughts and look at things from a more encouraging perspective. - Remember to keep your reason for doing this in mind to help guide you along the way. - Tell yourself that you've tackled challenges before. You can do it again. - Rely on resources to help you through difficult situations. Feeling supported can build confidence. - Focus on what you want to accomplish and what you hope to gain. Watch this video whenever you need a reminder of how you already have and can continue to tackle new challenges. Have questions?

HELP YOURSELF STAY ON TRACK WITH YOUR TREATMENT Ask yourself these questions: [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) Who Are the People I Can Reach Out to If I Need a Little Extra Support? (Example: Is there a family member or good friend who can sit with you while you're giving yourself or receiving an injection? Don't forget you can also contact the DUPIXENT MyWay Nurse Educators at 1-844-DUPIXENT [(1-844-387-4936)](tel:1-844-387-4936) for support) What Could Motivate Me to Stay On Track With Treatment? (Example: Can you set a date on your calendar to reward yourself after you've given yourself or received a second or third dose?) Why Did I Start Treatment in the First Place? (Example: Think back to the day you and your healthcare provider made the decision to try DUPIXENT. What treatment goals were you hoping to work toward?) HOW DOES DUPIXENT HELP HEAL SKIN FROM WITHIN? [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) DUPIXENT, a biologic, is a type of medicine that is processed in the body differently than oral medicines (pills) or steroids. In order to be effective and work properly, biologics are injectable medicines. DUPIXENT works by targeting an underlying source of inflammation that could be a root cause of your eczema. It helps heal your skin from within for noticeably clearer skin and less itch. Track your progress to monitor changes over time. \"No Treatment Will Work for Me.\" [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) It's normal to wonder if a treatment will be effective. Not everyone will respond the same way to treatment. One way to know how you are responding to treatment is to track your progress. You can write down your symptoms when you notice them. You could also take pictures of eczema patches regularly. Remember, eczema can look different in individuals depending on skin tone, and the severity of symptoms may vary. Consider using a journal, such as your DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Journal, to keep track of all your symptoms so you can share more information with your healthcare provider. Together, you can ensure that you get the most from your treatment. RESULTS IN ADULTS DUPIXENT was studied in 3 clinical trials with more than 2,100 adults with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis).

LOOK TO OUR NURSES FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT [View Transcript](#) I grew up in a very small town\u2014one stop light, if you blink you might miss it. Very quaint. The small-town environment lends to the type of work that I do, more one-on-one with our patients. My name is Shari and I'm a registered nurse with DUPIXENT MyWay. I chose to be a nurse because I wanted to help people, and I believe that people should be in service to others. Being a nurse for DUPIXENT MyWay is very rewarding. I really enjoy the patient interaction. I'm ready to make a difference. I'm ready to help our patients to have the confidence to proceed with their journey. Our nurses work remotely from our homes. So, we step into our offices, we're going into a nice relaxing environment. When our patients call in, they get to speak to a real person, a experienced clinician who can provide them support along their journey. We provide general product support and education, as well as supplemental injection training, and injection and refill reminder calls. Every day is different depending on the type of calls that we have. Some of the common questions we get: \"How much is it going to cost me?\" \"When will I get started?\" \"How do I take my DUPIXENT injections when I'm traveling?\" We have multiple resources available for patients. We have the ability to send out package inserts that include all the important safety information for DUPIXENT. For patients wanting a copay card, they can access that by visiting our product website at DUPIXENT.com. One of my favorite parts of providing nursing care to our patients is being able to walk them through their journey, hold their hand through the process, just to give them confidence along the way and we always want them to know that they have our support. LAURIE, Field Nurse I'm Laurie. I'm a registered nurse with DUPIXENT MyWay. I've been with DUPIXENT MyWay since the very beginning. I give supplemental injection training to the patient and the patient's caregiver. When I was very young, I knew that I wanted to be a nurse. I wanted to go out and make a difference and help people. When I get the order for the patient, I get really excited. I travel to see the patients\u2014sometimes for hours. I make sure that I gather all of the things that I may need to help the experienced person, and then the person that's never even touched a needle. I think it's very important for me as a nurse to go and teach these patients. Not only to teach them how to give themselves the medicine, but also to just come and give them encouragement, and show them kindness and patience. When I go to see the patient, I can't wait to travel, no matter how far it is. I have a training kit that has a training syringe in it. And that helps us so that we can practice before we do the real thing. I can't wait to go and meet them, and see where they are in their life, and be excited for them. I help them to relax. Sometimes they can just take a deep breath, we'll go slow, think about their favorite place, think about something that reminds them and makes them happy and calms them down. I went to this patient's house and he seemed very standoffish. You could tell that the patient was just not comfortable. He was anxious, he wouldn't give me eye contact. So, I asked the parents, \"would it be OK if I just come back the next day?\" I think it's very important to just be patient. Make it into their routine and let them go at their own pace. We have time. They have set aside this time for us to learn. And for me to teach. Sometimes at the end of the training, I'll get some questions about, \"You know, we did great today, but what else? What if when you leave, I don't know what to do and it's time for me to give myself my injection again?\" I can refer the patient to the DUPIXENT website for more resources and there's also a Nurse Educator phone number. I like to go out and do this job. It's just really neat. It's neat to go in and get to know people. DUP.23.04.0076 [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) DUPIXENT MyWay provides support from nurses, either virtually or via phone. Take a minute to watch these nurses explain how they may help throughout the treatment journey with DUPIXENT. REFER BACK TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) The DUPIXENT Instructions for Use is a helpful reference and should be read prior to administration. Once you feel confident, you can take steps to successfully make DUPIXENT part of a regular routine and help stay ahead of eczema symptoms. The 200-mg pre-filled syringe and the 300-mg pre-filled syringe are approved for use in adults and children 6 months of age and older.

[Pre-Filled Syringe 200-mg Pen 300-mg Instructions for Use](https://www.regeneron.com/sites/default/files/Dupixent_300mg_PFP_IFU.pdf) YOU'RE USING DUPIXENT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CONTINUOUSLY TREAT YOUR ECZEMA But do you have concerns or doubts that could hold you back from achieving that goal? [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) Wherever you are in your treatment with DUPIXENT, try taking a few photographs of your skin as it is right now. Keep these photographs handy and refer to them to see any changes. Measure any progress you may have made, and even share it with your doctor to help you keep sight of your goal. MAKE YOUR ROUTINE WORK WITH TIME, PRACTICE, AND COMMUNICATION [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) When you or your child were first prescribed DUPIXENT, your healthcare provider showed you how to administer subcutaneous (beneath the skin) injections and provided guidance, such as the need to choose a different injection site each time. But even if you still feel a little nervous about using an injection such as DUPIXENT, you may find it gets easier with time and practice. Let your healthcare provider know if you ever have questions about self-injection or administering the injection to your child. Do not try to prepare and inject DUPIXENT until you or your caregiver have been trained by your healthcare provider. In children 12 years of age and older, it's recommended DUPIXENT be administered by or under supervision of an adult. In children 6 months to less than 12 years of age, DUPIXENT should be given by a caregiver. \"My Treatment Isn't Working as Fast as I Hoped.\" [SEE MORE](javascript:void(0);) You and your healthcare provider decided that DUPIXENT was right for you, but you may be wondering why you are not yet experiencing results.
