Acupuncture is also gaining more popularity in other countries. About 2000 years ago, acupuncture was first developed in china where it was used for relieving pain and other symptoms. Keeping pace with appreciated use of acupuncture in treating low back pain, various research organizations such as National Institutes of Health are concerned with exploring the worth of acupuncture in controlling nausea and vomiting related to different conditions such as pregnancy, chemotherapy, or following an operation. Various other studies are being undertaken to know the benefits of acupuncture for treating addiction to cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. Moreover the role of acupuncture in relieving headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma has also been recently studied. The treatment of acupuncture is comprised of very thin stainless steel needles that are placed into the skin of the patient at certain specific locations. It is believed the needle insertion will reactivate the normal functioning of different organs of our body. According to the traditional Chinese interpretation about the human body, proper flow of natural energy is extremely important for the normal functioning of our body. This natural form of energy flows through 12 \"meridians\", located in different parts of our body. Moreover our body also has several thousand specific \"acupoints\" that play a significant role in controlling various diseases and their symptoms. According to the traditional terminology, the force of energy is called \"chee\", which is believed to possess both good and bad qualities. The balance between these two phases of life force i.e. the yin (a dark female force), and the yang (a light, male force), are involved in controlling every characteristic feature of the human body. Therefore acupuncture is concerned with maintaining the balance of these energy forces through the activation of acupoints that are united with different meridians. Acupuncture is generally painless and with the use of disposable needles there is only a rare risk of developing any infection when performed by a skilled person. Modern science does not agree with the concept behind acupuncture, but despite that, many people have found it to be very favorable for them. In the United States, treatment of acupuncture is easily available and is in fact covered under some health plans. The treatment of acupuncture is less expensive when compared to other allopathic treatments. Currently several studies are in progress to compare the effectiveness of acupuncture in respect to other treatment options, but results are still pending. The practice of acupuncture is safe and effective, if performed by an expert. Adverse effects such as infections and punctured organs are rarely reported. The decision for treating low back pain with acupuncture technique depends upon the individual opinion. Many people prefer acupuncture as it is an ancient therapy that had been used for thousands of years. Today, acupuncture is widely accepted all over the world, because of its effective results as well as eliminating the excessive use of drugs which can produce various side effects. Although the efficacy of acupuncture is not scientifically proven, it is a popular option for treatment of low back pain. One should always consult their physician or spine care provider before going for acupuncture therapy for low back pain. "}
