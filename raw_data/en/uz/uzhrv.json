Thus, in white light meditation, we focus our energy on healing and use visualization to [cultivate greater health and well-being](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-health/). White Light Meditation And The Yoga Sutras White Light Meditation, also known as Jyoti Dhyana in Sanskrit, translates to \"meditation on the inward light by a spiritual aspirant.\" It was first documented in The Yoga Sutras, which according to sage Patanjali, concentration and meditation are the ingredients to understanding the ultimate reality. The verse on Jyoti Dhyana in the yoga sutras translates loosely to: \"Vishoka Va Jyotismati - concentration on the inner light leads to a state which is beyond sorrow.\" Benefits Of White Light Meditation Like other meditation techniques, regular white light meditation practice can help calm your mind, relax your body, and rebalance your nervous system. However, the unique visualization technique is believed to bring meditators further benefits, such as: - It may assist in the healing of physical ailments and diseases. - Rejuvenates your body and mind - Increases [positive energy and helps you control negative feelings](https://www.theyoganomads.com/negative-energy-cleansing/)like anger and frustration - Reduces stress and [anxiety](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-anxiety/) - Clears the mind and increases focus - Enhances intuition and inner vision - Activates, cleanses, and balances the [seven chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakras/) - Helps you foster a deeper connection with the universe (higher power).

Then, once you get comfortable with the process, give the extended version a go. Short White Light Guided Meditation - Find a comfortable position. You can do this meditation seated or lying down. - Place one hand on your [solar plexus chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/yellow-chakra/), between the belly button and chest, and the other on your sacral chakra, just below the belly button. - With closed eyes, turn your attention to your breathing.

This will help you turn your attention inwards. - Imagine a brilliant white light floating all around your body, shining intensely. - As you inhale, envision this healing light entering your physical body, penetrating your skin, tissues, and bones.

Tips For Meditation Success If you're new to meditation or visualization, here are a few additional tips to get you comfortable with the practice. Practice In A Quiet Place When we first start to meditate, many things may distract us. So one way to minimize distractions is to choose a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. If you live with others, especially children, choose a time when they are not around if possible. Another way to block out any background noise that may distract you, such as people talking, is to play soft meditation music. For the white light meditation, I recommend listening to music tuned at the frequency of the crown chakra of 963 Hz, like this [Crown Chakra Healing Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNIPSfwxwTw). Use A Meditation Cushion Aside from minimizing distractions, a comfortable posture is another key to successful meditation. You can do the white light practice seated or lying down, but I don't recommend the latter unless necessary, as it can be too easy to fall asleep. There are several ways to make [a seated meditation posture more comfortable, such as sitting with your back against a wall, on a chair, or using a meditation cushion](https://www.theyoganomads.com/meditation-cushion-sets/). If you're serious about starting and maintaining a regular meditation practice, I recommend a cushion set like this one from [Bean Products](https://www.amazon.com/Bean-Products-Zabuton-Meditation-Cushion/dp/B07BQDC31F/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=S6RV4M9KDMVK&keywords=meditation+cushion+set&qid=1670664257&sprefix=meditation+cushion+se%2Caps%2C346&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExRENQV1VGUEhSMUoxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODQ5MTYzMk0yTU4xNkE5UUtEWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjA2MzkzM0VMOFRSSzZMV0xTNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&tag=theyoganomads-20). It contains both a [Zafu](https://www.theyoganomads.com/zafu-meditation-cushion/) (round-shaped) cushion and Zabuton (large, rectangular cushion). The Zafu elevates your hips to prevent [joint or spine pain](https://www.theyoganomads.com/yoga-wedge/) and improve posture. Meanwhile, the Zabuton provides cushioning for your feet and ankles. Be Patient Lastly, like all types of meditation, you may not immediately feel the positive effects of the white light healing energy. Moreover, if you are new to visualization, it's normal to struggle to envision the white light healing energy and maintain focus on this imagery. Thus, start with the shorter meditation, easing yourself into it. If you get distracted and lose the visualization, don't be hard on yourself. Instead, observe the distraction and return your awareness to your breath for a few moments before continuing. FAQS What Does White Light Represent? For centuries, the power of white light has been known to hold the most electrifying energy. White light is believed to be a combination of every visible wavelength of the spectrum. Using it in meditation can create significant changes in the magnetic field of our physical, psychic, emotional, or mental states of awareness. The color white is also associated with the crown chakra (Sahasrara), located at the top of the head. This energy center is responsible for our connection to the divine, expansion of consciousness, and flow of life energy. It is believed that when our crown chakra is healthy and open, a pure white light glows in our aura. Can meditation really heal you? If you're skeptical about the claims of white light meditation, I highly recommend the book [Meditation As Medicine: Activate the Power of Your Natural Healing Force](https://www.amazon.com/Meditation-As-Medicine-Activate-Natural/dp/0743400658/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2XQIUCH3U4GRH&keywords=healing+meditation&qid=1670640369&sprefix=healing+meditation%2Caps%2C335&sr=8-7&tag=theyoganomads-20). Written by Dr. Dharma Singh Khalsa, Meditation As Medicine explains the power of medical meditation based on scientific research. It also features various healing meditations, each having a specific physiological effect and targeting a different ailment, such as arthritis, ulcers, or cancer. What Does It Mean If You See White Light When Meditating? Some people claim to [see a white light when meditating](https://mindworks.org/blog/why-do-some-people-see-white-light-during-meditation/) without trying to visualize it. It is believed this happens because meditation stimulates the pineal gland. The pineal gland is located deep in the brain at the level of the third eye chakra. Thus, some people also believe that seeing white light naturally during meditation indicates that your third eye chakra is opening. What Light Should You Meditate In? Generally, a dimly lit room is best for meditation as it helps to calm the mind. However, meditating in the dark is best when using visualization techniques. If you don't like to meditate in pitch black, light candles or turn on a warm-toned bedside light. [ Salts lamps](https://www.amazon.com/V-C-Formark-Himalayan-Release-Negative-Changing/dp/B07TSMCXX7/ref=sr_1_11?crid=22755411L5I6J&keywords=meditation+light&qid=1670666969&sprefix=meditation+ligh%2Caps%2C366&sr=8-11&tag=theyoganomads-20) are also fantastic for providing soft lighting and setting the right ambiance. Final Thoughts On Meditation White Light Science has proven our bodies possess the ability to heal themselves. However, many aspects of modern-day life, such as poor diet, high-stress levels, and lack of sleep, hinder its ability to make us better. Visualization meditation is one way we can help our bodies help us while increasing positive energy, focus, and mental clarity.
