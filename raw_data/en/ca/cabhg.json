Language establishing the Commission was included in the legislation we spearheaded which created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at NIH. The Commissioners are: In a White House press release announcing the Commission appointments, President Clinton said \"We need to be able to use information about alternative therapies to set the national agenda for the education and training of health care practitioners in this field and provide recommendations for advisable coverage policies for alternative therapies As we enter into the 21st century, we need to get better information to ensure American families have access to the best and most cost-effective health care.\" The Commission is charged with developing a set of legislative and administrative recommendations to maximize the benefits of complementary and alternative medicine for the general public. Its report to Congress is due in March 2002, and must address the following: (a) the education and training of health care practitioners in complementary and alternative medicine; (b) coordinated research to increase knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine practices and products; (c) the provision to health care professionals of reliable and useful information about complementary and alternative medicine that can be made readily accessible and understandable to the general public; and (d) guidance for appropriate access to and delivery of complementary and alternative medicine. At the initial Commission meeting on July 13, Peter Reinecke, Legislative Director for U.S. Senator Harkin, encouraged the Commission to develop a comprehensive plan for gathering public comment. How the final report is received, he noted, will greatly depend on the degree they succeed in doing so. According to Mr. Reinecke, Senator Harkin also encouraged the Commission to focus on the following: 1. Training - What should the criteria be for eligibility for federal loans and grants?; What can/should the federal government do to encourage continuing education?; What can be done through Medicare support?; 2. Research - What can be done to encourage greater public investment in CAM? He also reminded the Commission that it is not necessary for them to comment on the NIH research agenda, as there is already an NCCAM Advisory Council charged with that responsibility; 3. Delivery - What criteria should the federal government use for inclusion of CAM into federally supported health care programs? 4. Oversight - There are many federal departments with an interest in CAM and ongoing activities. Is that at the appropriate level, and how can it be coordinated? The Commission plans to hold a series of town meetings around the country, in addition to its regular meetings, in order to gather as much information as possible from a broad range of practitioners, researchers, consumers and academicians, among others. The first town meeting was September 8th in San Francisco; the second is scheduled for Seattle on October 30th. Other meetings are listed below. The Commission will also soon be launching a web site where visitors can read the minutes from prior meetings, identify opportunities for providing comment at future meetings, and eventually read the draft Commission report to Congress. AAHF will be working closely with the Commission over the next two years, and we encourage all interested parties to submit testimony on issues they believe should be brought to their attention. The Commission's final report will help determine national public policy for CAM and will dramatically affect the future of health care in this country for years to come. Let's not waste this opportunity. Meeting Dates: September 8, 2000 San Francisco, CA Town Hall West Coast/Region IX October 5-6, 2000 Washington, D.C.
