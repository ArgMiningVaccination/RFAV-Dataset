Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a system of holistic mind/body/spirit wellness rooted in evidence-based science with more than 5000 years of history. While TCM is very effective in treating acute conditions, it excels at uncovering patterns of disease and treating root causes of illness. Complex and chronic illness often manifests from underlying disharmony that unfortunately Western Medicine too frequently misses or does not effectively address. TCM can provide understanding, realistic hope, and life-changing treatment for patients who may have exhausted other available treatments. The goal of Traditional Chinese Medicine is to re-establish balance, to enable your body to heal itself. Your experiences, your current state of wellbeing, and your goals and motivations are unique; establishing and sustaining your unique harmonic balance requires a personalized, responsive, holistic approach to wellness. In clinical practice Jenece undertakes a comprehensive diagnostic assessment and creates an individualized treatment plan tailored to address your current needs, condition, and comfort. The goal is optimal and enduring wellness.
