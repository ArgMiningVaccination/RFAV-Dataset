They involve treating the skin and the individual as a whole rather than as separate entities. Our state of mind has an immense effect on our skin and overall health, and what we consume mentally, physically and emotionally shows up externally.

This treatment features multiple holistic elements that address skin health and mind/body wellness. Sound Healing Everything has a vibrational frequency that affects us in a positive or negative way. The sound frequencies and vibrations of [sound therapy](https://www.wellspa360.com/business/article/21154202/the-healing-power-of-sound-therapy) help slow down brain waves to a deeply restorative state which activates the body's system of self healing. Gua Sha Facelift Gua sha is a natural and ancient Chinese healing technique that helps promote the flow of chi, or energy, in the skin. It reduces puffiness, brightens and softens fine lines and wrinkles, and promotes [lymphatic drainage](https://www.wellspa360.com/wellness/therapies/news/22552367/wellness-trend-lymphatic-drainage-treatments). Immersive Meditation The skin is like a mirror, reflecting a person's state of mind. Fear, stress and worry are often root causes of many skin issues, and meditation is the perfect practice that brings a sense of peace, calmness and awareness. During this facial, clients are immersed in a 25-minute guided meditation that helps them focus on their energy. [Related: Emerging Trends in Meditation](https://www.wellspa360.com/business/industry-experts/article/22353526/emerging-trends-in-meditation) Reiki Healing [Reiki is an ancient Japanese technique](https://www.wellspa360.com/wellness/therapies/article/22525968/chakralicious-20570-reiki-your-allinone-tool-for-energy-healing-and-protection) that calls upon universal healing life force energy and helps restore clients on a cellular level. We all have energy fields that support our health and vitality, and we experience disharmony in the body when they are blocked. Reiki helps clear out these blockages and move the energy for the greater good. Guests can reap the benefits of reiki healing while listening to their guided meditation. All of these healing modalities, combined with gem-infused skin care, creates a unique experience that transports clients into a deep state of relaxation, ultimately enhancing their well-being and leaving them with an inner and outer glow.
