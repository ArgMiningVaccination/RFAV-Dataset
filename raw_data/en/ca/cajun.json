Admissions Policy In keeping with its philosophy and objectives, the College will admit all applicants who are high school graduates, General Educational Development (GED) recipients, and home schooled students who have completed senior-level curriculum. Also, those who give evidence, through previous academic, field work, and/or personal qualifications that they are capable of achieving success in their chosen program of study will be admitted. In addition, adults who are not high school graduates will be admitted if they are 18 years of age or older and give evidence of being able to benefit from a course offered by the College. However, federal legislation requires that students who are not high school graduates or recipients of a GED must prove their ability to benefit (by specific testing) in order to be eligible to receive funding for their college education. When you are accepted to the College you are not ensured admission to all of our programs. The College reserves the right to limit enrollment in college parallel and career curricula. Students who do not meet the College's academic standards or those who do not meet special admissions requirements will not be accepted into selective programs. Once formally accepted, you should take placement tests prior to registration. After you complete your placement testing, you will receive registration dates and will receive help in selecting your courses. Students who apply early and follow the correct admission procedure will be able to take full advantage of all advising College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 1services. They will also have a greater selection of courses from which they can choose. Graduation rates, transfer out rates and campus crime data required by the Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act are available upon request from the Admissions Office, 610-861-5500 or online at www.northampton.edu.

Concurrent enrollment students may enroll in one or two classes at NCC if they are seniors in high school or in the last year of a home school curriculum and have demonstrated the academic ability to benefit from course offerings at the College. All students must have approval of their school districts. Final decision to admit a concurrent enrollment student rests with the College. Students who are in academic difficulty or have been expelled or dropped out of high school are not eligible for concurrent enrollment. Such students will fall under the regular College admissions policy, which requires students to be 18 years of age and give evidence of being able to benefit from courses offered by the College. All requests for concurrent and dual enrollment are processed through the NCC Admissions Office.

Northampton Sponsoring School Districts Bangor Area Northampton Area Bethlehem Area Pen Argyl Area Easton Area Saucon Valley Nazareth Area Wilson Area Placement Testing Policy The college uses placement tests to assess skills in reading, writing, mathematics and English as a second language (ESL).* The results are used to place students into courses where they will have the best opportunity to succeed. Courses are available for students who need developmental work as determined by placement testing. Before registering for credit courses, students must take the placement tests (or provide other evidence of English or Math eligibility). If students need developmental work, they must begin that work in their first semester at the college and continue until the requirements are completed (which may take several semesters). Students who test into both developmental writing and reading are required to enroll in the corresponding Counseling (COUN---) course as outlined in the Placement Guidelines. Developmental course work does not count toward degree requirements. Students who place into developmental courses can retest once before starting those courses. Students may not take the test while enrolled in a developmental course. Some students may be placed into English or Mathematics courses as a result of PSSA, ACT, or SAT scores, or previous degrees or courses. Students must furnish the appropriate evidence of previous testing or experience before registering for courses. If they do not furnish evidence, they must take the placement test before registering. * Students whose first language is not English should contact the ESL department for testing and placement. If students have low reading or writing scores on the English Placement Test and their first language is not English, they will be referred to the ESL department for ESL testing and placement. Requests for accommodated testing must be submitted through the Office of Disability Services.

TransferringTransferring In Northampton Community College will accept credits when transferring from another institution when: 1. Credits earned at U.S. colleges and universities are accredited by the following regional associations: Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools New England Association of Schools and Colleges North Central Association of Colleges and Schools Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Western Association of Schools and Colleges 2. Credits earned from a foreign institution are evaluated by an evaluation agency such as World Education Services Inc. or Educational Credential Evaluators Inc. and a copy of the evaluation sent directly to NCC. For more information concerning WES, please contact the NCC Admissions or Records Office 3. Courses taken through the military are provided to the College on the official DD295 form or AARTS transcript 4. The course grade is C or better. Courses taken on a pass/ fail basis may be accepted only if the official transcript states that a \"pass\" grade is equivalent to a C or above 5. The course content is equivalent to a Northampton course 6. The course is applicable to the student's Northampton program 7. Transcript is official (sealed, delivered directly to the Northampton Admissions Office). A maximum of 45 credits with up to 75% of total program credits may be transferred to Northampton toward an associate's degree (maximum of 50% may be credit by exam). Admissions determines transferability of credits for new students and change of majors into the allied health majors the Registrar determines all other transferability of credits. Transferred credits are added to a student's record upon final verification of enrollment (after the refund period of a student's first semester). Grades do not transfer (no effect on NCC GPA). Transfer with a Bachelor's degree A student possessing a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university and enrolling at Northampton in an Associate's degree program shall be considered to have completed the general education core requirements except for required courses identified by the program faculty. Check with Admissions Office for approved list of general education courses transferrable into each program. Transferring Out College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 7More than half of the students at Northampton are enrolled in transfer programs. The College will recommend for transfer those students whose personal qualities and academic achievement indicate that they will succeed at other institutions. Although a C average is usually considered minimal for transfer, the specific average required varies with the selective admissions policy established by each individual institution. The transfer of specific courses normally depends upon appropriateness of completed work to the intended transfer program. Generally, courses completed with a grade of C or better receive transfer credit. The maximum amount of transfer credit varies by college, but normally 60 to 70 credit hours of applicable course work can be transferred. The final decision regarding admission and the acceptability of transfer credit hours rests with the receiving institution. A course-by-course reference guide is available for your use in the Northampton Advising and Transfer Office. The guide indicates how individual NCC courses transfer to many of the four-year institutions in eastern Pennsylvania. Some course guides are on the advising and transfer services web page. The fact that freshman and sophomore requirements vary considerably among senior colleges suggests that students should discuss their transfer plans with both a faculty advisor and an advising specialist, who will help plan a program as near as possible to the requirements of the intended transfer program. Unless there is no doubt that the student will transfer to a particular college, it is generally advisable to take courses at the College which are as close as possible to those offered at those colleges which might be considered for transfer. Articulation Agreements NCC has over 100 articulation agreements with more than 30 colleges and universities. Articulation agreements are signed by two institutions to make the transfer process easier for students. There are several types of articulation agreements that NCC has with various institutions. Most offer the greatest benefit to students who earn an associate degree then transfer to complete a baccalaureate degree. The most common types of agreements are explained below. Dual Admissions agreements allow students to apply to both NCC and the partner four-year institution. Typically, students are provisionally accepted to the four-year institution provided they meet the admissions criteria outlined in the agreement. Admissions criteria usually require a student to earn an associate degree with a minimum grade point average. Dual admissions agreements are good for students who know before coming to NCC the four-year institution they want to attend. Core-to Core agreements guarantee that credit earned by students who complete an A.A. or A.S. degree at NCC will be accepted towards the core requirements at the four-year institution. Core requirements are the general educationportion of a baccalaureate degree. General education requirements vary among institutions. Students benefit from core-to-core agreements because all of the credit earned from the associate degree is applied to the four-year program without evaluating individual courses. Typically, there are also admissions criteria for transfer students outlined in the agreement. Program-to-Program agreements are designed to map out the curriculum necessary for students to earn an associate degree at NCC and meet the requirements for a corresponding baccalaureate degree at a four-year institution. The agreements stipulate the exact major courses, general education courses, and electives students should take to make a seamless transfer. Take your Credits with You Pennsylvania has an innovative statewide transfer system that allows up to 30 foundation credits to be transferred from one participating college or university to another, anywhere in the state. pacollegetransfer.com offers all the information you need to make full use of this transfer system.

It allows community college students who earn an A.A. or A.S. degree with a GPA of 2.0 or higher to be accepted to a SSHE university. It also guarantees the acceptance of up to 60 credits to be applied towards a Baccalaureate degree entitling a student to junior status. The first 45 credits will be used as general education requirements with the additional 15 credits applied to major requirements or electives. Although this agreement allows students to be accepted at the 14 SSHE universities it does not guarantee acceptance to selective admission or enrollment capped programs. Other criteria will be used for these programs. Programs eligible for Academic Passport at NCC are: Biology, Business Administration, Chemistry, Communication Studies, Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Education, Engineering, Fine Art, General Studies, Individual Transfer Studies, Journalism, Liberal Arts, Math/Physics, Social Work, Sport Management, and Theatre.

The program is unique in that each student works with the four-year institution and designs a curriculum to meet the specific requirements for the major at the baccalaureate institution. The program consists of a three-part curriculum which includes: The current general education core for the associate in arts (A.A.) programs The addition of one Humanities and one Social Science to the general electives The remaining credit hours will align with the requirements at the transfer institution. The Individualized Transfer Program ensures that students take only those courses at NCC which are required by the four-year institution to which they intend to transfer. This option is intended for students who have identified their baccalaureate institution of choice. The student must meet with an advisor at the four-year institution to pre-plan a program of transferable courses. These Northampton courses will fulfill the general distribution requirements and other courses that are required at the four-year institution. This enables students to get a head start on their baccalaureate degree with an associate's degree from Northampton. Program Information All the academic programs within the College are designed to help you meet your goals. Northampton offers programs that will transfer to four-year colleges and universities, as well as those that prepare you to step right into today's competitive work force. At Northampton, all curricula have a general education component that serves as a solid base for your education. In addition, in each academic program, you will find that the majority of courses give you specific skills and training designed to prepare you to meet your transfer or career objectives. The College's faculty are specialists who make teaching their first priority. You'll gain knowledge in your chosen subject area from a combination of classroom lectures, group projects, and hands-on laboratory work. You will also benefit from the expertise of members of our advisory committees, composed of successful individuals from the region who advise the College about particular changes in the workplace. General Education Core Curriculum The General Education Core Curriculum is an essential component of all degree programs. Courses in the Core fall into two broad categories: Knowledge of Arts, Cultures and the Natural World, and Intellectual and Practical Skills. Students are exposed to a broad range of academic disciplines and fields of study in order to provide a strong foundation of content knowledge and intellectual skills. Certificate programs usually require six credits of general education courses. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 9Transfer Education Many of Northampton's courses are designed to transfer to four-year institutions that is, they contain roughly the same material as similar courses at those institutions. Students who intend to continue their education after Northampton should take as many transferable courses as possible within A.A. or A.S. degree programs. The receiving institution ultimately determines the transferability of courses. It is advisable that students consult early with the Admissions Office of the institution to which they plan to transfer. Technical Education Technical education or career education describes a category of courses designed to develop highly skilled graduates prepared for entry-level positions in a particular occupation or group of occupations. Northampton's career education programs, which prepare students for employment immediately upon graduation, usually contain a strong complement of technical education courses. These courses carry credit toward the associate in applied science and associate in general education degrees. They are not designed for transfer. Developmental Education Developmental education helps students learn the skills needed for success in college-level courses. These skills include the essentials of reading, writing, and mathematics, and proven strategies for achieving their academic goals. Developmental education services are provided through these means: Placement testing in math, reading, and English determines the eligibility of students for developmental courses. Some courses numbered below 100 (0XX) are designed to allow students to remedy specific deficiencies in mathematics, reading, and writing. Among them are PreAlgebra, Elementary Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Reading Fundamentals, Critical Reading, Basic English, and Chemical Calculations. NOTE: While courses below 100 each carry credit for determining student load and for financial aid, those credits may not be applied to any degree or certificate granted by the College. The Learning Center provides tutoring, workshops, and study skills support to promote the academic success of developmental students. Tutoring options include study groups, classroom tutors, Supplemental Instruction, individual appointments, walk-in hours, and online hours.English as a Second Language The College supports English language learners by offering courses for college credit through the English as a Second Language (ESL) Department. Students work toward proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking skills. Course work ranges from the beginner level through the advanced level and prepares students to succeed in other college courses or in communities of their choice. Students are supported with tutoring services, a computerized language lab, and academic advising, all with a special attention to the needs of English language learners. Higher levels of ESL can be taken at the same time as other college courses upon the recommendation of an ESL advisor. Students take an ESL placement test to assist with proper placement into classes. Special Studies and Special Topics Courses In some semesters the College offers special studies courses, of one to four credits, that are designed to give variety to the present curriculum and reflect current interests. Special studies courses are offered by almost all of the College's academic departments. The specific topic to be covered is announced at the time a special studies course is scheduled, along with any applicable enrollment requirements or prerequisites. Up to 12 credits of special studies courses may be applied to a student's program, insofar as they fit into the program requirements. (A special studies course may be repeated if a different specific topic is offered.) Special studies courses that are later approved as on-going courses in substantially the same form will not be counted toward the 12-credit limit.

Course Withdrawal, Refunds, Class Changes, and Adjustments Students who wish to withdraw from either a course or the College must receive official authorization from the Records Office. Failure to withdraw officially may result in the recording of an F grade. A student who is asked to leave the College for misconduct or delinquent attendance will receive no refund of tuition or fees. Students who withdraw with the approval of the Records office prior to the beginning of a semester and the date specified in the College Calendar, will be entitled to a 100 percent refund (or adjustment) of tuition and fees, less the non-refundable admissions deposit and any amounts owed to the College for fines, returned checks and other charges and fees. In addition, a student who withdraws during the following specified periods will be entitled to the applicable refund (or adjustment) of tuition and fees, less the admissions deposit, student fees, and any amounts owed to the College per the schedule below. Specified dates for each semester are listed in the College Calendar. All refund payments will be made payable to the student except for a) contractual third party payments - refund payable to the third party named, and b) excess parents plus loan funds - refund payable to the parent named Refund Rates 75% - First week of class or equivalent for non-standard session College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 12 50% - Second week of class or equivalent for non- standard session 25% - Third week of class or equivalent for non- standard session * A standard session is considered as 15 weeks. Room and Board: A separate refund schedule applies to housing and meal plan charges. This schedule is published in the Residence Life Handbook and made available to students in the Office of Student Activities and Housing. Please note that a drop or withdrawal does not absolve a student's financial responsibility for his/her educational expenses. The student is responsible for payment of charges outstanding after the drop or withdrawal is processed and charges are adjusted. Special Note to Financial Aid Recipients: In accordance with federal and state guidelines, a drop or withdrawal may reduce a student's financial aid award. As a result, the student may owe a balance to the College. Any amounts owed after adjustment of the financial aid award is billed to the student. In the event of serious injury or illness which is certified by a physician, the student will be granted a full tuition credit, if that documentation is received at the time the student withdraws from the College. Such credit may be applied toward tuition costs only upon his or her return to the College. This credit will be cancelled if it is not used within a one-year period after the student has taken leave from the institution. Tuition credit will not be granted if a student received academic credit from courses in which he or she is enrolled. Students called to involuntary active military duty may be eligible for a full tuition credit or full tuition refund upon receipt of the appropriate application and supporting documentation as specified at the time of withdrawal. Tuition refunds are subject to financial aid regulations. Financial Obligation Payment for tuition and fees is due, in full, by the semester tuition due date published in the academic calendar. No student will be considered registered until all obligations have been fully satisfied. In order to receive a refund or adjustment of charges, a student must complete an official course withdrawal during the stated refund periods. The college reserves the right to cancel a student's registration if full payment is not received by the due date established each semester. Financial aid must be pending on the student account in order to be deducted from the balance due on the tuition and fees bill. Expected financial aid that is not pending by the tuition due date cannot be deducted. Students who do not meet their financial obligations may not be permitted to register for a subsequent semester, receive official transcripts or grades, or participate in graduation.Students may also incur additional collection costs and legal fees. Tuition Payment Plan NCC offers a tuition payment plan option that spreads payment for tuition, fees, room and board throughout the semester. Enrollment in the payment plan is due as follows: Fall - July 15 Spring - December 15 Summer I - April 15 Summer II - April 15 Re-enrollment must be repeated each semester. Contact the bursar's office for additional information. Financial Aid Since its founding, Northampton Community College has been committed to offering excellence in education at a moderate cost. While NCC adheres to the principle that students and their families have the primary responsibility to pay for college costs as their means permit, financial assistance programs represent a bridge between a family's ability to pay and the cost of higher education. Last year, the College awarded approximately $30 million in financial assistance to over 6,500 full and part-time students. The NCC Financial Aid Office administers many types of financial assistance including federal, state, private and institutional financial aid programs to help students meet their educational costs. Most financial aid awards are made on the basis of financial need. A student's financial need is determined by deducting the student's expected family contribution (EFC) from the cost of education. To qualify for financial aid, you must demonstrate financial need while maintaining academic progress. Financial aid awards must be applied to educational expenses such as tuition, fees, books, room, board, supplies, transportation or other educational costs. Financial aid awards may consist of grants and/or scholarships (funds which do not have to be repaid), loans (low interest loans which require little or no payment while a student is attending college on at least a half-time basis), employment (money which a student earns through work either on or off-campus) or a combination of these sources. Foundation Scholarships To encourage and assist students, NCC also offers over 500 scholarships to students who meet donor requirements. Funds for scholarship assistance are provided through the efforts of the Northampton Community College Foundation and the generosity of community leaders and friends of the College. The NCC Foundation was established in 1969 as a private, non-profit corporation to support educational programs and activities that cannot be funded through the College's regular College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 13income sources. Northampton's scholarship program is the largest among community colleges in Pennsylvania. Students must complete the financial aid application process to be considered for scholarships. A list of available scholarships, and any additional information required, can be viewed on the College's Web site. How to Apply for Financial Aid To apply for financial aid at Northampton Community College a student must: 1. Complete and submit an NCC Financial Aid Information Form available at www.northampton.edu/ Admissions/Financial-Aid.htm 2. Complete and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) via the Web at www.fafsa.gov (A student or parent can apply for a PIN number to electronically sign the FAFSA at www.pin.ed.gov ) New students should not wait to be admitted to NCC before applying for financial aid. Returning students must annually reapply for financial aid for each academic year a student wants to be considered for financial aid. The Northampton Community College financial aid priority application deadline is March 31st. Students who complete their financial aid application by the priority deadline will be notified of their eligibility for aid before tuition is due for the following Fall semester. The priority application deadline for the Spring semester is October 1st of the previous year. While financial aid applications are accepted throughout the year, it is important to meet the priority application deadlines if a student expects financial aid to help pay his/her semester tuition and fee charges by the tuition due date. Eligibility To receive aid, a student must meet the following eligibility requirements: 1. Be a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen with a valid social security number 2. Be enrolled in an eligible academic program 3. Be a high school graduate, have a recognized General Equivalency Diploma (GED) or meet the \"ability to benefit\" guidelines established by the federal government 4. Be an undergraduate student who has not previously earned a bachelor's degree (for most types of aid) 5. Not be in default on any previous student loan nor owe a repayment on an adjusted federal grant 6. If male and age 18-25, be registered for Selective Service 7. Comply with Northampton Community College's Academic Progress Policy requirements.Student Employment NCC offers on and off-campus jobs to students who have financial need through the Federal Work Study Program. A student's earnings under this program are not credited to the student's account, but are paid to the student every two weeks. Students are responsible for securing their job by interviewing with the job's supervisor. A list of available positions can be found on the Work Study link on the Financial Aid page of the NCC Web site. Students who are interested in community service positions should contact the Work Study Coordinator in the Financial Aid Office. Veteran's Benefits We are proud to be a Veterans Administration (VA) approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL). Veteran Affairs in the NCC Financial Aid Office handles certifications of enrollment to the VA for the Montgomery GI Bill and other education benefit programs. It is a veteran's or qualifying dependent's responsibility to notify Veteran Affairs of enrollment, changes in enrollment, termination of student status or changes of address and phone number. Failure to do this could jeopardize current or future benefits. Questions about VA benefits and programs should be directed to the Financial Aid Office at 610-861-5508. Academic Progress Policy All students must be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree, certificate or specialized diploma in order to establish or renew eligibility for participation in any of the Federal or State financial aid programs. The Higher Education Act requires institutions to establish academic progress standards that contain qualitative and quantitative measurements of progress. The act also requires a maximum time frame for completion of the program. The provisions included in Northampton's academic progress policy are based on federal requirements and are applicable to all students applying for federal aid including the Federal Parent Loan (PLUS). Copies of the policy and the appeal procedure are available at the Financial Aid Office and are distributed to all financial aid recipients with their financial aid award letter. I. Completion Rate and Grade Point Average A student must successfully complete seventy-five percent (75%) of all credits attempted at NCC. Students may receive financial aid for repeated courses, but the credit hours earned for the course may be counted only once. A student must maintain a minimum required grade point average based on the total number of credits attempted including transfer credits. Total credits attempted include courses in which a student receives a grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F, P , N, R, W , or I. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 14Total Credits Attempted Including Transfer CreditsMinimum GPA Required 9-16 1.50 17-30 1.75 31-45 1.90 46+ 2.0 II. Maximum Time Frame For federal financial aid eligibility students must complete their program within a maximum time frame not to exceed 150% of the length of the educational program. This includes all semesters of enrollment even if no aid was received. Once a student attempts more than 150% of the credits that it normally takes to complete his/her program of study, he/she is no longer eligible for financial aid. Example: Length of Program MaximumTime Frame 60-credit program 90 credits attempted 30-credit program 45 credits attempted Note: If an exception is made to the maximum time frame requirement due to a change in major, once the student attempts more than 120 credits (including transfer credits) for a two-year program or more than 60 credits for a one- year program, he/she is no longer eligible for financial aid. Students who have completed the required number of credits for their program of study and are applying for financial aid must submit a graduation plan to the Financial Aid Office. Additional financial aid is contingent upon approval of the graduation plan. Questions about this policy should be directed to the Financial Aid Office (610-861-5510). Appeal Process Students who do not meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements have the right to appeal. All appeals must be in writing and must be submitted within 45 days of the date of the notice of denial. The appeal form should be submitted to Northampton Community College, Financial Aid Office, 3835 Green Pond Road, Bethlehem, PA 18020. The appeal should include an explanation of the extenuating circumstances which resulted in the student's inability to meet the requirements. Information about the student's plan to make up any deficiencies should also be included. Note: PA State grant eligibility is based on standards set by the State agency. Institutional appeals do not cover State grants. Loss of State grant eligibility may be appealed directly to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) in cases of illness or death in the family.Evaluation An evaluation of academic progress will be done after the end of the spring semester or when students reapply for financial aid. Students who do not meet the requirements will be notified within ten days of the completion of the evaluation. An evaluation will be done at the halfway point of the program for students enrolled in one-year programs. PHEAA has its own standards of progress for state financial assistance. Federal Financial Aid Recipients Who Withdraw The 1998 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act requires the College to calculate a return of federal student aid funds for students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) from all classes on or before the 60 percent attendance point of the semester. Using the Federal formula, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student's earned versus unearned federal student aid funds. The number of calendar days spent attending classes is divided by the number of calendar days in the semester. The unearned portion of federal student aid funds will be returned to the appropriate aid program. Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Direct Loan Subsidized Direct Loan Perkins Loan Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Pell Grant Program Academic Competitiveness Grant Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Students receiving financial aid who withdraw from all of their classes may not receive further financial aid disbursements, may lose some or all of the aid that has already been disbursed to their account and are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of unearned federal student aid funds. Students who stop attending all classes without officially withdrawing will be subject to the return of federal funds at the end of the semester based on the 50 percent point of the semester. Notification of Award Students who have their financial aid applications completed by the priority application deadline will be notified of their eligibility for aid by the tuition due date. They will receive a financial aid award letter. Included with the award letter are instructions, conditions governing awards and disbursement information about how and when students will receive financial aid funds. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 15Financial Aid Information Financial aid application forms and information are available from the NCC Financial Aid Office in the Student Enrollment Center at the Main Campus, the Enrollment Office at the Monroe Campus, the Fowler Family South Side Center, and on the Financial Aid page of the NCC Web site at www.northampton.edu/Admissions/Financial- Aid.htm. You can call the NCC Financial Aid Office at 610-861-5510. Policies: College / Academic Academic Probation Policy Northampton Community College is committed to the academic success of its students. Students who do not achieve a cumulative grade point average in accordance with the following standards will be placed on academic probation: Cumulative Attempted CreditsCumulative GPA 12-25 1.40 26-37 1.60 38+ 1.80 Students placed on academic probation are subject to the following conditions: Students must meet with an academic probation counselor and develop a plan for improved academic performance. Students on probation for a first semester will be limited to maximum enrollment of 13 credits. Additionally, students may have some restrictions placed on them regarding the types of courses they take. The academic probation counselor will recommend action based on the meeting with the student and after review of the academic record. This action may include requiring students to take specific courses. Any student who has been placed on academic probation for two consecutive major semesters may be academically suspended for up to one academic year. If a student is academically suspended, he/she may appeal the suspension. A committee comprised of an Advising staff member, the appropriate Academic Dean, one faculty member from each academic division and the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee will review the appeal and make a recommendation to the Vice President for Academic Affairs whose decision is final. Appeals must be made at least 6 weeks prior to the start of a fall semester, or 5 college days prior to the spring semester. Students who are academically suspended more than once and who do not make academic progress upon return to NCC will be dismissed from the institution for a minimum of three years. Academic Recognition Dean's Honors List - students who complete a minimum of six credit hours per semester, and who achieve a semester grade point average of not less than 3.50, will be carried on the Dean's Honor List as a mark of academic distinction. Graduation Honors - students who complete a minimum of 30 credits hours of coursework in the graduation major at Northampton, and have a graduation grade point average of 3.50 or higher in any degree, certificate or specialized diploma will be graduated with honors. The graduation grade point average includes only those courses used toward the graduation major. Academic Restart Policy The Academic Restart policy is intended for students who attended NCC in the past and compiled an unsatisfactory academic record. This one-time-only option allows students to redirect their academic goals and permits students to reset the NCC Grade Point Average and the Cumulative Credits earned. Eligibility is determined by: The student has not enrolled at NCC for at least three (3) consecutive academic years and has not earned an NCC degree. The student has a previous cumulative grade point average below 2.0. The student has not been granted the Academic Restart previously. The student has earned a grade point average of 2.0 or higher in a minimum of 12 credits since returning to NCC. The previous record will remain on the transcript however, it will not be used in the computation of the new grade point average. Students may use non-developmental level courses they completed with a grade of C or better prior to Academic Restart toward completion of graduation requirements, but grades for these courses will not affect grade point average calculation. Interested students must complete an application and meet with a member of the Advising Office. Academic Restart will be recorded on the student's transcript upon certification by the Advising Office. Note: Given federal and state student aid regulations, the student is not relieved of academic progress requirements for financial aid eligibility, even if restart approval is granted. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 16Some colleges will not accept courses prior to Academic Restart. Advanced Placement Policy All students may earn credit through the 1) College Level Examination Program (CLEP), 2) Excelsior Examination Program, 3) NCC challenge examinations, 4) Advanced Placement Program of the College Board, 5) military and non-traditional courses approved by the American Council on Education (ACE), and 6) credit for life experience. A student must be enrolled in NCC courses to have such credits applied to the NCC transcript. All external examinations, ACE approved courses, and credit for life experience will be equated to NCC courses by appropriate department faculty. Criteria for NCC challenge exams and life experience assessment will be reviewed on a periodic basis to insure currency with existing course requirements. Students wishing more information on any of the above, except CLEP and the NCC challenge examination, should contact the Admissions Office. CLEP is administered through the Library and challenge examinations through the Records Office. Eligibility All new applicants and currently enrolled students are eligible to apply for credit in any of these programs. Any form of advanced placement credit earned is added to the student's transcript upon final verification of enrollment (after the refund period of a student's first semester). Credit Limits A maximum of 30 hours of credit will be granted through any of these programs or any combination thereof. In accordance with degree requirements, no more than six of the last 15 hours of a degree may be credit earned under this policy. Record of Credits Advanced placement credit earned will be entered on the student's transcript with specific reference to the test or method used for granting credits Departmental Challenge Exams NCC departmental challenge exams are available for certain designated courses. Subject to faculty approval, students may challenge a course only one time and may not challenge a course in which they have been enrolled beyond the first three weeks of the semester, or the equivalent time in a shorter course. Courses must be challenged in sequence. If a course has a prerequisite, that prerequisite must be fulfilled through course work or credit by examination acceptable to the College before a challenge examination may be taken. Internships and courses numbered 0XX will not be available for challenge. Credit for NCC challenge examinations win be awarded for scores determined by faculty to be at a passing level. For information about the availability of departmental challenge examinations, students should contact the Records Office.Credit through CLEP or Excelsior College Students may take the CLEP examinations at either NCC Library or a national testing center. Excelsior examinations may be taken at any Sylvan Learning Center after test registration has been completed through Excelsior College. Credit for CLEP tests and Excelsior exams will be awarded for scores recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) for the former and Excelsior College for the latter, unless a Northampton department performs its own research and determines a more appropriate cut-off score. Credit for Advanced Placement exams taken through the College Board The College awards credit to students who successfully completed Advanced Placement (AP) courses and who score three or above on the AP examination. No grades will be awarded. Department faculty will determine courses to be accepted, credit to be awarded, and equivalency of each course to NCC courses. The Admissions Office will maintain a list of Advanced Placement courses approved by faculty. Credit for Military and Non-Traditional Training Credit will be awarded based on recommendations by the American Council on Education (ACE), unless a Northampton department performs its own research and determines a more appropriate recommendation. Credit for Life Experience Criteria for each course will be developed (if appropriate) by the academic department to establish the proof of knowledge/learning gained by experiences outside the classroom. Credit will be awarded upon faculty evaluation of presented portfolio. The Admissions Office will have a list of portfolio criteria needed for assessment of student's life experience. Equating Credits All methods of advanced placement will be equated to NCC courses or general electives as approved by department faculty. The Admissions and Records Office will maintain a list of approved equivalencies. Students who have successfully completed any of these advanced placement methods prior to or while attending NCC may request an evaluation of credits earned. Grades Only credits will be recorded on the transcript for any advanced placement credit awarded no grade will be given. Students who earn credit through this policy and later take the equivalent course at NCC will be given credit and grade earned only for the NCC course. Appeals Academic Appeals Appeals of grades, appeals of penalties for academic dishonesty, and appeals of actions related to the policy on Professional Conduct, will begin informally through College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 17discussion between the student and the faculty member involved and will proceed, if continued, through a series of formal steps culminating in a hearing before an Academic Appeals Committee, which will present its findings and recommendations for a decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. No final recommendation can be made without a quorum. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs will be final, unless it differs from that of the committee in such cases, the student may appeal to the President, whose decision is final. The appeals procedure is a student-motivated one the responsibility to keep the action in progress rests primarily with the student. Academic Appeals Committee The Academic Appeals Committee reviews matters related to appeals of grades, appeals of penalties for academic dishonesty, appeals of actions related to the policy on professional conduct, and waivers of graduation requirements. The Academic Appeals Committee shall be composed of the following: 5 full-time faculty members (at least two shall teach at the Monroe campus) elected to a two year term at large from Academic Affairs, one Student Services faculty member elected by that cluster, and four students (at least 2 shall attend classes at the Monroe campus) appointed for a one year term by the Student Senate and/or Monroe Student Governance. A quorum shall consist of the following: 7 persons - including 3 faculty members, 2 students, one student services faculty member and a dean (appointed by the President to hear the case). The Registrar may be asked to attend as an ex- officio member. Appeals Not Covered Under Other Policies Students may appeal a decision made by an administrator responsible for a department or division to the Vice President for Academic Affairs or Vice President for Student Affairs. The Vice President's decision will be final unless stated otherwise in specific College policy. Academic Honesty - Policy and Appeal Procedure Northampton Community College considers honesty to be essential to the learning experience. Academic honesty is one of the values that we expect members of the NCC community will apply in their work on this campus and take into their lives beyond NCC. Violations of academic honesty harm the learning experience and violate the expectations and values that we hope the NCC community embraces. We expect all members of the NCC academic community to conduct themselves and their work ethically and honestly. Student Responsibilities Students are solely responsible for their work and for making sure that their work represents their own honest efforts to meet the goals of the course. They are responsible for learning and following the policies and expectations of the college and for understanding the consequences of actions that violate the policy on academic honesty. They are responsible for showing that the work they present is theirs in whatever ways are deemed appropriate by the faculty for the course. Faculty responsibilities Faculty members are responsible for demonstrating academic honesty in their work. They are responsible for making their expectations related to academic honesty clear to their classes including which activities and resources are allowed and the consequences for violations in their courses. They are responsible for communicating about violations of the academic honesty policy to students and their division Dean and to the Vice President for Student Affairs. Academic Honesty Violations Violations of the academic honesty policy include any actions that attempt to gain academic credit for work that does not represent the student's own efforts and knowledge. They include, but are not limited to the following situations and examples: Cheating on examinations and quizzes- Using notes, materials, and/or mechanical, electronic or technological devices not authorized by the instructor during examinations or quizzes. Providing or receiving help on an examination or test in a manner not authorized by the instructor. Buying, selling, improperly obtaining, or using any tests or examinations. Posing as another student or allowing another student to pose as you when taking an exam or quiz. Altering or adding answers on exercises, exams, or quizzes after the work has been graded. Plagiarizing - Using the ideas or words of others without appropriate quotation and documentation that acknowledges the source or sources -- in other words, presenting someone else's work as one's own. Copying, exact words, phrases or sentences without quoting and giving credit to the source. Using a paraphrased version of the opinions, work, or ideas of others without giving credit.

Tampering with or damaging the work of others or preventing others from completing their own assignments. Penalties When a faculty member believes that a student has committed acts that violate the academic honesty policy, he or she will advise the student of the offense and the penalty imposed. A faculty member may apply one of the following penalties: A written warning, with the requirement that the assignment be redone within the instructor's specified time. (Faculty members are encouraged to report the incident and action to their division Dean and to the Vice President for Student Affairs using the Academic Dishonesty Report Form.) A failing grade for the assignment or test. (Faculty members are encouraged to report the incident and action to their division Dean and to the Vice President for Student Affairs using the Academic Dishonesty Report Form.) An \"F\" grade for the course. If a faculty member issues an \"F\" grade in the course as a penalty for academic dishonesty, he or she must send a written report of the instance of cheating or plagiarism and the action taken to the division dean and the Vice President for Student Affairs using the Academic Dishonesty Report Form. If the faculty member has given an \"F\" grade for the course as a penalty for a violation of academic honesty, a student may not withdraw from the course while the matter is under appeal or if it is resolved that the \"F\" grade stands. Appeal procedure-charges of academic dishonesty If a student wishes to appeal a charge of academic dishonesty or the penalty imposed, the student should follow these steps: Step 1 If the student wishes to respond to the accusation, he/ she must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member at a formal meeting within ten working days of the notification. If the student and faculty member accept a specific resolution offered by either of them, the matter shall be considered closed. If such a resolution cannot be reached, the student may formally appeal the action of the faculty member within three working days after the meeting with the faculty member. Appeal forms and procedure will be available in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Note: working day is defined as any day when a full schedule of classes are in session (this excludes Saturdays and Sundays). Step 2 Within three working days of the meeting with the faculty member, the student may request in writing that the appropriate dean should call the meeting within five working days to include the student, faculty member, and program director, if any. After this meeting, the dean will send all parties involved a written recommendation within three working days. Students who do not agree with the recommendation in Step 2 may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee within three working days. This appeal must be submitted, in writing, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Step 3 Students initiate appeals to the Academic Appeals Committee (within three days of notification of outcome of Step 2) by requesting a hearing through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A hearing will be scheduled as quickly as possible, and all parties to the appeal will be informed of the date, time, and place of the meeting. The faculty member will delay recording the grade for the work in question until the appeal is decided. The Academic Appeals Committee will decide whether evidence sustains or does not sustain such charges of academic dishonesty, and whether the penalty is consistent with the stated policies and recommend a decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, whose decision is final unless different from the recommendation of the committee in such cases, the student may appeal to the President, whose decision is final. If evidence does not sustain such charges in the opinions of the committee and the Vice President for Academic Affairs, all records in the student's file related to this charge will be expunged. If evidence does sustain the charges and the appeal relates to the penalty, the committee may recommend the following actions: College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 191. The assigned penalty will be supported. 2. The faculty member may be asked to reconsider the penalty in question. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will communicate in writing a decision to the student, faculty member, and the Vice President for Student Affairs no later than three working days after the hearing. Recurring violations of academic dishonesty If the student is reported to have violated the Academic Honesty policy repeatedly, the Vice President for Student Affairs shall request the Discipline Committee to consider the student's dismissal from the college. Attendance Policy Class attendance and engagement in the learning process are critical factors in determining students' success in their courses. NCC students are expected to attend all class sessions of courses in which they are enrolled, and are responsible for all material presented in class sessions of these courses. However, a student who misses class more than twice the number of weekly meetings of the class* (or the equivalent in short term courses) may be withdrawn from the course by the instructor. Students who are withdrawn for poor attendance will receive a grade of W . Faculty may issue a withdrawal through the first 90% of the semester (14th week or equivalent in short term classes*). After the 90% period, a student may not withdraw or be withdrawn. In an internet-based online learning course, a student is considered to have missed the equivalent of more than twice the number of weekly meetings of a traditional classroom course in a consecutive two-week period if there has been no participation by the student in the class through submission of assignments, participation in discussion forums or contact with the professor in any way during the period. Students who are withdrawn from the class for lack of attendance may appeal the enforced withdrawal to the instructor. If the Instructor agrees to reinstate the student, he/she will be required to complete a reinstatement form and return it directly to the Vice President for Student Affairs. If the appeal is denied, the student may speak with the appropriate academic dean and/or the Vice President for Student Affairs. Further discussion may take place with the faculty member, but the final decision on the withdrawal rests with the faculty member. * Clinical and lab courses my have a different application of this attendance policy and it will be so noted on each syllabus. Audit Policy A student may apply to audit a course. Auditing students are not required to take examinations and do not receive grades or earn credits for the class.Enrollment for the purpose of auditing shall be on a space available basis. Priority in class enrollment shall be given to students desiring to take courses for credit therefore enrollment for audit purposes will only be permitted during the first week of the semester. Auditors must be eligible for admission to the College. A student can only audit a course one time. Auditors pay standard tuition and fees. The student should identify himself to the instructor as an auditing student and discuss parameters of participating in classroom discussions. If a student wants to change from audit to credit, all prerequisites must be met. The change must be made by the end of the refund period for that course with the consent of the instructor. Instructors may request of the Vice President for Student Affairs that an auditor be officially withdrawn from the course if the auditor is interfering with the learning process. Class Load A minimum full-time class load is 12 credit hours. Students registering for 12 or more credit hours in either the fall or spring semester or for 8 or more in any summer session must have approval from an academic advisor. Students will not be allowed to take more than 19 credit hours for either the fall or spring semester or more than 13 credit hours in the summer unless required by their academic program. Exceptions will only be granted for students who have a G.P .A of at least 2.75, advisor recommendation, and Registrar approval. Completing an Associate's Degree in Two Years The number of credit hours that a student must carry in order to complete a program within a two-year period will vary depending upon his or her major field of endeavor. Please consult the Catalog program description for the variation in credits required by each program. Students who elect to pursue a minimum full-time load (12 credits) each semester cannot graduate in two years unless they complete significant credits during the summer. Additionally, if students must take developmental courses, it is likely that their timeframe will be lengthened. Students are encouraged to review all this information with their academic advisor and to discuss the option that presents the strongest opportunity for academic success. Classification of Students Students attending the College will be classified as follows: Freshman: Successfully completed fewer than 24 credit hours Sophomore: Successfully completed 24 or more credit hours College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 20Final Examinations All courses will end with some \"culminating experience,\" a final examination or project-based assessment that integrates the learning of the whole semester. Each course will be assigned a time during the final exam period, at which a final exam may be given or other \"culminating experience\" be assigned a deadline. Except for performance-, production-, and critique-based \"culminating experiences,\" which may run the course of several weeks, no \"culminating experiences\" may be expected of students before their scheduled final exam times. Faculty is encouraged to use the last week of instruction for assimilative or integrative activities wherever instructionally appropriate. No tests of any kind, except for short (less than 15 minutes) quizzes or science lab practicals, may be given during the last week of instruction. Grading Grading System A plus/minus grading system is used at the College. Using the plus/minus system is an option for faculty, not a requirement. Grades will be available online at Spartan Net at the end of each regular semester. At the end of the seventh week of classes, faculty will submit to the Records Office the names of all students whose performance in a particular course to date puts them at risk of failing the course. The Records Office will communicate this information to those students by the end of the eighth week of the semester. Grade Evaluation Points/Credit Hour A Superior 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B Above Average 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C Average 2.0 C- 1.7 D+ 1.3 D Below Average 1.0 F Fail 0.0 P Pass I1 Incomplete N Not released R Released X No grade submittedIP In progress L Audited T Transfer Credits Z Successful completeion of course, challenge process TZ Credits accepted through articulation agreement W2 Withdrawal WP 3 Withdrawal, Passing WF 3 Withdrawal, Failing Grade* Course repeated - this grade IS NOT included in GPA Grade** Course repeated - this grade IS included in GPA 1. An incomplete grade (I) is given only when the student had obtained, in advance, the permission of the instructor to postpone completion of specific course work for a valid reason. (Refer to Incomplete policy.) 2. A student may withdraw from a class in which he or she is enrolled through the 90% point in the instructional period. 3. Through summer 2007, students who withdrew from a course through the first 2/3 of the instructional period received a grade of W . After that point, and through the end of the semester, student received a grade of WP or WF. The grade of WF counted as a grade of F in the student's grade point average. Grade Changes Any grade changes by a faculty member must be made within five months of the end of the semester in which the original grade was issued. Withdrawal from a course is a final action. No change to the final grade is permitted in the case of a W . Grade Appeal Grades are assigned by the course instructor. Students may appeal a final grade only in the cases where they are alleging a serious computational error in the grade or in cases where they allege unfair treatment in the application of a course policy or procedure. When a student wishes to appeal a grade, final or part of a semester's work, he or she must follow the appeal procedures for grades, and those involved in the appeal may recommend only the following actions: The assigned grade may be supported. The faculty member may be asked to reconsider the grade in question. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 21Appeal procedure-grades Step 1 If a student wishes to appeal a grade, he or she must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member within ten working days. To appeal final grades or grades assigned in the last week of the semester, the student must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member at a formal meeting during the first week of the next regular semester unless arrangements can be made to meet prior to that time. If no agreement can be reached, the student may file an appeal in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and proceed to Step 2. Note: working day is defined as any day when a full schedule of classes are in session (this excludes Saturdays and Sundays). Step 2 Within three working days of the meeting with the faculty member, the student may request in writing that the appropriate dean should call the meeting within five working days to include the student, faculty member, and program director, if any. After this meeting, the dean will send all parties involved a written recommendation within three working days. Students who do not agree with the recommendation in Step 2 may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee within three working days. This appeal must be submitted, in writing, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Step 3 Students initiate appeals to the Academic Appeals Committee (within three days of notification of outcome of Step 2) by requesting a hearing through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A hearing will be scheduled as quickly as possible, and all parties to the appeal will be informed of the date, time, and place of the meeting. It is the responsibility of the student and the person(s) whose decision(s) is (are) being appealed to provide the committee with evidence, documentary or otherwise. The appellant may be accompanied by a college friend. Having heard the cases of appellant and objects of appeal, the committee will deliberate in private and recommend a decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, whose decision will be final unless different from the recommendation of the committee in such cases the student may appeal to the President, whose decision is final. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will communicate in writing a decision on the appeal no later than three working days after the hearing. GraduationEligibility To be eligible for graduation, a student must meet the minimum number of credits for a degree, certificate, or specialized diploma and must earn a graduation GPA of 2.00 (only courses for the credential are calculated.) Developmental course work does not count towards graduation requirements. This policy cannot be appealed. Honors at Graduation See Academic Recognition. Waiver of Graduation Requirements To waive graduation requirements, a student must secure a form from the Records Office and delineate complete justification for such a request. The student must submit that completed form to the Records Office. The Records Office then submits the form for approval to the program dean/ director, the instructor, and the dean/director responsible for the course(s) for which waiver is sought. If there is any disagreement among the three approving parties, the request will automatically be referred to the Academic Appeals Committee for disposition. The Academic Appeals Committee will recommend approval or disapproval of the petition. Incomplete Policy An incomplete grade of I is issued only at the student's request with the permission of the instructor to allow completion of specific course work the student did not complete due to valid, unforeseen circumstances. These circumstances include: serious illness of the student, serious illness or death in the student's immediate family, etc. The student must request the Incomplete grade from the professor before the last class meeting of the semester and the professor may approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, the professor will outline, on the incomplete form, the work the student must complete. The deadline for completing the course requirements is no more than five months - or sooner as designated by the professor - after the date grades were due in the semester in which the I grade was issued. The professor will designate that the incomplete grade become a specific letter grade if the work is not completed. This grade may not be a withdrawal (W). An Incomplete grade in a prerequisite course may make a student ineligible to take the subsequent course. Placement Testing For detailed information, see Placement Testing. Prerequisite Policy Students are required to have fulfilled the prerequisites for each course in which they enroll for credit. If a student enrolls in a course without having fulfilled the prerequisites, the instructor or the Registrar may withdraw the student from the course. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 22A prerequisite may be waived in special circumstances by the course instructor or the dean in the absence of the instructor, in response to a student's request. If the waived prerequisite is a required course in the student's program, the student must satisfy the requirement with a course approved by the dean. Repeated Courses The College allows a student to repeat any course once for any reason. This is subject to availability in limited enrollment courses (see special policy for re-admission, re-entry into limited enrollment courses). Students in developmental courses may repeat a course twice, if necessary. A student, who fails to earn credit or to satisfy a grade prerequisite after enrolling in a course for the second time (or third time if it is a developmental course), may not register for the course for two academic years after the last attempt. If a student enrolls in a class more than the allowed number of times without permission, the student can be removed. Grades for all repeated courses will appear on the student transcript. The credit hours for the course may be counted only once unless the course description states otherwise. Only the highest grade earned will be used in calculation of the cumulative grade point average. Appeals to this policy may be made to the Director of Advising & Transfer Services who, in consultation with the appropriate faculty, will make a decision. Further appeals can be made to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and that decision shall be final. Special Policy for Re-Admission, Re-Entry into Limited Enrollment Courses Any student who does not successfully complete a major course* in a program which has limited enrollment may retake that course only if space is available. Priority will be given to students entering the program for the first time and to those students who have successfully completed the core courses and have maintained continuous enrollment. * A major course is a course which carries the prefix of the student's program. Withdrawals Schedule Change and/or Withdrawal A change of class from one class section to another is accomplished only with approval of the Records Office. Failure to seek official approval may result in the recording of an \"F\" grade. No courses may be added to a class schedule after the first week of a semester or equivalent time in short-term classes.Students may withdraw from classes in which they are enrolled through the 90% point of the semester (the end of the 14th week in a 15 week semester, or equivalent in courses that run on a non-standard schedule) and an instructor may issue a withdrawal for poor attendance through the same period. Any student who officially withdraws, or is withdrawn by the instructor during this period will receive a grade of W for the course. Policy for Academic Withdrawal from Allied Health Programs (Nursing, Dental Hygiene, Surgical Technology, Radiography, Sonography, Funeral Service Education, and Veterinary Technician) Any student who does not successfully complete* two (2) courses (either two different courses or the same course twice), or one (1) eight credit course, that carries/carry the prefix of the student's Allied Health program, regardless of when in the program curriculum the unsuccessful attempt occurs, will be withdrawn from his/her Allied Health program. The student will be notified in writing by the program director/coordinator. A student who is withdrawn from an Allied Health program during the first or second semester of the program may apply through the Admissions Office to be reaccepted into the program with the next applicant group. Reapplication to the program does not ensure reacceptance. If the student is reaccepted into the program the student will be required to repeat the unsuccessful major courses in the program when they are offered. A student, who is withdrawn from an Allied Health program during a summer session, the third semester, or the fourth semester, may request reinstatement to the program by meeting with the program director/coordinator within ten working days. A student who is reinstated in the program must successfully complete all future major courses, to not do so will result in the student being permanently withdrawn from the Allied Health program. *Note: unsuccessful course completion is defined as a final course grade of less than 75% or an \"F\" in a P/F course. Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act Graduation rates, transfer out rates, and campus crime data required by the Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act are available upon request from the Records Office, 610-861-5494, the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, 610-861-4558, or Campus Security. Student Rights and Responsibilities A student has the right to pursue an education in an environment that is conducive to the free flow of information and ideas. At Northampton Community College, College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 23a student is encouraged to express him or herself through speech and actions and to actively participate in decisions affecting the educational process of the College. With rights come responsibilities. A student has the responsibility to realize that his or her actions must not interfere with the College's function as an educational institution and with the rights of others. The current student handbook contains the full student's rights and responsibilities document. Policy on Student Professional Conduct Documented evidence of a student's failure to conduct herself/himself in accordance with professional codes of conduct (i.e. Departmental and Host Facilities Code of Ethics, Policies on Clinical Procedures, Departmental Policies and Procedures, etc.) could result in serious academic penalties, up to and including failure in the course or dismissal from the academic program. If a student wishes to appeal any action taken under this policy he/she should follow the procedures for appeal of grades. Transfer Recommendation Policy To receive an unconditional recommendation for transfer from the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, a student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 and no prior disciplinary record at NCC. Students who do not satisfy the two aforementioned requirements may receive a conditional transfer recommendation.

A student may graduate under the requirements in effect during the year of entry into the program, those in effect during the year of re-entry (as described above), or those in effect during the year of graduation. Formal application for graduation must be made by submitting the designated form to the Records Office prior to the date stipulated on the College calendar. Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring that they have met all graduation requirements. Any student who wishes to earn either a specialized diploma or certificate as well as an A.A., A.S., or A.A.S. degree in the same program must earn the certificate or specialized diploma first. Students seeking a second major or second degree must complete requirements for the second program with at least 15 different credits. Additional requirements for specialized diplomas: The specialized diploma program will have no less than 6 credits and typically no more than 30 credits. At least one-fourth of the credits or a minimum of nine credits, whichever is greater, must be earned at Northampton. Additional requirements for certificates: The certificate program includes a minimum of 30 credits, and must include six credits outside the particular field, taken from the general education core. College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 24 At least one-fourth of the credits or a minimum of nine credits, whichever is greater, must be earned at Northampton. Additional requirements for all degrees: The degree program includes a minimum of 60 semester hours of credit. At least 15 credits applicable to the degree sought must be taken at Northampton. Of the last 15 hours prior to receiving an associate degree, nine hours must be taken at Northampton. A.A. and A.S. Degrees An A.A. degree is defined as requiring 12 credit hours of humanities, 12 credit hours of social science and 9 credit hours of mathematics and science. The following programs lead to the associate in arts degree: Business Administration Communication Studies Middle Level Education: Grades 4 - 8 Secondary Education Fine Art General Studies Individualized Transfer Studies Journalism Liberal Arts Social Work Sport Management Theatre An A.S. degree is defined as requiring 12 credit hours of humanities, 6 credit hours of social science and 24 credit hours of mathematics and science. The following programs lead to the associate in science degree: Biological Science Chemistry Computer Science Computer Information Systems Secondary Education: Mathematics and Science Engineering Math/Physics Sports Medicine: Athletic Training In addition to the specific requirements for the A.A. and A.S. degrees, there is a General Education Core for both the A.A. and A.S. degree with the minimum requirements listed on the following page. Curriculum framework for degrees An associate in arts degree should contain: A minimum of 50 percent common or general knowledge (humanities and social science preliminary courses, and at least one science or math course) A minimum of 25 percent contextual knowledge (science, mathematics, and pre-specialization courses in humanities or social sciences). An associate in science degree should contain: A minimum of 33 percent common or general knowledge (humanities and social science preliminary courses) A maximum of 67 percent scientific and technically related courses (mathematics and science within technical A.S. degrees like engineering, mathematics and science should roughly equal technical courses in number of credits). An associate in applied science degree program should contain: A minimum of 33 percent common knowledge (humanities and social sciences courses and one math or science course) A minimum of 50 percent and a maximum of 67 percent technical and technically related courses. Mathematics and science are essentially technically related, contextual courses in all curricula, but they are critical to the effectiveness of most A.A.S. degrees they may appear as \"purer\" contextual courses in the technically related category and as applied courses in the technical category. Frequency of offerings Courses listed in this catalog are generally offered at least yearly, unless otherwise noted in course descriptions.

General Education Core Curriculum (GE) What is General Education at Northampton Community College? An undergraduate degree is comprised of three parts: courses in the major, elective courses, and courses in the General Education Core Curriculum. Major courses define the program of study. Students choose electives that fit their College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 27individual interests. The General Education Core Curriculum is the part of the academic experience that all students have in common . The GE Core defines an important set of knowledge and skills that will help our graduates to continue learning, adapt to change, and become citizens who can make wise choices and contribute to their community.

Manufacturing today also requires more technical knowledge than in the past. That's why it is important to stay on top of the latest trends and methods involved in manufacturing, technology, and continuous quality improvement. For those just entering the field, it's also vital to have hands-on operating skills specific to at least one area of manufacturing. We developed our Applied Quality and Standards program with the assistance of local manufacturing experts. Their input assures that graduates of our program are highly skilled College Catalog 2010\u00ad11 34and knowledgeable in today's manufacturing and quality assurance practices. Graduates new to manufacturing will gain a new set of skills and knowledge qualifying them as machine operators, quality inspectors or technicians, and manufacturing engineering technicians. Existing manufacturing personnel who graduate from this program will become better qualified as technicians, auditors, supervisors and managers of Quality, manufacturing group leaders, and process technicians. Program Features The program focuses on providing practical industry-specific training in well-equipped manufacturing and quality assurance labs. While students study areas of Quality such as Total Quality Management, statistical process control, ISO 9000 standards, and auditing, they also learn to apply this knowledge to specific types of manufacturing through hands-on technical electives. If you have existing skills in manufacturing, you may be able to gain credit through testing to challenge the technical electives requirement. The associate's degree program includes a series of required general education courses. These classes prepare you to assume a greater role in working with people and other departments in your organization. The well-rounded education you receive increases your potential to grow into supervisory or management positions. The work-based internship near the end of the degree program can be carried out with your employer or with another approved organization. During your internship, you'll apply your manufacturing and quality skills and knowledge to a production or process operation, experiencing the dynamics found only in an actual organization. If you're interested in continuing your education to the bachelor's degree level, you may transfer your credits from this program to the following programs: Franklin College B.S. in Applied Management (web- based) California University of Pennsylvania B.S. in Industrial Management (web-based) Penn College of Technology B.S. in Technical Management Penn College of Technology B.S. in Welding and Fabrication Engineering Technology Check with your advisor for more information and options in course selection.

Career Potential: Social and Human Service Assistant, Social Worker, Direct Service Provider Manager, Direct Service Provider Supervisor, Group Home Supervisor, Director Group Home Education - All Programs Students intending to prepare to become teachers of children from infancy through twelfth grade may start their educational preparation at Northampton Community College. NCC offers five distinct degree programs that will prepare students for a variety of teaching positions in settings such as public schools, parochial and private schools, as well as childcare centers and Head Start programs. Northampton's programs have been modified to comply with the changes in the teacher education certification system in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has reorganized teacher certification as shown on next page: As of 2013, anyone graduating from a four-year college or university as a teacher will apply for a teaching certificate based on the new system. The matching NCC program to prepare you for these new requirements is shown in the box below. Are you not sure which level you want to teach? Many students that come to NCC interested in teaching as a career are unsure of which grades they would be best suited to teach. Such students should take EDUC115 Education for All Students , a course which explores all grade levels, including pre-kindergarten through high school teaching. EDUC115 gives students real world experience through observations in the schools, which often helps students to determine which level of teaching is best for them. Are you sure that you want to teach children grades Pre- Kindergarten to Grade 4 and/or aged infancy to age 9 in child care or Head Start? Students who are sure that they want to work with students up to Grade 4 may enter directly into the Early Childhood Education: Infant to Grade 4 , associate in applied science degree program. The Early Childhood Education program provides extensive opportunities to observe and work with young children during your time at NCC. Students would then transfer to a bachelor's degree program at college or university to complete the requirements for teacher certification or obtain a teaching position in a Child Care or Head Start. Do you have a subject area that you think you want to teach? Students that think they may want to teach a subject or content area (mathematics, science, English, social studies, etc) may consider teaching at either the middle school or high school level. The Middle School Grades 4 to 8 certification is new toPennsylvania . Middle level certification will allow teachers to teach the last two grades of elementary school (grades 4 and 5) and all grades of middle school. The Middle Level Education: Grades 4 to 8 degree gives students a strong foundation in mathematics, science, language arts, and social science. Students would then transfer to a bachelor's degree program at college or university to complete the requirements for teacher certification. Students intending to teach high school have two options. Future teachers of English, foreign language, history or social studies should enroll in the associate of arts degree in Secondary Education. Students who want to teach mathematics or science at the high school level should enroll in the associate of science degree in Secondary Education: Math & Science. It is important to work closely with an advisor to select classes that will transfer smoothly to the next college or university where students will complete their bachelor degree and obtain teacher certification. Students interested in becoming an art teacher should refer to the Individualized Transfer Studies major which is the pathway from NCC to Kutztown University for art education. What teaching positions could I obtain with an associate degree from NCC? Students who wish to enter directly into a job after completing an associate degree from NCC have several options. The Early Childhood Education: Infant to Grade 4 prepares students to work in childcare centers and Head Start programs. NCC also offers the gateway to a career as a paraeducator or teacher assistants through the Special Education: Paraeducator Training degree. For students who wish to help classroom teachers, the position of teacher assistant offers another opportunity to work in schools. Students who have completed the Middle Level Education: Grades 4-8 associate in arts degree may also gain employment as teacher assistants. Northampton offers a wide range of programs for students intending to make teaching a career. The programs are more fully described on the pages that follow. Please refer to the Special Education: Paraeducator Training program page for more information.
