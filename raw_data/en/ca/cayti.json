More than 33,000 people registered from 150 countries. Highlights particularly relevant for the public health community include: A new research study to globally track and understand the long-term impact of the novel coronavirus on the brain including cognition, behavior, and functioning will be undertaken by the Alzheimer's Association, the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientists from over 30 countries. The study will evaluate the short- and long-term consequences of infection from the novel coronavirus on the central nervous system and improve understanding of the lasting impact of the coronavirus on the brain.Risk factors for Alzheimer's may be apparent earlier in life . New studies found: Heart health risk factors in early life \u2014 including high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014 are associated with worse late-life cognition among African Americans.Higher body mass index (BMI) in early adulthood is associated with higher late- life dementia risk.Alzheimer's Public Health Curriculum A free, flexible curricular resource introduces Alzheimer's as a public health issue. The HBI Road Map Designed for state and local public health practitioners, the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map encourages 25 actions that help promote brain health, address cognitive impairment, and support the needs of caregivers. Road Map for Indian Country Individuals who received higher-quality early-life education had a lower risk of late-life dementia than those who received lower-quality education. Twelve modifiable risk factors across the life course may account for as much as 40% of dementia cases worldwide, according to the Lancet Standing Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care . This 2020 analysis updates the recommendations from the 2017 report and added three new modifiable factors that may contribute to dementia risk: excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury and air pollution.Designed for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map for Indian Country is a guide for AI/AN leaders to learn about Alzheimer's and begin planning their response to dementia.Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. New studies on the topic found: Having at least one flu vaccination is associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's prevalence, and receipt of more frequent seasonal flu vaccinations is associated with an additional 13% reduction in incidence.Receiving a pneumococcal vaccination between the ages of 65 and 75 is correlated with a reduced Alzheimer's risk of up to 40%.Individuals with dementia and hospitalizations due to viral, bacterial, and other infections have a 6.5 times higher mortality rate than those with no dementia or infection.Early research shows promise in the use of blood \"tests\" to measure abnormal versions of the tau protein, a hallmark indicator of Alzheimer's disease. This research may pave the way for future biomarker tests to improve the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Disparities and Dementia Many presentations at AAIC examined disparities associated with Alzheimer's and dementia. Study findings included: Dementia diagnoses among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals is missed more often than those of non-Hispanic white individuals; and, when they are diagnosed, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals have more advanced dementia than their white peers.

Hearing loss is highly prevalent, but generally untreated, among adults with cognitive impairment. Additionally, people with a cognitive impairment, particularly African Americans, are less likely to use hearing aids. LGBT women and men aged 45 and older are more likely to report subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than their heterosexual peers. LGBT adults also report greater frequency and higher levels of cognitive difficulty than their heterosexual peers, even when controlling for demographic factors. Black and Hispanic veterans have a significantly higher risk of dementia than white veterans. The neurocognitive effects of APOE-e4 \u2014 one of the strongest genetic predictors of Alzheimer's \u2014 vary among different Hispanic sub-populations , with the most significant effect seen among Cubans.AAIC registrants may search the meeting app for additional details and studies. All abstracts from AAIC will be published in a forthcoming edition of Alzheimer's & Dementia. COVID-19 and Dementia Public health agencies nationwide are continuing their response to the evolving novel coronavirus pandemic, and people living with dementia require special considerations in that response.
