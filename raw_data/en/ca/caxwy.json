For many of us, the thought of waking up with energy to tackle the day seems far fetched, but we promise it is possible! There are many natural ways to boost your energy - so let's explore some ways to improve your morning energy. Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate Are you getting enough water? If not, this can be easily remedied as part of your morning routine. If you wake up feeling slow and sluggish, a great place to start is with a glass of water. Fatigue, memory fog, and mood disturbances are linked to [dehydration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/). After a night's rest, your body has gone for a prolonged period of time without any water. Starting your day with a fresh glass of water is a great way to replenish your body. Continually staying on top of your water intake throughout the day can also help keep your energy levels high and your mind clear. So wake up, grab a glass of water, and get to work! Remember to Eat Breakfast We have all heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day - but is it that important for our morning energy levels? Stimulating our metabolism to get to work by eating is essential. Prolonged periods of time (especially in the morning) without food can make you feel sluggish and slow. Incorporating a healthy breakfast made from whole foods can turn your metabolism up and get your natural energy flowing. [Breakfasts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017414/) with a low glycemic index (low amount of sugar) and are high in protein are great natural sources of energy. Additionally, breakfasts high in protein keep you fuller for longer and are associated with reducing the risk for metabolic and liver diseases. So start the day off with a healthy whole food breakfast for better energy and overall health! Morning Yoga and Stretching = Morning Energy If you're wondering how to get natural energy in the morning, yoga may be your answer. Yoga is an incredibly popular form of light aerobic exercise. Starting your day with stretching and mindful meditation through yoga is a great way to get moving and start-up your metabolism (and it's fun!) A morning yoga practice can be a very relaxing, introspective time to connect with your body and mind. Flowing through movements in time to your own breath can help promote harmony within your body and increase your natural energy levels. Setting intentions for your day during your practice is also a great way to keep you moving forward throughout the day. Get Outside A very simple way to improve your natural morning energy is to get outside (yep, it can be that simple!) Going for an outdoor walk or run in the morning is an excellent source of cardiovascular activity and fresh air. Crisp morning air helps remove any groggy morning feelings and can help rejuvenate your energy. Get outside for an extra kick of morning energy! Mindfulness Meditation If you're looking for an answer to how to get energy naturally, mindfulness meditation is your answer!

Assess Your Sleep Patterns Are you giving yourself the best possible chance of having morning energy? If your sleep habits are less than ideal, having energy throughout the day will be difficult.

Do you understand the impact a poor night's sleep has on your energy levels and sleep? Addressing these questions can help encourage healthier sleep habits and will improve your overall morning energy and health.
