Schedule an appointment today! Many of the OSFM physicians are also trained midwives, and embody that tradition in our approach to naturopathic primary care. Although we're not offering prenatal care and birthing serivces anymore, years of attending women during childbirth has given us a deep respect for this important time of life. We love to help people prepare for pregnancy, provide primary care for them thoughout their pregnancy and offer support to them as new parents, including in-house lactation services.
