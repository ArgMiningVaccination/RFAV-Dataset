Most of us are on the path to seeking the best possible health for ourselves, and this means we are leveraging a range of health care solutions. While traditional prescription medication does hold a place in our healthcare regime, naturopathy allows us all to have access to more holistic health. We are not suggesting that you should seek to access only one kind of treatment, but rather you should leverage naturopathy as part of your wider treatment. At Kula Health, we are dedicated to your ongoing health and wellbeing and offer naturopathic treatments as part of your wider holistic healthcare. [Contact us](https://kulahealth.com.au/contact/) to make your appointment or to find out more about our services. 1. Naturopathy Works by Focusing on Disease Prevention (As Opposed To Cure) Naturopathy leverages the healing powers of nature and works to prevent disease and keep you healthy and well long before problems turn into sickness. Naturopathy uses a variety of treatments to allow your own body to heal itself. One of the key aims of naturopathy is to balance the body and allow it to care for itself so that illness is less likely to occur in the future. You're in safe hands with a naturopath; they are a registered and insured professional who has completed Bachelor-level qualifications. They are going to assess you and use a range of techniques to ensure you get the best possible care. 2. Naturopathy Assists in Many Common Health Conditions Which People Face Today If you're facing a common health problem, then chances are your naturopath can help you address this issue with holistic, natural treatments. You may be able to seek naturopathic treatments for all manner of problems, from hormonal imbalance through to fertility issues. If you're struggling with digestive problems or stomach irritation, having trouble sleeping, or are battling with skin conditions, naturopathy offers a non-invasive way of tackling these issues head-on - without the need for potentially invasive treatments. 3. Naturopathy is Non-Invasive and Natural When walking into the clinic at Kula Health, you are immediately greeted by our welcoming and open space, where the focus is on your wellness. We are committed to only using natural and proven techniques in your treatment, and this is echoed throughout our clinic. When your naturopath works with you, they are going to be using a range of non-invasive therapies which are designed to work in harmony with your other treatments or medications. There might be hydrotherapy, kinesiology, physical therapies, herbal medicines, and nutrition or diet advice. Whatever the treatment your body needs, your naturopath will help to administer it and give you the guidance and counsel you need to move forward in health and wellness. 4. Naturopathy Can Work in Harmony with Traditional Western Medicines It must be noted that naturopathy is not a treatment which works to treat a specific disease. As a result, it's important to secure your naturopathic treatment in conjunction with a general practitioner. Always be guided by your doctor or treating specialist when you're seeking naturopathy treatment - especially if you are considering naturopathy for a serious illness. We will never advise you to abandon your physician's treatment. We believe instead that your naturopathy treatment can work in harmony with your treatment and may even work to alleviate some of the side effects you may experience due to traditional western medicines. 5. Naturopathy is Affordable When you consider the impact that naturopathy can have on your life, it might be that you cannot fix a price on this treatment at all! But irrespective of any value - naturopathy is an affordable treatment available to anyone. We believe in structuring our pricing to reflect the expertise and value of the treatments provided.
