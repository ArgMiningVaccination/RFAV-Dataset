All Full- Time Equivalent (FTE) levels presented in this Budget in Brief are based on the Appendix, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2023, and were finalized before the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. Unles s otherwise noted, all tables are in millions of dollars and numbers may not add to the totals due to rounding. 1BUILDING A HEALTHY AMERICA The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance and protect the health and well- being of all Americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services. The President's F iscal Y ear (FY) 2 023 B udget i nvests in all Americ ans' health and w ell-bein g. It addresses critical chall enges and opportunities w e face as a nation , including tackling t he C OVID- 19 p a ndemic, expanding access t o care, addressing health d ispa rities, strengthening behavioral health, a nd promotin g the well-bei ng o f children, f amilies, and seniors. HHS prop oses $ 127.3 bill ion in discretionary and $1.7 trill io n in manda tory budget a uthority for FY 2023 . This b udg et demonstrate s the Ad ministration's commitm ent t o reinvesting i n public he alth, research , and d evelopment to d rive g rowth a nd shared pros peri ty for all Americans by making major inve stme nts in priority ar eas, includ ing overdose prevention , mental health, maternal health, cancer, and H IV. It als o ad vance s equi ty through t he work of the federal government and helps ensure o ur program s serve p eople o f color a nd o ther ma rginalized populat ions wit h the o pportunities promised to a ll Americans . The m andatory budget proposals in t his bud get improve care , drive q uality, p ro mote the w ell- being of the w hole family, and focus on p revention. RESPON D TO EMERGENT C HALLENGES COVID -19 an d F uture P andemics With t he re cent surge of t he Omicron variant, t he COVID- 19 pan demic is u ndoubt edly s till a t the fore fro nt of m ost A mericans' m inds, e specially disad va ntaged communities, i ncluding immuno compromised i ndividuals, p eople with disabilities, and communities o f color , who ar e dispropo rtiona tely im pacted . Tackling t he pandemic remains a k ey focus f or this Administration and HHS . The F Y 20 23 b udget c ontinu es to i nvest r esources in pandemic response, as w ell as prepa redness a ctivities toward s future pande mics a nd biological threats. The b udget i ncludes $ 81.7 b illion i n mandat ory f unding over fi ve years across the O ffice of t he Assistant Secreta ry and Pre vention ( CDC), National Inst itu tes of H ealth (NIH), and Food a nd D ru g Admini stration ( FDA) to support President Biden's p lan to tr ansform U.S. capabilities to prepare for and respond rapidly and effectively to future pandemics and other high consequence biological threats. The COVID -19 pand emic highlights the importance of vaccines and prevention. L ong-standing , deep disparities exist in adult vaccination coverage based on race and ethnicity, particularly among Black and Hispanic populations . HHS includes in this budget the Vaccines for Adults program , a new mandatory program modeled after the existing Vaccines for Children program , to provide uninsured adults with access to vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The budget further expands the existing Vaccines for C hildren program to include all children unde r age 19 enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. These mandatory investments complement the investments in CDC's discretionary Section 317 Immunization program included in the FY 2023 budget. 2Building a Healthy America 2HHS take s action t o further protect and a dvance access to care f or all Centers f or M edicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiaries, underscoring the Administration's commitment to r emoving b arriers within the h ealthcare s ystem and supporting the country's most vulnerable in dividuals. For i nstance, the budget i ncludes a p roposal to consolidate v accine coverage unde r Medicare Part B, which will make vaccines m ore ac cessible, r emove f inancial bar riers, and streamline the pr ocess f or be neficiaries and providers . The b udget includes a propos al to grant the Secretar y authority to make Emergency U se Authorization drugs and devices av ailable dur ing a public health e mergency, without patient co st-sharing , for M edicare, M edicaid, and C hildren's Health Insurance P rogram enrollees a nd for the uninsured. Moreover, t he b udget i ncludes proposals to i mprove Medicare pr ovider da ta reporting and laboratory testing f lexibilities in public healt h emergencies. In addition to t hese m andatory p ro posals, HHS makes sig nificant discretionary investments i n sup port o f preparedness in FY 2023 . This budget b uilds o n the hist oric inv estment in the bu dge t released last y ear to furt her s trengthen p reparedness a ct ivities across CDC, ASP R, and o ther HH S en tities. Con sistent with t he P resident's E xecutive O rder 13 994 o n Ensuring a D ata-Driven R e sponse t o C OVID -19 a nd Futu re High-Consequence Public Health T hre ats, the bud get p rovides $200 millio n for CDC 's Data Mod ernization I nitiative to continue t o modernize publ ic he alth dat a system s nationwide t hat w i ll last beyond the cu rrent p an demic. The funding w ill also help f acilitate an \"equity -centered\" d ata s ystem that im proves d ata q uality a nd m a kes d ata m ore co mplete, ac ce ssible, and representative o f al l people. The bud get a lso s upports C D C in buildi ng core public h ealth inf rastructure and capacity across all levels o f gove rnmen t with $ 600 million to c reate a r es ilient public he alt h system, with strategies in place t o ad dress s urge n eeds, ca pabilities f or long-term p u blic he alth p lanning, a nd flexibil ity to add ress lo cal or emerging p riorities w it h evidence -based a pproaches. Th e budget i ncludes $ 353 million, $ 10 0 million above t he FY 2022 enacted , for G lobal Public Health P ro tection to e nsure a rategic r e gional p resence a nd impro ve global public dis ea se detection a nd emergency response, as well as $50 million to sust ain the recently est ablished Center f or For ecasting a nd Ou tbreak Analy tics to im p rove t he U.S. government's abilit y to forecast emerging health threats. This pa ndemic highlighted the need for a permanent and nimble organizing entity to synchroniz e and provide logistical support for the government's medical countermeasure efforts. The HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element in ASPR handles the coordination and implementation of priorities surrounding the development, production, and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines and therapeutics. HHS's budget provides $133 million to support the program 's work in coordinating and operationaliz ing the COVID -19 pandemic response . The budget also provides $130 million for the National Disaster Medical System to help communities respond, recover, and protect public health when they are most overwhelmed. ASPR will use the funding to r ecruit, hire, and train the intermittent workforce, as well as routine maintenance and replenishment of kits and caches. The budget also provides $20 million for the Public Health Commissioned Corps to maintain and continue to operationalize COVID -19 investments in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Ready Reserve, Public Health Emergency Response Strike Team, and Corps' readiness and training activities. The budget further provides $975 million for the Strategic National Stockpile, an increase of $ 130 million above FY 2022 enacted , to sustain and expand the current inventory of supplies to ensure readiness for potential future pandemics and other threats . HHS also recognizes the importance of advanced research and development and provides $828 million for the Biomedical Advanced Res earch and Development Authority within ASPR , an increase of $83 million above FY 2022 enacted, to work with both public and private sector partners to support the advanced research, development, regulatory approval, and procurement of life -saving medical countermeasures , and to support the Broad -Spectrum Antimicrobials Program. In addition, t he budget includes $25 million for CDC and $20 million for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ ) to study long COVID conditions. The budget also includes a proposal designed to combat antibiotic- resistant bacteria by encouraging the development of innovative antimicrobial drugs. This proposal would provide annual payments from a contract valued between $750 million and $ 3 billion to the developers of newly approved antimicrobial drugs. By delinking revenue from the volume of sales, these 3 Building a Healthy America Building a Healthy America advance market commitments properly incentivize the market entry of new antimicrobials and ensure that the American people are armed with a n adequate supply of properly stewarded antimicrobial products against highly dangerous drug -resistant microbes. Refugees and Unaccompanied Children Amid the COVID -19 pandemic, large numbers of unaccompanied children continue to arrive at our Southern border. HHS is committed t o fulfilling the legal and humanitarian responsibility to care for all unaccompanied children. The FY 2023 budget includes $6.3 billion in discretionary funding for refugees and unaccompanied children , with a new mandatory contingency fund to provide addi tional funds during a surge . The discretionary investment continues to build on the nation's refugee infrastructure to support resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 202 3. HHS is committed to caring for unaccompanied children safely and humanely in alignment with child welfare bes t practices . HHS aims to unify these children with vetted sponsors as safely and quickly as possible. 4Building a Healthy America 5STRENGTHENING BEHAVIORAL HE ALTH The CO VID- 19 p and emic has had a detrimental effect on b eha vioral healt h, but even w ithout t he p andemic , fo cuse d efforts to address mental h ealth a nd substance use ar e long overdue. HHS pr opose s $2 0.8 billion in discretionary funding for behavioral health programs in FY 2023, $4.9 billion above FY 2022 enacted. I ndividuals who develop substance use disorders are often also di agnosed with mental disorders\u2014th e budget addresses the significant connection between mental health and s ubstance use b y investing i n a broad spectrum of behavioral health services. Mental Health According to the 2020 N ational Su rvey o n Drug Use a n d Healt h, an estimated 2 1.0 pe rcent ( 53 million) of adul ts ages 1 8 and older had some type of m ental illne ss in the p re viou s year a nd 5 .6 percent ( 14.2 million) had serious mental illness. Invest ing in prevention , tre atment, and recovery support s are essential stra tegie s to ad vance the h ealth a nd p rosperity o f individuals, families, communities, a nd the c ountry. In support o f the President's call for tr ansforming how we d eliv er m ental he alth services, the b udget in cludes a new $7.5 billion Me ntal Health Sy stem Transformation Fund t o increase access to m ental health s ervices through workforce d evel opment a nd service e xpansion, includin g the d evelopment of n on- tradit ional health delivery sites, the i ntegration o f quality m e nt al health and s ubs tance us e care in to primary care s ettings, and the dissemination o f evidence-b ased practices. The budget also provides a historic investment in 9-8-8 and B ehavio ral Healt h Services, which w ill expand acc ess to crisis care s erv ices for pe ople w ith suic idal ideations or e xperiencing b ehavioral health crisis. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline w ill transit ion from a 10 -digit numb er to 9-8-8 i n J uly 2022. The launc hi ng of th is 9-8-8 mental health crisis s ervice hotline w ill cre ate a nat ional ne twor k of local crisis centers fortified by na tional back up cent ers to answer calls and texts. To e nsure 100 percent of contacts are answered in FY 2023, SAMHSA will dedicate $697 million to the 9-8-8 and Behavioral Health Services program, an increase of $590 million over F Y 2022 e nacted. In addition, the budget sup ports community-ba sed mental health and will permanently extend funding for Community Mental Health Centers. This historic investment build s off the $825 million in funding directed to the centers in the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations and provides $413 million to these centers in FY 2023, and $4.1 billion over ten years, through the Substance use And Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Additionally, t he b udget i ncreases f unding f or Certified Community B ehavioral H ealth Center Expansion Grant s by $ 238 million above FY 2022 enacted . These community -based cl inics h elp e nsure t hat p atients receive c oordinated, hig h-quality, and comprehensive behavioral health services. T he b udget also expands and c onvert s the D emonstration Programs to I mprove Community Me ntal Health S ervices i nto a p ermanent program, allowing all states and territories t o participate in the existing Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration. It would also convert existing and any n ew d emonstration p rograms to a more s ustainable M edicaid state plan option. The budget i ncludes a ppropriations l anguage to ensure states will use at least 10 percent of Mental Health Block Grant funds to invest in early interv ention and prevention o f mental disorders in at-risk yo uth a nd adults . Moreover, t he budget als o inc ludes language that further increases the amount of M ental Health Block G rant funds reserved f or crisis intervention services from 5 percent t o 10 percent. In support of the President's call for full parity b etween physical and mental health and substance use benefits, the b udget includes proposals to m odernize M edicare's mental health benefits and improve behavioral health for t he private insurance m arket and Me dicaid beneficiaries, with an emphasi s on improving access, promoting equity, and fostering i nnovation. The budget i ncludes proposals to require M edicare a nd private ins urance to cover three b ehavioral health visits per yea r with no cost-sharing. T he b udget also requir es Medicaid behavioral health services, whether provided under f ee-for-service or managed care, be consistent with current and clinically a ppropriate treatment guidelines. Youth Mental H ealth Suicide r emains the secon d leading cause of death among young people between the ages o f 10 and 24. Unfortunately, a significant proportion o f our nation's youth , especially young people of color, Indigenous youth, and LGBTQ+ youth, still lack access to affordable mental heal thcare coverage. Additionally, t he COVID - 19 pandemic has made addressing youth mental health only more challenging, as the pandemic has subjected many young Americans to social isolation, loss of 6 Building a Healthy Am erica routines, and traumatic g rief. Public h ealth dat a now show alarming r ates o f behavioral health needs a mong school -age y outh, w ith significant inc reases in the number e xperiencing moderate t o severe anxiety and depression. The b udget i ncludes $ 308 million, an increase o f $163 million above FY 2022 enacted, fo r Project AW ARE and the M ental Health Awareness Training p rogram. Thi s investment w ill support comprehensive, co ordinated, a nd integrated state and tribal efforts t o adopt t rauma -informed a pproaches and increase access to m ental health services. This investment w ill also support inc reased t raining to law enforcement p ersonnel, veterans, armed s ervice members, and their f amilies to r ecognize the s igns a nd symptoms of m ental d isorders. The b udget a lso includes $ 225 million, an inc rease o f $100 m illion above FY 2022 e nacted, t o support t he development, implementation, e xpansion, and sustainability o f comprehensive, co mmunity -based s ervices fo r youth with severe e motional disturbance. It expand s support for the A dministration f or Children and Fami lies (ACF) to improve outcomes for families at risk o f child welfare, including e xpanding services t o keep fa milies together, enhancing support for youth w ho experienced f oster c are i n the tr ansition to a dulthood , and p roviding mental and behavioral health services for ch ildren a nd a dults. Behavioral Health Workforce In order t o improve a ccess to n eed ed b ehavioral heal th serv ices, investments a re needed to g row a nd d iversify th e wo rkforce that is e quipped and t rai ned t o deliver high -qualit y, culturally app ropriate mental health and sub stance use serv ices, pa rtic ularly in underserved areas . T herefore , this b udget includes $ 3 97 million for B ehavi oral Health Workforce Development P rogra ms. The H e alth Resources a nd S ervices Administration (HRS A) will prioritize t raining paraprofessionals, incre asing t he overall n umber s of be havioral health providers in the workforce, and promoting team-b ased care. In additi on to expanding services for the American public, HHS recognizes it is more critical now than ever before to support our frontline health professional s who have continued to provide high- quality care throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The budget thus includes $50 million for Preventing Burnout in the Health Workforce. This investment will provide crucial support for health workforce retention and recruitment, which is essential for addressing current and future behavioral health workforce shortages. The budget also establishes a $7.5 billion demonstration to i mprove provider c apacity in Medicaid to a ddress mental h ealth t reatment. A ll state s may apply for f unding, w hich ca n be used f or planning grant s to a ssess and d evelop strategies on education, recruitment, integration, r eimbursement , and t raining o f providers , and to improve m ental health provider c apacity . Substance Us e The overdose epidemi c has b e en one of t h e m o st significant public health challenges of our time, and the COVID-1 9 pandemic has had a devastati ng impact on t his ongoing crisis. According to CDC data, d rug overdose deaths i ncreased nearly 30 percent in 2020. Thi s budget a ddresses the overdose epidemic by i nvesting $11 .4 billion, inc luding $10.8 billion in di scretionary funding, in programs addressing o pioids and overdose-r elated acti vities across HHS. These are foundational programs supporting the Department's Overdose Prevention Strategy. The Strategy prioritizes four key target areas\u2014p rimary prevention, harm reduction, evidence-b ased treatment, and recovery s upport. These four cornerstone principles reflect t he Biden-Harris Administration's dedication to maximizing 7 Building a Healthy America health equity for underserved populations, using the best available data and evidence to inform policy and a ctions, i n tegrating substance u se disorder s ervices into o t her types of healthcare and social services, and r educing s tigma.

Where h e alth c en ters have begun t o integrate behavioral health services int o their pr imary c are operations, t hey inc lude c o unseling, psychiatry, s ubstance use d isorder t r eatments, and other evidence -based i nterventions. The budget provides $5.7 billion for health centers, including $3.9 billion in mandatory r esources , and will expand t h e E n ding HIV E pidemi c ini tiative and support the p l acement of e a rly childhood development experts in health centers. M aternal H e alth T he m aternal mortality rate in th e Un ited S tates i s significantly h igher than most o ther d eveloped countries and is e specially hi gh among B lack and Native American/Alask a Native w omen, r egardless o f their income o r education levels. The Biden -Harris Administration i s committed t o promoting maternal health and ensuring equitable ac cess to af fordable, quality h ealthcare f or our nation's pregnant w omen and mothers. HHS i nvests over $470 million i n funding across AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, NIH, and the Indian Health Service (IHS) to r educe m aternal mortality and morbidity. This i ncludes i ncreased f unding to C DC's Maternal Mortality R eview C ommittees and o ther S afe Motherhood p rograms ; HRSA 's State M aternal Health Innovation G rants program a nd new H ealthy Start program ini tiatives ; and o ther maternal health programs across H HS. The budget also invests resource s specifically to r e duce healthcare dis parities and advance h e alth e quity in the maternal health space. In FY 2023, t he Office of M inority H e alth will increase f o cus o n areas w ith high rates of a dverse m a ternal health o utcomes or with s ignificant r acial or e thnic di sparities in maternal he al th outcomes.

The ini t iative is a 8 Building a Healthy America Building a Healthy America bold plan announced in 2019 and further solidified in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2022 -2025) that aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the United States by 75 percent by 2025 , and by at least 90 percent by 2030 . HHS works closely with communities to support the four key strategies - Diagnose, Treat, Prevent, and Respond - to end the HIV epide mic. The budget also creates a national program that invests $9.8 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years to guarantee pre-exposure prophylaxis (also known as PrEP) at no cost for all uninsured and underinsured individuals ; provide essential wrap - around services through States, IHS and tribal entities, and localities ; and establish a network of community providers to reach underserved areas and populations. The budget also expands access to PrEP under Medicaid by covering the drug and associated services without cost sharing, while removing utilization management practices that may limit access . Improving Equity in Medicare and Medicaid The budget prioritizes resources to break down barriers to reduce health disparities. CMS invests $ 35 million in a new initiative to systematically identify and resolve barriers to equity in each CMS program through research, data collection and analysis , stakeholder engagement, building upon rural health equity efforts, and technical assistance. HHS is commit ted to obtaining more accurate and comprehensive race and ethnicity data on Medicare beneficiaries , and t he budget require s reporting on social determinants in post -acute healthcare settings . HHS also proposes to add Medicare coverage for services furnished by community health workers , who often play a key role in addressing public health challenges for underserved communities. These proposals will help identify, mitigate , and lessen health disparities . Civil Rights Enforcement and Protection from Discrimination The pandemic has shone a light on the disparities in our healthcare system and provided us with a new opportunity to address them in a meaningful way. Protecting individuals from being discriminated based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, and religion is a critical part of HHS's work. This bud get builds on the budget released last year to provide the Office for Civil Rights $ 60 million, a 50 percent increase compared to FY 2022 enacted, to support additional resources needed to address the existing complaint 2 Indian Health Service: Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup Interim Report June 2018 backlog; e nsure a \" whole -of-government\" , Department -wide c ivil rights compliance and policy development through technical assistance , regulations reviews, a nd HH S grantee training ; and support t he White House Ini tiative o n Asian Americans, N ative Hawaiians, and P acific Is landers now h oused within HHS.

To h onor this co mmitment a nd a ddress chronic underinvestment, the budget proposes all funding f or the Indian H ealth S ervice (IHS) as mandatory b eginning in FY 2023. This historic ste p is in response t o the l ong- standing r ecommendations of T ribal le aders shared i n c onsultation with HHS. In FY 2023, t he budget provides $ 9.3 bil lion in mandatory f unding for I HS, which includes $ 147 million in current law mandatory funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This IHS budget is a $2 .5 billio n increase above FY 2022 enacted and exempts I HS from m andatory s equestration to subs tantially expand access t o high- quality he althcare s ervices i n In dian C ountry .

IT and F acility Needs Supported by the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund The Nonrecurring Expenses Fund is a resource available to HHS for use to fund IT and facilities infrastructure projects across the Department. Since FY 2013, the fund has allocated over $5.4 billion in capital investment projects across the Department. For FY 2023 , HHS is proposing to use $300 million from the fund for various IT and infrastructure projects across the Department , including at IHS, NIH, and HRSA . Thes e proposed investments will ensure aging systems and facilities do not compromise the Department's mission. Oversight and Program Integrity Carrying out HHS's mission depends on taxpayer dollars, therefore ensuring the integrity of our spending is a core value and responsibility of HHS. The budget increases the discretionary Heath Care Fraud and Abuse Control program spending to a total of $899 million to provide oversight of CMS health programs, strengthen OIG investigations, and protect beneficiaries against healthcare fraud, yielding a return -on-investment of $13.6 billion over ten years. The pandemic has unleashed new healthcare fraud risks related to the implementation of billions in new federal spending, as well as multiple provider regulatory and other flexibilities. In response, HHS seeks to prevent iden tity theft and other fraud schemes in the Medicare program by proposing to prohibit unsolicited contacts to Medicare beneficiaries. HHS remains vigilant in root ing out bad actors who take advantage of these federal funds and flexibilities. 12 Building a Healthy America HHS BUDGET BY OPERATING DIVISION The follow ing table is in millions of dollars.

FDA also advances the public health by helping to efficiently advance innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and affordable; and by helping the public get the accurate, science -based information they need to use medical products and foods to maintai n and improve their health. Furthermore, the FDA regulates the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect public health and reduce tobacco use by minors. Finally, FDA strengthens the nation' s counterterrorism capability by ensuring the security of the food supply and fostering the development of medical products to respond to deliberate and naturally occurring public health threats. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for p rotecting and promoting public health by (1) ensuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and animal drugs, biological products, and medical devices; (2) ensuring the safety of human and animal food, cosmetics, and radiation- emitting products; and (3) regulating tobacco products . FDA is responsible for the oversight of more than $2.7 trillion i n consumption of in food and medical safety products. C ombined, these products account for about 20 cents of every dollar U S consumers spend . The Fis cal Year (FY) 2023 budget provides $8.4 billion for FDA \u2014an increase of $ 2.1 billion o r 34 percent above FY 2022 enacted . This total includes $ 3.7 billion in discretionary budget authority , $3.0 billion in user fees, and $1.6 billion in proposed mandatory funding . The budget supports FDA's public health activities , including supporting the continued transformation of the human and animal food safety system s, advancing the development and approval of safe and effective medical products, and crosscutting efforts to 6 The FTE totals do not include FTE proposed through Pandemic Preparedness or funded by COVID -19 s upplemental resources. 7 https://www.fda.gov/about -fda/fda -basics/fact -sheet -fda-glance modernize the agency 's technology and physical infrastructure . In addition, t he budget invests in new resources to support the President 's Cancer Moonshot Initiative , which will allow FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence to expand internal and external collaborations and to expedite the development o f oncology and malignant hematology products using an integrated approach to the clinical evaluation of drugs, biologics, and devices to treat patients with cancer . Finally, the budget includes investment in pandemic preparedness across HHS agencies including FDA. In calendar year 20 21, FDA had several notable achievements across the broad spectrum of the agency 's mandated priorities , which include public health emergencies , foodborne illnesses, and product tampering that have already resulte d in meaningful, lifesaving differences . For example, the agency has successfully combat ed the COVID -19 pandemic. Since the authorization of the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 Vaccines in December 2020, the agency has gone on to authorize an additional COVID -19 vaccine manufactured by Janssen and the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine for use in children five years of age and ol der, as well as booster doses, increasing a ccess to COVID -19 vaccines . In August 2021, the agency approved the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine (marketed as Comirnaty) for use in individuals ages 16 and older . Additionally, FDA has approved one drug to treat COVID -19, and 14 therapeutics are currently authorized for emergency use, including antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibody treatments . The agency has authorized, approved, granted, or cleared over 2,000 additional COVID -19 medical products, including, but not l imited to, molecular diagnostic, antigen and serology tests, sample collection devices, personal protective equipment, and ventilators. PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS The FY 2023 b udget makes transformative investments in pandemic preparedness and biodefense acros s HHS public health agencie s to enable an agile, coordinated, and comprehensive public health response to future threats and protect American lives, families, and the economy. The mandatory funding will support preparedness activities across HHS . Within an HHS -wide total of $81.7 billion, $1.6 billion is included for FDA to expand and modernize regulatory capacity, information technology , and laboratory infrastructure to respond rapidly and effectively to any future pandemic or high consequence biol ogical threat . With these investments, FDA aims to strengthen the personal protective equipment supply chain by building analytics and creating predictive modeling capabilities and speed development of diagnostics, including expansion of test validation capacity and development of common performance standards . Additionally, these investments support efforts with international partners to strengthen foreign inspections, harmonize premarket review of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics , and r educe zoonotic p athogen sp illover. CONTINUING TH E TRA NSFORMATION TO MODERNIZE THE FOOD SAFETY S YSTEM When the F ood S afety Mo dernization Act wa s enacted in 2011, FDA embarked on a collaborative pa th with regulatory p artners a nd stakeholders to t ransform t he human a nd a nimal food s afety s ystem s. Under the a ct, FDA e stablished foundational science and risk -based protection s that shifted the agency f rom r esponding to foodborne i llness outbreak s to a p revention -based approach. Even a s food safety modernization act implementation was underway , the agency recognize d the need for steps beyond this regulatory framework in order to keep up with the continuously and rapidly evolving food industry . The agency will continue, over the next decade , to further bend the curve of foodborne illness by creat ing a more digital, traceable, and safer food system that improves the quality of life for consumers in this country . FDA will continue to measure its regulatory actions against achievable goals to enhance food traceability, how well they st rengthen processes to predict, prevent and address incidences of foodborne illness using modern tools and approaches , ability to ensure the safety of foods produced, prepared and delivered through new business models, and foster s food safety culture. era of smarte r food safety Tech- enable d traceab ility will create a harmo nized system of traceab ility from farm to fork that will help protect consu mers from unsafe food.

Maternal and Infant H ealth and Nutrition FDA s upports i nitiatives t o improve h ealth a n d well - b eing through nutrition a n d r e ducing exposure t o har mful chemicals and toxins in food. For e xample, under the Closer to Zero Action plan, FDA aims to reduce exposure to toxic elements, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, from foods for babies and young childre n. The plan advances research, sets action levels, and encourag es the adoption of best practices by industry to address concerns about toxicity in foods. Since the release of Closer to Zero in April 2021 , FDA has issued a letter to baby and toddler food manufacturers reminding them of their existing responsibility to consider risks from chemical hazards \u2014 including toxic elements \u2014when conducting a hazard analysis. FDA is building on its maternal and infant health and nutrition efforts with an approach that integrates nutrition and diet, toxicology, and health across the lifespan. The FY 2023 budget includes $20 million, an increase of $ 7 million above FY 2022 enacted , to continue effort s to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals and toxins in foods and modern ize labeling guidance to support healthy eating . In addition, FDA will invest in better tools to generate and analyze real-time information on the food supply 's evolving composition, increase staff capacity to research co - occurrence of toxic elements in baby foods, expand education and outreach programs to update consumers, and empower consumers to make healthy choices. Health y and Safe Food for All The budget also provides $14 millio n in ne w funding for FDA to implement the Healthy and Safe Food for All initiativ e to improve health equity through nutrition and reduc e exposure to harmful chemicals and toxins in food . The additional investments support expanding outreach efforts to other potentially vulnerable populations and producing education al materials that integrate information to help consu mers make healthy choices that reduce exposure to toxic elements . In addition, the focus on health equity leverages FDA 's unique role in increasing transparency to consumers by modernizing labeling guidance and regulations, explor ing opportunities to include nutrition labeling on food packages purchased through e -commerce, and develop ing health and dietary educational materials targeted to specific at -risk populations . Lastly, funds will also enable FDA to increase its scientific and regulatory capacity related to dietary supplements . Emerging Chemical and Toxicology Issues The budget provides $20 million, $13 million above FY 2022 enacted , to streamline regulatory frameworks for food products that may pose potential chronic risks to human health, such as per - and polyfluoroalkyl Food and Drug Administration 21Food and Drug Administration substan ces, chemicals used in food contact, and food additives . In addition, funds will support hiring additional experts to advance the science, acquire new data tools, and advance research. ADVANCING ACCESS TO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL PRODUCTS From glucose meters and programmable pacemakers to the pills in our medicine cabinets, FDA provides patients and consum ers greater access to safe and effective medical products . FDA also ensures that regulated products are marketed according to federal standards and that products available to the public continue to be safe , especially as new clinical information becomes available . The FY 2023 budget requests $4.2 billion, an increase o f $253 million above FY 2022 enacted , for medical product safety investments . This includes $ 2.0 billion in budget authority and $ 2.2 billion in user fees to support premarket animal drug review capacity, bolster medical device cybersecurity , and support Cancer Moonshot activities . The budget also provides funding to FDA to advance the goal of e nding the o pioid crisis, bolster device shortages and challenges with supply chain activities , advance the Predictive Toxicology Roadmap, improv e drug safety surveillance and o versight, an d continu e Center for Veterinary Medicine' s medical product supply chain activities . The budget also provides resources for agency -wide and crosscutting investments to continue the modernization of FDA's data infrastructure, strengthening of administrative capabilities , and optimization of inspections . These investments are discussed in the modernization section below. Reigniting the Cancer Moonshot Cancer Moonshot is a bold effort to accelerate progress in cancer research and aims to make more therapies available to more patients. Since the Cancer Moonshot was launched, remarkable progress and scientific accomplishments have been made . FDA is committed to meeting the goals of accelerating scientific discovery, fostering greater collaboration, and improving data sharing . The budget includes an additional $ 20 million in new, one -time funding to support FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence programs that incorporate patient voice, real- world evidence , and collaborations with FDA 's global partners to facilitate faster patient access to innovative cancer 8 https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/deaths/index.htmltherapies . With this investment, FDA will build on existing efforts to continue to facilitate and expand internal and external collaborations to expedite the development of oncology and malignant hematology products as well as increase diversity and speed progress against the most deadly and rare cancers, including childhood cancers , and foster the development of novel therapeutics for patients with ultra -rare cancers. Animal Drug Review s The FY 2023 budget provides $5 million in new funding to Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendment programs. The number of pioneer and generic animal drug submissions received have steadily increased over time , and these funds will increase FDA 's capacity to review the additional submissions wi thin agreed -upon timeframes . Medical Device Cybersecurity Medical devices are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks, and other medical device s. This can lead to safer, more effective technologies and provide many new options that can be used in people 's homes and other places outside of traditional health care settings. However, this also makes medical devices increasingly vulnerable to security breaches , potentially impacting the safety and effectiveness of the device . Moreover , cybersecurity incidents have severely impacted medical devices and hospital networks, disrupting the delivery of patient care across healthcare facilities and, in some cases, posing significant risk s to our national security . The FY 2023 budget includes a total of $6 million to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities by improving the safety and security of medical devices . These funds expand upon ongoing efforts to recruit and hir e cyber experts and develop tools to track vulnerabilities associated with devices. Fighting the Opioids Epidemic Opioids are claiming lives at a staggering rate and have reduced life expectancy in the United States . Since 1999, overdose deaths involving opioids have increased over six times. In 2019, overdoses involving opioids killed nearly 50,000 people , with synthetic opioids accounting for nearly 73% of those deaths 8. As part of the HHS Opioid Strategy, FDA is committed to examining all facets of the epidemic: opioid abuse, misuse, addiction, overdose, and death s in the U nited 22States. In a ddition, FDA i s taking step s to a ddress four priority areas o f the epidemic: ( 1) decreasing ex posure and p reventing n ew a ddiction; ( 2) supporting t he treatment o f those with o pioid u se disorder; (3) fostering the d evelopment of n ovel pain tr eatment therapies; and ( 4) improving e nforcement a nd assessing benefit- risk.

This funding will spur the adoption of new alternative meth ods for regulatory use that can replace, reduce and refine animal testing (the 3Rs), and improve predictivity of nonclinical testing to streamline the development of FDA -re gulated products and bring them to US public and patients more rapidly and more efficiently while assuring they are safe, effective, and that patients can depend on them. Opt imizing Inspections The FY 2023 budg et includes $34 million in budget authority, an increase of $ 24 million above FY 2022 enacted, to optimize inspection . The increase will support the recruitment and training of staff capable of analyzing available data to increase the efficiency and productivity of FDA 's operations. In addition, throughout FY 2020 and into FY 2021, the COVID -19 pandemic significantly impacted in -person inspectional operations for medical products and food safety and highlighted the need for a safe and secure medical supply chain . The budget will also support cross-a gency inspection analysis and improvement projects to streamline, improve, and optimize end-t o-end inspection processes and improve overall inspections operations for food and Medical Product i nspections. With additional personnel and tools, FDA will improve its inspectional capacity and build on the efforts to keep pace with a rapidly expanding industry, including medical countermeasures and advanced manufacturing. REDUC ING THE USE AND HARMS OF TOBACCO Despite si gn ificant progress over the past half -century, tobacco use continues to be the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. Each year, nearly half a million people in the United States die prematurely from tobacco -related diseases. One of FDA 's core missions is to protect and advance public health by helping to reduce harm from regulated tobacco products . Since the enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, FDA has had the authority to regulate the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco Food and Drug Administration 24products . For F Y 2023, FDA r emain s committed t o reducing the burden of the a ddiction cr ises that a re threatening A merican f amilies t o prevent a new generation of children f rom b ecoming addicted t o nicotine t hrough e -cigarettes. The FY 2023 b udget includes $ 812 million in u ser f ees to su pport FD A tobacco 's program . Include d within this t otal, the budget c ontinue s to p ropose a n increase to this fee o f $100 million t o enhance p roduct r eview and evaluation, r esearch, co mpliance a nd enforcement, public education ca mpaigns, a nd p olicy d evelopment. Thes e user fee resources will continue o ngoing effort s to bolster the a gency 's c ompliance and enforcement ef forts f or all tobacco pr oducts and expand public educat ion campaigns and science and r esearch programs as it w orks to address s ubstance u se and pro tect c onsumers from the dangers of tobacco u se. Fur thermore, the agency a ims t o ad vance h ealth e quity by taking targeted st eps to p revent y outh f rom st a rting to sm oke a nd a ddressing tobacco -r elated h ealth dis parities e xperienced b y communities i ncluding, b ut not limited to, c ertain racial and ethnic po pulations, lo w-income p opulations, a nd LGBTQ+ i ndividuals.

INFR ND rastructure nd facilities c ontinues to be a pr iority n eed for F DA. The ag e ncy m anages an exte nsive p ortfolio, including 53 la boratories strategically lo cated across the continental Unite d States and Puerto R ico. The F Y 20 23 b udget i n cludes $353 million in budget au thority, an increase o f $ 40 million above FY 2022 e nacted to a ddress FDA 's in frastructure a nd facilities needs. Wi thin t his total i s $322 million, an increase o f $22 million above FY 2022 e nac ted, to cover the cost o f sec urity, r ental payments to t he Gener al S ervices Administration ( GSA) , and the operations a nd maintenance services and utilities not covered by GSA rent . For example, many FDA locations, both directly owned and managed by GSA, require support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year . In addition, these facilities contain labs or vivariums that house activities that cannot be accomplished remotely. The bud get also provides $31 million, an increase of $18 million above FY 2022 enacted , to ensure that FDA's owned offices and labs across the country , many of which are aged and in critical need of repair and improvement, function optimally and empower the agency 's workforce to carry out its public health mission, respond to food safety and medical product emergencies, and protect and promote the safety and health of American families. USER FEES FDA's user fee programs help the agency fulfill its mission of protecting public health and enabl ing the agency to strengthen its efficiency and increase the speed at which products are available to the public. The calendar year 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) . Since 1992, PDUFA has allowed FDA to collect fees from industry on certain human drug products submitted for FDA review . These funds support staffing and other resources enabling the agency to review and approve new drug applications. In addition, f ollowing the initial passage of PDUFA, Congress has enacted and reauthorized several other user fees for drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, a nd biosimilar biological products . The budget assumes resources from these four user fee programs, currently authorized user fees, and increases to export certification fee and the tobacco user fee for a total of $3.0 billion. In FY 2023, the following user fee programs are proposed for reauthorization : PDUFA, the Generic Drug User Fee Act , the Biosimilars User Fee Act , and the Medical Device User Fee Act. In addition, the following user fee programs will be submitted to Congress for reauthorization covering FYs 2024 \u20142028: The Animal Drug User Fee Act and the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act. 25 Food and Drug Administration Health Resources and Services Administration The following tables are in millions of dollars.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 202 3 President's Budget requests $13.3 billion for HRSA , which is $ 41 million above FY 2022 enacted. This total includes $ 8.5 billion in discretionary budget authority and $ 4.8 billion in mandatory funding and other sources. In FY 2023 , HRSA programs and services will invest in actions to expand health care access for the underserved, grow the health care workforce, and advance health equity including : Advancing equitable access to mental health and substance use disorder services with historic investments in the behavioral health workforce , including psychiatry, crisis care, peer support, community health workers, nursing, primary care, and substance usedisorder practitioners , and integrating these services into primary care settings; Launching new initiatives to reduce maternalmortality and disparities in maternal healthoutcomes through evidence -based interventions; Supporting the resiliency and mental health ofour health care workforce to prevent burnout in frontline workers; Training the next generation of the health workforce - including physicians, nurses, community health workers, and other professionals - through scholarships and loan repayment programs in exchange for working in underserved communities; Providing affordable, accessible, and high- quality medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services to millions of low-income , disproportionately racial and ethnic minoritypatients , regardless of their ability to pay ; Ending the HIV epidemic by expanding prevention and tre atment services ; Investing new resources in embedding early childhood development experts in community health centers and targeted expansion ofHealthy Start community -based supports for children and families; and Advancing telehealth services that increase health care quality and access , expand provider access to specialized expertise , andim prove health outcomes in rural and underserved areas. PROMOTING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGH -QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES The budget supports the delivery of direct health care services through Health Centers , the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program , and Title X Family Planning . These programs deliver affordable , patient -centered , and high - quality services to more than 30 million people across the United States. Health Centers The FY 2023 b udget provides $ 5.7 billion for h ealth centers , including $ 3.9 billion in mandatory resources . Within this amount, t he budget includes $85 million to embed early childhood development experts in health centers and $172 million for the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative. For 55 years, health centers have delivered affordable, accessible, quality, and value -based primary health care to millions of people regardless of their ability to pay. Health centers serve one in 11 people across the country and lead the nation in driving quality improvement with cost-effective care. H RSA's investments have advanced the nation's commit m ent to health equity by ensuring more patients and communities each year have access to high quality, comprehensive primary care. Today, HRSA funds nearly 1,400 health centers operating over 14,000 serv ice delivery sites in every U.S. state, U.S. territory, and the District of Columbia. Health centers deliver positive health outcomes to the communities they serve by providing culturally competent care, helping patients to overcome geographic , financial, linguistic, and other barriers to care . Although health center patients may experience a variety of social and economic barriers to connecting and remaining in care, center outcomes on key measures like diabetes and hypertension control exceed national averages. Sixty -four percent of health center patients with diabetes had their blood sugar levels controlled (HbA1c 9%), exceeding the national average of 55 percent. Fifty- eight percent of health center patients with hypertension had their blood pressure 28contr olled, which exceed s the national average of 56 percent. The health center model of care also is associated with reductions in the use of costly care options, such as emerge ncy department utilization and hospital ization. Compared to other health care providers, patients receiving care at health centers have 24 percent lower overall costs due to the reduced need for specialty and hospital care. Health Centers and Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States Health centers serv e as a key point of entry for prevention and diagnosis of people living with HIV. In 2020, health centers provided over 2. 5 million HIV tests to more than 2 million patients and treated one in 5 patients diagnosed with HIV nationally. In FY 2023, HRSA will dedicate $ 172 million to increase access to HIV prevention services, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) , outreach efforts , and care coordination for approximately 400 health centers . Ryan White H IV/AIDS P rogram Millions of l ives have b een l ost o r changed f orever due to H IV sinc e the fi rst c ases were r eported i n the United States in J une 1 981. Over 36 ,000 p eople were diagnosed w ith HIV i n the United S tates i n 201 9, and a n estimated 1 .2 million people in the United States ar e living w ith H IV. Among those livin g with H IV, one in eight do n ot know t hey a re infected. The b udget p rovides $2. 7 billion for t he Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program , which is $ 160 million above FY 2022 enacte d. This program provides a comprehensive system o f primary medical care, essential support services, and medication for pe ople with l ow incomes living w ith H IV/AIDS . More t han hal f a million people \u2014 repre senting half o f all people w ith d iagnosed HIV i n the Un ited States \u2014recei ve services through t he Ryan White Program each year. In 2 020, 89.4 percent o f Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients were virally suppressed, which exceed s the national average of 65.5 percent. This means individuals have an undetectable viral load and cannot sexually transmit the virus to a partner. The bud get increases funding for the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U nited States Initiative by providing an additional $ 165 million above FY 2022 e nacted , for a total of $ 290 million. Funding will support HIV care and treatment for over 76,000 clients in the 5 0 geographic locations that currently have more than 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses nationally and the seven states with substantial rural HIV burden . This funding will also expand evidence -informed practices to link, engage, and retain people with HIV in care, and support capacity building, technical assistance, program implementation, and oversight\u2014 with a focus on reducing disparities in health outcomes and building the capacity of organizations that reflect the communities they serve . Titl e X Family Planning Program For more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have ensured access to a broad range of family planning and related health services for millions of individuals who are l ow-income or uninsured . The budget provides $400 million, an increase of $114 million above F Y 2022 enacted, to the Title X Family Planning program to improve access to vital reproductive and preventive health services. The Title X program prioritizes a dvancing e quit y for all, including people from families with low incomes , people of color, and o thers who have been historically underserved, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. The FY 2023 budget request is expected to support family planning services for approximately 4.25 million people , with approximately 90 percent havi ng family incomes at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level. 29 Health Resources and Services Administration Health Resources and Services Administration IMPR OVING MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH HRSA programs provid e health and public health services , support research, and invest in workforce training to ensure the health and well -being of mothers, children, and families across their lives. At least 93 percent of pregnant people and 98 percent of all infants receive HRSA -funded services , including infant screenings and preventive care visits, each year through the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant to States program. Im proving Maternal Health Despite improvements in medical care , the U nited States continues to have the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations . In 2020 , more than 8 00 women die d from pregnancy -related causes in the U.S. and nearly 20,000 infants die d before reaching their first birthday . In addition, each year, tens of thousands of mothers experience severe morbidity \u2014unintended outcomes of labor and delivery that result in life -altering short - or long -term health challenges, such as severe heart issues, hemorrhages, seizures, and blood inf ections. The maternal mortality rate s are highest for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women, with rates that are two to three times higher than those for white populations . These inequities are major drivers of the poor overall U.S. rates of mater nal mortality and infant mortality. Geographic disparities in maternal health outcomes also persist, and county -level access to obstetric care services varies widely across states. \"I call on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressi ng the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity in this country.\" - President Biden Proclam ation on Black Maternal Health Week, April 2021 To t ackle these disparities, the budget dedicate s $276 million across HRSA to improve maternal health and specifically reduce maternal mortality and morbidity , $202 million above FY 2022 enacted . HRSA will expand current initiatives, including : State Maternal Health Innovation Grant s ($55 million, $ 26 million above FY 2022 enacted): to implement state specific innovative action plans to improve access to maternal care services and address workforce needs ; Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health($15 million, $ 3 million above FY 2022 enacted): to expand the implementation of maternal safety bundles , which are straightforward sets of evidence -based practices shown to improve patient outcomes,in birthing facilities , community -based organizations and outpatient clinical settings; Rural Maternity and Obstetrics ManagementStrategies ($10 million, $ 4 million above FY 2022 enacted): to expand maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities; Screening and Treatment for MaternalDepression ($10 million, $ 4 million above FY 2022 enacted): to expand health care providers' capacity to screen, assess, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum individuals for maternal depression and related behavioral health needs ; Maternal Health Hotline ($7 million, $ 3 million above FY 2022 enacted ): to expand funding for a vital, easily accessible new maternal mental health resource ; Maternity Care Target Area s ($5 million, $4 million above FY 2022 enacted ): to identify geographic areas with maternity care health 30Health Resources and Services Administration pr ofessional shortages to inform efforts to distribute maternity care health professionals to these areas; and Healthy Start program ($32 million, $17 million above FY 2022 enacted): to 1) support an existing initiative to provide clinical services, such as well -woman care and maternity care services at Healthy Start sites and 2) expan d a new Healthy Start model to reduce racial disparities in poor maternal andinfant health outcomes. This funding will support new programs in communities withthe highest rates of disparities, focusing on addressing the unique structural,environmental, and systemic factors thatcontribute to disparities in poor outcomes for mothers and their babies. T he budget also includes funding for HRSA to launch innovative maternal health programs , including : Pregnancy Medical Home Demonstration Project ($25 million, $25 million above FY 2022 enacted ): t o support efforts to deliver integrated health care services to pregnant and postpartum individuals and reduce adverse maternal health outcomes and racial disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity ; Implicit Bias Training Grants for Health Care Providers ($5 million, $5 million above FY 2022 enacted ): to reduce and prevent implicit bias, racism, and discrimination in maternity care settings and to advancerespectful, culturally congruent, trauma- informed care ; National Academy of Medicine Study ($1 million, $1 million above FY 2022 enacted): to study and make recommendations for incorporating biasrecognition in clinical skills testing for accredited schools of allopathic medicine and accredited schools of osteopathic medicine ; and Maternal Health Pilot Programs ($110 millio n, $110 million above FY 202 2 enacted) o $55 million for Addressing Emerging Issues and Social Determinants ofMaternal Health o $20 million for Growing and Diversifying the Doula Workforceo $25 million for Growing and Diversifying the Nursing Workforce o $10 million to support research and curricula development through Minority -Serving Institutions . Ho me Visiting The budget pro poses $ 467 million in mandatory funding for the Home Visiting program , which is a $67 million increase above the current mandatory funding in FY 2022 enacted. Home Visiting serves a crucial role in promoting the physical and mental health of pregnant people , young children, and families living in communities at risk for poor maternal a nd child health outcomes. Each year, the voluntary Home Visiting program serves over 144,000 parents and children and provides more than 9 40,000 home visits. The expansion of Home Visiting will allow the program to reach more families, increasing the program's reach in communities that have historically experienced systemic racism and health inequities. Home Visiting programs have been shown to improve maternal and child health outcomes in the early years, leaving long - lasting, positive impacts on parenting skills, children's development, and school readiness . Home Visiting programs have also been found to improve women's health, including reductions in symptoms of depression , and increase women's health insurance coverage . The Adminis tration i s committed to working with Congress to double funding for Home Visiting. Other Maternal and Child Health Programs The budget requests $ 1 billion for other maternal and child health programs in addition to the programs related to reducing matern al mortality, which is $60 million above FY 2022 enacted. This includes $592 million, an increase of $ 24 million above FY 2022 enacted, for the M aternal and Child Health Block Grant to States to expand health care and public health services that currently benefit an estimated 60 million women, infants, and children . Funding also includes increases to Emergency Medical Services for Children ($ 28 million, $6 million above FY 2022 enacted) to address critical gaps in emergency and trauma care and to Autism and Other Developmental Disorders ( $57 million, $3 million above FY 2022 enacted) to improve care and outcomes for people with autism spectrum disorder . 31TRANSFORM ING RURAL HE ALTH IN A MERICA More than 61 million Americans liv e in rural communities , and too o f ten face c hallenges in access he alth care s ervices .

The budget includes $119 million in mandatory funding for training clinicians in these community -based settings, such as rural health clinics and health centers , which are primarily in medically underserved communities. Supporting a Diverse Health Workforce Several HRSA programs seek to foster a more diverse health workforce providing support for individuals with less access to opportunity , including underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities. The budget provides $133 million, an increase of $15 million above FY 2022 enacted, to expand the diversity of the health professions workforce , including Nursing Workforce Diversity, Centers of Excellence, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Faculty Loan Repayment , and Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students . Greater diversity among health professionals is associated with improve d outcomes and access to health care . OTHER HRSA PROGRAMS 340B Drug Pricing Program The 340B Drug Pricing Program is an integral component of the health care safety net, requiring drug manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient prescription drugs to certain health care providers that serve vulnerable and underserved patient populatio ns.

In accordance with this relationship, the Indian Health Service ( IHS) provides healthcare to over 2.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) through IHS and Tribal Health Programs, as 1 The FY 2021 column reflects final levels, including required and permissive transfers, but do es not include $7.1 billion i n COVID-19 supplemental r esources. 2 Includes di scretionary budget authority and mandatory funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. 3 The FY 2022 column reflects enacted levels, i ncluding required transfers, but do es not include $700 million i n funding f rom the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 4 The FY 2023 budget proposes a ll IHS funding as mandatory. 5 The FY 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-260) extended the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through FY 2023 at $150 million per year. F Y 2022 and FY 2023 level s reflect current law, which includes a mandatory sequester of 2%. Indian Health Service 35Indian Health Service well as Urban Indian Organizations, often referred to as the I/T/U or Indian Health system . IHS consults and partners with tribes to incorporate their priorities and needs into programs that affect their communities. The I ndian Health system is chronically under -funded compared to other health systems in the U nited States.67 These funding deficiencies directly contribute to stark health disparities faced by tribal communities. AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years short er than the U.S. all- races population, with some tribes experiencing life expectancy as much as 12 years short er than the general population. They also experience disproportionate rates of mortality from most major health issues, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, diabetes, unintentional injuries, assault and homicide, and suicide. The pandemic compounded the impact of these disparities in tr ibal communities, with AI/ANs experiencing disproportionate rates of COVID -19 infection, hospitalization, and death. LONG -TERM FUNDING SOLUTIONS The Administration is committed to implementing long - term solutions to address chronic under -funding of IHS and finally delivering on the n ation's promises to Indian Country . To that end, t he Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 President's Budget takes the historic step of proposing all funding for the IHS as mandatory funding and to exempt the IHS budget from sequestration . The budget proposes $9. 3 billion for IHS in FY 2023, which includes $147 million in current law mandatory funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This is an increase of $2. 5 billion or 37 percent above FY 2022 enacted. Proposing mandatory funding for IHS is aligned with long-standing recommendations of tribal leaders that have been shared in consultation with HHS. Implementing this change to the IHS budget will make meaningful progress toward redressing health inequities and ensuring that the disproportionate impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on AI/AN communities are never repeated. Growth beyond what can be accomplished through discretionary spending is necessary to make substantial progress toward closing funding gaps and remediating healt h disparities. While discretionary funding for IHS 6 Government Accounta bility Office Report: Indian Health Service: Spending Levels and Characteristics of IHS and Three Other Federal Health Care Programs 7 United States Commission on Civil Rights Report: Broken Promises: Continuing Federal Funding Shortfall for Native Americans has increased substantially in the last decade, by 57 percent from FY 2012 to the current FY 2022 enacted level, the growth has not been sufficient to address the well -documented funding gaps in Indian Country. The budget proposes to authorize mandatory funding for IHS from FY 2023 to FY 2032 . Funding would grow over time, from $9. 3 billion in FY 2023 to $36.7 billion in FY 2032, an increase of 296 percent over the 10-year budget window. In addition to allowing for more significant funding increases each year, the budget will enable IHS, Tribal Health Programs, and U rban Indian Organizations to more effectively plan healthcare programming over multiple years , because outyear funding levels will be known in advance . This increased stability and ability to conduct longer -term planning will improve quality of health care , promote recruitment and retention of health professionals, and enhance management efficiencies for individual health programs and the Indian Health system at -large . In FY 2023 , the budget maintains substantial funding increases proposed in the FY 2023 advance appropriation level included in the FY 2022 budget. It makes high -impact investments that will expand access to healthcare services, modernize aging facilities and information techno logy infrastructure, and address urgent health issues, including HIV and Hepatitis C, maternal mortality, and opioid use. It also includes funding to improve healthcare quality, enhance operational capacity, fully fund operational costs for Tribal health programs to support tribal self - determination, and recruit and retain healthcare providers. From FY 2024 to FY 2032, the budget continues to grow each year to account for the growing cost of providing 36healthca re, using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Medical Inflation, the Employment Cost Index, as well as population and pay growth. The budget also includes additional increases over the 10 - year window to begin addressing documented gaps in healthcare services and infrastructure. These investments collectively support IHS's strategic goals to improve access to comprehensive and culturally appropriate care, promote excellence and quality through innovation, and strengthen the agency's management and operations. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TRIBES Commitment to Tribal Consultation HHS is committed to maintaining a strong Nation- to- Nation relationship between the federal government and tribes. In 2021, HHS held the first ever formal Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer sessions to consider m andatory proposals for the IHS budget . These sessions provided critical input to inform formulation of the FY 2023 budget and were an important first step . With the release of the budget , we look forward to working with tribes and Congress to refine this hist oric proposal through the legislative process and ensure funding is implemented properly. The F Y 2023 b udget i s a historic f irst ste p and the st art of an ongoing conversation with tribes to e nsure t he IHS sy stem i s meetin g the healthcare needs i n Indian Country. HHS l ooks forward t o working in c onsultation with tribes , urban Indian organizations, and C ongress to identify t he a ppropriate s tructure a nd long-term funding l evels t o make s ustained i mprovements i n health s tatus a s we continue to s trengthen th e Nation - to-Nation r elationship. Supporting Tribal Self -Determination Additionally, H HS con tinues t o support the self- determination of tribes to operate their own health programs. Tribal leaders and members are best positioned to understand the priorities and needs of their local communities. In recognition of this, the Indian Self -Determinati on and Education Assistance Act allows tribes to enter into contracts or compacts to directly administer health programs that would otherwise be administered by IHS. The amount of the IHS budget that is administered through these contracts and compacts ha s grown over time, with over 60 percent of IHS funding currently administered directly by tribes. Tribes design and manage the delivery of individual and community health services through 22 hospitals, 31 9 health centers, 552 ambulatory clinics, 79 health stations, 146 Alaska village clinics, and 8 school health centers across Indian Country. The budget continues this strong commitment to supporting tribes as they determine the best approach to providing healthcare services in their individual communities. ADVANC ING HEALTH EQUITY BY PROVIDING HIGH - QUALITY CARE IN INDIAN COUNTRY Historical trauma and chronic underinvestment significant ly contributed to the perpetuation of health disparities in Indian Country. These stark inequit ies illustrate the ur gent need for investments to improve the health status and quality of life of AI/ANs. In FY 2023, the budget includes $6.3 billion in the Services account, an increase of $1. 6 billion above FY 2022 enacted. These increases will expand access to programs that provide essential health services and community -based disease prevention and promotion in tribal communities. This funding will support additional direct patient care services across the IHS system, including inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory care, dental care, and medical support services, such as laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, behavioral health services, and physical therapy. Addressing Targeted Health Challenges In FY 2023, the budget also includes targeted investments in IHS as part of HHS initiatives to address our Nation's most pressing public health challenges, which disproportionately impact AI/AN communities. This includes HIV and Hepatitis C, maternal mortality and morbidity, and opioid use. Ending HIV and Hepatitis C in Indian Country ($52 million): Provides $47 million above FY 2022 enacted to enhance access to HIV testing, promote linkages to care, provide treatment, and reduce the spread of HIV 37Indian Health ServiceIndian Health Service through the prescribing of pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Funds will als o support enhanced surveillance and data infrastructure to better track HIV, Hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted diseases through Tribal Epidemiology Centers. Addressing Opioid Use ($20 million): Provides $9 million above FY 2022 enacted to enhance existing activities to provide prevention, treatment, and recovery services to addressthe impact of opioid use in AI/AN communities. This includes activities toincreas e knowledge and use of culturally appropriate interventions and encourage the use of medi cation- assisted treatment. Improving Maternal Health ($10 million): Provides $ 4 million above FY 2022 enacted to improve maternal health in AI/ANcommunities. Funding supports preventive, perinatal, and postpartum care; addresses theneeds of pregnant women with opioid orsubstance use disorder; and advances thequality of services provided to improve health outc omes and reduce maternal morbidity. American Indian & Alaska Native Health Disparities text image, full description located i n the paragraph foll owing this image BehaviorL health and substance abuse disparities: American Indians and Alaskan Natives suffer disproportionatly from drug abuse and significant behavioral health challanges. 10.1% of Ame rican Indians and Alaska Natives ages 12+ have experienced substance use disorder in the past year Substantiall y higher than other ethnicities: Whites (7. 7%), Hispanics (7.1%), Asians (4.8%), and African Americans (6.8%). Hep C and HIV epidemic in Indian Country: American Indian and Alaska Native people face significant health dispariti es in rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. 40,000 - 1000,000 American Indian and Alaska Native people living with Hepatitis C 67% increase in the number of HIV diagnoses among American Indians and Al aska Natives aged 25-34 from 2010 to 2017 Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) rates are also rising in Indian Country, further inc reasing the risk of HIV transmission. Maternal Health Disparities: American Indian and Alaska Native women are more than two times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women regardless of education and socioeconomic status. 30 pregnancy-relate d deaths for American Indian and Alaska Native women, as compared to the rate for white women, 13 out of 100,000 Hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders lead to disproportionate levels of pregnancy-related deaths for AI/AN woman compared to white women. 38Indian Health Service Staffing for New and Expanded Facilities In FY 2023, the budget fully funds staffing and operating costs for eight newly constructed or expanded healthcare facilities including: Naytahwaush Health Center in Naytahwaush, Minnesota; Northeast Ambulatory Care Center (Salt River) in Scottsdale, Arizona; Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona; Ysleta Del Sur Health Center in El Paso, Texas; Alternative Rural Health Center in Dilkon, Arizona; Elbowoods Memorial Health Center in New Town, North Dakota; North Star Health Clinic in Seward, Alaska; and Rapid City Health Center in Rapid City, South Dakota . These investments will expand access to healthcare services in local communities where existing capacity is overextended. Four of these projects are part of the highly successful Joint Venture Construction Program, where tribes fund construction of a new or replacement facility, and IHS works with Congress to fund staffing and operating costs. Closing Documented Funding Gaps for Direct Healthcare Services Over the 10-year budget window, the Services account grows to $34.2 billion, an increase of $29.5 billion above FY 2022 enacted . In addition to accounting for inflationary factors, t his funding would address the funding gap for direct healthcare services documented in the FY 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup's Level of Need Funded analysis 8. The fund is authorized in the Indian Health Care Imp rovement Act to eliminate deficiencies in the health status and resources of all Indian Tribes, eliminate backlogs in healthcare services provided to AI/ANs, meet the needs of AI/ANs in an efficient and equitable manner, eliminate inequities in funding for both direct care and Purchased/Referred Care programs, and augment health services where deficiencies are highest. In FY 2018, an IHS workgroup comprised of both federal and tribal representatives was convened to evaluate the fund's formula and propose p otential revisions to the formula. As part of this process, the workgroup documented an estimated $16.2 billion funding need in 2018 for direct healthcare services in comparison to a benchmark of national health expenditures . In FY 2018, the IHS received $4.9 billion in resources for direct health care services. This leaves a funding deficiency of $11.2 billion. The budget proposes to address this documented gap over 5 years , from FY 2024 to FY 2028. These funding increases would be distributed across the IHS funding 8Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup Interim Report lines that provide direct healthcare services, including: Hospitals and Health Clinics, Purchased/Referred Care, Dental Health, Mental Health, Alcohol and Substance Abuse, Indian Health Care Improvement Fund , Public Health Nursing, Health Education, Community Health Representatives, and Urba n Indian Health. This approach ensures a broad benefit of this increased funding for all tribes, while also seeking to address funding disparities within the Indian Health syste m. Health Information T echnology Modernization The IHS Health Information Technology infrastructure supports the delivery of quality healthcare to 2.7 million AI/AN people . The Electronic Health Record is an essential tool for the provision of clinical care, administrative functions of hospitals and health clinics, and third -party billing for reimbursements that are foundational to the operating budgets of many health facilities. IHS requires a secure, certified system to improve healthcare delivery and quality, enhance access to care, reduce medical errors, enhance data collection and tracking, and improve health outcomes in Indian Country . The current IHS E lectronic Health Record (EHR) , the Resource and Patient Manag ement System (RPMS) , is over 50 years old, and the G overnment Accountability Office identifie d it as one of the 10 most critical federal legacy systems in need of modernization. IHS relies on its EHR for all aspects of patient care -from the patient record to prescriptions, and care referrals to billing public and private insurance for reimbursable healthcare services. In 2017, t he Department of Veterans Affairs announced it will phase out an underlying system that IHS uses to op erate RPMS . Over the coming years, IHS must modernize its Health Information Technology infrastructure, including its EHR, to a n innovative and practical solution that meets the needs of IHS, Tribal, and Urban facilities and patients . The budget invests an additiona l $6 billion from FY 2024 to FY 2028 to complete the transition to an improved and modernized EHR system. This substantial investment demonstrates the mission - critical nature of this effort, which will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the health of AI/AN people. This additional funding will support the following activities , which are vital to the success of the Health IT Modernization initiative: 39Indian Health Service Continued efforts to stabilize the aging system while Electronic Health Record modernization is underway; Procurement of a solution and initial buildactivities for the Electronic Health Recordenvironment; Initial site transition planning; Work to ensure intero perability with partners; Efforts to centralize immunization informationand exchange data with state immunizationand public health systems; and Completing individual site transitions to moveto the new system and address the individualized needs of each healthcare delivery site. ADDRE SSING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN INDIAN COUNTRY IHS manages a comprehensive facilities and environmental health portfolio , including programs that support the planning and construction of healthcare facilities , sanitation facilities construction , engineering services, and facilities operations. The facilities programs improve access to medical care and promote collaboration and partnership between tribes and IHS. Outdated facilities can pose challenges in providing patient care, recr uiting and retaining staff, and meeting accreditation standards. IHS hospitals are 40 years old on average, which is almost four times the age of the average hospital in the United States. The operational challenges posed by outdated infrastructure were acutely highlighted during the COVID -19 pandemic, when additional renovations and maintenance were necessary for many IHS and Tribal Facilities to mount an appropriate response. Infrastructure improvements continue to be an urgent need across the Indian health system. This includes significant backlogs in healthcare facilities construction, sanitation facilities construction, maintenance and improvement of IHS and Tribal facilities, and medical equipment. The budget provides $ 1.6 billion for Facilities programs in FY 2023\u2014 an increase of $627 million above FY 2022 enacted \u2014to support projects on the Healthcare Facilities Construction Priority List, fund sanitation construction projects, purchase medical equipment, support maintenance and improvement of health facilities, and support the Facilities and Environmental Health Support program. Over the 10-year budget window, the Facilities account grows to $4.7 billion, an increase of $3.7 billion above FY 2022 enacted. Over this period, the budget provides additional funding to complete the projects on the Healthcare Facilities Construction Priority List and to address existing projects on the Sanitation Deficiency System, maintenance and improvement of IHS and tribal facilities , and the maintenance and replacement of medical equipment for IHS and Tribal Health Programs. Healthcare Facilities Construction The Healthcare Facilities Construction Priority List , developed in 1993 by IHS in consultation with tribes, governs new and replacement facilities construction. The 2010 reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act incorporated the Priority List in statute. The addition al funding provided in the budget will support the completion of the remaining projects on the Priority List, including: Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona; Whiteriver Hospital in White River, AZ; Gallup Indian Medical Center in Gallup, New Mexico; and outpatient facilities in Bodaway Gap, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Sells, Arizona. Comp leting this almost 30 -year -old list will enable IHS to begin addressing critical facilities 40needs across Indian Country that are beyond the scope capture d in the Priority List.

Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same. CDC i ncreases the health security of our nation. As the nation's health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. To accomplish its mission, CDC conducts critical science and provides health information that protects our nation against expensive and dangerous health threats and responds when these arise. The C enters for Disease Control a nd P revention ( CDC) is the na tion's health protection agency. The CD C works 24/7 to p revent and protect ag ainst public health t hreats domesti c and a broad. CD C plays a k ey role in de tecting a nd responding t o new a nd emerging health threats, p utting s cience i nto a ction to p revent disease, promoting h ealthy and s afe b ehaviors, communities a nd environments, a nd d eveloping a nd training a robust public he alth workforce.

This includes new p roposed mandatory fu nding t o establish a Vaccines f or Adults p rogram a n d m andatory funding to s upport President B iden's plan to transform U.S. capabilities t o prepare f o r and re spond r apidly a nd effectively to f ut ure p andemics an d other h igh co n sequence b iological t hreats . Th e FY 2023 b udget prioritizes investments and policies to enhance public h ealth capacity and infrastructure a t the state, lo cal, and federal levels and to e nsure t h at nec essary le gislative au thorities and flexibilities a re in plac e to allow C DC to e ffectively and efficiently a ddr ess known and e merging public health t hreats. In par ticular, t he FY 202 3 budget prioritizes i nv estments that w ill modernize public h ealt h data collection, increase c apacity to f orecast and analyze f uture o utbreaks response. Addi tionally, t he b udget i nvests in a ra n ge o f CDC p rogram s to a dvance h e alth equity a nd h e althy env ironments, including maternal health, v iral hepatitis, s ickle c ell disease , youth m ental h e alth a l ead poisoning prevention . In a ddition, t h e b udge t includes robust i nvestments to address violence a n d climate change, two significant public health issues that jeopardize the health and wellbeing of the nation . To continue to address gun violence as a public health epidemic, the budget also invests in community violence intervention and firearm safety research. Buil ding on the investments in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, CDC will support core public health capacity improvements in s tates and t erritories, modernize public health data collection nationwide, train new epidemiologists and other public health experts, and build international capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to emerging global threats. MODERNIZING BUDGET STRUCTURE AND AUTHORITIES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS The FY 2023 budget proposes to enhance preparedness capacity and CDC's response to public health emergencies , as well as modernize CDC's budget structure . The budget includes several legislative authorities which would allow CDC to more effectively and efficiently prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. This includes additional authorities to: recruit and retain public health professionals more effectively, limit caps on overtime pay for employees working on emergency and response operations, provide danger pay to employees serving in an environment that may result in physical harm or risk to health and wellbeing, and to provide CDC with additional flexibility to enter into financial transactions other than contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements when the HHS Secretary has declared a public health emergency or determined there is a significant potential for an emergency . As an agency with public health emerg ency response as a core part of its mission, CDC's current budget structure with 13 separate Treasury accounts is not flexible enough to enable a \"whole of agency\" response to a national public health emergency. The account structure proposal in FY 2023 would reduce CDC's 13 separate Treasury accounts into one \"CDC - Wide Activities and Program Support\" account, 43 Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention enabling the agency to more efficiently bring its resources to bear to address a crisis. This would provide flexibility to deploy staff more efficiently to CDC's response activities and appropriately cover associated salaries, while retaining accountability for specific programs, projects , and activities. CROSSCUTTING CDC- WIDE ACTIVITIES To complement program or disease specific investments, CDC leverages critical crosscutting resources to effectively implement, manage, and provide oversight of federal funding appropriated to CDC. The FY 2023 budget includes $ 969 million in crosscutting funding, of which $600 million will support flexible public health infrastructure and capacity investments within states, territories, localities, and at CDC, and $50 million will sustain investments in the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which was established with American Rescue Plan Act of 202 1 (ARP) supplemental resources. The FY 2023 budget also includes $1 24 million for leadership, communication, and public health innovation, which includes an increase of $10 million above FY 2022 enacted, and is the first request for increased funding for this activity in over a decade. Public Health Capacity and Infrastructure The COVID -19 pandemic has revealed long -standing vulnerabilities in the nation's public health system. Public health officials in many jurisdictions have described how the lack of sufficient funding and capacity prior to the pandemic left jurisdictions poorly prepared to conduct basic public health functions required to address such a rapidly moving, deadl y disease. CDC is committed to building a responsive, highly coordinated, strategic, and predictive public health system. The FY 2023 budget includes $600 million in flexible funding to support core public health capacity investments at all levels of gov ernment. These investments will enhance capacity to surge for local, state, regional, or national emergencies, conduct long-term public health planning, and expand or create new evidence -based approaches. Investing in public health infrastructure will en able health departments to address the challenges of today and be better prepared to address the public health challenges of tomorrow. Cente r for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics President Biden's National Security Memorandum -1 called for the establishment of a national capability that would support the US government and partners with advanced analytics, disease modeling, and outbreak analytics. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) provided initial funding to establish the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA) at CDC. With this investment, CDC has begun developingthis critical interagency capability, and is alreadyproviding insights to inform the CDC and United StatesGovernment response on issues such as the wave ofOmicron infe ctions in late 2021. The FY 2023 budget includes $50 million in dedicated funding which would allow CDC to sustain the CFA in FY 2023. This funding is critical to maintain CFA's functionality for COVID -19 and other pandemic or epidemic threats. 44IMMU NIZATION AND RE SPIRATORY D ISEASES The existing i mmunization i nfrastructure a t federal, state, and local levels play s a critical role in lim iti ng and pre venting t he spr ead of in fectious dis e ase. COVID -19 hi ghlighted the i mportance of a r obust a nd a daptable i mmunization i nfrastructure as a k ey co mponent o f ou tbreak r esponse and r ecovery. Th e FY 2023 b udget proposes s i gnificant i nvestments i n the d iscretionary Section 317 Immunization p rogram, as well as le gislative changes t o expand the Vaccines fo r Children program and t o establish a new m andatory V accines for A dults program. In addition to a n es timated $5.9 billion i n m andatory re sources for the V accines for C hildren p rogram u n der proposed l aw, and a n estimated $2.1 billion in ma ndatory r esources for the n ew Vaccines f or Adults p rogram u nder p roposed l a w, the FY 2023 b udget inc ludes $ 1.3 billion, an inc re ase o f $383 m illion above FY 2022 enacted, i n discretionary resources for Im munization and R espiratory D iseases. This inc ludes $994 million for t he dis cretionary Section 3 17 Imm unization program, which will he lp transition to a sustainable program t o support C OVID -19 vaccination in the future, co n tinue research r elated to l o ng C OVID - 1 9 conditions, and e nhance s u pport in t he h u man papillo ma virus (HPV) v accination efforts in alignment wi th the A d ministration's Cancer Moonshot Initiative prio rities. Within the discretionary t otal, t he FY 2023 budget a lso includes $251 million t o enhance s upport for C DC's influ enza program, w ith a f ocus on i ncreased sur veillance o f nov el influenza viruses. Vaccines for Ch ildren Vaccines f or Children is an entitlement p rogram, funded through M edicaid a nd implemented b y CDC, th at provides A dvisory Committee o n Im munization Practices -recommended v accines at no c ost to un insured o r underinsured c h ildren.

PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS Tackling the pandemic remains a key focus for the FY 2023 budget, which includes key investments across HHS and within CDC for pandemic response as well as for preparing for the future. P andemic Preparedness Plan The FY 2023 budget includes an effort totaling $81.7 billion in mandatory funding, available over five years across the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support the Administration's plan to transform U.S. capabilities to prepare for and respond rapidly and effectively to future pandemics and other high consequence biological threats. Within this total, the FY 2023 budge t requests $28 billion in mandatory funding for CDC to invest in the public health system infrastructure, support international capabilities for vaccine preparedness and medical countermeasure development, enhance domestic and global disease surveillance, expand laboratory capacity, further develop a robust public health workforce, and strengthen public health data systems. The CD C-specific investments will help transform our medical defenses, ensure early warning and situational awareness, strengthen publi c health systems, and build core capabilities \u2014a ll which will transform America's pandemic preparedness while having major benefits for public health in general. I ncreased Access to Vaccines T he budget establishes a new, mandatory Vaccines for Adults progr am, which will provide uninsured adults with access to all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at no cost. As a complement to the successful Vaccines for Children program, the Vaccines For Adults program will reduce disparities in vaccine coverage and promote infrastructure for broad access to routine and outbreak vaccines. The budget would also expand the children's program to include all children under age 19 enrolled in CHIP. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 45HIV/ AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION C DC envisions a future free of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis. In working Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toward that future, C DC prioritizes cost -effective, scalable programs, policies, and research to achieve the greatest reduction in the incidence of these conditions \u2014all of which have significant personal, societal, and economic costs for all Americans and an even greater cost for certain groups. The FY 2023 budget includes $1. 5 billion, an increase of $126 million above FY 2022 enacted, for CDC's efforts to support state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments ' responses to infectious disease outbreaks, with a focus on comprehensive, evidence - based approaches to prevent the spread of infection. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States Through the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, CDC works to reduce new HIV infections and advance health equity by reaching di sproportionately affected populations, including gay and bisexual men of color, transgender and cisgender Black/African American women, and people who inject drugs. The budget provides $1.1 billion for CDC's domestic HIV/AIDS surveillance and prevention efforts, which includes $310 million, an increase of $1 15 million above FY 2022 enacted, to continue to advance HHS's efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 48 counties, the District of Columbia , and San Juan, Puerto Rico, which together account for more than 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses, and seven states that have a substantial rural HIV burden with additional expertise, technology, and resources. In FY 2023, the CDC will expand innovations, implement approaches that integrate health equity into the entire HIV prevention portfolio, test innovative service delivery models designed to increase access to prevention services, and strengthen engagement of community -based organizations in implement ing the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative . These investments will result in approximately 1 6,000 new diagnoses being identified , 13,000 people re - linked to healthcare , 15,000 people enrolled in pre - exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services and treatment, and investigation of and response to 100 HIV clusters or outbreaks. Health equity is central to addressing the HIV epidemic, and CDC is embracing innovative strategies to increase access to HIV prevention services, enhance community engagement, and combat st igma. The FY 2023 budget investments will help fulfil l the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2022 -2025) commitment to a 75 percent reduction in HIV infection by 2025 . EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases works to protect people at home and around the world from infectious disease outbreaks and public health threats. These threats include foodborne, waterborne , and fungal infections, bioth reats like anthrax, and infections like rabies and Lyme disease that spread between people, animals, and insects. CDC also provides expertise, guidance , and resources to support travelers abroad and domestically. The FY 2023 budget includes $ 703 million for CDC's emerging and z oonotic infectious diseases activities and prioritizes funding to address the ongoing risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria, as described previously , as well as expanded and modernized public health and migration systems to protect the United States during future international outbreaks and pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIFIC SERVICES The FY 2023 budget includes $ 799 million for CDC to lead, promote , and facilitate scientific standards and policies. This includes prov iding leadership and training to create an impactful public health workforce , maintaining and transforming public health surveillance systems and infrastructure and ensuring readily available access to information that public health professionals need to inform policy and action. Specifically, t he National Center for Health Statistics produces official health statistics for the nation and provides critical evidence to inform policies, m onitor programs, track progress, and measure change. The budget includes $ 182 million, which will allow CDC to enhance critical data collection activities . Additional funding in FY 2023 will be used to expand the sample size of the National Health Interv iew Survey to allow for disaggregated estimates and intersectional analyses of healthcare access, chronic disease conditions, and mental health status by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation , and gender identi ty. Public Health Data Modernization Initiativ e Investments in CDC's Public Health Data Modernization Initiative in FY 2020 and FY 2021 have enabled CDC to take the first steps to strengthen the public health data and surveillance infrastructure of the United States. To date, CDC's ongoing efforts have laid the groundwork for a sustainable strategy to advance data science, build robust public- private partnerships to support 46health i nformation e xchange, and to m odernize d ata systems at state, local, tribal , and t erritorial public healt h agencies and at t he C D C.

INJ URY P REVENTION AND CONTROL Violence is a serious and growing pr oblem in the United S ta tes affecting pe ople in all stages o f life. Furthe rmore, i njuries a nd v iolence a re leading ca uses of death f o r children a nd a dults ages 1 -45 in the United States. Many survivors of v iolence su ffer p hysical, menta l, and/or emotional health p r oblems throughout their liv es . Preventing violence a nd injuries u ses the same p u bl ic health m ethods u sed t o pre vent d isease: careful ly defining t he p roblem t hrough d ata, s t udying factors that inc rease o r decrease r isk, de si gning and evaluati ng interventions that target th ese r isk fact ors, and t ak in g step s to e nsur e that p roven str a tegies are implem ented i n communities n ationwide. CDC is committe d to r educing h ealth d isparities, a chieving health equity, a ddressing the epidemic o f systemic racism as i t relates t o inj ury and violence, and fostering a diverse inj u ry and v iolence pr evention workforce to ensure all people c an achieve lif elong h ealth and wellbeing . CDC's goal i s to keep people sa fe w here they l i ve, w ork, p lay, a nd learn . The F Y 2023 b udget includes $ 1.3 billion, an inc rease o f $568 million above F Y 2022 enacted, f or inj ury preventi on a nd control programs . Thi s funding level supports inv es tments that will allow C DC to ad vanc e efforts to reduce all forms o f violence \u2014inclu ding community violence, g un v iolence, i ntimate p artne r violence , gender -based v iolence, and sexual violence. Specifically , the FY 2023 budget provide s an additional $5 m illion above F Y 2022 enacted for domestic v iolence com munity p rojects, a llowing to C DC to e x pand t he Dome stic V iolence Prevention E nhanceme nt and Leadership T hrough Alliances ( DELTA) pr ogram, $45 million abo ve FY 2022 enacted for r ape pre vention education, and $10 million above FY 2022 enacted for the National Violent Death Reporting System. In addition, the FY 2023 budget prioritizes and increases investments in CDC's suicide prevention program , which focuses on early intervention, and expands support for states to improve surveillance and research to prevent Adverse Childhood Experiences. Community and Youth Violence Prevention The FY 2023 budget includes $265 million, of which $250 million is dedicated to continuing the Community Violence Intervention Initiative. These funds will support the implementation and monitoring of proven, evidence -based strategies to address community violence, including strategies in hospital settings , by state and local health departments. This increase also supports additional awards to further build the evidence base for prevention violence in communities experiencing the greatest burden, and to reduce the racial, ethnic, and economic inequities that characterize such violence across the U nited States. CDC also funds five National Centers of Excellence in Youth Violence Prevention , or Youth Violen ce Prevention Centers. Each center is an academic - community collaboration to advance the science and practice of youth violence prevention research. Through local partnerships, the CDC centers of excellence develop, implement, and rigorously evaluate innovative strategies to prevent violence and 47 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention creat e safer, healthier family and community environments for youth. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research Firearm injuries are a serious public health problem. In 2020, there were 45,222 firearm -related deaths in the United States\u2014 roughly 124 people dying from a firearm -related injury each day. Firearm injuries affect people in all stages of life, though some groups have higher rates of firearm injury than others: Males account for 86 percent of all victims of firearm death s, Firearm homicide rates are highest among teens and young adults 15 -34 years of age, and Firearm suicide rates are highest among adults75 years of age and older and among AmericanIndian/Alaska Native and non- Hispanic white popul ations.

Addressing the Drug Overdose Epidemic in America The drug o verdose epidemic continue s to evolve a nd is becoming m ore complex through a n increasing range of drugs , such as synthetic opioids (e.g., illicitly manufactured fentanyl) and stimulants, and an increase in po lysubstance use. In 2020,over 93,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States,up from70,630 in 2019 and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Combatting t he current overdose e pidemic remains a priority for CDC and i ts drug overdose prevention w ork encompasses f our foundational pillars (surveillance and research, building state, local, and tribal capacity, supporting providers, health systems, and payers, and partnering with public safety), all of which align wit h the O ffice of N ational Drug C ontrol Policy drug control strategy. These activities are implemented within a framework centering on health Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention equity, reducing sti gma, and improving linkage to care and treatment. The FY 20 23 budget invest s $713 million, an increase of $223 million above FY 2022 enacted, for CDC's opioid overdose prevention and surveillance . CDC will continue local investments and innovation to reach approximately 25 of the nation's largest cities/counties and 40 smaller communities heavily impacted by the overdose crisis, while continuing to support all 50 states, territories , and local jurisdictions to track and prevent overdose d eaths. Adverse Childhood Experiences Adverse Childhood Experiences are childhood traumas that include experiences such as exposure to violence, abuse, and neglect and household challenges like parental incarceration or mental illness. Other examples of adverse childhood experiences include bullying, experiencing racism, or the death of a parent. Historical and ongoing traumas due to systemic racism and structural inequities, such as discrimination, multigenerational poverty, as well as limited educational and economic opportunities, intersect with, and amplify the experience of, other adverse experiences , leading to disproportionate effects in certain populations. Preventing adverse childhood experiences can help create neighborhoods and communities where every child thrives. The FY 2023 budget includes $15 million, an increase of $ 8 million above FY 2022 enacted , to further support states to improve surveillance and research for the prevention of adverse childhood experiences . BIRTH DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) was established to improve the health and well -being of populations across the lifespan, including those that have been disproportionately impacted in the U nited States, and advance the science to support those that have been historically marginalized. CDC's birth def ects, developmental disabilities, blood disorders and disabilities , and health programs promote optimal health across the lifespan among populations that have been historically marginalized by advancing leadership, programs, research, tools, and surveillan ce into action. CDC identifies health inequities among individuals living with birth defects, disabilities, and infant disorders by 1) linking birth defects and other data , such as critical congenital heart defect newborn screening data to determine the method and timing of 48detection and disparities in timing o f diag nosis, 2 ) improving ac cess to timely s creenings and qualit y healthcare for children with de velopment al disabilities and hearing impairments, 3) e xpanding s urveillance and s trengthening r eportin g of dis ability s tatus and gender i dentity f or persons with b leeding disorders, and 4 ) preventing s econdary co nditions f or individuals with disabilities . CDC is work ing toward a d ay w hen every c hild i s born with the best h ealth p ossible .

REIGNITING THE CANCER M OONSHOT Cancer Moonshot Initiative is a bold effort to accelerate progress in cancer research and aims to make more therapies available to more patients. In the years since the Cancer Moonshot was launched, remarkable progress and scientific accomplishme nts have been made. To support the goals of the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, the FY 2023 budget includes additional funding within CDC. This funding will support dedicated increases across a range of CDC's cancer prevention- rela ted programs, including: National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early D etection Program, Colorectal Cancer Control Program, National Program of Cancer Registries, the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, the Bring Your Brave campaig n, the Inside Knowledge: About Gynecological Cancer campaign, Cancer Survivorship, prostate cancer, skin cancer, HPV vaccination, tobacco prevention, analysis of cancer clusters , and laboratory and envi ronmental health activities . 49 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The FY 202 3 budget includes $ 1.6 billion \u2014an increase of $274 million above FY 2022 enacted \u2014 for chronic disease prevention and health promotion programs to continue efforts to prevent and reduce chronic diseases, conditions, and associated risk factors; promote health; and eliminate health disparities. The budget prioritizes investments to support maternal health, to promote healthy school environments, and to strengthen investments in cancer prevention programs in support of the Administration's Cancer Moonshot Initiative goals. Improving Maternal Health The FY 2023 budget includes $164 million, an increase of $81 million above FY 2022 enacted , to make robust investments in maternal health. This includes additional funding for Maternal Mortality Review Committees to promote representative community engagement and Enhancing Reviews and Su rveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality to further expanding support for all states and territories and increas ing support for Tribes . Additional funding will also be directed to expand Perinatal Quality Collaboratives to every state and support commun ity engagement in maternal mortality prevention. This increase will also support the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Centers for Disease Control and Prevention System to test and implement alternate approaches to data collection to increase response rates, particularly among underrepresented communities. The FY 2023 budget includes an expansion of CDC's H ear Her campaign to raise awareness of critical warning signs during and after pregnancy and to improve communication between patients and their healthcare providers, as well as tools to help states develop coordinated regional systems to help ensure that those at high risk of complications receive care at a birth facility that is best prepare d to meet their health needs. EN VIRONMENTAL HEALTH Health is inextricably linked to the environment, and safe and healthy environments promote healthier people and communities. CDC helps protect Americans from environmental hazards, addressing environment al factors that could otherwise pose health risks, and working to ensure the safety of the air they breathe, the water they drink, the food they eat, the soil in which they grow their food, and the environment in which they live, work, and play. CDC is co mmitted to protecting the health and wellbeing of populations who are especially vulnerable to environmental health threats, including children, older adults , racial and ethnic minority groups, people with lower incomes, and people with disabilities. The FY 2023 budget includes $ 402 million, an increase of $1 74 million above FY 2022 enacted , to support CDC's environmental health activities. This increase will allow CDC to strengthen environmental programs and support CDC's efforts around Climate and Health and the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program . In addition, the budget will support the Administration's Cancer Moonshot Initiative , with a focus on enhanced study of cancer clusters and understanding of human health and exposure to hazardous substances and pathways by which exposures may cause or contribute to development of different cancers. Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program The budget increases funding for the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program by $49 million above FY 2022 enacted, for a total of $90 million. In FY 2023, CDC will continue to support childhood lead poisoning prevention activities in state and local jurisdictions. Increased funding will be used to : 1. Expand and enhance existing activities to all states and territories to ensure all jurisdictions have su fficient resources to implement a comprehensive childhood lead poisoningprevention program ; 2. Improve health equity by building capacity inadditional jurisdictions through a new community -based effort to further support communities with the highest need ; and 3. Expand CDC's capacity and data capabilities to enhance guidance, technical assistance, and other tools. The recipie nt state and local health departments will focus their efforts on four core program strategies: 1) testing and reporting ; 2) surveillance ; 3) linking lead- exposed children to services ; and 4) implementing tailored, community -based interventions . Climate and Health CDC's Climate and Health Program directly addresses the Administration's climate change priorities by supporting state, tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies to prepare for specific health impacts of a changing climate. Climate -related events , such as heat waves, floods, droughts, and extreme storms affect everyone, but not everyone is affected equally. Some communities and populations are disproportionately at risk. Additionally, factors such as age, location, race, pregnancy, and occupation all affect an individual's resilience to climate -related health risks . As the only U.S. government investment dedi cated to preparing our nation to anticipate and adapt to the health effects linked to climate change, CDC's Climate and Health Program is uniquely positioned to provide resources and assistance to some of the communities around the country most disproporti onately affected by the health impacts of climate change through its core program of data, science , and action. In FY 2023 , CDC will dedicate $110 million, an increase of $100 million above FY 2022 enacted, to continue the program in all states and territ ories, identify potential health effects associated with climate change , and implement health adaptation plans. Additionally, the total increase includes $10 million to support states to pilot the provi sion of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration systems in homes and communities most affected by exposure to wildfire smoke, and to better understand the feasibility and health impact of installing such systems. 50OCCUPATIONAL S AFETY AND H EALTH The N ational Institute f or Occupational Safety and Healt h (NIOSH) is t he o nly d e dicated federal inves tment fo r the research needed t o pr event work - re lat ed injuries and illne sses am ong t he nation's 161 million workers. To ac hieve this, CDC works coop eratively with e mployers and e mployee s to adapt res earch findings in to effective and f eas ible s olutions to pr event i llness a nd injury in t he w o rkplace. In 202 1, 137 Health Hazard E valuations w ere co nducted i n 38 sta tes to address work -rela ted h ealth co ncerns o f th ousands of workers and m anage rs.

As of Decemb er 31, 2021 , the program has e nro lled over 115,630 eligible responders a nd s urvivors and paid claims for treatment and medication for more t han 38, 439 enrollees. PUBL IC HEALTH P REPAREDNESS A ND R ESPONSE The CO VI D-19 p an demi c highlighted the c riti cal n eed for s us tained investment in domestic public h ealth prep aredness a nd response i nfrastructur e. O ver t he last two decades, there have been various infectious diseases and localized disease outbreaks - including H1N1, Ebola, Zika, SARS -CoV-1 (SARS), and SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19)\u2014 that spread rapidly and affected populations around the world. CDC's prep aredness efforts rely on its expertise in laboratory science, public health surveillance, epidemiology, and public health emergency management in addition to its longstanding relationships with federal, state, tribal, local, territorial, and global partner s. The FY 202 3 budget includes $842 million for domestic public health preparedness, which will allow CDC to continue to support state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments' capacity to address naturally occurring or intentional events that may cause public health emergencies. CDC will continue to fund all 50 states, four large metropolitan areas, and eight U.S. territories and freely associated states through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement. Funding in FY 2023 will also continue to support academic centers for public health preparedness , which enable the translation and dissemination of research to inform decision- making and the rapid implementation of interventions during public health crises. GLOBAL HEALTH In today's tightly connected world, diseases can be transported from any remote village to any major city on any continent in as little as 36 hours . CDC's global health mission is to improve and protect the health, safety, and security of Americans while reducing morbidity and mortality worldwide. CDC works globally to protect Americans from dangerous and costly public health threats, like COVID -19, vaccine - preventable diseases, HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. As the U.S. government lead for infectious disease emergency response, CDC supports global efforts to detect epidemic threats earlier, respond more effectively, and prevent avoidable catastrophes. CDC's trusted partnerships and extensive technical expertise in public health emergency ma nagement, disease tracking and reporting systems, workforce training, infection control, and laboratory systems targeting high- hazard pathogens, enable the agency to build local, national, and regional public health capabilities and strengthen global healt h security. The budget includes $ 748 million, an increase of $101 million above FY 2022 enacted, for CDC's global health activities that help protect Americans from major health threats . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 51Centers for Disease Control and Prevention G lobal Public Health Protection W ithin the overall increase for CDC's global health activities, t he FY 2023 budget includes $100 million above FY 2022 enacted , for a total of $ 353 million, for Global Public Health Protection. This increase will allow CDC to make strategic investments to establish additional regional public health platforms necessary to improve country -level and global healthcare systems. This approach allows CDC the flexibility to focus efforts where they are most needed, such as deploying staff and other resources to a country within a region to address outbreaks, providing technical assistance, and advancing key programmatic objectives. In addition, CDC will strengthen bilateral partnerships by implementing additional global health security activities where CDC has presence ; initiate and enhance National Public Health Institutes ; and support Field Epidemiology Training Programs in new countries . BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES C DC's building repair and improvement needs are nationwide \u2014covering CDC -owned facilities in seven states and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FY 2023 budget includes $55 million to fund renovations to existing buildings as well as repair and improvements (e.g., laboratory ventilation upgrades, structural repairs, roof replacements, and electrical and mechanical repairs) necessary to restore, maintain, and improve CDC's physical assets. This investment will allow CDC to make progress toward reducing the backlog of maintenance and repairs , which is currently $174.7 million. This investment is critical to keeping CDC facilities fully functional and prepared to identify, respond to, and eliminate the next disease threat to our nation. A GENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AN D DISEASE REGISTRY The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR ) is the only federal health agency that works directly with concerned citizens to address environmental hazards and responds to requests for assistance from communities across the nation. Its work is centered on protecting communities from harmful health effects related to exposure to natural and man- made hazardous substances. ATSDR achieves this work by responding to environmental health emergencies ; invest igating emerging environmental health threats ; conducting research on the health impacts of hazardous waste sites; and building capabilities of , and providing actionable guidance to , state and local health partners. In addition to protecting human health, ATSDR's efforts mitigate the economic burdens commonly associated with environmental contamination, including the cost of treatment, lost productivity, and decreased lifetime earnings for those affected, and even reduced property value and business liability. In FY 2021 , ATSDR connected more than 1,000 patients with more than 60 clinical trials and epidemiological studies related to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and funded 19 research grants. T he FY 2023 budget includes $ 85 million for ATSDR to protect communities from harmful environmental exposures and build on current capacity to respond, provide assistance, and prevent harmful effects. ATSDR will expand its partnership with communities to address their concerns by monitoring and investigating hazardous exposures and developing science -based tools and resources to build environmental health capacity. With these additional resources, ATSDR can also continue to educate the public and train healthcare providers on the health concerns associated with exposures to harmful substances. 52National Institutes of Health National Institutes of Health The following tables are in millions of dollars.

Founded in 1887, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) today is one of the world's foremost med ical research centers, and th e federal focal point for medical research in the United States. The NIH mission is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. NIH works toward that mission by: conducting research in its own labor atories; supporting the research of no n-federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of medical and health sciences information. The FY 2023 President's Budget provides $ 63 billion in discretionary and mandatory resources for NIH, an increase of $ 16 billion above FY 202 2 enacted . Within this total , $5 billion is proposed for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA- H), which will revolutionize healthcare and medicine through accelerated biomedical innovation and adoption of technologies. The NIH budget continues vital work to address the opioid crisis and end HIV . The budge t also makes new investments in pandemic preparedness and nutrition research , establishes a Center for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Research, and also supports NIH's work as part of the Cancer Moonshot. More than 80 percent of NIH's funding is awarded for extramural research, largely through almost 50,000 competitive grants to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities and other research institutions in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and several tribes . About 10 percent of 8 Reflects mandatory sequester of 5.7 percent in FY 2022 and FY 2023. 9 Excludes 4 FTEs funded by the Public Health Service trust funds in all years. NIH's budget supports approximately 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows conducting basic, translational, and clinical research in the Intramural Research Program. To date, 195 NIH - supported researchers, including 33 intramural investigators, have been awarded the Nobel Prize. ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR HEALTH The FY 2023 budget provides $5 billion, an increase of $4 billion above FY 2022 enacted, for ARPA -H, a new entity that will benefit the health of all Americans by catalyzing health breakthroughs that cannot readily be accomplished through traditional research or commercial activity. With an initial focus on cancer and other diseases such as diabetes and dementia, this major investment w ill drive transformational innovation in health and speed the application and implementation of health breakthroughs. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) , ARPA -H will recruit visionary term -limited program ma nagers who can identify and fund traditional and non -traditional partners to take on critical challenges that are unlikely to move forward quickly without this catalytic assistance. ARPA -H will leverage novel public -private partnerships, use directive approaches that will provide quick funding decisions to support projects that are results- driven and time -limited, and identify emergent opportunities through advanced systematic horizon scans of academic and industry efforts. National Institutes of Health ARPA -H will be tasked with building high -risk, high - reward capabilities to drive biomedical innovations \u2014 ranging from molecular to societal \u2014that would provide transformative solutions for all patients. Potential areas of transformative research driven by ARPA -H include development and im plementation of accurate, wearable, ambulatory blood pressure technology, preparation of mRNA vaccines against common forms of cancer, and accelerating development of efficient gene/drug delivery systems to target any organ, tissue, or cell type \u2014a zip code for the human body. PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS The FY 2023 budget makes transformative investments in pandemic preparedness and biodefense across HHS public health agencie s to enable an agile, coordinated, and comprehensive public health response to future threats, and to protect American lives, families, and the economy. The mandatory funding will support preparedness activities across HHS . Within the HHS-wide total of $81.7 billion, $12.1 billion is included for NIH research and development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics against high priority viral families, biosafety and biosecurity, and to expand laboratory capacity and clinical trial infrastructure. For exa mple, NIH will conduct preclinical and clinical research on vaccines and vaccine platforms, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and novel adjuvants to provide protection against prototype or representative pathogens selected from a preliminary group of ~20 viral families of concern. It will support development and clinical trials of additional therapeutic candidates, including host -tissue -directed therapies. It will invest in biomedical research infrastructure to address future pandemics, including BSL -3/-4 labo ratories, and expand its capacity to manufacture pilot lots of prototype medical countermeasures in compliance with FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. It will expand and sustain its network of domestic and international outpatient and inpatient clinical trial sites that have been so critical to addressing the COVID -19 pandemic. Finally, NIH will develop next -generation diagnostics to fill critical gaps, such as the need for affordable at -home tests that are equally reliable to lab-based PCR tests, as well as 102020- 2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research innovative clinical and environmental surveillance technologies. RESEARCH PRIORITIES IN F Y 2023 Reigniting the Cancer Moonshot Cancer Moonshot is a bold effort to accelerate progress in cancer research and aims to make more t herapies available to more patients. In the years since the Cancer Moonshot was launched, remarkable progress and scientific accomplishments have been made. As part of the Administration's priority, NIH will work with other agencies to organize the colle ctive efforts of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer centers and other networks to identify barriers to broader cancer screening and investigate the most effective means of delivering screening. This will help offset the millions of delayed cancer screenings due to the pandemic, with a focus on reaching those individuals most at risk. Also in partnership with other federal agencies, NIH will dedicate FY 2023 funding to develop a focused program to expeditiously study and evaluate multicancer early detection tests, which could help detect cancers at an earlier stage when there may be more effective treatment options . Opportunities or obstacles identified by the Cancer Moonshot may become candidates for the new approach to transform ational change offered by ARPA -H. Transfo rming Nutrition Science To reflect the priority NIH places on innovative, multidisciplinary nutrition research, in FY 2021, the Office of Nutrition Research was moved from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to the NIH Office of the Director . By centrally coordinating the implementation of the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research 10, the Office of Nutrition Research can support large, time -limited, goal- drive n projects of cro ss-cutting NIH interest developed in 55National Institu tes of Health collaboration with Institutes and Center s that already fund nutrition research . The FY 2023 budget includes $97 million for the Office of Nutrition Research, an increase of $96 million above FY 2022 enacted to advance nutrition science to promote health and reduce the burden of diet -related diseases. One new collaborative project is the Reducing Nutrition Health Disparities through Food Insecurity and Neighborhood Food Environment Research. This research will use precision regional implementation science and pragmatic research approaches to test strategies ensuring food security and access to healthy food to prevent disparities in a variety of diet -related diseases and conditions, such as car diovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Elucidating the role of these social conditions on diet and nutritional status could help address and prevent diet -related health disparities and promote health equity. Nutrition science research will also complement the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Chronic Disease initiative, given that most chronic diseases are diet -related. The complexity of human nutrition demands that cutting- edge data science and system science methods be employed to move this field forward. Funds will support new training programs in Artificial Intelligence for Precision Nutrition that will focus on integration of related domains , including machine learning, systems biology, systems science, Big Data, and computational analytics. The goal is to build a future workforce that will be able to use growing data resources to tackle complex biomedical challenges in nutrition science that are beyond human intuition. Combatti ng Overdose and Addiction The crisis of opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose in the United States is a rapidly evolving and urgent public health emergency. In 2020, there were over 90,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. More than 2 million Americans have opioid use dis order, and 10 million Americans misuse opioids. Additionally, more than 25 million Americans experience daily pain, putting them at increased risks for opioid misuse. The COVID -19 pandemic has collided with the opioid crisis in profound ways. Since the declaration of a public health emergency for COVID -19, overdoses increased six percent in May 2020 compared to May 2019. The COVID -19 pandemic caused significant disruption to pain management and substance use disorder t reatment a nd recovery s ervices. Th ese n umbers f ail to capture the full ex tent o f the damage of t he opioid crisis, w hich reaches ac ross every domain of f amily and community l ife\u2014from lo st productivity and economic opportunity , to i ntergenerational a nd ch ildhood trauma, to e xtreme s train o n community r esources, including first responders, e mergency r ooms, h ospitals, and treatment centers. The budget dedicates $2.6 billion within NIH for opioids, stimulant, and pain research. Within this total, $1.8 billion will support ongoing research across the Institutes a nd Centers w hile $811 million is allocate d to the Helping to E nd A ddiction L ong-term (H EAL) Initiative . 56National Institutes of Health NIH launched the HEAL Initiative in 2018 to provide scientific s olutions to the opioid crisis and offer new hope for individuals, families, and communities affected by this devastating crisis. This cross- cutting NIH effort spans basic, translational, clinical, and implementation science on opioid misuse, addiction, and pain. By the end of FY 2021, HEAL funded $2 billion in research, representing more than 500 research projects across the United States. These projects aim to identify new therapeutic targets for both pain and opioid use disorder, reduce the risk of opioids through nonpharmacological strategies for pain management, and improve opioid addiction treatment in a variety of settings. Health Disparities and Inequities Research While the diversity of the American population is one of the nation's greatest assets, one of its greatest challenges is reducing the profound disparity in the health status of its racial and ethnic minority, rural, low-income, and other underserved popula tions. NIH will continue to aim towards expanding its investment in research on health disparities, fostering collaborations and partnerships to promote and support evidence -based science to address long- standing inequities. The FY 2023 budget provides a n increase of $ 350 million above FY 2022 enacted to enhance health disparities and inequities research, including $2 10 million for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. NIH also will continue to support the UNITE Initiative that was launched in early 2021, which is an NIH -wide effort committed to ending racial inequities across the biomedical research enterprise. This Initiative builds upon and complements the advances in health disparities research at NIH. Developing a Univer sal Influenza Vaccine NIH-supported research advances our understanding of how influenza strains emerge, evolve, infect, and cause illness. This research informs the design of new and improved therapies, diagnostics, and vaccines, including a universal influenza vaccine. Circulating and emerging influenza viruses present a public health threat and place substantial health and economic burdens in the United States and around the world. Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective way to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality. However, traditional vaccine development relies heavily on predicting which strains will be in circulation each year. This approach is suboptimal for dealing with constantly evolving and newly emerging virus strains. The Bu dget includes $260 million for the development of a universal influenza vaccine, an increase of $ 15 million above FY 2022 enacted . The Budget supports continued investments toward developing a universal influenza vaccine, which would provide durable and broad protection to millions of people from infection and significantly mitigate the public health threat posed by seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza strains. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States The FY 2023 budget continues inve stments across HHS to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030 . This bold initiative leverages critical scientific advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outbreak response by coordinating the highly successful programs, resources, and infrastructure of many HHS agencies and offices. NIH has made critical investments into HIV research in the decades since the AIDS pandemic emerged . These investments have been integral to the significant decline in HIV diagnoses and extending the lif espan of those living with HIV . Despite such progress, new infections continue to occur in every state . As part of the initiative to end HIV, the FY 2023 budget includes $26 million for NIH -sponsored Centers for AIDS Research to continue innovative and e vidence - based implementation research on new strategies for the successful delivery of integrated HIV prevention and treatment. NIH -funded research will build upon identified and evaluated strategies to diagnose new cases of HIV, help connect people living with HIV or at risk of HIV acquisition with medical care and HIV prevention services, and ensure they continue to receive care to treat or prevent HIV. Improving Maternal Health The CDC estimates 700 women die each year in the United States of pregnancy -related deaths, 60 percent of which are preventable, and over 50,000 experience severe pregnancy- related complications . Understanding and reducing pregnancy -related deaths and complications \u2014or maternal mortality and morbidity \u2014is a high priority for N IH. More studies are needed to better understand the causes of these severe complications and deaths, the circumstances that contribute to them, and how to prevent them. 57National Institu tes of Health The Implementing a Maternal health and PRegnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) Initiative supports research to reduce preventable maternal deaths and improve health for all women before, during, and after delivery. The FY 2023 budget includes $30 million for IMPROVE to invest in comprehensive, interdisciplinary research that engages communities with high rates of maternal deaths and complications to address the foremost causes of maternal mortality in the United States , which include cardiovascular disease, infection, embolism, and immunity \u2014as well as significant pregnancy -associated and pregnancy - related health complications, such as diabetes, obesity, mental health disorders, and substance use disorders. An additional $3 million is provided within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to support research on mitigating the effects of COVID -19 on pregnant, lactating, and post -partum individuals, with a focus on individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Innovating Mental Health Research The FY 2023 budget provides an incre ase of $10 million to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to support studies of the social media impact on mental health ($5 million) and to support studies to inform mental health treatment approaches, service delivery, and system transformatio n ($5 million). Multiple NIH Institutes are examining the impact of social media on human development, including neurodevelopment and health behaviors. NIMH will build on these efforts in FY 2023, including by supporting research that leverages social media to inform targets and timing for interventions and to facilitate clinical decision- making. In keeping with its mission of transforming the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, NIMH will continue to prioritize research on improving the qu ality and outcomes of care, organization- and system -level interventions to enhance service delivery, and strategies for widespread dissemination and implementation of evidence -based treatments into routine care settings. Establishing a Center for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Research Advancing sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection for research and administrative activities at the Department is a priority and an integral part of the mission to promote the health and well - being of all Americans. The FY 2023 budget provides $2 million to establish a center for ongoing SOGI research. The purpose will be to analyze and build upon the consensus study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) on Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation, published in March 2022. The NASEM study report made recommendations for standardized federal data collection efforts based on evaluating current measures of sex, gender identity, and sexu al orientation. However, more research needs to be done, and the NASEM study serves as a starting point. To build on this work, the goal of establishing this center will be to continue research in SOGI data collection and establish best practices that can be distributed across government agencies. RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE Buildings and Facilities The dynamic nature of biomedical and clinical research requires state -of-the-art facilities and infrastructure . A critical aspect of supporting the discovery of novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and cures to disease requires facilities that can house state -of-the-art imaging equipment, discover tumors at the earliest stage possible, safely develop novel treatments such as cellular therapy, and more. Facilities must co-evolve with science for NIH to achieve its full potential. As part of a long- term effort to stem the growth of NIH's backlog of maintenance and repair, the budget provides $300 million for intramural Buildings and Facilities, an increas e of $ 50 million above FY 2022 enacted, and expands the authority for Institutes and Centers to contribute toward facilities projects. NIH will execute various modernization and repair projects at NIH's research hospital, replace research animal facilitie s with a centralized and more efficient facility, improve facilities that advance computational and data science, replace temporary and obsolete administrative support facilities with permanent buildings, improve the energy and water efficiency of buildings, and support the co -evolution of science and buildings. 58National Institutes of Health Overview by Mechani sm The following tables are in millions of dollars except as indicated. 11 Reflects the FY 2021 Final Level including funding authorized by 21st Century Cures Act and directed and permissive transfers. 12 Reflects the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level including the $5 million directed transfer to the HHS Office of Inspector General. 13 Reflects $5 million directed transfer to the HHS Office of Inspector General. 14 Number of grants and dollars for the Common Fund and Office of Research Infrastructure Programs components of the Office of t he Director (OD) are distributed by mechanism and the dollars ar e noted here as a non -add.

Behavioral health is essential to overall health\u2014 but Americans continue to face signific ant challenges with mental health and substance use . An es t imated 59.3 million Americans aged 12 or older had a substance use disorder in 2020 and a pproximately 104,000 people died from a drug -related overdose in the 12 -month period that ended in September 2021 . The Substance use And Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is poised to make historic investments that expand access to care across the spectrum of behavioral health services. The budget 's proposals will ensure SAMHSA can continue to directly enhance the behavioral health of the nation . Even before the pandemic, demand for mental health and substance use services was increasing, especially for our nation's young people. The F Y 20 23 President's Budget provides $ 10.7 billion for SAMHSA , an increase of $4.2 billion above FY 2022 enacted. The proposals in the FY 2023 President's Budget direct an historic investment in strengthening and supporting the Behavior Health Crisis Services; invest in supporting the health of our n ation's children through increasing access to children's mental services ; and expand access to community mental health services to protect the health of children and communities. The budget's investment s in SAMHSA are a critical component of the Administration's commitment t o eliminat e barriers to care and expand the full continuum of prevention, treatment, and recovery services . 62 3 The FY 2023 Budget proposes to change the name of the Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration to remove \"abuse\" from the agency name . Individuals do not choose to \"abuse\" drugs and alcohol ; they suffer from a disease known as addiction. The Administration is committed to moving past outdated and stigmatizing language that is harmful to the individuals and families that suffer because of addiction. HISTOR IC EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Addressing mental health has become even more paramount during the COVID -19 pandemic, which has not only negatively impacted many individuals' mental health but has also created barriers to treatment. In 2020, an estimated 52.9 million adults had a diagno sable mental illness, but only 46 percent of these adults received mental health services in the past year. Recent studies and research indicate an increased risk of COVID -19 mortality among individuals with mental illness. The COVID -19 pandemic is also associated with high levels of psychological distress among the general population, particularly among people with serious mental illness. Expanding access to mental health services is critical to saving lives and ensuring the mental health and well -being of Americans of all ages. The F Y 2023 budget provides $ 4.6 billion f or SAMHSA's m ental health activities, an inc rease o f $2.5 billion over FY 2022 e nacte d. These investments w il l provide a n hi storic investment i n the Behavior H ealth Crisis Ser vices ; expand access t o cr isis s ervices ; e nsure a ccess to ea rly intervention a n d prevention s ervices t o the na tion's vulnerable p opulations ; and i nvest i n ch ildren's mental health. In addition, HHS w ill create a new $ 7.5 billion mental health system t ransformation fund t o increase access to m ental health s ervices through workforce development a nd service e xpansion . This new program supports the President's call for transforming h ow we deliver mental health services . This f und will include the development o f non -traditional health delivery sites, the integration of quali ty mental health and substance use care into primary care settings, and dissemination of evidence -based practices. 9-8-8 and Behavioral Health Crisis Services Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, with 45,979 deaths in 2020 , or about one death every 11 minutes . Suicide is a significant concern for youth \u2014 in 2020 , suicide was the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 -14 and 25 -34. Suicide rates are disproportionately high among Black youth, and LGBTQI+ persons are at disproportionate risk of deathby suicide as well as suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts. The Administration is com mitted to providing historic investments in suicide prevention and 9 -8-8 and Behavioral Health Crisis Services in FY 2023 . The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will transition from a 10 -digit number to 9 -8-8 in July 2022. The launching of this \"9 -8-8\" mental health crisis service hotline will create a national network of local crisis centers fortified by national back -up centers to answer calls and texts. This transition will result in significantly increased 9 -8-8 contacts directed toward local cris is call centers. SAMHSA estimates that the 9 -8-8 call centers will respond to approximately 7.6 million individuals in 2023 \u2014compared to approximately 2 million answered contacts in 2020. To ensure 100 percent of contacts are answered in FY 2023, SAMHSA w ill dedicate $697 million to the 9 -8-8 and Behavioral Health Services program, an increase of $590 million over FY 2022 enacted. This historic investment in 9 -8-8 and Behavioral Health Services will enhance access to crisis care services for people with suicidal ideations or experiencing behavioral health cris es through the use of an easily remembered 3 -digit number; reduce reliance on the police by linking the behavioral health crisis care centers w ith mobile crisis teams; reduce deadly gaps in the existing Lifeline services by enabling the behavioral health crisis care centers to stay in contact and follow up with those in crisis; relieve emergency room over - crowding/boarding by providing needed evaluation and crisis intervention in the community whenever possible; and better meet the behavioral healthcare needs of all people experiencing crises in a way that reduces stigma and encourages people at risk and their family members to seek help in the fu ture. The creation of 9 -8-8 is a once -in-a-lifetime opportunity to strengthen and expand the Lifeline and transform America's behavioral health crisis care system to one Substance use An d Mental Health Services Administration 63Substance use And Mental Health Services Administration that saves lives by serving anyone, at any time, from anywhere across the nation. Bolster Children's Mental Health Services In 2021, a national emergency for children's mental health was declared by several pediatric health organizations, and the U.S. Surgeon General released an advisory on mental health among youths. The COVID -19 pande mic has made the situation only more challenging, subjecting many young Americans to social isolation, loss of routines, and traumatic grief. Public health data now show alarming rates of behavioral health needs among school -age youth, with significant increases in the number experiencing moderate to severe anxiety and depression. In 2020, 4.1 million youth aged 12 -17 had a major depressive episode, but only 42 percent of those youth received treatment for depression within the past year. To address this alarming public health crisis, the FY 2023 budget includes $244 million for Project AWARE, an increase of $ 123 million above FY 2022 enacted. This investment will support comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated state efforts to make school s safer and increase access to mental health services. This funding will directly support training for teachers, parents, first responders, and other adults who interact with youth to recognize and respond to the signs of mental health and substance use i ssues. Additionally, this significant investment in Project AWARE will expand access to these funds to broader populations, including college students and adults. The budget also provides $64 million for the Mental Health Awareness Training program, an increase of $ 39 million above FY 2022 enacted . This investment will support increased training to school person nel, emergency first responders, law enforcement, veterans, armed service members, and their families to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental disorders. More than half of parents express concern over their children's mental well- being . The budget includes several critical investments in programs addressing the mental health needs of children. The budget provides $150 million to the National Child Traumatic Stress network, an increase of $68 million above FY 2022 enacted, to provide trauma -informed services for children and adolescents as well as training for the child-serving workforce. The budget also includes $38 million for the Infant an d Early Childhood Mental Health grant program , an increase of $28 million above FY 2022 enacted to expand access to evidence -based and culturally appropriate infant and early childhood mental health services . Additionally, the budget includes $35 million for Project LAUNCH, an increase of $12 million above FY 2022 enacted, to provide behavioral health screening, prevention, early intervention, and referrals to high quality treatment for young children. A si gnificant share of youth experience serious ment al health concerns each year. In 2020, an estimated 4.1 million children aged 12 -17 (17 percent) experienced a major depressive episode. The budget provides $ 225 million for Children's Mental Health Services , an increase of $100 million over FY 2022 enacted . This investment will direct funding into the development, implementation, expansion, and sustainability of comprehensive, community -based services for children and youth with severe emotional disturbance . This approach has demonstrated improved outcomes for children at home, at school, and in their communities \u2014including a significant decrease in suicide attempt rates within 12 months after children and youth services. Broaden Mental Health Services Serious mental illnesses are common in the United States. Among adults aged 18 or older in 2020, 645.6 percent ( or 14.2 millio n people) h ad a serious mental illness in the pas t year. Since 1 992, t he Mental Health Block Grant has directed f unding directly t o the nation's behavioral health infrastructure. The blo ck grant p rovides f unding f or community -based behavioral health services t o 59 eligible s tates and territories and freely as sociated states. These f unds provide c ritical s upport for so me o f the m ost a t-risk populations across the c ountry. T he block g rant's flexibility and stability hav e made it v ital in support of public mental health s ystems. This f unding h as improved o utcomes for m illions of A mericans. In 2 021, the blo ck grant served 8 .0 million clients. Eighty percent of c lients r epor ted i mproved f unctioning a s a direct r esult o f the mental healthcare services t hey received. The b udget i nvests $ 1.7 b illion i nto t he Community M ental Health Block G rant, an increase of $ 795 million ab ove FY 2022 enacted , to ensure o ur nation's mental healthcare system can s erve o ur m o st vulnerable p opulations . The b udget a lso p roposes to d edicate 1 0 percent o f t hese funds to s upport early intervention a nd p revention f or at-risk youth a nd a dults. This i nvestment w ill expand f unding t o support e arlier identification and prevention of m en tal health di sorders a nd further s upport targeted s ervices f o r yo uth a nd p revent m o re s erious s ymptoms f urther o n in a person's life. Sin ce FY 2021, s tates h ave b e en required to u se f ive percent o f the funds f rom t h e Me ntal Health Block Gr ant for e vidence -bas ed crisis c are pr ograms. The FY 2023 budget proposes to i nc rease t he share of f unds st ates must use f or cr isis services from five percent t o 10 percent. A fu lly developed c risis response sy stem must b e re sponsive to a nyone, anywhere, at any ti me . This incr ease d set -aside will invest in effective co m munity - based crisis -intervention a nd response sy stems. The devel opment o f fully accessible and r esponsive c r isis services involves complex p roblem so lving with many st akeholders. This e xpansion of c risis s e rvices will play a cr itical role in t andem with t he e x pansion of the S uicide Lifeline. E ffective implementation o f t he 9 -8-8 pr ogram w ill be the catalyst f o r further crisis s ervice development and t ransformation. In 2020, 1 4.2 m i llion people aged 18 and older (six percent o f the p opulation) h ad a s erious mental il lness i n th e p ast year. The budget p rovides investments in services to ensure people experiencing serious mental illness receive the services they need. The budget provides $10 5 million for the Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration program, an increase of $50 million above FY 2022 enacted, to coordinate primary care services and community behavioral health services for individuals with serious mental illness or co- occurring mental illness and substance use disor der. The budget also provides $36 million, an increase of $5 million above FY 2022 enacted, for the Homelessness Prevention progr ams, and $70 million, an increase of $5 million above 2022 enacted, for Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness. This funding will expand access to treatment and connect homeless individuals experiencing Serious Mental Illness with safe, secure housing . Expand A ccess to Community -Based Mental Health Services The budget includes two keystone investments in community -based mental health services. The budget provides $553 million for the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics Expansi on Grant program, an increase of $ 238 million over FY 2022 enacted . Since the inception of the program in FY 2018, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics have served over 276,000 individuals . This investment will drive funding Substance use An d Mental Health Services Administration 65Substance use And Mental Health Services Administration to certified clinics serving children and adults and ensure patients receive c oordinated, high -quality state - certified behavioral health services for comprehensive behavioral health services . The budget also includes a new mandatory program, directing $413 million to Community Mental Health Centers. The budget directs $4.1 billion to this program over 10 years. This historic investment would build off the $825 million in funding directed to Community Mental Health Cente rs in the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations. This proposal would expand access to local mental health services across the country and ensure that these critical centers have sustainable funding year after year. INVESTING IN OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND ENDING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC The budget provides $ 5.9 billion for substance use prevention and treatment activities, an increase of $1.7 billion over FY 2022 enacted. The budget continues to infuse funding to s tates and tribes to respond to the ongoing opioid and substance use crisis , ensure access to naloxone and overdose prevention services , and invest in prevention and recovery support services. HHS requests $ 11.0 billion across the Department to support activities that will help end the opioid and substance use crisis. Of that amount, $ 5.5 billion is specifically for SAMHSA 's substance use prevention and treatment progr ams and $ 861 million for mental health activities , an increase of $2.1 billion over FY 2022 enacted. Ensuring Access to Substance Use Treatment The budget includes $3. 0 billion for the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant \u2014 an increase of $1.1 billion over FY 2022 enacted. This funding will improve the health and lives of individuals with substance use disorders \u2014serving 2.3 million people in FY 2022 . The block grant distributes funds to 60 eligible states, territories , and one eligible tribe. This investment in the block g rant will support state prevention, treatment , and recovery systems' infrastructure and capacity. It is imperative that HHS' s addiction crisis response evolve from an acute short - term individual -focused treatment response to a broader community recovery r esponse . The block grant funding includes the 10 percent recovery set - aside to significantly expand the continuum of care both upstream and downstream. Provisional data indicate that estimated overdose deaths from opioids were increasing as of September 2021. The budget's investments in these critical SAMHSA programs will ensure states and tribes have the necessary funding to direct interventions where they are needed most in their communities . 66The b udget a lso p rovide s $2. 0 billion f or the State Opioid R esponse gr ant p rogram , an increase o f $475 million over FY 2022 enacted. Within this t otal, SAMHSA w ill direct $ 75 mi llion to t he T ribal Opioid Response gr ant p rogram to specifically a ddress the opioid s ubstance u se needs i n tribal co mmunities. Since t he State O pioid R esponse program b egan, approximately 971,372 patients h ave r eceived treatment se rvice s for o pioid u se disorder, i ncluding 409,086 who have r eceived m edication- assisted treatment . The o verdose e pidemic has co ntinued amidst t he g lobal pandemic. According to th e Centers for D isease C ontrol a nd Prevent ion's provisional data estimates , more t han 1 04,000 drug overdose d eaths occurred in t he United S tates i n the 1 2 months e nding in Se ptember 2021. The b udget's investments in the State O pioid R esponse p rogram are c ritical to e nsuring access to treatment se rvices and p reventing o verdose - related d eaths . Access to treatment se r vices f or su bstance u se disorder is a critical component of o ve rdose epidemic response . The b udget p rovides $105 million for the drug court pr ogram , an increase o f $35 million over F Y 2022 en acted, to se rve 6,489 clients. Drug c ourts play an inte gral role in providin g direct t reatment services to di verse p opulations. This p rogram i s dedicated to ex panding acce ss to t hese i mportant se r vices and ad dressing behavioral health disparities among r aci al and e thnic minorities. Incr easing access t o medication- assisted t r eatment is imperative a s overdose d eaths associated with opioids co ntinue t o rise . The b udget invests $1 37 millio n in SAM HSA's Medication A ssisted T reatment for Prescription a nd D rug A ddiction p rogram, an increase o f $36 million over F Y 2022 enacted.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the lead Federal agency charged with improv ing the safety and quality of healthcare for all Americans. AHRQ d e velops the knowledge, tools, and data needed to improve the healthcare system and help consumers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers make informed health decisions. AHRQ' s overarching goal is to improve the lives of patients. 1The F Y 2022 column reflect s enacted levels, including required transfers. 2AHRQ r eceives mandatory funds transferred from the Patient-C entered O utcomes Research Trust Fund to implement section 937 of the Public Health Services Act. 3Excludes mandatory PCORTF FTEs and reimbursable FTEs. The agency aims to help healthcare systems and professionals deliver care that is high quality, safe, equita ble and high value. AHR Q accomplishes its mission by focusing on three core competencies: Health Services and Systems Research: Investing in research that generates evidence about how to deliver high -quality, safe, equitable, high -value healthcare.Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 72 72 72 -- Subtotal, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 72 72 72 -- Program Support 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Program Support 71 73 75 +2 Subtotal, Program Support 72 73 75 +2 Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund2 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) 96 105 111 +6 Subtotal, Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund 96 105 111 +6 AHRQ Budget Totals 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Total, Budget Authority 338 350 376 +26 Total, PHS Evaluation Funds -- -- 40 +40 Total, PCORTF 96 105 111 +6 Total, Program Level 434 455 527 +71 Full-Time Equivalents3 262 262 269 +7 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 68 Practice Improvement: Creating strategies and tools to help health systems and frontline clinicians deliver high- quality, equitable, safe, high value healthcare . Data and Analytics: Disseminating data and analys es that help healthcare decision makers understand how the US healthcare system is working and w here there are opportunities for improvement. The FY 2023 b udget invests in A HRQ's core m ission areas of conducting h ealth services r esearch, i mproving patient s afety, dig ital healthcare, and s ustaining k ey data resources o n access, care d elivery, and affordability for all. The F iscal Year (FY) 2023 budget request s $527 million for AHRQ. This includes $ 376 million i n budget authority, $40 millio n in PHS E valuation Set A side funding , and $ 111 million in m andatory transfers f rom the Patient Centered O utcomes R esearch T rust Fund. The b udget s upports new Lo ng C OVID research and diagnostic safety research, the development o f an all- payer claims dat abase, and activities t o evaluate t he effects of telehealth on he althcare de livery and health outcomes. HEALTH S ERVICES, R ESEARCH, DATA, AND DISSEMINATION The principal goals of health service s and s ystems research a re to ide ntify the most effective ways to organize, manage, finance, and deliver healthcar e that is high quality, s afe, equitable, and hig h value. This portfolio first conducts research to find answers f or the most p ressing questions faced by clinicians, health system leaders, policy makers an d others about how t o best provide t he care patients need. This research is done both through investigator -initiated and directed research grants programs as we ll as through r esearch contracts. The next step in the Health Services Research continuum is to translate r esearch findings into tools and resources a nd partner with delivery systems to e nsure i nnovations a re implemented i n practice . Lastly, A HRQ creates and disseminates data and analyses of key trends in the quality, safety, e quity, and cost of healthcare to help users understand and respond to what is driving the delivery of care today. The FY 2023 budget p rovides $133 million, an increase of $35 million above F Y 2022 enacted , for the health services research, data, and dissemination portfolio. This increase will support targeted research investments t hat will address today's most pressing healthcare challenges , such as COVID -19, the opioid epidemic, primary care, and health equity. Funding will also support an all- payers claims database. Inve stigator -Initiated Grants and Contracts A HRQ is addressing critical healthcare issue s through investigator -initiated research and training grants support , which can generate discoveries and address today's critical issues. AHRQ -fund ed research generates new research findings and develops knowledge into practice. The budget provides $62 million for investigator -initiated research to support new general research grants and grants to ensu re diversity within the health services research community. New investigator -initiated research and training grants are essential to health services research -they ensure that both new ideas and new investigators are supported each year. Investigator - initiated research grants allow extramural researchersto pursue the various research avenues that lead tosuccessful yet unexpected discoveries. In this light, the investigator -initiated grant funding is seen as one of the most vital forces driving health services research in this country. P rimary Care Research P rimar y care research is critical to AHRQ's mission to make healthcare safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable. AHRQ is the only P ublic Health Service agency that supports clinical, primary care research which includes translating science into patient care and better organizing healthcare to meet patient and population needs. The budget proposes an investment of $10 million for primary care research. O pioid Initiative Deaths from drug overdoses have risen steadily over the past two decades and have become a leading cause of injury death in the United States. T he rise in drug overdose deaths was initially driven by misuse of prescription opioids but is n ow also fueled by rising use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, stimulants, and polydrug use. The FY 2023 budget propose s $10 m illion to support opioid and polysubstance research grants to increase equity in treatment access and outcomes, accelera te the implementation of effective evidence- based care in primary and ambulatory care, and develop whole person models of care that address the co -existing conditions and social Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 69factors which shape treatment adherence and long- term recovery. All-P ayer Claims Database The FY 2023 provides $5 million to develop the infrastructure to regularly create and disseminate an All-P ayers C laims Database. AHRQ will partner with states and other data holders to create a framework for a se cure claims database that will enhance v alue to individual participating s tates and provide analytics to federal policy makers to inform decision making, address equity i ssues, and i mprove healthcare quality. As part of this effort, AHRQ will seek input from other federal agencies, including ASPE, HRSA, OMB, and SAMHSA, to e nsure that the databases produced will have wide applications and uses to meet a variety of federal needs. Additionally, the budget allows AHRQ to continue expansion and innovation of major data platforms, including the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, making t hem more comprehensive, timely, and relevant. ENHANCING PATIENT SAFTEY At the core of AHRQ's efforts to improve healthcare delivery is a focus on patient safety. AHRQ conducts critical research to advance the field of patient safety and develops tools and resources to ensure health systems and professi onals can put this evidence into real-w orld practice. AHRQ collects data to monitor the nation's p rogress in preventing harm i n healthcare settings. In FY 2023, the program will conti nue its focus on Heal thcare-A ssociated Infections, i ts support of P atient Safety Organizations, and its efforts to prevent and mitigate patient safety risks and harms. The FY 2023 bu dget provides $79 million for patient safety research to reduce patient safety risks and harms, support patient safety organizations, and address healthcare-a ssoci ated infections. To achieve this work, A HRQ supports the Comprehensive Unit- based Safety Program projects aimed at improving antibiotic stewardshi p and maintains the Network of Patient Safety Databases to advance the nation's understanding of the prevalence, causes, and potential solutions to improve patient safety. Diagnostic Errors Approximatel y 1 2 million Americans suffer a diagnostic error each y ear, and more than four million people experience s evere consequences because of these errors or from diagnostic delays. The cost of diagnostic errors to the U.S. healthcare system may be well over $100 billion annually. To discover and test solutions to avoid diagnostic error, AHRQ will invest $10 million in Diagnostic Safety Centers of Excellence and disseminating evidence -based tools for improving diagnostic safety. The research Centers will bring together multi -disciplinary teams to develop, implement, test, and refine practical solut ions for reducing diagnostic errors using human factors principles, system engineering, and digital health applications. AHRQ intends to fund five center s with each center focusing on specific conditions, populations, or settings of diagnostic safety. At least one Center will focus on each of 'big three' conditions - cancer, heart disease, and infectious disease - which together account for more than 50 percent of diagnostic errors annually. Ideally, centers will develop, implement, test, and refine pra ctical solutions for reducing diagnostic errors using human factors, system engineering, and digital health applications. This increase will also support the evaluation, refinement, and dissemination of evidence -based tools and resources to improve diagnostic safety . 1 in 3 patients experienc e a diagnostic error first-hand 33% of all 27% are medium severity, 69% are high severity. 34% of these resulted in death.

LONG COVI D RESEARCH The FY 2023 budget invests $19 million within AHRQ's Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement to establish a new initiative aimed at advancing and disseminating quality healthcare approaches for people living with p ost-acute sequalae of SARS COV -2 Infection, or Long COVID . Long COVID is a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 or can appear weeks after infection. Providing patient - centered, whole person -oriented care for COVID -19 and Long COVID remains a challenge as organizations seek to develop strategies for effectively preventing, diagnosing, treating, and managing COVID -19. AHRQ 's work will ensure that healthcare delivery systems are prepared to provide that patient -centered, coordinated care. Building on its competencies in healthcare delivery research, digital healthcare research, and quality and safety implementation science and practice, AHRQ will: 71 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Invest in health systems research on how to organize and deliver patient -centered care for peopl e living with Long COVID Develop, test, and disseminate clinical tools,resources, and trainings to improve thequality, safety, coordination, patient - centeredness, equity, and value of the deliveryof care for people living with Long COVI D Establish a hub and spoke based model forsupporting multispecialty Long COVID centersin communities without access to majoracademic centers; and Establish telementoring support for primarycare clinicians who will be the backbone of long- term care of Long COVID for many Americans. I MPROVING MATERNAL HEALTH In 2020, 861 women were identified as having died of pregnancy and birth -related causes in the United States, compared with 754 in 2019. These outcomes are not evenly distributed, with underserved populations, including African American individuals, being at substantially higher risk of complication and death. T he budget request s $7 m illion to fund AHRQ's contribution to the HHS-wide Improving Maternal Health Initiative . Funding would support the first year of the effort . This initiative will focus on expanding state capacity to link local and federal healthcare , vital statistics, and social service data; using predictive analytics to improve maternal health and outcomes ; expanding the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to provide better data on maternity care; and expanding the capacity to measure pregnant individuals' experience with care. U .S PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE AHRQ provides scient ific and administrative sup port for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent, non-governmental , volunteer panel of national experts in prevention and evidence -based medicine . The Task Force works to improve the health of people nationwide by making evidence -based recommendations abo ut clinical preventive services. AHRQ supports the Task Force by ensuring t hat it has the evidence i t needs to make recommendations ; the ability to operate in an open, transparent, and scientifically rigorous, and efficie nt manner ; and the ability to share its recommendations clearly and effectively with the healthcare community and public. In FY 2021 , the Task Force issued 15 final recommendation statements , all of which were published in a major national peer -reviewed journal. In 2021, the Task Force also described a new plan for increasing their focus on addressing racial and ethnic health disparities in preventive care . The bu dget invests $12 million to c onduct evidence reviews and develop approximately 8-12 recommendations in FY 2023 . AHRQ will also continue to support the task force in advancing its efforts to increase health equity through the implementation of evidence -based clinical preventive services. M EDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY T he Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a set of large - scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers across the United States. The survey is the most complete source of data on the cost and use of healthcare and health insurance coverage. The survey collects detailed information from families on access, use, expenses, insurance coverage , and quality . Funding supports data collectio n and analytical file production for three interrelated survey components: household , medical provider , and i nsurance . The information from the survey provides valuable data on health status, demographics, employment, and healthcare access and quality. For example, AHRQ recently r eleased analyses from the household component examining the overall concertation of healthcare expenditures across the U.S. population, specifically identifying most commonly treated conditions among top spends and shares of spendi ng by age, race and ethnicity, type of medical service, and source of payment. The FY 2023 budget provides $72 million. This level includes funding for the third -year costs associated with increas ing state sample sizes to enhance the ability to estimate for states and smaller population subgroups. P ROGRAM SUPPORT T he budget includes $ 75 million, an increase of $2 million above FY 2022 enacted, to support agency - wide operational and administrative costs that help ensure efficient management of research activities and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 72Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality stew ardship of federal resources. The increase in funding will allow AHRQ to support the staff and operation costs necessary to carry out the agency's responsibilities. This increase will also fund the addition of seven full-time equivalents needed to support HHS - and AHRQ- funded initiatives including patient safety , digital healthcare , and L ong COVID research. IMPLEMENTING PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH FINDINGS In FY 2023 AHRQ will receive $ 111 million from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund to advance the dissemination and use of patient-centered outcomes research findings and train future PCOR researchers. AHRQ will also use these resources to advance the use of clinical decision support, and other digital technologies to incorporate patient centered outcomes research findings into clinical practice , provide training and career de velopment for researchers and institutions in methods to conduct comparative effectiveness research , and engage with stakeholders to ensure this work has the greatest possible impact on healthcare delivery and outcomes. 73CMS - Overview Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: Overview The following tables are in millions of dollars.

Over 1 50 million Americans rely on CMS programs for high -quality health coverage. The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget estimates $1. 4 trillion in mandatory and discretionary outlays for CMS, a net increase of $53 billion above FY 2022 enacted. Proposed Law 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/ - 2022 Total Proposed Law -- -- -552 -552 Total, Net Outlays, Proposed Law 1,240,666 1,370,463 1,423,680 +53217 74 The Cent ers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ensures effective and high -quality healthcare while promoting more equitable and accessible care for all. CMS is dedicated to moving toward a healthcare system that emphasize s equitable and high -quality healthcare access for all Americans. As the Nation's largest administrator of health benefit programs, CMS is uniquely positioned to accelerate initiatives that advance the Secretary's commitment to enhance mental health services , transform pandemic preparedness capabilities , and advance health equity . BUDGETA RY REQUEST MENTAL HEALTH Through Executive Orders and other regulatory actions, the Admin istration is taking steps to address the unprecedented mental health crisis exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic by strengthening system capacity and connecting more Americans to the care they need . CMS has implemented a new Medicaid state option made available under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to support community -based mobile crisis intervention services that will make behavioral health prov iders the first responder to mental health and substance use crises. CMS has also promulgated Medicare regulations that improve coverage and reimbursement for mental health services . The budget em phasizes the Administration's commitment to mental health by modernizing Medicare mental health bene fits and making them more affordable , expanding access to virtual therapy services for Medicare bene ficiaries, and allowing more providers to receive direct Medicare payment for their mental health services. It also expands access to mental health services by strengthening consumer protections in the private insurance market . Additionally, t he budget proposes improve ments to mental health access in Medicaid through increased access to providers , expand ing and converting the Demonstration Program s to Improve Community Mental Health Services into a permanent program to improve access to behavioral health services , establishing a performance fund to improve behavioral health, and encourag ing utilization of clinically CMS - Overview appropriat e criteria for Medicaid covered behavioral health services . PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS The Administration put Pandemic Preparedness at the forefront of national priorities in the American Rescue Plan Act. The Act empowered CMS to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic by investing in advanced research, development, manufacturing, production and purchase of vaccines, therapeutics, and ancillary medical products utilized for treatment and prevention of COVID -19. The Act also: Requires Medicaid and CHIP coverage of COVID -19 vaccines and their administration, testing, and treatment without beneficiary cost sharing with the vaccine and administration matched at 100 percent feder al medical assistance percentage through one year after the end of the public health emergency. Allows territories to fund this Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP ) increase for coverage of COVID -19 vaccines and their administration, testing, and treatment outside of the territory funding allotment caps. Creates a Medicaid state option to provide coverage to the uninsured for COVID -19 vaccines and treatment without cost sharing at 100 percent federal medical assistance percentage . Provides 100 percent FMAP for two years for services provided to Medicaid beneficiariesreceiving care through Urban IndianOrganizations and Native Hawaiian Healthcare Systems. The COVID -19 pandemic highlights the importance of vaccines and prevention. The budget therefore bolsters CMS's pandemic preparedness with proposals that strengthen CMS's abilit y to collect crucial quality data during future public health emergencies and ensure laboratory services are accessible to the maximum extent feasible in any federal ly declared emergency period . EQ UITY The Administration's commitment to equity in healthcare was made evident in Executive Order 13985, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\" The Administration has also taken actionable steps to increase health equity by lower ing the cost of coverage and healthcare costs for millions of Americans, resulting in 5.8 million people who newly gained Marketplace coverage. In step with the Administration's priority to reduce health disparities , the budget emphasizes positive equity impacts for beneficiaries of all CMS programs. The budget includes foundational equity - and data -related proposals that would further increase access to healthcare coverage . ON GOING PRIORITIES The Administration r emains co mmitted t o lowering prescription d rug co sts for Americans a nd supports actions t o add ress high a nd rising d rug p rices.

Medicare provides health benefits to individuals who are aged 65 or older, disabled, or have End -Stage Renal Disease. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 , the Office of the Actuary estimates that gross current law spending on Medicare benefits will total $ 1.0 trillion and the program will provide health benefits to 66.3 million beneficiaries. HOW MEDICARE WORKS - THE FOUR PARTS OF MEDICARE Part A Medicare Part A pays for healthcare services in inpatient hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, home healthcare related to a hospital stay, and hospice care. A 2.9 percent payroll tax, paid by both employees and employers, is the primary financing mechanism for Part A. Part A gross f ee-for-service spending will total an estimated $ 211.7 billion in FY 2023. Individuals who have worked for 10 years (40 quarters) and paid Medicare taxes during that time generally receive Part A benefits without paying a premium, but most services require beneficiary coinsurance. In Calendar Year (CY) 2022 , beneficiaries pay a $1, 556 deductible for a hospital stay of 1 -60 days, and a $ 194.50 daily coinsurance for days 21 -100 in a skilled nursing facility. Part B Medicare Part B pays for physician, outpatient hospital, End-Stage Renal Disease, laboratory, durable medical equipment, home healthcare unrelated to a hospital stay, and other medical services. Part B coverage is CMS - Medicare voluntary , and approximately 90 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries enroll ed in Part B through either fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage in CY 2022 . Beneficiary premiums finance approximately 25 percent of Part B costs with the remaining 75 percent covered by general revenues from the U.S. Treasury. Par t B gross f ee-for-service spending will total $ 227.7 billion in FY 2023. The standa rd monthly Part B premium is $ 170.10 in CY 2022 , an increase of $ 21.60 from $ 148.50 in CY 2021. A statutory \"hold harmless\" provision applies each year to the approximately 70 percent of enrollees whose premiums are paid from their Social Security benefits , limiting the annual rise in Part B premiums to no more than the Social Security cost of living increase. For these enrollees, any increase in Part B premiums must be lower than the increase in their Social Security benefits. Some beneficiaries also pay a higher Part B premium based on income: those with annual incomes above $ 91,000 (single), or $ 182,000 (married) will pay from $ 238.10 to $578.30 per month in CY 2022. The Part B annual deductible in CY 2022 is $233.00 for all beneficiaries, an increase of $ 30.00 from $ 203.00 in CY 2021. Part C Medicare Part C, the Medicare Advantage Program, pays plans a capitated monthly payment to provide all Part A and B services, and Part D services if offered by the plan. Plans can offer additional benefits or alternative cost -sharing arrangements that are at least as ge nerous as the standard Parts A and B benefits under traditional Medicare. In addition to the regular Part B premium, beneficiaries who choose to participate in Part C may pay monthly plan premiums that vary based on the services offered by the plan and the efficiency of the plan. In CY 2023 , Medicare Advantage enrollment is expected to total a bout 32.0 million beneficiaries, or 52.6 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries who have both Parts A and B. Between 201 3 and 202 2, private plan enrollment grew by 15.3 million, or 10 3 percent, compared to growth in the overall Medicare population of 2 4 percent for the same period. Recent data confirm that 99.7 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least one Medicare Advantage plan in CY 2022. Additio nally, plan offerings of Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits have increased while premiums have remained stable. Medicare payments for private health coverage under Part C are expected to total $4 59 billion in FY 2023 . MedPAC reports p ayments to plans are 104% of what they would be to provide Part A and B benefits in fee- for-service, negatively affecting Part A solvency and increasing Part B premiums for beneficiaries . Part D Medicare Part D offers a standard prescription drug benefit with a CY 2022 deductible of $4 80 and base beneficiary premium of approximately $3 3.37 per month. Enhanced and alternative benefits are also available with varying deductibles and premiums. Participating beneficiaries pay a portion of the cost of their prescription drugs, which varies based on the phase of coverage and the amount the beneficiary has already spent on medications that year. Low -income beneficiaries have varying degrees of cost -sharing, with co-payments ranging from $0 to $ 9.85 in 202 2 and low or no monthly premiums. For CY 2023 , CMS expects Medicare Part D enrollment to increase 2.8 percent to 52 million, including 13.8 million beneficiaries who receive the low -income subsidy . CMS estimates Part D program costs will total $1 24.5 billion in FY 2023. In CY 2022 , of beneficiaries that have P art D coverage, approximately 45 percent are enrolled in a standalone Part D Prescription Drug Plan, 53 percent are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan, and 2 percent are enrolled in an employer plan. Of Medicare beneficiaries overall, approximately 79 percent receive prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D or employer sponsored retiree health plans, and a significant number of the remaining benefi ciaries through other creditable coverage, including benefits received under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , the Department of Veterans Affairs, TRICARE, and Indian Health Services . For most Part D enrollees (those without the low- income subsidy ), the Part D defined standard benefit covers 75 percent of drug spending above a deductible and all but five percent coinsurance once a beneficiary reaches an out -of-pocket threshold. In the initial coverag e phase, if the combined amount the beneficiary and the drug plan pay for prescription drugs reaches a certain level ($4, 430 in 2022), the beneficiary enters the Part D coverage gap phase . As of 2020 , non-low-income subsidy beneficiaries who reach this phase of Medicare Part D coverage continue to pay no more than 25 percent of costs for all covered Part D drugs. Low -income subsidy beneficiaries are statutorily excluded from the coverage gap discount program, and Medicare pays the majority of their cost 77CMS - Medi care sharing. Beneficiaries stay in this phase until they reach the threshold for qualified out -of-pocket spending ($ 7,050 in out -of-pocket costs CY 2022), at which point they enter the catastrophic phase and are then generally responsible for no more tha n five percent of their drug costs. Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations CMS contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) \u2014experts in quality improvement \u2014to ensure Medicare beneficiaries and their families receive high quality care and support CMS's aims of better health, better care , and lower costs. The QIOs drive local change by partnering directly with Medicare providers, beneficiaries, families, and other organizations to support innovative approaches to improve quality, accessibility, and affordability, which translates into national quality improveme nt. The current five-year contract cycle, or 1 2th Scope of Work, began FY 2019 and lasts through FY 2023 . Spending under this Scope of Work totals $ 641 million in FY 2023 and $ 3.7 billion over five years. There are two types of QIOs that work with provi ders and beneficiaries: Quality Innovation Network contractors and Beneficiary and Family Centered Care contractors. During the 1 2th Scope of Work, Q uality Innovation Network QIOs assist patients, providers, and communities to improve behavioral health ou tcomes, decrease opioid misuse, increase patient safety, address chronic disease self -management, and promote quality of care transitions as well as nursing home quality. Quality innovation Network QIOs also play an essential role in the Department's response to COVID -19 by providing targeted response and technical assistance to nursing homes experiencing infection outbreaks. To date , the Quality Innovation Network QIOs have trained frontline staff and managers in over 11,5 00 nursing homes on first -of-its-kind COVID -19 infection control techniques . Beneficiary and Family Centered Care organizations perform the program's statutory case review work, including beneficiary complaints, concerns related to early discharge from healthcare settings, and patient and family engagement. RECEN T PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT S Mental Health Mental healthcare and access to care is a very high priority for this Administration. The Administration is expanding access to mental health and beneficiary - centered care under Medicare via greater use of telehealth and other telecommunications technologies to provide behavioral healthcare, among other services. Medicare beneficiaries can experience care directly in their homes thanks to recent regulations, including the CY 2022 Physician Fee Schedule final rule, that allow for certain behavioral health services via audio -only telephone calls. This means counseling and therapy services, including treatment of substance use disorders and services provided through Opioid Treatment Programs, will be more readily available to individuals, especially in areas with poor bro adband infrastructure. During the COVID -19 pandemic, a report by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation found that visits with behavioral health specialists constituted the largest increase in Medicare fee-for-service telehealth utilization in 2020 . Further , telehealth services comprised a third of total visits 78CMS - Medicare with behavioral health specialists and up to 70 percent of 2020 telehealth visits were potentially payable as audio -only services. The report can be found at : ht tps://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/medicare -beneficiaries - use-telehealth- 2020 . For the first time outside of the COVID -19 public health emergency, Medicare will pay for mental health visits furnished by Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers via telecommunications technology, including audio -only telephone calls, expanding access for rural and other vulnerable populations. P andemic Preparedness Medicare Protects Older Adults 89% of Americans aged 65 and older are fully boosted thanks to the efforts by HHS and its partners. 20% Vaccination associated with roughly a reduction in COVID-19 infection among Medicate beneficiaries, as well as related hospitalizations and deaths, 6.1 million Medicare be neficiaries contracted COVID-19 as of November 2021, The COVID-10 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the elderly and chronically ill. About 1.6 million adults age 65 a nd older may have toruble accessing COVID-19 vaccinations because they have difficulty leaving home. HHS has taken action to bring these life-saving caccines to them. Over 73% of Reside nts in Nursing Homes have received at least one additional primary or booster dose of COVID-19 vaccination as of February 2022. Sources: P reliminary Medicare COVID-19 Data Snapshot, CDC. COVID-19 Data Tracker, A SPE Associations Between County-level Vaccination Rates and COVID-19 Outcomes Among Medicare Beneficiaries. October 21.The Administration has worked tirelessly to increase access to COVID -19 vaccinations for all Americans. Medicare took critical steps to ensure that America's healthcare facilities responded effectively to the COVID -19 public health emergency, including publishing final payment rules to establish a national average COVID -19 vaccine payment rate for physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and many other immunizers ; issue Long- Term Care Facility immunization requi rements for residents and staff; improve transparency with va ccine and therapeutics treatment reporting requirements; and provide set s of toolkits for providers, states, and insurers to facilitate the healthcare system's swift response. These measures support ed the important actions taken by providers to expand the ir capacity to increase the number of vaccines they could furnish each day, including establishing new or growing existing vaccination sites, conducting patient outreach and education, and hiring additional staff. The Biden -Harris Administration's effort s to expand access to COVID -19 vaccines extended to Medicare beneficiaries' homes. There are approximately 1.6 million adults 65 or older who may have trouble accessing COVID -19 vaccination s because they have difficulty leaving home . These individuals are often at - risk patients who could require complex care if they contracted COVID -19 and needed to be hospitalized. To better serve this group, Medicare increased the total payment amount for at -home vaccinations in certain circumstance s to ensure that providers administering the vaccines are sufficiently compensated for upfront costs, clinical time, and safety measures to administer the vaccines in a home environment . Actions taken to protect all beneficiaries underscores the Administr ation's commitment to removing barriers and bringing the fight against the COVID -19 pandemic to the country's most vulnerable individuals. The Administration is further support ing pandemic preparedness through a $200 million investment in infection contr ol and vaccination uptake for nursing homes through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This funding enables QIOs to combat COVID - 19 in nursing homes by providing assistance to increase resident and staff vaccination rates, mitigat e outbreaks, and stren gthen infection control systems to prevent the entry and spread of infections. Encourage Efficiency The Administration has continued to promote price transparency for Medicare beneficiaries as well as all healthcare users through its efforts to enforce hospital compliance with the Hospital Price Transparency final rule. Hospital price transparency helps people know what a hospital charges for the items and services it provides , an important factor given that healthcare costs can cause significant financial burdens for consumers. While enforcement activities are necessary 79CMS - Medi care to drive compliance with price transparency, CMS is also committed to working with hospitals to help them meet those requirements. Strengthen Oversight, Quality, and Beneficiary Protections The Administration has made nursing home staff turnover rates and weekend staff levels publicly available to Medicare beneficiaries and all healthcare consumers for the first time ever . Staffing in nursing homes has a substantia l impact on the quality of care and outcomes residents experience. This information, available on Medicare.gov /care -compare , helps consumers understand more about each nursing home facility's staffing environment and choose a facility that provides the hi ghest quality of care that best meets the healthcare needs of their loved one. In addition, via the National Healthcare Safety Network , beneficiaries are also able to see national and state level data on COVID -19 vaccination coverage among nursing home residents and staff . The Administration is also launching new initiatives to improve nursing home quality, including the intention to strengthen requirements for on -site infection preventionists, efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications , and the provision of technical assistance to nursing homes to help them improve. 2023 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS The FY 2023 budget includes targeted Medicare proposals that support the Administration's prioritie s to invest in mental he alth, strengthen equity in healthcare , and improve beneficiary protections. Together, this legislative package invests a net $3.0 billion into the Medicare program over 10 years. When, combined with program integrity investments, the budget yields net savings to Medicare of $17.7 billion over 10 years. Mental Health Eliminate the 190 -day Lifetime Limit on Psychiatric Hospital Services Under current law, once an individual receives Medicare benefits for 190 -days of care in a psychiatric hospital during their lifetime, no further benefits of that type are available to that individual. This limitation applies only to services furnished in a psychiatric hospital, not to inpatient psychiatric services furnished in a distinct psychiatric unit of a general hospital. Eliminating the lifetime limit on psychiatric hospital services would serve to improve parity between Medicare mental health and physical health coverage by removing a limitation on coverage of mental health services for which there is no comparable limit on physical health services. It would also increase the overall availability of inpatient psychiatric hospital services. This proposal will improve equity by removing a barrier to accessing mental health services, which affects thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with mental illness, many of whom are under age 65. [$2.2 billion in Medicare costs over 10 years] Require Medicare t o Cover Three Behavioral Health Visits without Cost -Sharing Medicare Part B includes coverage of behavioral health visits to a doctor, therapist, or other clinician for services generally received outside of a hospital, but the annual Part B deductible and coinsurance apply, with limited exceptions. This proposal would require Medicare to cover up to three behavioral health visits per year without cost -sharing. Eliminating cost -sharing for individuals removes potential financial barriers to treatment and gives more patients access to the care they need. This proposal will have a positive impact on health equity by improving access and adherence to treatment , creating a pathway to better overall health outcomes. [$ 1.4 billion in costs over 10 years] Revis e Criteria for Psychiatric Hospital Terminations from Medicare Current law requires CMS to terminate psychiatric hospital participation in Medicare after six months of non-compliance with conditions of participation, even if the deficiency does not jeopardize patient health and wellbeing. T his provision does not apply to any other provider category . If a facility must be terminated, i t would diminish access to quality mental health services by diverting resources away from patient care, and any required termination could cause patients with mental illness to forgo seeking the appropriate care . This proposal would give CMS flexibility to allow a psychiatric hospital to continue receiving Medicare payments when deficiencies are not considered to imme diately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients and where the facility is actively working to correct the deficiencies identified in an approved Plan of Correction . Without this flexibility for options beyond termination from participation in Medicare, the communities using these psychiatric services may suffer reduced access to care , increasing health disparities and having a negative impact on social determinants of health. [Budget Neutral ] 80CMS - Medicare Modernize Medicare Mental Health B enefits Currently , statutory limits on the list of practitioners and the scope of services that are eligible for Medicare payment restrict access to mental health services in Medicare . This proposal would : establish a Medicare benefit category for Licensed P rofessional Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists that authorizes direct billing and payment under Medicare for these practi tioners , remove limits on the scope of services for which Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Professional Counselo rs, and Marriage and Family Therapists can be paid by Medicare ; allow these practitioners to bill Medicare directly for their mental health services for covered Part A qualifying S killed Nursing Facility stays; establish Medicare payment under Part B for services provided under an Assertive Community Treatment delivery system ; allow payment to R ural Health Clinics and F ederally Qualified Health Center s for Licensed Professional Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists providing mental health services ; and enable Medicare coverage of evidence -based digital applications and platforms that facilitate the delivery of mental health services . By removing statutory limits on the list of providers that are authorized to receive direct Medicare payment for their mental health services , this proposal would expand access to mental health services in Medicare, especially in rural and underserved areas with fewer mental health professionals, or communities more likely to r eceive care from the referenced practitioners . [Not Scorable ] Apply the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to Medicare Unlike most private and employer -based insurance and Medicaid plans, Medicare is not subject to the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (the Act), which requires health plans that offer mental health and substance use disorder benefits to provide coverage that is on par with the medical and surgical benefits they offer. This proposal ensures that mental health and substance use disorder benefits under Medicare do not face greater limitations on reimbursement or access to care relative to medical and surgical benefits. MedPAC will be required to issue a report to identify existing gaps in mental health and substance use disorder benefits to be addressed in Medicare statute. Applying the Act to Medicare builds on efforts to enhance behavioral health coverage and improve s access to comprehensive care for these beneficiaries. This proposal improves health equi ty and confirms the notion that Medicare beneficiaries suffering from mental health and substance use disorders are just as deserving of protection and care as those with medical, physical, or surgical needs. [ Not Scor eable ] Growing need for expansion of Medicare mental health benefits: - 1 in 4 report anxiety or de pression amid the COVID-19 pandemic vs one in ten pre-pandemic; - Medicare be neficiaries are more likely to live with mental illness as compared to the general population; - Prevalence of mental illness is g reatest among beneficiaries under 65 who qualify for Medicare because of disability and low- income beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid; - More than 112 million Americans live in areas of the country where mental health care providers are in short supply; - 2 of 3 Medicare beneficiaries will seek care from a professional for their mental health concerns; - However, adults over 65 years old cite cost as a barrier to adequate long-term mental health Consolidate all Vaccine Coverage under Medicare Part B Current Medicare coverage for vaccine administration is divided between Part B and Part D, which can be confusing and burdensome for both Medicare beneficiaries and providers. Part B is a more appropriate type of coverage for vaccines because 81CMS - Medi care more beneficiaries are enrolled in Part B than Part D and higher out -of-pocket costs in some Part D plans may create a financial barrier to access. This proposal shifts all Medicare coverage for vaccines, including administration costs, to Part B and requires that Medicare Advantage Plans charge no greater cost - sharing for any vaccines and their administration than is charged under Original Medicare. For all vaccines, as recommended by the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and approved by the CDC Director, with the exception of vaccination for travel- related purposes, there w ill be zero cost- sharing for Medicare beneficiaries. This pr oposal also modifies the way Medicare pays for vaccines from 95 percent of the Average Wholesale Price, which often has little relationship to market prices, to 103 percent of the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, the price at which the manufacturer sells the vaccine to the wholesaler. These changes promote better access to vaccines among the Medicare population while making Medicare payment for them more in line with actual costs. Health equity is improved by removing potential financial barriers to CDC -recomm ended vaccines. [$3.6 billion in costs over 10 years ] Authorize Coverage for Unapproved Drugs and Devices Authorized for Emergency Use The Secretary has broad authority to temporarily waive or modify certain Medicare, Medicaid, or Children's Health Insura nce Program ( CHIP ) requirements in certain public health emergencies, but this emergency waiver authority does not permit the Secretary to broaden coverage to drugs and devices that the FDA authorizes under an Emergency Use Authorization . Additionally, current law does not allow the Secretary to require coverage for the uninsured. This proposal changes the public health emergency statute to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to respond rapidly and effectively to future pandemics and other publi c health emergencies. Specifically, this proposal grants the Secretary explicit authority to make Emergency Use Authorization drugs and devices available during a public health emergency , without patient cost -sharing, for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP enrollees and for the uninsured. This authority would avoid dependence on emergency legislation or administrative workarounds, both of which have been necessary during the COVID -19 public he alth emergency . The authority ensure s that all Americans have access to drugs and devices that receive Emergency Use Authorization s, without patient cost -sharing. The proposal improves h ealth equity as underserved communities have been historically dispr oportionately impacted by disasters and emergencies. This proposal would increase HHS's capacity to address the medical needs of vulnerable communities during future pandemics, disasters, and other public health emergencies. [Not Scoreable] Ensure Consistency and Clarity of Data Reporting Requirements for Medicare Providers, Suppliers and Contractors During Public Health Emergencies While CMS was able to collect valuable information from certain providers during the public health emergency , CMS is limited and often faces significant delays around the collection and reporting of quality data. This proposal permits CMS to require all Medicare providers, suppliers, and contractors to collect and report relevant data under a declared public health emergency as specified by the Secretary, and to enforce these requirements with intermediate penalties such as civil monetary penalties . By permitting CMS to require relevant data submissions from all Medicare providers, suppliers, and contractors during public heal th emergencies , and setting clear and consistent expectations for data reporting and allowing more flexible enforcement , CMS could improve compliance and better inform government response to public health emergencies. [ Budget Neutral ] Enable the Secretary to Temporarily Waive or Modify the Application of Specific Requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 Act during Public Health Emergencies The use of waiver authority under current law is central to CMS' s emergency response activities during the pandemic; however, t he Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program does not have similar statutory flexibilities. Because of this limitation, CMS has had to use enforcement discretion to implement a temporary policy within the constraints of the program's statutory requirements . This proposal enables the Secretary to temporarily waive or modify the application of specific requirements of the A ct to ensure laboratory services are accessible to the maximum extent feasible in any federally declared emergency period and area , among other things . Exempting certain requirements will strengthen preparedness by allowing laboratory flexibilities for testing performed during federally declared emergencies and public health emergencies , thus allowing for expanded testing to underserved communities. For example, during the COVID -19 public 82CMS - Medicare health emergency , the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program allowed pathologists to interpret slides remotely under enforcement discretion. This enforcement discretion added to continuity of care, especially for surgical patients awaiting a serious and time sensitive diagnosis. Amending the statute would pr ovide CMS the ability to apply consistent criteria when granting a waiver to specific Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments requirements . [Not Scorable ] Strengthen Oversight, Quality, and Beneficiary Protections Enhance Physician Fee Schedule Conversion Factor Updates in CY 2025 Under current law, eligible clinicians who achieve Qualifying Participant (QP) status in an Alternative Payment Model ( APM ) receive two primary incentives: (1) exclusion from the Merit -based Incentive Payment System, including both the reporting requirements andpayment adjustments; and (2) a financial incentive thatapplies from 2019 -2024 followed by one that applies from 2026 forward. Specifically, f or Payment Year s 2019 through 2024, QPs receive a five percent APM incentive payment for Part B covered professional services furnished during a year , then beginning in 2026, QPs receive a 0.75 percent conversion factorupdate, while non -QPs receive a 0.25 percent update . There is no incent ive in 2025. T he conversion factor is the multiplier that Medicare applies to calculatepayment rates for Medicare Part B covered professional services under the Physician Fee Schedule . This proposal b egin s the respective conversion factor updates for Advanced APM p articipants and non - participants in 2025, one year e arlier than under current law, effective CY 2025 . Beginning the enhanced conversion factor update in 2025 rather than 2026 would close the gap during which QPs wouldreceive no financial reward under the Quality Payment Program and therefore encourage eligible clinicians to participate in Advanced APMs to attain QP status in Performance Year 2023 for payment year 2025 . Beginning the enhanced conversion factor update in 2025 inste ad of 2026 would simplify physician payment policy, reduce regulations and paperwork, and avoid confusion among stakeholders. [$3.5 billion in costs over 10 years] Add Medicare Coverage of Services Furnished by Community Health Workers Under current law, services provided by community health workers are not paid under Medicare. This proposal would provide coverage and reimbursement to community health workers acting within the scope of their license or certification under Medicare's Physician Fee Schedule for select, evidence -based preventive, chronic, and behavioral care management services, as well as certain social determinants of health evaluation and navigation services, effective CY 2024 . Such services would be exempt from Medicar e cost-sharing . Services must be furnished under the direction of \u2014and billed by \u2014a Medicare -enrolled supplier or provider in accordance with a comprehensive community needs assessment and engagement plan. In addition to existing Medicare providers, the Se cretary would be permitted to enroll community -based organizations (e.g. , non-profits, public health departments , etc.) as community health worker suppliers to broaden access to services, subject to program integrity and patient safety guardrails. This proposal has positive equity implications, as it would increase access to the healthcare system for underserved Medicare beneficiaries and allow communities to better target resources to addressing local public health challenges. [Not Scorable ] Standardize Data Collection to Improve Quality and Promote Equitable Care Current law requires post -acute providers (inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long -term care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies) to report standardized patient assessment data on five health assessment categories, as well as \"other categories deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.\" However, there is no express statutory requirement for data reporting on social determinants of health. This proposal would add a new category of standardized patient assessment data, \"drivers of health\", for post - acute care providers. These data could include, for example, transportation, housing, social isolation, and food insecurity . This new data would enabl e real -time information exchange between the healthcare system and those resources best equipped to address individual needs \u2014activating government , community agencies, and healthcare providers to work together to support individuals of underserved populations and be responsive to respond to public health needs. [Budget Neutral ] Remove Restrictions on the Certification of New Entities as Organ Procurement Organizations and Increas e Enforcement Flexibility Under curr ent law, only currently certified organ procurement organizations may be recertified . This 83CMS - Medi care prevents new entities from becoming certified as an organ procurement organization . This proposal allows CMS to do two things: 1) certify new entities as organ procurement organizations , and 2) rec ertify certain organ procurement organizations that do not meet the criteria for recertification based on outcome measure performance, but which have shown significant improvement during a re-certification cycle. The proposal will provide the flexibility CMS needs to avoid organ procurement disruptions due to the certification status of certain organ procurement organizations and provide these organizations w ith an incentivize to maximize performance even if they do not believe they could satis fy the outcome requirements at the next re - certification. [Budget Neutral ] Increase Transparency by Disclosing Accreditation Surveys Current law prohibits the Secretary from disclosing accreditation surveys done by Accrediting Organizations or any other national accreditation body , except for surveys for home health agencies, hospice programs, and surveys related to enforcement action taken by CMS. This proposal will remove the disclosure prohibition that currently prohibits the Secretary from disclosing certain accreditation surveys . Posting survey information about facilities currently out of compliance addresses the information gap for members of the public who would otherwise be unaware of a n accredited provider's performance based solely on their continued accreditation status. [Budget Neutral ] Hold Long- Term Care Facility Owners Accountable for Noncompliant Closures and Substandard Care When a long -term care facility closes, it is typically the owner of the faci lity that has control of the finances (including profits) and authority over the closure, and not the facility administrator. Yet under current statute, it is the administrator that is at risk of being imposed a civil money penalty, and the owner has no accountability if they close the facility in a noncompliant manner . This proposal would change the individual subject to a civil money penalty from \"administrator\" to \"owner, operator, or owners or operators\" of a facility and add a provision that would ensure the Secretary has the authority to impose enforcement on the owners of a facility, after the facility has closed. [Budget Neutral ] 2023 ADMINISTRATIVE PROPOSALS The budget also includes one Medicare administrative proposal that the Department plans to implement in FY 2023. This proposal supports the Administration's priorities for Medicare and does not require Congressional action. Strengthen Oversight, Quality, and Beneficiary Protections Increase Social Security Administration S haring and Collection of R ace and E thnicity Data for Medicare Beneficiaries The primary source of race and ethnicity data on Medicare beneficiaries has been the Social Security Administration (SSA). Currently, SSA collects limited race and ethnicity data on some Medicare beneficiaries and does not collect any data on other beneficiaries , which hinders CMS's ability to identify and reduce health disparities . The current collection of race and ethnicity data complies with certain 1997 OMB guidelines but does not comply with the more expansive 2011 HHS Data Standards that, for example, provide more detail on the diversity of Asian populations in the U nited States, such as Chinese, Vietnamese , and Filipino . This administrative proposal would have SSA increase sharing of race and ethnicity data with CMS for current and prospective Medicare beneficiaries , and consider expanding collection of detailed data , e.g., at 2011 HHS data standards or newer data standard s. CMS will assist by conducting appropriate research and user testing for collection of this data to ensure it is useful for the purposes of tracking disparities in healthcare treatment and outcomes by race and ethnicity.

The Administration's vision is to protect and strengthen Medicaid and t he Affordable Care Act by expanding access to coverage, improving health equity, and making our healthcare system less complex to navigate. HOW MEDICAID WORKS States design, implement, and administer their own Medicaid programs based on federal guidelines. The federal government matches state expenditures using the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, which is based on state per capita income compared to the national average and can be no lower than 50 percent. In FY 2021, the federal share of Medicaid outlays was approximately $521 billion. Medicaid beneficiaries include low -income children, pregnant adults, non - elderly adults, and the aged, blind, and/or d isabled. Individuals must meet certain minimum categorical and financial eligibility standards. States have flexibility to extend coverage to higher income groups, including medically needy individuals, through waivers and amended Medicaid state plans. Medically needy individuals are those who do not meet the income standards of the categorical eligibility groups, but these individuals incur large medical expenses and would otherwise qualify for Medicaid. States also have the option to expand Medicaid t o eligible adults with 1 Gross obligations 2 Totals may not add due to rounding. 3 The HHS total for legislative proposals does not include the -$18 million in third scorecard savings anticipated from the Social Security Administration allocation adjustment proposal.

Within three months of submission of initial state home and community -based services spending plans, all states and the District of Columbia received approval to enhance, expand, and strengthen these services .7 The $25 billion in planned investment allows states to tailor enhancements, while strengthening the home and community -based services workforce and accelerating reform and innovation. CMS also con tinues to support states as they address the impact of COVID -19 on Medicaid beneficiaries. Under the A RP, CMS distributed funds and guidance to support the mandatory coverage of COVID -19 vaccines, testing, and treatment.8 Following the authorization and recommendation of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine for children, age 5 and older, and a booster dose for those aged 12 to 17 , CMS released a new policy requiring states to cover stand -alone COVID -19 vaccine counseling visits for children and stand -alone COVID -19 vaccine counseling visits related to all pediatric vaccines for child beneficiaries. 9 CMS is also providing intensive technical assistance to states as they prepare for the eventual end of the Public Health Emergency and work to ensure that eligible Medicaid beneficiaries maintain healthcare coverage once the declaration ends. Comprehensive Access Strategy for Medicaid and CHIP The Administration is committed to continuing to work to reduce inequities in Medicaid and CHIP and ensuring every eligible person can access the coverage and care to which they are entitled . In February 2022, CMS released a Request for Information (RFI) regarding access to care and coverage for people enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. CMS seeks input on a broad set of topics related to accessibility of care, ranging from ensuring adequate payment rates and encouraging provider availability and quality, to culturally and linguistically competent care and reducing gaps in healthcare coverage , as well as barriers to enrolling in and maintaining coverage of Medicaid and CHIP, and beneficiaries' perceptions and experiences with care. This feedback will help inform future policies, monitoring, and regulatory actions, helping ensure beneficiaries have equitable access to high- quality and appropriate c are ac ross all Medicaid and CHIP pay ment and d elivery sy stems, i ncluding f ee-for-service, managed care lternative p ayment m odels. The RFI su bmissions will a lso inform C MS's work t o ensure timely ac cess to critical services, s uch as be havioral healthcare and home a nd community -based s ervices . Quality Measurement and Improvement The A ffordable Care A ct appropriated a t otal of $300 mil lion for t he purpose o f measuring o ve rall national qualit y of care f or Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries , monitor ing performance at t he state level , and improving the quality o f healt hcare . CMS continues to w ork w ith states, the District o f Columbia, and t er ritories t o impr ove reporting a nd quali ty of se rvices in Medicaid and CHIP. F or example, CMS ide ntified the n eed t o improve the postpartum p eriod experience for Me dicaid and C HIP beneficiaries and thus d e veloped the Post par tum C are L earning Collaborative . This Collaborative pr ovides states with strategie s i mprove o utcomes, su ch as e nsuring continuity o f coverage f or beneficiaries and reforming prov ider p ayments .

The FY 2023 budget includes a proposal to allow all states and territories to participate in the existing Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) demonstration program and would convert existing and any new demonstr ation programs to a more sustainable Medicaid state plan option. This proposal also maintains the demonstration 's enhanced federal matching rate under the state plan option. Extending and converting this demonstration program into a permanent program will help ensure more Medicaid beneficiaries have access to all the behavioral health services CCBHCs provide, which can improve health outcomes. See the State Grants and Demonstrations chapter for additional information. [$24 billion in costs over 10 years . The remaining $45 million in proposal costs are funded in the State Grants and Demonstrations account. ] Establish Medicaid Provider Capacity Demonstration for Mental Health Treatment There are currently widespread shortages of highly trained mental health professionals in the U nited States to address the full spectrum of mental health issues, including those treating adults with serious mental illness . This proposal includes $7.5 billion in Medicaid to provide planning grants and a demonstration op portunity for states to improve Medicaid mental health provider capacity , complementing the existing successful Medicaid provider capacity demonstration program for substance use disorder treatment . All states may apply for funding , which can be used for planning grants to assess and develop strategies on education, recruitment, integration, reimbursement , and training of providers, and to improve mental health provider capacity . Demonstration states will be selected from planning grants states for those that have a robust strategy to improve provider capacity. This proposal seeks to improve access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries by increasing mental health provider capacity . [$7.5 billion in costs over 10 years ] Utilize Clinically Appropriate Criteria for Medicaid Behavioral Health Services Some states impose pay ment rules that prohibit same day billing for mental health and physical health visits , which is problematic for providers and Medicaid beneficiaries . This proposal would prevent states from prohibiting same day billing and allow providers to be reimbursed for Medicaid mental health and physical health visits provided to a Medicaid beneficiary that occur on the same day. Additionally, it require s that Medicaid behavioral health services , whether provided under fee -for-service or managed care, be consistent with current and clinically appropriate treatment guidelines. This proposal encourages equitable care by ensuring consistency in quality of services provided to beneficiaries through fee -for-service or managed care delivery systems . [$2.4 billion in costs over 10 years ] Establish Performance Bonus Fund to Improve Behavioral Health in Medicaid This proposal establishes a $ 2.5 billion fund over five years for HHS to award payments to states contingent upon improvements on the behavioral health core set, access measures, or other measures selected by the Secretary. See the State Grants and Demonstrations chapter for additional information. [$2.5billion in costs over 10 years] HIV/AIDS Eliminate under Medicaid Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) can reduce the risk of getting HIV by at least 74 percent . To increase access to these preventive activities, this proposal requires coverage of PrEP under Medicaid, including associated laboratory services, with no cost -sharing , and prohibits such utilization management practices that would limit access to PrEP, including prior authorization and benefit limits. Removing these barriers could greatly 90CMS - Medicaid incre ase access to PrEP for Medicaid beneficiaries seeking HIV prevention tools , including those among populations most vulnerable to HIV. It also aligns wi th other HHS work being done in this area, such as the CDC's Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States. [$4.2 billion in savings over 10 years ] Program Efficiencie s Modify the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in Territories Currently, each of the U.S. territories' readiness to implement the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program varies . The budget proposes technical changes to provide flexibility so t erritories ready to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program may do so and achieve drug price savings without increasing drug prices in territories not ready to participate. To accomplish this, the proposal excludes sales from the manufacturer calculation of average manufacturer price and best price in territories to ensure continued discounted drug prices for territories. Additionally, the proposal makes it optional for territories to participate i n the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program . These changes will support territories in continuing to provide medication access for vulnerable populations . [Budget Neutral] Enhance Medicaid Managed Care Enforcement Currently, CMS has inadequate financial ov ersight and compliance tools in Medicaid managed care , lacking maximum flexibility to disallow and defer individual payments or partial payments associated with contracts with managed care organizations, prepaid inpatient health plans, and prep aid ambulatory health plans. CMS's only recourse when it identifies compliance failures is to withhold all federal financial participation under the contract , an untenable compliance option given potential beneficiary harm and disruption to the state's Me dicaid program . This proposal would revise Section 1903(m)(2)(A ) to condition federal match in Medicaid managed care plan contract capitation payment amounts on a service -by-service basis and provide CMS with additional enforcement options . The proposed revisions would enhance CMS' s ability to take meaningful actions to protect beneficiaries and enforce requirements, making these managed care compliance tools more effective and consistent with similar authorities in fee -for-service .

States also have the option to cover targeted low -income, uninsured pregnant women under CHIP. In Fiscal Year ( FY) 2021 , the CMS Office of the Actuary estimated that CHIP enrollment averaged approximately 7.3 million individuals per month in 2021 .1 C ongress appropriated $25.9 billion in federal funding for CHIP for FY 2023 in the HEALTHY KIDS Act . The HEALTHY KIDS Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended federal funding for CHIP and authorized the C hild Enrollment Contingency Fund for a period of 10 years , from FY 2018 through FY 2027. This 10 -year extension is the longest period of stable CHIP funding since CHIP's creation in 1997. Since its initiation, CHIP has contributed greatly to the decline in uninsured rates among low -income children, and research indicates the program works as intended to provide a safety net for low -income children, particularly during times of economic hardship. Additionally, children enrolled in CHIP experience better access to care, fewer unmet needs, and families experienced much lower financial burden and stress in meeting the child's healthcare needs when compared to children who are uninsured. 2 1 Decreases in total annual child enrollment between FY 2019 and FY 2020 is likely due to children moving from CHIP to Medicaid during the Public Health Emergency . 2 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Mandated Evaluation of the Children's Health Insurance Program. HOW CHIP W ORKS CHIP is a jo int partnership b etween t he federal government and states, the District of C olum bia and five U .S. Territories to he lp provide c hildren unde r age 19 from l ow- and middle -income h ouseholds with health insurance c overage a nd access t o healthcare . Congress appropriates funding f or an annual capped amount for C HIP, which CMS then allocates t o states and t erritories w ith a pproved C HIP p lans according t o a statutory form ula. Since FY 2009, the a mount o f funding Congress appropriate s for C HIP ha s exceeded the a mount CMS ca n award states a nd territories according t o the statutory f ormula. Congress grants sta tes, District of C olumbia , a nd five territories flexibility in designing t heir CHIP programs. They may implement C HIP by expanding M ed icaid, creating a se parate p rogram, or using a co mbination o f Med ica id and a separate CHIP. CMS ha s approved a CHIP plan f or every state, District o f Columbia , a nd the five territories. These plans i nclude 15 Medicaid expansion programs, two separate programs, and 38 combi nation programs. States use a Modified Adjusted Gross Income s tan dard to de te rmine e ligibility f or CHIP. The s tatute p ermits sta tes the o ption to o ffer children conti nuous e ligi bility for 1 2 months regardless of changes to family inc ome duri ng the year.

Since it s establishment in FY 2009, o nly 93CMS - Children's Health Insurance Program four states have qualified for Contingency Fund payment s. Current law does not require states to spend Contingency Fund resources on CHIP activities. In addition, CMS recovers unused state allotment funding to redistribute to states facing a funding shor tfall. Since 2012, CMS has redistributed approximately $1.9 billion to 32 states and territories. RECENT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS The American Rescue Plan Act ( ARP), signed by the President on March 11, 2021 , made COVID -19 vaccine s, their administration , testing, treatment, and associated costs for these services a time -limited mandatory benefit under CHIP without cost sharing. The ARP also requires states that elect to provide 12 months postpartum coverage in their Medicaid program s to also provide 12 months postpartum care in CHIP. T his option is limited to a five -year period beginning April 1, 2022 . The Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act ) made mental health services, including behavioral health and s ubstance use disorder , mandatory under CHIP. These new mandatory services include preventive services, age - appropriate behavioral health screenings, and behavioral health treatment . The SUPPO RT Act also requires states to provide these services in culturally and linguistically appropriate ways and ensure beneficiary access to these services. Throughout the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency declaration period, CMS has supported state s, including approving 38 CHIP state plan amendments to provide states operational flexibility during the emergency . CMS continues to provide guidance to states as they prepare to return to routine operations after the Public Health Emergency. CHIP also i ncludes programs to improve child health quality in Medicaid and CHIP and strengthen the quality of access to children's healthcare for eligible children not enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 made state reporting on the Child Core Set mandatory starting in FY 2024 . Through CMS's collaboration with states on Medicaid and CHIP Child Quality Measurement, all states, District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico voluntarily reported on at least one measure in the Child Core Set and 48 states reported on at least half of the measures in the child core set in FY 2020. CMS was also able to publicly report on live births weighing less than 2,500 grams for all 50 states , using existing data sources for the firs t time in FY 2020 . CMS continues to work with states to prepare for mandatory reporting beginning in FY 2024. On Jan uary 27, 2022, CMS announced $49.4 million in available funding through the Connecting Kids to Coverage HEALTHY KIDS 2022 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreements program , building on the successes of the 2019 grant cycle . This funding will support eff orts to increase participation of eligible children, parents, and pregnant individuals in Medicaid and CHIP , and is the largest amount of funding CMS has ever made available for these outreach and enrollment awards. 94CMS - Children's Health Insurance Program FY 202 3 Budget Proposals The following tables are in millions of dollars .

CMS also re cently released guidance on the scope of, and payments for, qualifying community -based mobile crisis intervention services. MONEY F OLLOWS THE P ERSON DEMONSTRATION Over t he lif etime of this demonstration, 34 states , including the District o f Columbia , were awarded competitive g rants and receive d an e nhanced federal matching r ate to help eligible individuals t ransition from a qualified institutional setting t o a qualified home o r community -based setting. States have demonstrated positive o utcomes, i ncluding h elping individuals i n institutions r eturn t o the co mmunity, improving par ticipant quali ty of life, and lowering the cost o f care.

DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS TO I MPROVE C OMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH S ERVICES The Certified Community B ehavior al Health Clinic s (CCBHC) demonstration program provides p articipating clinics w ith an enhanced feder al matching r ate reimbursement to support states in improving the availability and quality of community-based, comprehensive treatment a nd recovery s upport services t o Medicaid b eneficiaries living w ith mental illness a nd substance u se disorders. Par ticipating clinics ar e als o provided access t o a prospective 97 CMS - State Grants and Demonstrations CMS - State Grants and Demonstrations payment s ystem that i s designed t o cover t he expected c osts of p r oviding CCBHC services. I n 2015 , HHS aw arded $22.9 million in one -y ear planning g r ants for CCB HCs to support 24 s ta tes in their e f forts to plan t o participate in this demonstration p rogram . In 2 016, HHS selected eight s t ates (of t he o r iginal 2 4) to p articipate i n th e d emonstration p rogram. The d emonstration p r ogram h as been extended multiple t imes; most recently the Consolidated A p propriations A ct, 2021 extended t h e d e monstration u ntil S eptember 2 023. In addition, the Coronavirus A i d, Re lief, and Economi c Security A ct required H H S t o ad d t w o a dditional st ates to the d e monstration p r ogram, which had t o be s elected f rom am ong t h e o riginal 2 4 pl anning grantee s t ates. CCBHCs participating in the demonstration program are certified by states to provide community-based mental and s ubstance u se disorder s ervices, a dvance int egration of be ha vioral health with physical healthcare, as s imilate and utilize evidence -based practices consistently, and promote improved access t o high quality care. Under the demonstration program, certified clinics may receive Medicaid payment through a daily or monthly prospective payment system rate that is clinic -specific and reimburses the expected cost of demonstration services. Results from the most recent report to Congress on this demonstration indicated that during the first two years of the demonstration program, CCBHCs implemented a range of activities to improve access to care; increased the number of clients they served; expanded services to include various evidence -based practices; hired and trained staff ; and changed many of their care processes. Overall, the average total costs of CCB HC services per client varied widely by state . On average, payment rates covered the costs of CCBHC services in all but one state, and the average rates came into greater alignment with the average costs in the second year of the demonstration.

The FY 2023 budget includes a proposal to allow all states and territories to participate in the existing CCBHC demonstration program and would convert the existing and any new demonstration programs to Medicaid state plan options. States and territor ies that cho ose to participate in this program will also receive planning grant funding. This proposal will help ensure more Medicaid beneficiaries have access to all the behavioral health services CCBHCs provide, which can improve health outcomes. See the Medicaid chapter for additional information. [$45 million in costs over 10 years , which account for the planning grants and administration funded in this account.

Through this demonstration program, CMS encourages states to increase provider capacity in their Medicaid programs through provision of enhanced federal reimbursement for increases in Medicaid spending on substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for select states. In 2019, CMS selected 15 states to receive planning grants to assess behavioral health treatment capacity and provider needs to sustainably improve Medicaid provider networks treating substance use disorders. In September 2021, CMS selected five state Medicaid agencies to participate in th e 36 -month post- planning period: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, and West Virginia. The goals of this demonstration include: Supporting recruitment and training, and providing technical assistance for providers offering substance use disorder tre atment or recovery services; Improving reimbursement for and expanding the amount of treatment capacity ofp articipating providers authorized to dispense Food and Drug Administration -approved drugs for individuals with substance use disorders ; and Improvin g reimbursement and expanding the amount of participating providers ' treatment capacity to address the treatment needs of certain populations enrolled under the s tate plan or waiver of such plan . B EHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS Establish Performance Bonus Fund to Improve Behavioral Health in Medicaid B ehavioral health conditions are common among Medicaid beneficiaries and have worsened during the COVID -19 pandemic. As one of the major payers of behavioral health services, Medicaid plays a key role in enabl ing beneficiaries' access to these important services. This proposal establishes a $ 2.5 billion fund over five years for HHS to award payments to states contingent upon improvements on the behavioral health core measurement set, access measures, or other measures selected by the Secretary. These award payments to states ca n improve access to and quality of behavioral health services for vulnerable populations under Medi caid.

Since i ts passage 1 2 years ago, t he A CA h as reduced t he n umber o f uninsured A mericans b y more than 2 0 million people, e xtended critical consumer protections to over 1 00 million people, and strengthened a nd improved the n ation's healthcare system. During t he COVID -19 Public H ealth E mergency , additional subsidies p rovided b y the American R escue Plan Act ha ve m ade Marketplace coverage e ven more affordable and accessible f or m illions of A mericans. Nevertheless, c hallenges r emain. Despite his toric gains, m illions of A mericans remain uninsured, including lo w-income indiv iduals in states that have n ot expanded Me dicaid. Moreover, t he C OVID -19 pandemic and the o ngoing o pioid cr isis h ave underscored the n eed for a dditional consumer protections, especially in the ar eas o f mental health and substance use d isorder services. Highlighted below a re some o f the measures that t he Administration has t aken t o ensure t hat A mericans have access t o affordable healthcare coverage d uring the C OVID -19 P ublic Health E mergency , as w ell as actions t aken to i mplement s urprise b illing p rotections from the No Surprises Act and a robust set of new proposals in the F Y 2023 budget to help consumers access hig h-quality healthcare . EXPANDING COVERAGE AN D AC CESS TO AFFORDABLE CAR E TH ROUGH THE M ARKETPLACES Th e CO VID-19 p andemi c has t aken a n im mense toll on Amer icans' phy sical, m ental, and economic w ellbeing. I n response to these u n precedented ch allenges, Congre ss passed t he American Rescue Plan Act in Mar ch of 2 021. The A ct improves health ins uranc e aff ordability and ac cess by reducing t he am ount o f in come i ndividuals a re required to contr ibute to their he alth i nsurance p remiums and by eliminating t h e in come c ap of 4 00 percent of the feder al p overty level fo r premium as sistance e l igibility (also k nown as the \"s ubsidy cliff\"). Under t hese provisions, which r emain i n eff ect t hrough t he end o f 2022, m illions of A mericans h ave be en able t o access he alth insurance plans w ith low - or z ero-co st m onthly premiums, wh il e households over 400 percent of the federal poverty level became eligible for Marketplace subsidies for the first time. The Ce nt ers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have also taken steps to ensure that Americans have access to high -quality, affordable health insurance during the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency. From February 15, 2021, to August 15, 2021, CMS provided a COVID-19 Special Enrollment Period during which consumers could apply for and enroll in health insurance coverage through the Marketplaces. Over 2.8 million new consumers enrolled in health insurance plans during the COVID -19 Special Enrollment Period, while over 8 million existing consumers saw their premiums go down by an average of $67 per month as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act provisions. In add ition, CMS extended the 2022 annual Open Enrollment Period by one month, giving consumers from November 1, 2021, to January 15, 2022, to sign up for coverage through the Marketplaces. The 2022 Open Enrollment Period saw a record 14.5 million Americans enroll in health insurance, including 3 million who signed up for new coverage. With the more gen erous subsidies provided under the Act, consumers who signed up for health care coverage through the Federally Facilitated Marketplaces also saw their monthly premiums after subsidy decrease by 23 percent on average, from $144 in 2021 to $111 in 2022. CMS - Private Insurance 101CMS - Private Insurance The success of the 2021 COVID -19 Special Enrollment Period and the 2022 Open Enrollment Period is due in part to significant investments in consumer outreach and assistance, including over $90 million in funding for the Navigator program, an increase of more than $80 million from 2020. As a result of this increase in funding, Navigator awardee organizations were able to train and certify over 1,500 Navigators to help families and underserved communities understand their options and apply for coverage. The Ad ministration is committed to building on the successes of the past year to strengthen the Marketplaces and ensure that all Americans have access to high -quality, affordable health insurance. NO SURPRISE S ACT As of January 1, 2022, consumers have new patient billing protections when receiving out -of-network emergency services, out -of-network air ambulance services, and certain out-of-network services at in - network facilities. According to a report from the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, surprise medical bills are relatively common among privately insured patients and can average more than $1,200 for service s provided by anesthesiologists, $2,600 for surgical assistants, and $750 for childbirth . Accordingly, in implementing the No Surprises Act , the Administration issued a series of regulations to protect consumers covered by group and individual health insurance plans from surprise medical bills. HHS, along with the Departments of Labor and Treasury and the Office of Personnel Management , drafted and published rules and guidance to support implementation o f the No Surprises Act , including three interim final rules and one notice of proposed rulemaking. Under these regulations, patients are only responsible for their in- network cost -sharing , and final payment amount s for s ervices received are settled betwee n providers a nd insurers. Although so me s tates have enacted l aws to reduce o r el iminate s urprise m e dical billing, pr ior to t he No Sur prises Act, co mprehensive , nationwide co nsumer pro tections w ere no t available.

[$310 million in costs over 10 years] Prov ide Mandatory Funding for State Enforcement of Mental Health Parity Requirements Adequate enforcement is necessary to ensure that consumers actually benefit from the protections enshrined in law. This propo sal provides $125 million in mandatory funding over five years for grants to states to enforce mental health and substance use disorder parity requirements. Any funds not expended by states at the end of five fiscal years would remain available to the HHS Secretary to make additional mental health parity grants. [$125 million in costs over 10 years] Increase Access to Consumer Protections in Self - Insured Non- Federal Governmental Plans Under current law, self -insured state and local gover nment -sponsored health plans (also known as non-federal governmental plans) can opt out of several key provisions of the Public Health Service Act. These provisions require health plans to adhere to behavioral health parity rules, to cover hospital care after childbirth and breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, and to provide a coverage safety net if an employee's child takes a leave of absence fr om college for a serious illness or injury. This proposal eliminates the ability of self -insured non -federal governmental plans to opt out of these provisions, affording state and municipal employees the same consumer protections that apply to other emplo yees with private health insurance .

Two programs \u2014the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) Program and the Medicaid Integrity Program \u2014comprise the largest portion of federal government investment in healthcare program integrity. The FY 2023 b udget provides $2.5 billion in total mandatory and discretionary investmen ts for the HCFAC and Medicaid Integrity Programs. HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL PROGRAM The HCFAC Program, established in 1996, serve s as the primary federal investment that addresses healthcare fraud and abuse through a coordinated effort between the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). It provides both discretionary and mandatory funding to address the full spectrum of hea lthcare fraud and abuse interventions, including identifying and reducing improper payments, preventi on and detection, and investigation and prosecution of fraud . Discretionary Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control The budget requests $8 99 million in discr etionary HCFAC funding, $26 million above the FY 2022 enacted level . The budget assumes discretionary HCFAC spending will grow over the ten -year budget window and include s an allocation adjustment to be used pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act in the Congressional Budget Resolution . This additional investment is projected to total $6.6 billion over the ten-year budget window and yi eld $13.6 billion in 1 The Fiscal Year ( FY) 2022 column reflects enacted levels. 2 The FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023 mandatory base includes sequester reductions and the impacts of the Medicare sequestration suspension first enacted in the CARES Act, as appropriate. 3 Additional information on the Medicaid Integrity Program is included in the States Grants and Demonstrations chapter . Medicare and Med icaid baseline savings, returning more than double the investment. Of the $ 899 million, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS ) will receive $ 692.2 million, DOJ will receive $97.2 million, and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) will receive $ 109.6 million. Together CMS, DOJ, and HHS OIG will invest in innovative program integrity tools to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in a changing healthcare landscape. New advancements in predictive modeling and artificial intelligence will allow CMS to enhance existing efforts to reduce improper payments, prevent fraud, and target bad actors, while limiting burden. For example, CMS is exploring methods of using machine learning to conduct more rapid review of chart documentation to improve payment accuracy. A top priority for increased investment in this account is Medicare medical review. This involve s the collection and clinical review of medical records and related information to ensure that payment is made only for services that meet all Medicare coverage, coding, billing, and medical necessity requirements. CMS has a long -term goal to increase the percentage of fee-for-service claims subject to medical review, which currently stands at le ss than one-tenth of one percent , to one percent . Medicare program integrity activities, inclusive of medical review, yield a robust rate of return to th e Trust Funds of over $8 for every $1 spent based on a three -year rolling average. CMS will also increase data analytics and improper payment measurement work for the Marketplaces. Investment in oversight and law enforcement will allow HHS OIG and DOJ to combat complex healthcare fraud and stay ahead of criminals who are armed with 105CMS - Program Integrity increasingly sophisticated tools and technologies . In 2020, Health Care F raud Strike Force Teams harnessed the combined resources of f ederal, state, and local law enforcement entities to prosecute complex health care fraud cases involving the illegal presc ription, distribution, and diversion of opioids . Strike Force accomplishments included investi gating 405 defendants who allegedly billed health care programs and private insurers more than $4.7 billion ; obtaining 254 guilty pleas; and securing impr isonment for 254 sentenced defendants. HCFAC law enforcem ent partners will continue to support new methods and technologies to stay ahead of criminal actors who seek to harm taxpayers and patients. Mandatory Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control The Medicar e Part A Trust Fund provides over $1.4 billion in mandatory HCFAC resources for FY 2023 allocated to the Medicare Integrity Program and other HCFAC partners. This funding supports efforts across HHS, HHS OIG, DOJ, and the FBI to combat healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse. R eturn on Investment Program integrity spending is a proven cost -effective investment. Medicare Integrity Program improper payment efforts have consistently yielded savings of over $ 10 billion annually. The t hree -year rolling average return on investment for HCFAC law enforcement activities is $4.3 recovered for every $1 spent. In FY 2020 alone, these activities returned nearly $3.1 billion to the federal government or private individuals , including $ 2.1 billion to the Medicare Trust Funds and $ 128.2 million in federal Medicaid recoveries and audit disallowances to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. MEDICA ID INTEGRITY PROGRAM Using HCFAC as a model, the Deficit Reduct ion Act of 2005 established the Medicaid Integrity Program as the nation's first program integrity effort focused on Medicaid. The mandatory appropriation for the Medicaid Integrity Program adjusts annually for inflation and will total $ 91.4 million in FY 2023. States are the first response for combating fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid program, and the Medicaid Integrity Program plays an important role in supporting these efforts. Funded activities include reviews, audits, education activities, and technical support to states. The Medicaid Integrity Program works in coordination with Medicaid program integrity activities funded by the HCFAC Program. Combined with CMS program man agement and other accounts, Medica id program integrity funding improve s critical Medicaid systems support ing program integrit y. Continued investments in CMS program operations and in Medicaid program integrity will ensure CMS can continue to enhance transparency and will also fund critical updates to Medicaid information systems that support program integrity . The se updates include investments in the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System , which is the nation's first accessible repository of Medicaid claims and encounter data. 1062023 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS The FY 2023 budget includes a package o f program integrity le gislative p roposals, t hat s trengthen f iscal stewardship i n Medicare b y protecting b eneficiary safet y and reducing f raud, waste, and a buse i n Medicare .

Current Law 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Innovation Center Obligations1 700 766 756 -10 109Vision: A healthcare system that achieves equitable outcomes through high quality, affordable, person- centered care. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) tests innovative payment and service delivery models with the potential to improve the quality of care and re duce federal healthcare spend ing. The Innovation Center is integral to biparti san efforts to accelerate the move from a healthcare system that pays for volume to one that pays for value and encourages innovation. Congress appropriated $10 billion in 2011 , $10 billion in 2020, and an additional $10 billion in appropriations in every ten-year period thereafter (beginning in FY 2030) to support Innovation Center activities . INNOVATION CENTER OVERVIEW Paying for health and improved outcomes instead of high volume and low value care is the central premise of the Innovation Center's work. The emphasis is on the quality rather than the quantity of care. To date, the Innovation Center has launched more than 50 models , including Accountable Care Organization (ACO) models; episode -based payment models; disease specific payment models; primary care transformation models ; models focused on Medicaid, CHIP, and dually eligible populations; initiatives to accelerate development and testing of new payment and service delivery models; and initiatives to speed adoption of best practices. The Innovation Center also implement s demonstrations established directly by Congress. Model Evaluations and Results The Innovation Center uses independent evaluators to routinely and rigorously assess the impac t of each model on quality and expenditures. The evaluations include carefully selected comparison groups, wherever possible, or advanced statistical methods to determine model performance and success. Having a robust evaluation process allows the Innovation Center to determine , on an ongoing basis and at the end of the testing period , whether a model represent s a high- value investment of taxpayer dollars. The Innovation 1 Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 numbers are actuals. FY 2022 and FY 2023 are estimates. Center uses ongoing assessment s to improve model testing, making evaluation results public as they become available. Expanded Models Section 1115A of the Social Security Act provides the Secretary authority to expand through rulemaking the duration and scope of a model that is being tested , including nationwide implementation. To exercise this authority, the Secretary must determine if expansion would reduce spending without reducing quality of care or improve quality of care without increasing spending , and the Chief Actuary at CMS must certify that the expansion would reduce or would not result in any increase in net program spending . To date, the Innovation Center has certified four models for expansion . 1. The Pioneer ACO Model supported the coordinat ion of care for patients across care settings, improving continuity and reducingduplicative care and testing. CMS incorporated several successful elements of the model into Track 3 of the Medicare Shared Savings Program through notice and comment rulemak ing. 2. The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program helps prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes among pre - diabetic Medicare beneficiaries . Through the expanded model, suppliers deliver clinical interventions that seek to achieve at least five percent weight loss by participants. 3. The Medicare P rior Authorization Model for Repetitive, Scheduled Non -Emergent Ambulance Transport was certified for national expansion under the authority of the Medicare Access andCHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 . The model ensures that ambulance suppliers comply with applicable Medicare coverage, coding, andpayment rules before rendering services andsubmitting claims, thus improving the MedicareCMS - Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation improper payment rate. The model saved Medicare about $1 billion over five years while preserving quality of, and access to, care. 4. The Home Health Value- Based Purchasing Model has been expanded to all Medicare participating home health agencies in all 50 states , effective January 1, 2022 . Th e model tests higher payment incentives in nine states to improve quality of careand shift home health agencies from volume - t o value -based purchasing. The first three years of t he model prior to expansion re sulted in an average annual improvement of 4.6 p ercent in home health agencies' quality scores, as well as average annual savings of $141 millio n to Medicare. Be yond formal certification, the Innovation Center will prior itize impacts on health equity, person -centered care, and health system transf ormation - efforts which are aligned with CMS -wide goals. For example, accountable care models have contributed to the design of the Medicare Shared Savings Program , and CMS has proposed incorporating elements of the Financial Alignment Initiative into relationships between states and Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans . NEW AND PRIORITY INITIATIVES In designing and implementing models, the Innovation Center carefully consults with a diverse group of stakeholders, including patient advocates, clinicians, researchers, and innovators with direct experience in healthcare management and improvement, as we ll as with representatives of relevant federal and state agencies . The CMS Innovation Center's strategy for the future is organized around five objectives. These objectives will guide models a nd priorities, and progress on achieving goals for each objective will be measured to assess impact. 1. Drive Accountable Care. Increase the number of Medicare fee -for-service and Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with a provider that is accountab le for quality and total cost of care. 2. Advance Health Equity . Embed health equity in every aspect of CMS Innovation Center models and increase the focus on underserved populations. 1103. Support Innovation. Leverage a range of supports that enable integrated, person - centered care such as actionable, practice - specific data, technology, dissemination ofbest practices, peer -to-peer learning collaboratives, and payment flexibilities. 4. Address Affordability . Pursue strategies to address healthcare prices , affordability, and reduce unnecessary or duplicative care. 5. Partner to Achieve System Transformation.Align priorities and policies across CMS andaggressively engage payers, purchasers,providers, states and beneficiaries to improve quality, to achieve e quitable outcomes, and to reduce healthcare costs.

ACO Realizing Equity, A ccess, an d Community H ealth Model The Accountable Care Organization (ACO) R ealiz ing Equity, Access, and Community Health (REACH) Model (in its original design and called the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model through 2022) aims to improve quality of care and care coordination for beneficiaries in Medicare fee -for-service. The model tests approaches for providers to join together to assume responsibility for the quality and total cost of care of their patients and coordinate services across clinicians and settings. The redesigned model focuses on promoting health equity ; addressing healthcare disparities for underser ved communities ; continuing the momentum of provider -led organizations participating in risk -based models ; and protecting beneficiaries in the model w ith more participant vetting and monitoring. The model builds on les sons learned from initiatives involving Medicare ACOs , such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Next Generation ACO Model. The model began i n April 2021 with 53 participants and will run through 2026. CMS recently announced the permanent cancel lation of the related Geographic Direct Contracting Model . ADVANCIN G HEALTH EQUITY Research shows that certain underserved communities experience worse health outcomes and lower quality of care than the general population. To improve the quality of care and outcomes for all ty pes of Medicare beneficiaries, the Innovation Center has sought to refine existing models to systematically address health equity across the Center's entire portfolio . For example, the ACO REACH Model will test ways to address these health inequities by introducing five new policies to promote health equity starting in performance year 2023: Health Equity Plan Requirement ; Health Equity Benchmark Adjustment ; Health Equity Data Collection Requirement ; Nurse Practitioner Services Benefit Enhancement ; and Health Equity Questions in Application and Scoring for Health Equity Experience . These updates are expected to reduce disparities in health such that those with the greatest needs and least resources r eceive the care they need . Com m unity Health Access and Rural Transformation Model Ann ounced in August 2020, this multi- payer model will test whether upfront investments, predictable capitated payments, and operational and regulatory flexibilities will enable rural healthcare providers to improve access to high quality care while reducing healthcare costs. Rural providers may offer additional services, such as those that address social 111CMS - Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation CMS - Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation determinants of health, including food and housing. CMS is providing fu nding for rural communities to build systems of care through a Community Transformation Track , which will run from January 2023 through 2028. End-Sta ge Renal Disease Treatment Choices Model End- Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Treatment Choices Model tests incentives to encourage greater use of home dialysis and increase kidney transplant ation for Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD. CMS makes certain payment adjustments that encourage participating providers to ensure that ESRD beneficiaries have access to and receive education about their kidney disease treatment options. I n October 2021, CMS finalized changes to the model policies through the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System Final Rule . The changes aim to en courage dialysis facilities and healthcare providers to decrease disparities in rates of home dialysis and kidney transplant ation among patients with lower socioeconomic status, making the model one of the agency's first CMS Innovation Center models to dir ectly address health equity. The model runs from January 2021 - June 2027. SUPPORTING CARE INNOVATIONS Medicare Advantage Value -Based Insurance Design The Value -Based Insurance Design Model , which provides M edicare Advantage plans with additional flexibilities to alter their benefit packages, tests whether offering these flexibilities (including a hospice benefit component as well as rewards and incentives programs) increases the uptake of high value services , reduces costs, and improves quality outcomes . Consistent with the CMS Innovation Center Strategy Refresh, the model is continuing to evolve with an expanded focus on health equity that leverages the model' s benefit flexibilities . The model launched in 2017 and will run through 2024. ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY Part D Senior Savings Model The Part D S enior Savings Model is a five -year, voluntary model for both drug manufacturers and Part D plan sponsors that is testing a change to the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program to allow participating Part D sponsors, through eligible enhanced alternative plans, to offer a Part D benefit design that includes predictable copays in the deductible, initial coverage, and coverage gap phases. Under the m odel, Part D sponsors may offer supplemental benefits that apply after manufacturers provide a discounted price in the coverage gap for a broad range of insulins included in the m odel at a maximum copay of $35 each for a month's supply in the deductible, initial coverage, and coverage gap phases of the Part D benefit. The model launched in January 2021 and has 106 Part D sponsors, with over 2,100 prescription drug plans participating in 2022 , including both Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans and standalone Prescription Drug plans. Over 17 million beneficiaries are enr olled in prescription drug plans participating in the model, which represents an incr ease of over 3 million from 2021. The model will continue through December 31, 2025. PARTNERING TO ACHIEVE HEALTH SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION The CMS Innovation Center's vision for broad health system transformation is ambitious and requires collaboration with and actions by a wide range of stakeholders. In particular, states, Medicaid, private payers, and purchasers should be aligned to increase the number of providers participating in value -based payment models and to make their participation sustainable across payers. Achieving this vision requires working across CMS and beyond, taking a whole -of-government approach -and collaborating with states, employers, and health plans as well as with patients, caregivers, providers, and community organizations. Closer collaboration with beneficiaries, caregivers, and patient groups across the lifecycle of models from conceptualization to evaluation and potential model expansion will help ensure that existing and new models are meeting their needs. This will include a f ocus on opportunities to prospectively drive multi -payer alignment, especially with Medicaid programs, leveraging the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network's state based strategic initiatives during development of new models. 112CMS - Program Management Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: Program Management The following tables are in millions of dollars .

Including mandatory appropriations and user fees, total Program Management spending from all sources in FY 2023 is $7.1 billion. This request will enabl e CMS to effectively administer its programs a nd provide high quality customer service for over 150 million Americans covered by Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) , and the Federally Facilitate d Marketplaces . The budget invests in modernizing CMS 's core operations to keep pace with growing enrollment and responsibilities across CMS programs. The budget invests in initiatives to advance health equity, improv e quality, lower cost, provid e flexibility to states and local communities, and expand access . 1 The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 column reflects final levels, including required and permissive transfers and recissions, but does not include $500 million in COVID -19 supplemental resources from American Rescue Plan Act, which will be transferred to CDC .

Within Program Operations, the funding amount is unchanged. 4 The FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023 mandatory base includes sequester reductions, where applicable. 5 Includes collections of user fees charged to issuers in Federally facilitated Marketplaces, State -based Marketplaces on the Federal platform, and Risk Adjustment. CMS - Program Management BUDGET ACCOUNT SUMMARIES Program Operations The budget requests $ 3.0 billion for Program Operations, $1 22 million, or 4 percent above the FY 2022 enacted level, to fund essential payment, information technology, and outreach activities for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private insurance programs. Priority activities for FY 2023 include: Medicare Contractor Operations Approximately 3 1 percent, or $971 million, of the FY 2023 Program Operations request supports ongoing Medicare contractor operations, including claims processing systems and critical support functions . This funding includes processing nearly 1.3 billion Medicare Part A and B claims, enrolling providers and suppliers in the Medicare program, paying providers and suppliers, processing 2.5 million first level appeals, responding to 11.5 million inquiries from providers, and educating over one million providers about the program . Contractor operations support allows CMS to process claims quickly, accurately, and in compliance with the law. Medicare's claims processing systems have enabled Medicare to become one of the fastest, most reliable health insurance payers in the world. Medicare Appeals The budget includes $ 84 million to process approximately 200,000 second level appeals in a timely manner. CMS has actively support ed the Department's efforts to improve the Medicare appeals process at all levels , including pilots that i ncrease data consistency, reduce provider burden, and provide cost saving workload efficiencies for the contractors that process appeals. These efforts have helped reduce the backlog of pending third -level appeals by 93 percent in the last six years. Information Technology Systems and Support The budget includes $ 646 million for information technology systems to prioritize CMS cybersecurity investment and continue the multi -year effort to comply with system upgrade requirements across the entire information technology landscape. CMS remains committed to modernizing Medicare payment systems that allow flexible and improved data and system functionality for operations by CMS staff and Medicare Administrative Contractors. The b udget supports the agency's mission to protect the consumer health data of millions of Americans from outside threats, and continued improvements in efficiency and reliability for CMS, health providers, and beneficiaries. 114 CMS's Information Technology budget enhances data security, protect s consumer da ta, modernizes the agency's infra structure, and improves efficiency and reliability. Medicare Payment Systems Moderniza tion: CMS proces ses over 1.3 billion Medicare fee for service cla ims a year. Modernization effort s underway, such as cloud migra tion, are making the payment system more nimble and transparent. IT Security: CMS faces cybersecurity threats t o data daily. CMS successfully implemented Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation at the core data center and cont inues to prioritize security. In February 2022, CMS modernized all 10 of its institutional cla ims software modules that price prospective payment system claims. Cloud hosting and modern language programming allow CMS to respond quickly to cha nges in payment policy and avoid erroneous payments.Medicaid and CHIP O perations The b udget r equests $225 million, for adm inistrative activities t o improve the Medicaid and CHIP p rograms and s upport CMS oversight and other s tate s upport functions that e nhance Me dicaid o perations.

CMS is uniquely positioned to drive equity in the healthcare system and is committed to reducing health disparities through investments in heal th equity. The budget requests a $35 million new investment through the CMS Office of Minority Health to: buil d an analytic data environment for modeling disparity trends over time; add a focus on underserved populations to CMS's Coverage to Care insurance expansion initiative; engage stakeholders and launch health literacy initiatives; expand the Minority Research Grant Program; and systematical ly identify and resolve barriers to equity in each CMS program by offering ongoing technical assi stance. This investment would also fund a refresh of the CMS Rural Health Strategy and development of a Rural Stakeholder Insights Trend and Triage System to better identify and execute activities that address emerging needs of rural communi ties. Through this investment and other ongoing initiatives, CMS is working to eliminate avoidable differences in health outcomes experi enced by people who are disadvantaged or underserved, and provide the care and support that enrollees need to thrive.Modern ize CMS' s Operations to Meet the Needs of Future Benefi ciaries CMS 's operations strive to keep up with the changing needs of the population it serve s. As a result , the budget invests $20 million for CMS to implement activities to enhance or expand upon current access to coverage and services , as well as improve CMS's ability to collect and process data . This includes a project to design and implement pathways for an expanded array of mental health clinicians to participate in Medicare to support better access to mental health care . These data -driven investments will move CMS towards more equitable access to care across CMS populations. Federal Administration The FY 2023 b udget requests $895 million for CMS federal administrative costs , which is $ 123 million or 16 percent above FY 2022 enacted. Of this total, $ 838 million will support a direct , full-time staff level of 4,518, an increase of 288 FTEs above the FY 2022 enacted level . CMS reprogrammed $50 million into the Federal Administration account to sustain existing staffing levels in FY 2020 . Continued investment is needed in F ederal Administration to relieve ongoing funding pressure s stemming from rising payroll and benefit costs and increased beneficiary growth . Further more , CMS requires an 115 CMS - Program Management CMS - Program Management appropriate ly scaled workforce to support core Medicare, Medicaid, Marketplace, and CHIP operations, implement recently enacted legislation, and support covera ge expansion and access initiatives . Within the total Federal Administration request, CMS requests $ 22 million to support the agency's innovative Real Estate Consolidation project that will further reduce commercially leased office space and mov e employees back to renovated portions of CMS's headquarters building , yielding long-term cost savings of about $8 8 million by 2033. The request also includes $ 5 million for the CMS U.S. Digital Service team to support CMS's IT portfolio. Survey and Certification The budget requests $4 94 million for Survey and Certification, an increase of $ 97 million or 24 percent above FY 2022 enacted . This investment will strengthen health, quality , and safety oversight for approximately 67,000 participating Medicare or Medicaid provider facilities . Survey workload s and costs continue to increase due to factors such as a growing number of beneficiaries and surveyor wage growth, as well as an increase in serious complaints against facilities, which can lead to costly ongoing enforcement activities once a deficiency is identified . The COVID -19 pandemic has underscored the Survey and Certification program's critical oversight role for holding nursing homes and other facilities accountable to meet minimum infection control standard s and protect public health for beneficiaries in these facilities from COVID -19. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided a minimum of $100 million to Medicare Survey and Certification for infection control efforts prioritizing nursing home s. This supplemental funding helped State Survey Agencies conduct focused infection control surveys and respond to the backlog of high -level complaint survey result s, recert ifications , and other survey activities. Building on lessons learned during COVID -19, the budget invests in improving care in long -term care facilities and improving oversight of accrediting organizations . At the FY 2023 request level, CMS projects that s tates wi ll have the resources to fully complete surveys for all provider types, including complaint surveys, statutorily required surveys, and non-statutory surveys. This level of survey completion, which has not been projected since the submission of the FY 2017 President's Budget, would permit the program to provide oversight for the relevant facility types and is the first step in shifting from a reactive to proactive posture . Timely certification surveys help to promote quality and avoid preventable patient safety adverse event issues, avoid patient harm, and may result in less severe enforcement action over time if issues can be detected earlier and corrected with education and training, rather than reactively responding to comp laints . Furthermore , CMS will improve oversight of nursing facilities, including an overhaul of the special focus facility program to improve care more quickly for low-performing nursing homes . These changes that will make the sp ecial focus 116facility p rogram requirements tougher and more impactful. Approximately 93 percent of t he request s for Medicare Survey and Certification is performed by s tate survey agencies. Surveys can include mandated f ederal inspections of long- term care facilities (i.e., nursing homes), home health agencies, and hospices, as well as federal inspections of hospitals and other key facilities that occur on a non -mandated frequency interval . All facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must undergo certification when entering the program and on a regular basis thereafter, which generally includes an onsite survey . The budget will enable CMS to significantly improve survey frequency levels where there is not a statutorily required frequency , potentially preventing serious violations of safety standards and avoiding patient harm. In the Recertification Survey Frequency Table below, the survey frequencies are divided into timeframes for each provider type and show the amount of time to survey the entire population. In total, states will complete over 30,000 initial surveys and recertifications in FY 2023. The b udget requests two -year b udget a uthority for t he Medicare Survey a nd Certification program, w hich accommodates s tates w ith different f iscal years than the federal go vernment, a ssists state s with l ong- range staffing plans, and increases CM S administrative flexibilit y to reallocate f unding b etween s tates w hen appropriate . CROSSCUTTING SUMMARIES National M edicare E ducation P rogram The b udget funds t he National Me dicare E ducation P rogram a t $445 m illion, inc luding $ 30 6 million in di scretionary budget a uthority . CMS is committed to ensuring beneficiaries have access to the educational materials and tools needed to find accurate and up-to- date information on covera ge options and available benefits. As a designated federal High Impact Service Provider , this program will continue to drive customer experience improvements for M edicare beneficiaries by engaging in iterative consumer research , customer feedback surveys, and the application of human - centered design best practices . The bud get provides $ 274 million, including $165 million in b udget authority, to support the 1-800- MEDICARE call center s, which provide beneficiaries quick access to customer service representatives to answer questions about the Medicare program. The request will support an estimated 24 million calls with an estimated average -speed -to-answer of approximately three to five minutes. Beneficiaries can also use 1 -800-MEDICARE to report instances of possible fraud or abuse. The budget includes $ 68 million, including $ 38 million in budget authority , for beneficiary materials, the majority supporting the printing and distribution of 52 million copies of the Medicare & You Handbook . CMS is required to mail Medicare education materials to beneficiaries annually. Th e budget proposes a general provision that provides the Secretary with increased flexibility to determine how to most efficiently and effectively communicate Medicare benefits information included in the Medicare & You Handbook with beneficiaries, including, in some cases, through electronic mean s. Offering digital alternatives will improve the efficiency of CMS beneficiary education activities and give beneficiaries communication options that are standard in most industries and settings . Market places The budget requests $ 2.0 billion to operate t he Federally Facilitated Marketplace, of which $ 1.7 billion will be funded by Marketplace user fees and $300 million will be funded by other sources in CMS Program Management , including b udget authority . The Marketplaces allow individuals to compare health plan options, det e rmine eligibility for health insurance programs, obtain financial assistance with premiums, and facilitate enrollment. The Marketplaces are a 117 CMS - Program Ma nagement CMS - Program Management critical source of comprehensive private health coverage for over 14 million Ame ricans . During 2021, over 2.8 million consumers signed up for new health insurance coverage during a 6 -month Special Enrollment Period that was initiated as a response to the ongoing COVID -19 pandem ic, and 14.5 million signed up for health coverage during the 2022 open enrollment . The Administration worked with Marketplace plans to implement provisions of the American Rescue Plan to quickly provide expanded Marketplace benefits to consumers. With this newly expanded financial assistance, there were recor d-low premiums during 2022 Open Enrollment, where four out of five people could find a plan for $10 or less per month . For plan year 202 3, HHS is responsible for operating the Marketplace s in 30 states that elected not to establish one on their own . HHS is also partnering with three states to leverage certain f ederal platforms for activities such as enrollment. In addition, CMS oversees the annual certification process for over 400 issuers of Qualified Health Plans and stand -alone dental plans offered on the individual and small group markets. This budget supports that process through the development of operational guidance and technical assistance pertaining to certification requirements, including the certification of agents and brokers. T he budget also ensures that the Federal Marketplace has adequate funding to process enrollment applications through Healthcare.gov and calculate and make advanced payments of the premium tax credit to issuers. The budget continues support for an expanded Marketplace Open Enrollment Period that is now November 1 - January 15 , fully funds Navigator program s at $80 million per year for individualized assistance to consumers to apply for and enroll in coverage , and supports year -round outreach with a focus on underserved populations . CMS quadrupled the number of Navigators available to people who need a ssistance getting covered, bringing the total number of Navigators to more than 1,500. 2023 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS The Department proposes legislative changes to modernize and improve the efficiency of the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, and C HIP.Provide CMS Mandatory Funding to Implement Legislative Proposals This request includes $300 million in proposed mandatory funding to cover the costs associated with implementing the Department's proposed legislative changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. 118Administration for Children and Families - Overview Administration for Children a nd Families: Overview The following table is in millions of dollars .

The Administra tion for Children and Families (ACF) works in partnership with states, tribes, and communities to provide critical assistance to help ensure that foster c hildren, youth, families, and communities are resilient, safe, healthy, and economically secur e. The President's Fiscal Year (F Y) 2023 Budget requests $73.8 billion for ACF. 1 Column reflects final levels, including required and permissive transfers, but does not include $58.2 b illion in COVID- 19 supplemental resources. 2 The FY 2022 column reflects enacted levels, including required transfers, but does not include $ 609 m illion in COVID -19 supplemental resources, $100 million in funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , and $2.9 billion in funding from the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act. 3 The FY 2023 column excludes $100 million in funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 119Administration for Children and Families - Overview The President's Budget supports the HHS mission to promote and enhance the safety and well -being of all Americans, especially those most in need of human services. The Budget supports low -income and working families and promotes upward economic mobility t hrough programs such as Head Start, the Child Care and Development Fund, Child Support Enforcement, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. These programs promote economic independence, productivity, and well -being by helping parents enter the workforce, care for their children, and form strong social networks and family bonds. ACF's child welfare programs promote safety, well -being, and permanency through services to stabilize families and prevent child maltreatment, foster care when necessary , reunification, adoption, and support for youth transitioning to adulthood . The budget invests in children and their caregivers with a robust commitment to child welfare programs, strengthening prevention -focused outcomes, and promoting equity in the chi ld welfare system. It also supports America's promise to refugees and reflects a commitment to caring for unaccompanied children safely and humanely in alignment with child welfare best practice.

It also does not include $56.1 billion in COVID- 19 supplemental resources directly appropriated to ACF . 2 The FY 2022 Column reflects enacted levels, including required transfers, but does not include $100 million in fundin g from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and $2.9 billion in funding from the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act. 3 The FY 2023 c olumn excludes $100 million in funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act . 121Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary ACF Discretionary Budget Totals 20211 20222 2023 2023 Discretionary mission of the Administration for Children and Families is to foster health and well-being by providing federal leadership, partnership, and resources for the compassionate and effective delivery of human services. The Administration for Children and Families ( ACF) promotes the economic and social well- being of children and families by providing services through states, tribes, and local governments, as well as non - profit, faith -based, and community -based organizations. HHS's overarching goal is to provide necessary support to help Americans lead fulfilling, independent lives. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 President's Budget requests $33.3 billion for ACF programs, an increase of $871 million over FY 2022 e nacted. The budget supports high -quality early learning opportunities, provides more families with the support they need to remain safely together , and supports survivors of family violence . INVESTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD AND LEARNING Childhoo d lays the foundation for success later in life. Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of a child's development in the first five years of life. The Administration continues to emphasi ze invest ment s in programs that improve the health and development of young children while supporting their families. These programs support children's health and overall development by providing access to quality early childcare and learning opportunities critical to leading happy and successful lives. Head Start The budget requests $ 12. 2 billion\u2014 an increase of $1.2 billion over FY 2022 e nacted \u2014to promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool -aged children from low -income f amilies , which includes $950 million to expand access to high -quality early learning opportunities with $650 million directed toward investments in Early Head Start -Child Care Partnerships and funding a cost-of-living adjustment ($505 million). This funding supports the Head Start ; Early Head Start ; American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start ; and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs. Each program promotes the early learning and development, health, and family well -being of children from low -income families. With this investm ent, all of the Head Start programs will serve an estimated 839,064 children, an increase of 48,687 , through nearly 1,600 local agencies in states, territories , and tribes across the United States. Head Sta r t services are provided in a variety of settings to meet the needs of the communities and children they serve. Each program is operated through local providers , ranging from childcare centers and family childcare to the children's own home. Head Start programs also engage parents and famil ies to support family well- being and achieve goals such as housing stability, continued education, and financial security . As Head Start programs are local, the programs are able to provide holistic, culturally competent services to specific vulnerable populations . Nearly one -third of children enrolled in Head Start programs during the 2020 -2021 program year were dual language learners. American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start programs serve nearly 22,000 children, of which many are served in or near federally r ecognized American Indian reservations . These programs incorporate traditional and cultural practices when serving populations living within their service area. Similarly, Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, which provide s services to agricultural families and families that migrate to a number of geographic locations annually , is funded to serve nearly 27,000 children. Head Start strives to serve children in all communities. 4 The increase in FTEs does not correspond to the increase in Federal Administration as there are several proposals to increase the FTEs with program dollars. Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary The budget includes $42 million for supplemental administrative costs and evaluation to improve quality of services and demonstrate the Administration's commitment to early childhood outcomes . The Head Start Act raised standards for teacher qualifications in 2007. The standards required that half of the preschool teachers nationwide in center -based programs have a Bachelor of Arts or advance d degree in early childhood education. In FY 2021 , 72 percent of Head Start preschool teachers have a Bachelor of Arts or advance d degree. Data Source: 20 21 Head Start Program Information Report (PIR) . This graphic is inclusive of all teachers within Head Start programs. These charts do not include teachers currently enrolled in a degree program. Child Care and Development Block Grant T he budget provides $ 7.6 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion above FY 2022 enacted, in discretionary funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant . This program is the primary federal childcare program that supports low-income families with children under age 13 by providing access to affordable, high -quality care while parents and guardians work or participate in training or education activities . In FY 2019\u2014 the most recent year for which data is available \u2014over 1.4 million children from about 857,000 low -income families received a monthly childcare subsidy. The FY 2023 budget will serve an estimated 2 million children. Childcare is an essential service for working families. ACF's increased investment into the program will promote the healthy development and school success of low -income children by providing them with higher - quality early learning and afterschool experiences. The increased investment will expand the supply of affordable childcare for many families as well as provide crucial services in childcare deserts. The block grant also promo tes children's healthy development and learning by supporting childcare licensing, quality improvement systems to help programs meet higher standards, and training and education for childcare workers. The budget also proposes a new federal administration set-aside of half of a percent. This set -aside will fund salaries and benefits for federal staff to review grantee reports, conduct site visits, coordinat e with relevant stakeholders, award grants, and updat e reporting systems. The budget also provides tribes the authority to submit fingerprint background checks directly to the FBI. This proposal would streamline the hiring process and safety for children. In addition, the budget has a proposal to eliminate the work eligibility requirement for children entering foster care or youth experiencing homelessness. P reschool Dev elopment Grants T he budget provides $450 million for the Preschool Development Grant s Birth through Five, an increase of $160 million over FY 2022 enacted, to fund states' coordination of the early childhood education delivery models and funding streams that exist in each state's mixed delivery system serving children from birth 123Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary through age five. States must also use funds to identify activities that focus on maximizing parental choice and expanding parental knowledge and involvement. There are 25 states that received renewal grants using FY 2021 funds that are carried into FY 2022. Three more states will receive grants in April 2022 with FY 2021 funds carried into FY 2022. In total, 28 states will have received renew al Grant funding originating in FY 2021 . This investment empower s state governments to better leverage federal, state, and local early care and education investments to provide preschool s for three - and four -year -old children from low - and moderate - income families. These funds are designed to benefit low-income and disadvantaged children prior to entering kindergarten, or to improve the quality of local programs through the enhancement of early childhood systems. The program provides funds to grantees to develop childcare centers and home -based childcare providers, Head Start and Early Head Start, state pre -kindergarten, and home visiting service providers across the public, private , and faith -based sector to serve more child ren. This program is funded through HHS and jointly administered with the Department of Education. SERVING V ULNERABLE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACF supports the organizations and communities that work to reduce the risk of youth homelessness and domestic v iolence while strengthening families and preventing child abuse and neglect. ACF strives to address the needs of vulnerable children and families so they can live healthy, productive, violence -free lives. Runaway and Homeless Youth There are 4.2 million youth and young adults ages 13 to 25 who experienced a form of homelessness over a 12 - month period. 5 The budget includes $150 million for 688 programs across the country to provide comprehensive services to an estimated 39,876 homeless youth who are at heightened risk for 5 Morton, M.H., Dworsky, A., & Samuels, G.M. (2017). Missed opportunities: Youth homelessness in America. National estimates. Chicago, IL: Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago. exploitation, victimization, and other long -lasting, negative outcomes. ACF work s with homeless, runaway , and street youth to help them find stable housing and services. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program serves as the national leader for the provision of street outreach, emergency shelters, longer -term transitional living, and maternity group home programs to runaway and homeless youth. These s ervices are provided through the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program/Maternity Group Home Program, and the Street Outreach Program. These programs provide positive alternatives for youth and families to ensure their safety and offer them new opportunities. This budget includes proposals to reauthorize and revise the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act through 2025. In particular, the budget proposes to include \"emergency\" in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to reinforce that shelters are time limited help for youth to leave the street or an unsafe situation. The budget also proposes to a lign the Street Outreach Program's age of eligibility , persons less than 22 years old, with the Transitional Living Program. This budget requests to i ncrease the set-aside for fed eral administration to ensure emergency flexibilities for program grantees, site visits, coordination with relevant stakeholders, awarding grants, updating reporting systems, and salaries and benefits for federal staff . Promoting Child Welfare and Preventing Child Abuse HHS is committed to reducing child abuse and providing more families with the support they need to remain safely together. The budget requests $932 million for Child Welfare and Child Abuse Prevention programs in ACF, an increase of $199 million over FY 2022 e nacted. For child abuse prevention, ACF requests $257 million for grants to states, local government agencies, universities, and non -profit organizations, an increase of $60 million over the FY 2022 Enacted . This funding stren gthens states' abilities to investigate child abuse and neglect cases and develop continuums of preventive services focusing on positive family development. ACF also provides competitive research and demonstration grants to improve child outcomes by expanding the evidence base to focus on providing 124programs a nd services t hat are proven t o be effective in serving children and families. The budget r equests $ 446 million for child welfare activities, an increase o f $110 million over FY 2022 enacted. Within this t otal, A CF is inv esting $ 100 million in new c ompetitive gr ants for st ates and l ocalities to advance r eforms t hat would reduce t he overrepresentation of c hildren and families o f color in the child welfare s ystem a nd a ddress the d isparate exper iences an d outcomes o f these f amilies, in addition to providing m ore f amilies with the s upport they n eed to remain s afely together. There w ere over 400,000 children i n the f oster ca re system i n FY 2020. ACF supports at -risk f amilies to e nable children t o remain safely w ith their f amilies or t o safely r eunify with their families in a timely manner. For ch ildren w ho ca nnot remain safely with their f amilies, A CF assists states in remov ing unnecessary barriers to a doption a nd provides i ncentive awards t o states that increase t he adoption of children from their f oster c are p rograms. ACF is also r equestin g $106 millio n for Promoting Safe and Stable Families, including f or family preservation and support activities and assistance f or kin caregivers and $48 mi llion for education a nd training v ouchers to help f oster c are y outh transition t o adulthood a nd achieve i ndependence. Administration f or Native A mericans ACF's Administration f or N ative A mericans supports Native A merican communities by promoting economic development, capacity build ing, e ntrepreneurial activities, financial education, social services s upport, wellness, cultural and language pr eservation, and advocating f or im proved policies w ithin H HS and across the federal government. ACF serves all Native Americans, including f ederally r ecognize d tribes, American Indian and Alask a Native o rganizations, Native H awaiian organizations, and N ative p opulations throughout the P acific B asin (including American Samoa, G uam, a nd the Commonwealth of the N orthern Mariana Islands). ACF supports community -based projects designed to a chieve sh ort- and l ong-term community goals focused on i mprovement i n the w ell- being o f Native American ch ildren, youth, f amilies, and communities. The b udget i ncludes $ 62 million, an increase o f $4 million above FY 2022 e nacted. The budget also includes a proposal to update the N ative American Programs Act to promote self-s ufficiency, language and cultural preservation, and social and economic development of N ative American communities. Family Violence Prevention and Services ACF supports more than 1,600 organizations and communities that work to end domestic violence. The budget provides $ 519 million for Family Violence Prevention and Service Act Programs, which is the primary federal funding stream dedicated to the support of emergency shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children. The funding represents a n increase of $ 292 million over FY 2022 enacted for the base program's shelters and supportive services. This funding provides services to an estimated 1.3 million children and families to prevent family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence. This includes $250 million in cash assistance for domestic violence survivors and $30 million for the Safe Recovery Together demonstration grants. The demonstration grants will support families affected by domestic violence at the intersection of substance -use coercion, housing instability, and child welfare involvement. This demonstration project will help alleviate the problem that pregnant and parenting domestic violence survivors ca n face, especially high barriers to accessing services to address substance -use coercion. This total also includes $27 millio n for the National Domestic Violence Hotline , an increase of $1 2 million over FY 2022 enacted. The Hotline offers immediate crisis counseling, emotional support, safety planning, and resources. Highly trained advocates directly connect callers to local domestic violence shelters. Unaccompanied Children ACF provides care, protection, and support for unaccompanied migrant children apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or other law enforcement authorities. These children have different reasons for undertaking the long and dangerous journey to the United States. ACF provides care for these children and identifies suitable sponsors, usually parents or other relatives, to care for them while their immigration cases proceed. While in ACF's care, children receive physical and mental healthcare, education, and recreation services. ACF's goal is to provide care through a network of standard facilities, which are licensed and operated by grantees or contractors, under the close supervision of ACF staff. The COVID -19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of standard beds due to greater space required to prevent infection, lost staff time due to COVID, and the difficulty of retaining staff to work in congregate settings. COVID bed limitations and large 125 Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary numbers of children arriving at the S outhwest border led to the use of 19,000 influx and emergency intake beds in June of 2021. With decreases in the number of children coming to the border, ACF has since reduce d the number of influx and emergency intake beds by bringing standard beds back on -line and safely placing children with vetted sponsors more rapidly. The budget requests $4.9 billion for the unaccompanied children program. The discretionary request suppo rts ACF's efforts to scale up standard capacity to a target level of 16,000 beds by early in CY 2023 . To meet this target, ACF is working with CDC ensure COVID -19 guidelines are up to date, assisting grantees with staff recruitment and retention, and releasing funding opportunities to open new standard beds. The budget request also includes funding for the Office of Refugee Resettlement's ( ORR ) share of facilities co -operated by the Department of Homeland Security and HHS at locations along the Southwest border ; allows ORR to have in -reserve beds in Influx Care Facilities that can be made available quickly if referrals exceed available permanent capacity ; and funds critical programmatic reforms, such as improving case management , implementing policies and procedures that reduce the time it takes to unify children with their sponsors, and increasing legal services and post -release services for unaccompanied children. The budget also includes a mandatory contingency fund to address various areas of uncertainty in this program, including the need to activate influx beds in response to surges, and the potential that ACF will be unable to meet the 16,000 standard bed goal due to factors such as a new strain of COVID , new state policies , and a continuing tight labor market. The contingency fund structure and parameters are specifically designed to address these areas of uncertainty. The budget also includes a mandatory proposal to provide legal representation to all arriving unaccompanied children by FY 2027 . Unaccompanied children have the right to petition immigration authorities to remain in the United States , but this right lacks meaning without access to counsel . S ervices for Reunified Families T he budget requests the authority for ACF funds to be used for critical reunification services\u2014 including trauma -related and mental health services \u2014for families separated at the southwest border by the previous Administration. The budget also r equests the authority for this population to be treated as refugees for the purposes of public benefit eligibility, meaning they would be eligible for public benefits like Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and Supplemental Secur ity Income. R efugees and Other New Arrivals T hrough networks of nonprofits and state and local governments, ACF assists refugees and other eligible new arrivals to become self -supporting and integrate into life in the United States. Assistance includes financial support and medical services, English as a second language instruction, education, job training, case management, and counseling. In 2021, ACF played a key role in Operation Allies Welcome, a whole -of-government response to support vulnerable Afgh ans, including those who worked alongside the United States in Afghanistan for the past two decades, as they safely resettle in the United States. ACF assisted 68,000 Afghans in 2021 and will continue to provide support to Afghans in 2022 . The FY 2023 est imate of eligible new arrivals is 233,000, including up to 125,000 refugees and 108,000 other new arrivals eligible for refugee benefits , such as asylees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Special Immigrant Visa holders . The budget includes $860 million for transitional and medical services, sufficient to maintain benefits for the estimated number of new arrivals and to continue benefits for eligible FY 2022 arrivals. The budget also includes $500 million for Refugee Support Services , an increase of $ 193 million over FY 2022 enacted. This program provides services to address barriers to employment, such as social adjustment services, interpretation and translation, childcare, healthcare, and citizenship and naturalization services. V ictims of Traffi cking and Survivors of Torture T he budget includes $39 million to screen and identify trafficking victims and provide services, including case management, emergency assistance, and medical services to an estimated 3,500 trafficking victims. ACF's Nationa l Human Trafficking Hotline provides 24 - hour emergency counseling, referrals to services from a database of over 2,900 vetted social service programs, and tips to law enforcement on potential trafficking schemes. The budget also includes $27 million to provide rehabilitative, social, and legal services to survivors of torture and provide training for healthcare providers on treating the physical and psychological effects of torture. 126COMMUNITY S ERVICES P ROGRAMS Low I ncome H ome Energy Assistance P rogr am The Low I ncome Home Energy A ssistance P rogram (LIHEAP ) program h elps low -income ouseholds to access ho me e nergy and weatherization assistance, vital tools f or protecting v ulnerable f amilies' he alth in response to e xtreme w eathe r and climate change. States typically m ake p ayments to h ome energy vendors, s uch as public ut ilities, o n behalf o f eligible households . Preliminary da ta for F Y 2020 shows an estimated 5 .3 m illion h ouseholds r eceived h eating assistance . For t he typical household , this assistance offset 8 3.5 percent o f their a nnual heating co sts, compared t o 63.1 percent the previous y ear. As part of the J ustice40 pilo t, HHS plan s to inc rease efforts to prevent e nergy sh utoffs and i ncrease su pport f or households with y oung ch ildren a nd older people, households inc luding pe ople w ith dis abilities, and households with high e nergy burdens. Since th e Low Income Household Water A ssistance P rogram (LIHWAP) expires a t the end of 2023, the budget proposes to expand L IHEAP to a dvance the goals of both LIHEAP and LIHWAP. Specifically, t he b udget increases LIHEAP funding a nd g ives states the o ption t o use a p ortion o f their L IHEAP f unds to p rovide w ater bill assistance t o low-income h ouseholds. The b udget additionally inc reases the f ederal administrative set - aside i n order to str engthen grants m anagement, d ata collection, p rogram evaluation, i nformation sy stems, and outreach. The b udget r equests $4.0 billion, an increase of $175 million over FY 2022 en acted. Commun ity Services The budget includes $ 790 million for the Office of Community Services, which is an increase of $ 2 million over FY 2022 enacted. This total includes $754 million for the Community Services Block Grant, $ 12 million for the Rural Community Development Program, and $24 million for Community Economic Development. This block grant supports services for poverty reduction, including services to address employment, education, housing assistance, nutrition, energy, emergency services, health, and substance abuse . Over one thousand eligible entities receive block grant funds annually. In FY 2020 , preliminary data indicates approximately 9.5 million individuals were served. The budget also includes a proposal to update the Community Services Block Grant Authorization to focus on equity, accountability, and continuous quality improvement. The Rural Community Development program provides training and technical assistance to small, rural communities for the improvement of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Community Economic Development program award s grants to nonprofit communit y development corporations for the purposes of creating employm ent and business development opportunities for individuals with low incomes . Within this budget, there is $2 million for energy dependent communities to create good paying jobs that help to expand renewable energy efforts and address climate change. This investment will strengthen families and communities and improve living conditions. EVALUATION AND INNOVATION Research and Demonstration Program evaluation and use of data and evidence are critical for ACF and its partners to improve service delivery and increase program effectiveness. The budget includes approximately $50 million to fund new demonstrations of whole -family approaches to service delivery across the lifecycle of families' interaction with benefits programs. The demonstration pr ojects would center on coordinating and centralizing service access and delivery, with a special focus on projects that aim to reduce the impacts of and/or smooth the benefits cliffs that working families face as their incomes rise, resulting in the sudden reduction or elimination of financial benefits including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, childcare subsidies, Supplemental 127 Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary Administration for Children and Families - Discretionary Nutrition Assistance Program, housing, Medicaid, and other services. Disaster Human Services Case Management In the wake of natural disasters and as directed by the Federal Emergency Management Administration , the ACF Disaster Human Services Case Management program promotes resilience of vulnerable individuals, children, families, and communities impacted by disasters and pub lic health emergencies . The b udget invests an additional $ 6 million above FY 2022 enacted to provide a system of care capability that can coordinate and support affected states, tribes, or territories with disaster relief response and recovery . Additionally, the investment will enhance collaboration between ACF , the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness , and Response National Disaster Medical System, ensuring an effective continuum of care for disaster survivors. Federal Administrat ion Federal Administration funding pays for s taff and administrative expenses necessary to effectively administer ACF programs that promote the economic and social well- being of children and families. Examples of administrative expenses include program management , required oversight and monitoring, and the development and maintenance of secure information technology systems. The budget requests $234 million, an increase of $22 million above FY 2022 enacted. 128Administration for Children and Families - Mandatory Administration for Children and Families: Mandatory The following tables are in millions of dollars .

CHILD CARE ENTITLEMENT TO STATES The federal government helps families access and afford childcare through both the discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Child Care Entitlement to States. The b udget includes $3. 6 billion in budget authority for the Child Care Entitlement in FY 2023, which represents a $633 million permanent increase passed in the American Rescue Plan in FY 2021 . The program provides funding to states and tribes for childcare and requires states to spend at least 70 percent of funding on families receiving TANF, transitioning from TANF, or at risk of becoming eligible for TANF. In FY 2023, states must spend a minimum of nine percent of all childcare funds, including the Child Care and Development Block Grant , to improve the quality and availability of safe childcare for all families . Legislative Proposals Funding for Effective Administration, Operations , Oversight, and Accountability The budget includes an allocation of up to one half of one percent of the Child Care and Development Fund for resources to effectively administer the childcare Administration for Children and Families - Mandatory program . The funds will ensure that the Office of Child Care improves and maintains IT and data systems, effectively implements crucial childcare programs, and strengthen efforts to support recipients of Child Care and Development Fund grants. The proposal is bud get neutral. CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS The Child Support Enforcement Program is a joint federal, state, tribal, and local partnership, operating under Title IV -D of the Social Security Act. The budget includes $4.2 billio n in budget autho rity for the Office of Child Support Enforcement to operate the program . The program invests in ensuring children have the financial, emotional, and medical support needed to be healthy and successful. The program functions in 54 states and territories, and 6 1 tribes. The Child Support Enforcement Program ensures economic and emotional support for children from both parents by locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity, supporting access and visitation, and establishing and enforcing child support orders. The child support program collects more than $5 dollars in child support for every $1 dollar spent by the program , making it a high -value return on state and federal investment. The budget authority for Child Support Enforcement also provides funding for the Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response to continue to operate the Repatriation Program. The Repatriation Program provides temporary assistance to United States citizens and thei r dependents who return to the United States from a foreign country because of destitution or illness because of war, threat of war, invasion, or similar crisis. ACF works with the US Department of State to identify and aid these individuals. CHI LDREN'S RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Children's Research and Technical Assistance supports training and technical assistance to states on child support enforcement activities and the operation of the Federal Parent Locator System, which assists state child support agencies in locating noncust odial parents. The Federal Parent Locator System includes the National Directory of New Hires, a national database of wage and employment information . The budget includes $37 million in budget authority which, together with s tates' user fees for use of the Federal Parent Locator System , fund s operations, including program support contracts and interagency agreements, salaries and benefits of federal staff, and associated overhe ad costs of the Federal Parent Locator System. 130FOSTER CARE AND PERMANENCY Authorized under t itle IV -E of the Social Security Act, the Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, Guardianship Assistance, Prevention Services, and John H. Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood programs provide safety and permanency for children separated from their families ; support services to prevent child maltreatment and the need for foster care ; and supports to prepare older youth in foster care for adulthood. Funding primarily supports partial reimbursement to states for board and care and related administrative costs for eligible children in foster care ($6.3 billion in FY 2021) and partial reimbursement to states subsidies to support adoption and guardianship ($3.9 billion in FY 2021) . The program also includes the Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood, which assists youth in or formerly in foster care up to age 21 or 23, depending on the state (age 27 in FY 2020 and FY 2021) in obtaining education , employment, and life skills for independence and self -sufficiency and successful transition to adulthood (typically $143 million per year but $543 million in FY 2021 ); and the additional services provided under the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 (Family First Act) ($15 million in FY 2021 ). ACF's child w f quity, p r evention of child maltreatment, p ro gram i mprovement, a n d im prov ed outcomes for youth who e xperienced foster car e. Research h as shown that Black and American Indian/A laska Native c hildren are disproportionately inv olved at all stages in the c hild welfare s y stem re lative to t heir representation in t he U.S. population. Although t he tot al number o f children i n foster ca re is still high, pr eliminary d ata s how t hat the n umber decreased to 407 ,493 children in FY 2020, a d ecrease of 4.5 percent f rom F Y 2019 a nd the third co nsecutive annual decrease . The n umber o f children e ntering foster care in FY 2020 decreased to 216,838, a 14.1 percent decrease from FY 2019 . The number of children adopted with U.S. public child welfare agency involvement was 57,881 in FY 2020 . Increasing permanency for children through adoption, legal guardianship, kinship placement, or reunification is a high priority for ACF. At th e end of FY 2020, 117,450 children were waiting to be adopted, a 3.9 percent decrease from the FY 2019 figure of 122,216. Also in FY 2020, 20,010 youth exited foster care without a doption or permanent guardianship, a decrease of 2.2 percent relative to FY 2019. ACF supports national recruitment and public awareness campaigns and partnerships with states and private, public, and faith- based groups to help find permanent homes for children waiting to be adopted , especially older youth, sibling groups, and children and youth with disabilities. Family F irst Prevention Services Act The Family First Act provides partial federal reimbursement to states that opt to provide prevention services for children who are at risk of entering foster care, pregnant or parenting foster youth, and their parents or kin caregivers. Federal funding is available to all children who are defined by states as at risk of fo ster care entry, without regard to title IV -E income eligibility standards. The funds can support evidence -based in -home parent skill -based 131 Administration for Children and Families - Mandatory Administration for Children and Families - Mandatory programs, mental health and substance use treatment services, including services to address opioid misuse. Prevent ive services can substantially improve outcomes for children and families by providing funding to keep children safely with their families, and present an opportunity to shift the mindset of the child welfare system to prioritize keeping families safely together in their communities. The Family First Act restricted federal funding for congregate foster care \u2014often called group homes \u2014in favor of family foster homes. As of October 1, 2021, Title IV -E agencies may not claim federal reimbursement for new congre gate care placements lasting longer than 14 days , except in limited circumstances in which the child needs therapeutic residential services, justified through ongoing documentation and judicial review. ACF's Title IV -E Prevention Services Clearinghouse must review and evaluate the evidence base for each program consistent with statutory requirements . To date, ACF has determined that 48 of the 88 programs reviewed are eligible for federal funding and is continuing to rev iew additional programs. ACF estimates that 7,400 children were served by Title IV -E prevention services programs in FY 2021 , and 325,900 children will be served annually by FY 2032. Legislative Proposals Ex pand and Encourage Participation in Title IV -E Prevention Services and Kinship Navigator Programs To prevent child maltreatment and the need for foster c are, the budget maintains the 100 percent federal reimbursement for Family First Act Prevention Services through FY 2022 , and 90 percent reimbursement for each year thereafter through FY 2026 (rather than 50 percent as under current law) . Thereafter, the budget provides for the greater of 75 percent or the sta te's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate plus 10 percentage points , rather than the FMAP rate as under current law . The budget makes permanent the current policy requiring states to spend at least 50 percent for services with a Title IV -E Prevention Services Clearinghouse rati ng of \"supported \" or \"well -supported\" (rather than applying that spending requirement to programs meeting the \"well -supported\" practice criteria only ). In addition, the proposal allow s up to 15 percent of a state's 132Prevention S ervices f unding to b e spent o n emerging or developing services t hat do n ot currently m eet t he ratings criteria, b ut st ates must evaluate t he services and e ither modify o r cease u sing t itle IV -E funding if the evaluatio n shows the service to be ineffective. The budget als o inc reas es funding for t he Prevention Service s Clearinghouse and related e valuation a nd technical assistance to $ 10 million per y ear and allows for increase d tribal and cultural adaptations of approved p revention s ervices p rograms. This proposal costs $4 .9 billion over 1 0 years.

Title IV - E-eligible plac em ents in unrelated family foster home s would co ntinue to b e rei mbursed a t e ach state 's rates. This proposal c osts $1 .3 bill ion ov er 10 years. Reduce Re imbursement Rates for Foster Care Congregate Care Placements The budget reduces reimbursement rates for placements in Child Care Institutions and Qualified Residential Treatment Programs to five percentage points below ea ch state's FMAP rate. This proposal is estimated to reduce costs to title IV -E by $180 million over 10 years , although some costs may be shifted to Medicaid. Combined with the proposal to increase reimbursement rates for children placed with kin caregive rs, the budget aligns federal financing with child welfare research and best practices . Across more than 20 studies published over two decades, researchers found that youth in family foster care consistently fared better than youth in residential care on outcomes relating to both internalizing behaviors (such as depression) and externalizing behaviors (acting out). In addition, studies have found that youth in family foster care have better educational outcomes, and are much less likely to become delinquent than those who experience residential care. Studies comparing kinship care and non -kin family foster care similarly find better outcomes across a range of behavioral and developmental well- being measures among those in kinship care. Prevent and Combat Religious, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sex Discriminatio n in the Child Welfare System The budget amends title IV -E to prohibit title IV -E agencies and their contractors from discriminating against current or prospective foster or adoptive parents, or a child in foster care or being considered for adoption , on the basis of their religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex. The proposal includes financial penalties and mandatory corrective action for any state or contractor that delays, denies, or otherwise discourages individuals from being considered or serving as foster or adoptive parents based on the above categories. This proposal is budget neutral. Administration for Children and Families - Mandatory 133\"HHS is commi tted to protecting young Americans who are targeted because of their se xual orientation or gender identity and supporting their pare nts, caretakers, and famil ies\" -HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra Appropriate care for LGBTQI + individual s is a priority for HHS, including gender affirming care and patient privacy. In the child welfare system, children and youth who are LGBTQI+ are especially vul nerable and often underserved, at risk of exploitation and famil y rejection, and unable to access necessary and affirming medical care. Therefore, ACF has issued guidance to emphasi ze that all entities receiving fede ral title IV-B and title IV-E funds must comply with state plan requirements and all appli cable federal laws, and must consider and address the needs of children and youth. This includes making placements that support the whole of each chi ld and youth's well- being, and addressing needs that may be a result of their sexual orientation, ge nder identity, or gender expression. Youth aged 14 or older must be consul ted on various aspects of their case plans and provi ded with age-appropriate services, including se rvices that address LGBTQI + issues as needed. ACF encourages state title IV-B and IV-E age ncies to serve LGBTQI+ children and youth with se rvices and supports tail ored to their individual needs, including those related to se xual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.P ROMOTING SAFE A N D S T ABLE FAM ILIES T he mandatory Promoting S af e and Stable F am ilies program , currently f u nded a t $34 5 million in m andatory f unding per yea r, provides formula grants to st a te s and t r ibes for community -b ased services to s upport a nd p r eserve families , improve child safety a t home , su pport r eunificatio n of children in f o ster c are a nd support adoptive f a milies .

The Regional Partnership Grants program helps to Ad ministration f or Children a nd Fa milies - M andatory address this problem by supporting interagency collaboration and integration of programs to prevent the need for foster care and better serve children and families. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families account also includes the Personal Responsibility Education Program and Sexual Risk Avoidance Education, which were reauthorized through FY 2023 at $75 million per program per year in P.L. 116 -260. Legislative Proposals Reauthorize, Increase Funding for, and Amend Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program The budget increases the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program funding by $ 300 million per year , nearly doubling the program funding . Of this increase, $40 million per year goes to increase Regional Partnership Grants funding and $30 million per year to expand the Court Imp rovement Program . Fifty million dollars per year funds a new grant program for civil legal representation for issues such as housing, domestic violence, or employment matters for families involved in the child welfare system. The remaining $180 million per year increases funding for the base formula grant from $ 295 million to $ 475 million per year. The budget also adds kinship support services as an allowable PSSF spending category and requires that states report to HHS on their use of kinship diversions an alternative to foster care (\"hidden foster care\") , including the number of children in those settings and the support offered to children and caregivers. This proposal costs $3 billion over 10 years. REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE The budget proposes new mandatory funding for an Unaccompanied Children Contingency Fund for FYs 2023 -2025 with probabilistic outlays of $4.6 billion. The budget also proposes mandatory funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children, towards a goal of universal representation . This is estimated to cost $8.2 billion over ten years . See the Unaccompanied Children section of the ACF Discretionary chapter for program descriptions. SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT The Social Services Block Grant program provides flexible formula grants, based on each state's population relative to all other states, for the provision of social services. Services include adult protective services, special services to persons with disabilities, 134adoption services, c ase m anagement, health-related services, tr ansportation su pport, foster c are, su bstance abuse se rvices, h ome-delivered m eals, independent and transitional living, and employment-related services.

Other federal agencies.living is overwhe lmingly preferred, more cost-effective and leads to better health outcomes than living in institutions . Communities are stronger when eve ryone is included, valued, and able to contribute. ACL remains committed to making community living an option for every American, and this budget aligns with that commitment . Administration for Community Living ADVANCING EQUITY In 2019, nearly one in 10 people age s 65 and older, and almost 26 percent of adults with disabilities, lived below the federal poverty level \u2014and those rates are higher for people from underrepresented and underserved communities .7 8 ACL's programs embody the Department's commitment to advancing equity, as most programs are targeted to those in greatest social and economic need, with particular attention on people with disabilities and older adults who also are further marginalized due to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation , gender identity, poverty, language spoken, or other factors , and/or are at risk of institutionalization. HEALTHY AGING IN ACTION The nation is changing. America's older population is growing rapidly . By the year 2030 , all baby boomers will be between ages 65 and 84 , 9 and Americans age d 65 or older in the United States will represent a quarter of the population . By 2060, that population will increase to 95 million people , from 52 million in 2018. 10 This growth will increase the need for the programs ACL administers. Providin g Nutrition Assistance for Older Americans ACL's Congregate and Home -Delivered Nutrition Services programs prioritize older adults in greatest need, including those who are most frail- which now includes a larger proportion of the older adult population because of prolonged isolation and corresponding reduced access to routine health and 7Administration for Community Living. 2020 Profile of Older Americans (2021). 2020 Profile of Older Americans 8University of New Hampshire, Institute on Disability. 2020 Annual Report on People with Disabilities in America 9 Knickman, J.

Older Americans Benefit from Older Americans Act Nutrition Program wellness services during the pandemic. The nutrition programs provide access to healthy meals, promote better health behaviors, delay complications of chronic disease , and slow the decline that often leads to living in nursing homes and other facilities. In addition to daily nutrition, the programs provide a range of servi ces including nutrition screening, assessment, education, and counseling , as well as opportunities for social interaction. These services are part of a comprehensive and coordinated system designed to help older people stay active, healthy , and engaged in their communities . 11 The FY 2023 budget provides $1.3 billion for Senior Nutrition programs, an increase of $306 million above FY 2022 enacted , to sustain support for the increased need for these services . Home and Co mmunity -Based Supports The budget also includes $500 million for Home and Community -Based Supportive Services and $70 million for Native American Nutrition and Supportive Services, an increase of $135 million above FY 2022 enacted for both programs , to help older Americans, including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian elders, live independently and with dignity. These supports include personal assistance, day services, 140Administration for Community Living support ed employment, case management, caregiver supports, trans portation, home -delivered meals, assistive technology, and home modifications. With needs continuing to increase, continuous improvement in program efficiency and effectiveness is critical to sustainability. Following the successful model created in the Senior Nutrition programs, t he budget includes authority to use up to one percent of funds appropriated for Home and Community -Based Supportive Services for demonstration grants to develop and evaluate innovative approaches to service delivery. ACL anticipates testing innovations in transportation, modernization of senior centers, inter - generational programming, and access to technology. Preventive Health Services The incidence of chronic diseases such as arthritis, cancer, and diabetes in older adults is increasing as Americans live longer , and every year, falls cause three million emergency department visits. ACL's Preventive Health Services grants support programs proven to be effective at helping participants adopt healthy behaviors, improve their health status, and reduce their use of hospital services and emergency room visits. The budget provides an increase of $1 million above FY 2022 enacted to help meet rising needs. Protect ion of Vulnerable Older Adults Elder abuse and neglect rob older adults of their fundamental human rights and often their health and independence. Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, reports of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation suggested that at least 10 percent, or approximately five million older Americans, experience abuse each year, and many experience it in multiple forms. 12 A study conducted in 2020 estimated that the prevalence of elder maltreatment during the pandemic increased by an astounding 84 percent. 13 Research also shows that only about one in 23 cases of elder abuse , and one in 44 cases of financial exploitation, are ever reported14.

Caregiving in the United States 2020 16 U.S. Census. 2019 American Community Survey increases, addressing the problem of elder abuse, neglect , and exploitation is inc reasingly critical. To address this challenge, the budget provides $139 million to protect vulnerable older adults, an increase of $ 64 million above FY 2022 enacted . Of this increase, $5 9 million is needed to continue funding, at a basic level, for Adult Protective Services formula grants that were first funded in FY 2021 and FY 2022 with supplemental funding under the American Rescue Plan Act. Without this funding , this nascent progr am will terminate. Additional investments include $37 million to support the Long -Term Care Ombudsman program; $20 million for the Senior Medicare Patrol program to prevent Medicare fraud across the country; $5 million to prevent elder abuse and neglect; $4 million for elder rights support activitie s; and another $3 million to expand efforts to combat the opioid crisis. Together, these elder rights and elder justice programs provide a foundation and establish best practices for states, territ ories, and tribes to expand and improve the protection of individuals living in their communities and in long -term care settings. SUPPORT ING CAREGIVERS Families are the nation's primary provider of long- term care -in 2020, there were 53 million Americans assisting at least one adult . 15 In addition, o lder adults often provide care to younger family members. For example, about 1.1 million grandparents age d 60 and older were responsible for the basic needs of one or more children under age 18 living with them in 2019 . 16. Caring for a f amily member can be rewarding, but it also can be physically, financially, and emotionally challenging. The demands of caregiving can cause a decline in the caregiver's health, which in turn increases the risk of institutionalization for their loved one. ACL's services are effective in helping caregivers support their loved ones at home \u201479 percent of the caregiver program 's clients reported that its services 141Administration for Community Living enabled them to provide care longer than otherwise would have been possible. In FY 202 3, the budget provides $ 266 million, a n increase of $ 61 million above FY 2022 enacted , for the Family Caregivers and Native American Caregiver Support programs, and nearly double s funding , from $8 million to $14 million, for the Lifespan Respite Care program. These programs pr ovide more than 1.5 million caregivers counseling, training, respite care, and other coordinated service s to allow them to support their loved ones while maintaining their own health and well -being. The budget also allows ACL to continue to support the advisory councils established by the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage Family Caregivers Act and the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act. These councils are playing a vital role in federal efforts to develop effective models of family caregiving by strengthening support to family caregivers and improving coordination across federal government programs. Supporting Families Affected by Alzheimer 's Disease The effects of Alzheimer's disease are devastating for people living with the disease and their families. In 2020, 5.8 million individuals were living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States, and this number is projected to triple to 14 million peop le by 2060. 17 The budget includes $30 million for ACL's Alzheimer's Disease Program to fund the development of effective and coordinated service delivery and 17 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias . 2020. healthcare systems that are responsive to the needs of these individuals and their caregivers \u2014and which will be crucial to the nation's ability to meet the needs of this growing population. MAK ING COMMUNITY LIVING POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there are more than 61 million people with disabilities , and that number is growing. ACL programs provide direct services for people with disabilities across the lifespan and their families and support capacity -building, research, and systems change advocacy to ensure that people with disabi lities and their families have access to the services and supports they need to lead self -determined lives and fully participate in all facets of community life. Protection and Advocacy Programs ACL's four Protection and Advocacy programs ( focused on Deve lopmental Disabilities, Voting Access, Assistive Technology and Traumatic Brain Injury) together play a critical role in upholding the rights and protecting the safety and welfare of people with disabilities through a range of services, including both individual and systems advocacy; health and safety monitoring; investigating and addressing abuse and neglect; legal assistance to address a range of issues, such as equal access to employment, education and healthcare ; ensuring accessibility of public places and programs; helping people avoid -or leave -institutions to live in the community; and information and referral assistance to connect people with disabilities to other services and resources. At current resource levels, Protection and Advocacy program s are able to serve only those in most dire need, and many are being forced to focus their efforts on crisis issues, such as addressing abuse. Most can provide only very limited assistance with things like ensuring equal access to employment, transportation, and public places. To increase capacity of these programs, ACL is requesting an i ncrease of $26 million to provide $85 million in funding for these four programs . Independent Living ACL's Independent Living programs also play a critical role in protecting the rights of people with disabilities. The services they provide are key to ensuring that people with disabilities have equal access and opportunity to fully participate in their communities. 142Administration for Community Living The Inde pendent Living Services programs work to expand and improve independent living services in each state and territory. They are at the forefront of helping people move back to the community from nursing homes and other institutions. Run by people with disabilities, Centers for Independent Living provide a comprehensive range of services and supports including securing and sustaining employment, self- advocacy, access to transportation, and personal care assistance. The ling ering impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic include a continued surge in demand for independent 18 Ziegler -Graham K, MacKenzie EJ, Ephraim PL, Travison TG, Brookmeyer R.

People with disabilities have disproportionately experienced loss of employment an d decreased access to formal and informal services and supports used to help navigate unexpected life changes. The budget pro vides $160 million, an increase of $ 42 million above FY 2022 enacted, to support service area operations of 352 Centers for Independent Living and 56 State Councils for Independent Living. Limb Loss, Paralysis, and Traumatic Brain Injury There are 2.1 million people living with limb loss or limb difference in the United States and that is expected to increase to 3.6 million by 2050 . 18 In addition, about 5.4 million people live with paralysis , and more than 2.5 million emergency department visits due to traumatic brain injuries . 19 20 The budget provides funding to help support the needs of people living with these disabilities , as follows: $4 million for the Limb Loss Resource Center, $10 million for the Paralysis Resource Center , and $ 8 million for the Traumatic Brain Injury program (for non -Protection and Advocacy activities) . Improving Systems to Meet the Needs of People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilit ies The budget invests $ 160 million in three programs authorized by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to build the capacity of systems- within states and across the country -to support community living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities , an increase of $26 million above FY 2022 enacted. This includes $88 million for State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, $47 million for University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, and $25 million for Projects of National Significance. Together, these programs help state s develop and maintain coordinated system s of services and supports for people with intellectual and developmental disabilit ies. The programs also provide training, education, and advocacy to ensure accessibility of healthcare , education, transportation, recreation and 143Administration for Community Living other infrastructure systems and support innovation, research, and dissemination of best practices. Advancing Disability Research The National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research programs are aimed at improving outcomes of people with disabilities in the three interrelated domains \u2014community living and participation, health and function, and employment . The program's support for the development and dissemination of new knowledge , technological devices, and other informational products to enhance community living have resulte d in more than 1,200 products that may be used to enhance the community living opportunities for people with disabilities . 21 The budget provides $119 million for the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research to cont inue investments in the generation of new knowledge and to promote effective use of information to improve the functionality and quality of life for individuals living with a disability. CONSUMER INFORMATION, ACCESS, AND OUTREACH ACL's consumer informat ion, access, and outreach programs help older adults and people with disabilities make informed decisions and access appropriate supportive services. Aging and Disability Resource Centers Aging and Disability Resource Centers support state efforts to develop more efficient, cost -effective, and consumer -responsive systems of information and integrated access by creating no wrong door \"one -stop shop\" entry points into long- term care at the community -level. They deliver a range of services including advice, counseling, and assistance to empower people to make informed decisions about their long -term services and supports, which help to prevent people from opting to receive more costly institut ional care. The budget provides $ 12 million to support these efforts. State Health Insurance Assistance The budget provides $ 55 million for the State Health Insurance Assistance program , an increase of $ 2 million above FY 2022 enacted , to allow for the c ontinuation of individual grantee capacit y and the revision of program business processes to maintain/incorporate innovative technologies adopted during the COVID -19 pandemic. 21 Administration for Community Living.

Together with $50 million previously appropriated for Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act programs, these funds will support access to unbiased help for older adults and people with disabilities who are Medicare eligible or dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, their families, and caregivers. Most clients use these counselors every year because of the complexity of their situations, and the counseling can help to save them thousands of dollars per year. In 2020, an estimated 6 million Medicare beneficiaries used these services. C ounselors spent over 2.2 million hours of direct one -on-one services for nearly 2.4 million beneficiaries. Additionally, State Health Insurance Assistance Programs reached over 3.6 million people in educational events explaining Medicare and its benefits . Assistive Technology In addition to the increases for Assistive Technology Protection and Advocacy activities above , the FY 2023 budget for Assistive Technology includes $37 million to expand program capacity to support people with disabilities and their families to obtain a ssistive technology devices and services. In FY 2020, 37,512 people received a total of 53,258 refurbished devices from 53 assistive technology programs, at a much lower cost to the consumer -in total, program participants saved a total of $212 million. 22 I MPROVING EMERGENCY PLANNING AND DISASTER RESPONSE The pandemic illustrated the dire need to expand the capacity of the aging and disability networks to address the needs of older Americans and people with disabilities when a major disaster or public health emergency occurs. The budget includes $2 million each for one aging program, Aging Services Support Activities , and one disability program, Projects of National Significance , which will be merged to establish a single technical assistance center to support the aging and disability networks in: building partnerships with state and local public health and emergency management agencies; continuity of operations planning; ensuring the needs of people with disabilities and older adults are included in disaster planning and 144Administration for Community Living resp onse; identifyi ng other funding; ensuring equitable response; and more. B UILDING ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE Program Administration T he budget includes $57 million for program management and support activities, an increase of $15 million above FY 2022 enacted. This funding reflects the Department's continued focus on maintaining the infrastructure needed to properly administer programs and fulfill the agency's responsibilities. With the significant increases in responsibilities ACL has seen in recent years, requirements now exceed its current staff capacity and necessitate additional hiring . This investment will also allow ACL to take critical steps toward addressing other long-standing infrastructure gaps, including continued updates to IT systems to improv e security, accessibility , and usability, and to improve ACL's ability to effectively engage stakeholders. 145Office of the Secretary - General Department Management The Office of the Secretary : General Departmental Management The following table is in millions of dollars.

LEADING THE NATION'S PUBLIC HEALTH ENTERPRISE The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary administers and oversees the largest cabinet department in terms of budget. The HHS annual budget is over $ 1.77 trillion, accounts for almost one out of every four federal dollars, and provides more grant funding than all other federal agencies combined. The Secretary oversees HHS programs, policies , and operations to ensure effective stewardship of the Department 's resources to enhance and protect the health and well -being of every American. The HHS Office of the Secretary's administrative budget is less t han 0. 04 percent of the total $ 1.77 trillio n HHS budget . It funds leadership, policy, legal, and administrative functions that help support 11 staff divisions and provide management oversight for the Department as a whole. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 President's Budget requests a program level o f $665 million for General Departmental Management, a $94 million increase above FY 2022 enacted . The budget ensures health policy coordination and program integrity oversight across the Department ; invests in administrative and operational resources to bolster operations; and supports Administration priorities such as implementation of the President's Executive Orders on Health and Racial Equity , Climate Change, and others . PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY CO ORDINATION The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) makes up almost half of the General Departmental Management budget. OASH serves as the senior 1 This table does not include funding of Full -Time Equivalents for the Pregnancy Assistance Fund, allocation for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, or funding for the Phys ician -Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee created by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. advisor to the Secretary for public health, science , and medicine and coordinates public health policy and programs across the HHS Operating and Staff Divisions. Additionally, the Assistant Secretary for Health oversees the Office of the Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Ser vice Commissioned Corps (\"Corps \") and its newly established Ready Reserve. OASH oversees 11 core program offices , including the Office of Minority Health (OMH) and the Office on Women's Health (OWH) . These program offices lead policy coordination across the Department, the government, and with nongovernmental partners. This coordination enables the Department to address a diverse range of public health challenges, including key elements of the ongoing COVID -19 response, combatting the nation's opioid epidemic, and ending the HIV epidemic in Amer ica. OASH focuses on supplying information and tools that empower individuals, communities, and health systems to emphasize health promotion and disease prevention. TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION The budget includes $ 111 million to support community efforts t o reduce teen pregnancy. The program , implemented by the Office of Population Affairs within OASH, supports grants to replicate programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation. These investments help reduce teenage pregnancy and the behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy or other associated risk factors.

OFFICE OF SU RGEON GENERAL AND U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSIONED CORPS As the na tion's doctor, the Surgeon General provides Americans with the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury. The Surgeon General manages the daily operations of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (\"Corps\"), which consists of approximately 6,000 uniformed public health professionals who underpin the nation's response network for public health emergencies. Corps officers, including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, social workers, and engineers have supported the U.S. government's response to natural disasters and other public health disasters. Between FYs 2013 and 2021, Corps officers deployed 11,470 times contributing to 258,404 deployment days supporting 409 diff erent missions. Deployments included critical support from 2014 to 2015 for the West Africa Ebola outbreak; 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria where the Corps provided public health support to displaced families; and medical screenings and behavioral and primary care for unaccompanied children and families along the Office of the Secretary - General Department Management 147Office of the Secretary - General Department Management southwestern border in 2018 and 2021. As of February 10, 2022, t he COVID -19 pandemic has seen the highest historical deployment of officers to -date, with over 4,400 officer deployments, i n many instances with officers deploying multiple times, in support of COVID - 19. As part of reforming and improving the Corps, the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General implemented the Ready Reserve Corps to provide surge capacity for deployments in public health emergencies and backfill critical positions left vacant during regular Corps deployments . The Reserve Corps fulfills the urgent need to have additional Corps personnel available on short notice to respond to routine public health and emergency response missions. Additionally, the Public Health Emergency Response Strike T eam was established to complement the Ready Reserve as an additional Corps asset available for immediate deployment at the request of the President or the Secretary. Entirely dedicated to public health emergency response, the strike team includes full -time active -duty officers who are the first HHS representatives on the ground. The budget includes $20 million in the Public Health and Social Services Emerge ncy Fund to maintain and continue to operationalize COVID -19-related investments in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Ready Reserve, Public Health Emergency Response Strike Team , and Commissioned Corps readiness and training activities . Funding will ensure sufficient resources to maintain these programs that were stood up and initialized with the CARES Act. See the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund chapter for more details. PROGRAM INTEGRITY OVERSIGHT AND OTHER GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT The budget includes $ 18 million to allow the Office of the Secretary to ensure implementation of over 30 Executive Orders, including those on Health and Racial Equity. The budget includ es $5 million for Department -wide Electric Vehicle Fleet program; $6 million for Grants Quality Service Management Office , a government - wide storefront offering multiple solutions for technology and services in the Grants functional area ; and a total of $6 million in PHS evaluation funding for the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity , and President Biden's Executive Order on Health Equity . The budget also includes $ 253 million to support each of the 10 Staff Divisions supported by General Departmenta l Management in the Office of the Secretary ; investments in administrative and operational resources to ensure program integrity oversight; and increasing capacity of understaffed offices unable to meet the basic functions and legislative requirements due to years of reduced or level funding. The budget includes $79 million in additional evaluation funding to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of public health programs, including the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program , and fund t he Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Since FY 2012, HHS' s leadership structure has managed with fewer resources and staff but with growing responsibilities and vulnerabilities. The budget ensures that program integrity and leadership oversight are at the forefront of HHS's mission deliver y. 148Office of the Secretary - Medicare Hearings and Appeals Office of the Secretary : Medicare Hearings and Appeals Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals1,2 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Medicare Appeals Adjudication 172 162 -10 Full-Time Equivalents 1,117 958 832 -126 Departmental Appeals Board - 2021 2022 2023 2023 2022 Medicare Appeals Adjudication 24 34 +10 Full-Time Equivalents 111 132 193 +61 Budget Total 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Total, Medicare Hearings and Appeal Program Level 192 196 196 - Total, Medicare Hearings and Appeal Full -time Equivalent Program Level 1,228 1,090 1,025 +65 149 The Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) provides beneficiaries, providers, and suppliers an opportunity for a hearing on disputed Medicare claims. The Departmental Appeals Board for Medicare provides final administrative review of claims for Medicare entitlement, payment, and coverage at HHS . Medicare Hearings and Appeals is an account created by Con gr ess in FY 2020 to consolidate the costs of the adjudicative expenses associated with appeals of Medicare claims brought by beneficiaries and health 1 FY 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 funding levels for OMHA and DAB represent allocations from the overall appropriation and are subject to change based on actual incoming appeal receipt levels and statuses of appeal backlogs at each level. 2 Reflects appropriated funding levels and does not include any transfers or carryforward balances. care providers. The appeals process is overseen by administrative law and appeals judges at the Office of Office of the Secretary - Medicare Hearings and Appeals Medicare Hearings and Appeals and the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), respectively. Beginning in FY 2011, an aging population and unintended results from HHS's Medicare program integrity efforts led to a sign ificant increase in Medicare claims denials. This increase resulted in more appeals than OMHA and DAB could process within the 90 -day case adjudication time frame required by law. Despite best efforts, this resulted in a backlog of appeals pending adjudication at both OMHA and DAB. THE APPEALS BACKLOG While the Medicare appeals backlog remains significant, t he Department has taken a number of administrative actions to reduce the pending appeals workload, including alternative dispute resolution and multiple settlement actions. OMHA reduced the backlog of cases by 93 percent to approximately 60,062 appeals (from a high of nearly 900,000 in FY 2015) . DAB continues to build capacity as their caseload has remained over 18,000 since the end of FY 2020. DAB's caseload still represents a reduction in the backlog from a high of nearly 31,000 in FY 2017. OFFICE OF MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS OMHA administers the nationwide hearing process for appeals arising from Medicare coverage and payment claims for items and services furnished to beneficiaries. The FY 2023 President's Budget requests $1 62 million for OMHA, $10 million below the projected FY 2022 Enacted level, which is subject to change . FY 2023 will be a year of transition for OMHA as they return to pre - backlog annual appeals receipt levels. The budget will allow OMHA to support the number of full -time equivalent (FTE) staff necessary to manage the anticipated workload that allows them t o return to the 90-day statutorily adjudication timeframe .DEPARTMENTAL APPEALS BOARD The DA B Medicare Appeals Council provides a final administrative review of claims for entitlement to Medicare, individual claims for Medicare coverage, and claims for payment filed by beneficiaries or health care providers and suppliers at HHS . The FY 2023 President's Budget requests $34 million for DAB, $1 0 million above the FY 2022 enacted level . DAB's Medicare appeals adjudication costs have been funded out of the same appropriation as OMHA since FY 2020. The budget will allow DAB to continue to increase FTE to a level that supports reducing the balance of its pending appeals backlog. 150Office of the Secretary : Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technolog y Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology 20211 20222 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Total Discretionary Budget Authority 62 -- -- -62 Total PHS Evaluation Funds -- 64 104 +40 Total Program Level 62 64 104 +40 Full-Time Equivalents 180 180 180 - The mission of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology is t o improve the health and well- being of individuals and communities through the use of technology and health information that is accessible when and where it matters most The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) leads HHS' s efforts to ensure that electronic health information is available and can be shared safely and securely to improve the health and care of all Americans and their communities. ONC's work is pivotal to achieving interoperability, advancing patient access t o their electronic records, combating information blocking, and bringing innovative easy -to-use products into the hands of users. The budget supports ONC's responsibilities in the areas of policy development and coordination, and standards , certification, and interoperability . ONC advance s the development and use of health IT capabilities and moving toward an interoperable nationwide health IT infrastructure . The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget requests $104 million at the program level for ONC, an increase of $ 40 million above FY 2022 enacted. These resources will be provided through the Public Health Services Act Evaluation set -aside . POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND COORDINATION ONC develops and implement s health IT poli cies through open, transparent, and accountable processes and has a critical role in coordinating with f ederal, state, and local partners , along with the private sector, to support and protect innovation and competition in health IT . This coordination resu lts in new solutions and business models for better care and improved outcomes. 1The FY 2021 c olumn reflects f i nal level, i nc luding r equired and permissive transfers a nd recissions, but do es no t inc lude FY 2022 column reflects enacted levels. Office of the Secretary - Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT 151Office of the Secretary - Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT HHS continues to pursue an agenda that promotes innovation in healthcare built on widespread, interoperable health information. ONC play s a transformative role in moving towar ds transparency in healthcare through the agency's health IT coordination activities. The importance of coordination of health IT activities has dramatically increased in recent years as a growing number of partners seek to leverage electronic health records and other health IT capabilities. This coordination informs policy, ensures that policy is responsive to stakeholder needs, and promotes health IT capabilities that enable the secure, seamless transfer of health information when and where it is needed. The Health IT Advisory Committee (HITAC), ONC's Federal Advisory Committee , serves as a priority method for obtaining routine input from a group of 27 health IT experts and six federal representatives. The HITAC recommendations are informing HHS's response to the President 's Executive Order on Ensuring a Data -Driven Response to COVID -19 and Future High -Consequence Public Health Threats. From building on regulations that incentivized the digitization of medical data within electronic health record systems to supporting greater consumer engagement and transparency through technologies, ONC is essential to making health information available when and where it matters most. Promoting Trusted Exchange of Health Information The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement ( TEFCA ) is a set of foundational principles that established an advance d health IT infrastructure. This governing approach allows for different health information exchange s and networks to be able to share patients ' clinical information through a secure flow of data exchange. The FY 2023 budget further provides $39 million for ONC, an increase of $ 18 million above the FY 2022 enacted, to advance the implementation of the Common Agreement through the three -year Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Roadmap published at the beginning of 2022 . As the capabilities of the health IT market mature, this roadmap lays out how the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standard will become an established pa rt of the TEFCA -based exchange over time. Additional funding will contribute to the speed readiness, onboarding, and infrastructure activities related to the growth of stakeholder participation in the existing network -to-network exchange ecosystem . Funds will also support ONC in leverag ing the entirety of the TEFCA network . 21st Cent ury Cures Act Final Rule The patient is at the center of the 21st Century Cures Act. Putting patients in charge of their health records is a key piece of patient control in healthcare . Supporting access to information is key to empowering patients and a critical part of the patient -centeredness that is at the heart of value -based care. ONC's Cures Act F inal Rule increase s innovation and competition by fostering a standardized ecosystem of new and existing application programming interfaces to provide patients with more choices in their healthcare by making their healthcare information easily and readily available . The budget provide s ONC with the resources to address technical barriers and business practices that may impede the secure and app ropriate sharing of data and allow s ONC to continue promot ing transparency, working with stakeholders , and using modern computers, smartphones, and software to provide opportunities for the American public to regain visibility in the services and quality of healthcare. STANDARDS, CERTIFICATION , AND INTEROPERABILITY ONC 's standards and interoperability work advances the technical infrastructure necessary to support the appropriate and secure exchange of electronic health information and records to individual s, caregivers, and their clinicians leading to greater interoperability in healthcare. ONC will continue to play a critical role in transforming healthcare to be interoperable and more equitable. There is a wide range of activities that ONC implements to support standard s and certification, including administering the ONC Health IT Certification Program . This program is an important part of the health IT ecosystem and facilitat es improved health data interoperability for patient care and patient access. The budget includes $52 million for ONC's Standards, Certification, and I nteroperability work , an increase of $20 million above the FY 2022 enacted . ONC's certification work will focus on implementing rulemaking and invest ing in standards updates to 152increase interoperability and improve equity through health IT activities. The budget includes a legislative proposal to provide ONC with the authority to create an advisory process to issue opinions on information blocking practices . This will allow individuals or entities to request advisory opinions from ONC concerning whether the requestor's practice or proposed practice is considered \"information blocking\". All issued advisory opinions issued would be made publicly available and l egally binding . These advisory opinions could help reduce the challenges actors face in determining whether a particular practice constitutes information blocking. Additionally, underserved populations that disproportionately experience gaps in care due to inequities in care delivery and access, may particularly benefit from increased integration and coordination across the healthcare system. Information blocking practices by actors can exacerbate the challenges these populations face by preve nting crucial information sharing. Advancing Standards and Interoperability ONC will continue t o make i nvestments i n standards updates t o further interoperability efforts . The b udget provides $ 20 million to c ontinue the agency's work i n implementing s trategies to make h ealth information more readily av ailable t o pat ients and to f urther it s equity -by-design approach.

The investments will allow HHS to breakthrough inequity barriers and mitigate health disparities among the health IT community . These resourc es will enhance ONC's role as a leader and convener of the health IT community to identify and curate t he standards, implementation specifications, and common approaches to enable secure, equitable, and interoperable health IT systems. As the need to strengthen the American healthcare system grow s, ONC will provide technical leadership and coordination wit hin the health IT community to identify, evaluate, and influence the development of standards, implementation guidance, and best practices for standardizing and exchanging electronic health information. AGENCY WIDE SUPPORT The budget includes $13 million for ONC to provide executive, clinical, and scientific leadership to coordinate outreach between ONC and key federal stakeholders, allowing ONC to maximize its impact. ONC continues to implement workplace improvement initiatives to maintain t he agency's recent increases in employee engagement. F unding also maintains https://HealthIT.gov , which promotes federal health IT policy and ensures the agency is providing effective operations and management . 153Offi ce of the Secretary - Office of the National Coordinator for Health ITOffice of the Secretary - Office of Civil Rights Office of the Secretary : Office for Civil Rights Office for Civil Rights 2021 2022 2023 2023 +/- 2022 Discretionary Budget Authority 39 40 60 +21 Civil Monetary Settlement Funds 15 19 21 +2 Total, Program Level 54 59 81 +23 Full-Time Equivalents1 181 190 281 +91 The Office for Civil Rights is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' primary enforce ment and regulator y agency of civil rights and health information privacy and security. The U.S. De partment of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ensures : Individuals receiving services from HHS - conducted or HHS- funded programs are not subject to discrimination; and People can trust the privacy, security, and availability of their health information. The Fisc al Year (FY) 202 3 President's Budget requests $60 million for OCR. OCR will use $ 21 million in civil monetary settlement funds to support H ealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) enforcement activities. The budget supports OCR's role to protect access to and delivery of HHS services free from discrimination and secure patient privacy. Advancing equity is an Administration priority and at the core of the Department's mission to promote the health and well -being of all Americans. Vigorous enforcement of c ivil rights laws is central to the goal of achieving equity . The laws guarantee non - discrimination, equal access, and equal treatment to all who seek HHS services and programs. To carry out its functions, OCR investigates complaints, enforces the law , develops policy, promulgates regulations, and provides technical assistance and publi c education to ensure understanding of , and compliance with, non-discrimination and privacy laws . OCR works to help promote positive change throughout the nation's social service and healthcare systems to advance equity and accountability. 1 Includes Full -Time Equivalents supported at the Program Level. CIVIL RIGHTS The FY 2023 funding request will empower OCR to bolster its enforcement; policy; and education and outreach, in all non- discrimination areas that include race, color, national origin, disability, sex, age, and religion. The investment will advance equity and non - discriminatory protections across America. Further, OCR will continue to enforce conscience protections for health care providers as part of its civil rights activities. In continuing this work, OCR will work to ensure that all individuals have access to programs and services. To advance the Administration's priorities, OCR's budget includes a n $8 million increase to invest in additional staff and resources to allow OCR to address the backlog of complaint inventory. Since FY 2016, civil rights case receipts have increased by 252 percent and health information privacy and security receipts have increased by 51 percent . The additional staff will allow the opportunity for a full investigative process; the resources to initiate co mpliance reviews in the Administration's priority areas; and the ability to properly staff the regional offices to respond to the complaints in a timely and impactful way . Additional funding allows OCR to evaluate and further assess the impact of HHS 's policies and its regulatory role in health equity barriers for underserved populations . 154Office of the Secretary - Office of Civil Rights Advan cing Health Equity T he FY 2023 increases will allow OCR to advance the Executive Orders aimed at increasing equity in governmental programs and services by: Adding appropriate subject matter expertise to provide technical assistance review ofregulations ; Training for grantees; and Providing resources to the Department insupport of a whole -of-government approach to civil rights compliance which leads togreater protections for all seeking services across the country.

The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSS EF), within the Office of the Secretary, supports activities to protect the public and improve the nation's ability to prepare for, and respond to, public health threats and natural and man -made dis asters. The Fiscal Year (FY) 202 3 President's Budget includes $3.8 billion in discre tionary funds for the PHSSEF millio n above FY 2022 enacted , to prepare for future public health emergencies and build upon investment s made in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. The budget also includes a pandemic preparedness proposal supported by $40 billion in mandatory funding . Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE (ASPR) ASPR supports the nation's medical and public health preparedness for, response to, and recovery from disasters and public health emergencies. ASPR accomplishes its mission by stewarding the development of advanced medical countermeasures; partnering with cutting -edge biotechnology industry partners ; stockpiling vaccines, life -saving therapeutics and medical equipment ; collaborating with state s, local governments, tribes, and territories; and by providing operational leaders hip and policy development. ASPR has been a leader in the government's response to the COVID -19 pandemic and will sustain this leadership into FY 2023 , as the historic partnership between HHS and the Department of Defense , formerly known as Operation Warp Speed , has been transitioned fully into HHS as the HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element or H- CORE . The FY 2023 budget provides ASPR $3. 6 billion in discretionary funding , an increase of $ 483 million above FY 2022 enacted . This total include s $293 million in annual and no- year pandemic influenza funding. Funds will enable ASPR to build the capabilities necessary for the nation and organization to emerge from the COVID -19 pandemic restored and stronger. These investments will also enable ASP R to better prepare for the next public health emergency. The FY 2023 budget support s the rapid develop ment and manufacture of innovative vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics , the stockpiling of critical medical countermeasures, the modernization of influenza vaccines, and the preparation and training of disaster response teams. The budget also includes a pandemic preparedness proposal supported by mandatory funding totaling $ 40 billion for ASPR. P andemic Preparedness T he FY 2023 b udget makes transformative investments in pandemic preparedness and biodefense across HHS public health agencie s to enable an agile, coordinated, and comprehensive public health response to future threats and protect American lives, families, and the economy.

B iomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority T he Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies . BARDA partners with industry leaders to rapidly develop these 160important counter measures to keep Americans safe from emerging infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Supporting the transition of these products from stages of research through advanced development, BARDA als o assists medical product developers with technical and regulatory assistance, aiding them in completing clinical studies, obtaining safety and efficacy data, and manufacturing optimization. To date, BARDA has supported 61 products through FDA approval, l icensure , or clearance. BARDA s upports m any m edical p r oducts a nd tec hnologies to pr epare f or public he alth t hr eats. In response t o the ongoin g COVID -19 pandemic, B ARD A has s upported t he d evelopment a nd distribution o f a t otal of 100 diagnostics, t herape utics, vaccines, and othe r medical countermeasures. This robust portfolio of COVID -19 m edical countermeasure s was made possi ble because o f B ARDA's rapid exe cution of n ew pa rtnerships w ith p ublic and p rivate e nt ities and by leve raging e xisting par tnerships. The budget p rovides $82 8 million for B ARDA, an increase o f $83 million above FY 2022 enacted , to promote the ad vanced development of m edical countermeasures t o protect A mericans a nd respond to twenty-f irst century health security threats. The budget will sustain the efforts of BARDA's Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures to spur the innovation of diagnostics, prevention tools, and public health technologies, such as non -needle -based vaccine delivery methods. The increase will also support the Broad -Spectrum Antimicrobials Program to expand its portfolio of next generation antibacterial candidates. The budget also increases BARDA's ongoing work through the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator to support the advanced development of novel antibiotics by offering technical assistance and offsetting the high research and development costs of new drugs. Further, the FY 2023 budget will expand funding for vaccines and therapeutics for Marburg and Sudan viruses, as well as next generation smallpox drugs. Projec t BioShield Project BioShield is a program within BARDA that builds a pipeline of medical products , which prevent and treat illnesses and injuries caused by chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Project BioShield funds the late -stage development and procurement of medical countermeasures , such as vaccines and treatments for anthrax, smallpox, antibiotic -resistant microbes, botulism, and radiological and nuclear injury. Since it began, Project BioShield has invested in 29 unique medical countermeasures and delivered 20 of these to the Strategic Nat ional Stockpile. The budget provides $770 million to Project BioShield for FY 2023 . Project BioShield's ongoing work will support the advanced development or procurement of up to six new medical countermeasures by the end of 2023. Under the FY 2023 budget, Project BioShield will continue to develop or procure therapeutics for Sudan and Marburg Viruses, a second smallpox antiviral drug , a smallpox vaccine, and treatments for chemical injuries, while procuring new antibacterial drugs, a new treatment for radiation exposure, and new formulations of the currently stockpiled smallpox antiviral drugs. Strategic National Stockpile The Strategic National Stockpile is a reserve of pharmaceuticals, critical medical supplies, Federal Medical St ations, and medical equipment that stands ready for rapid deployment in the case of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats. Strategic National Stockpile products go into action during public health emergencies to supplement the critical me dical supplies of states, territories, and localities. 161 Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund In the spring of 2020, recognizing the challenges the Strategic National Stockpile faced at the beginning of the COVID -19 response, ASPR initiated modernization efforts to ensure it is prepared for any future public health emergency, bolster the U.S. industrial base, and reduce America's reliance on foreign suppliers and manufacturers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Stockpile has deployed over 404 Trucks and 100 flights moving more than 1300 tons of materiel in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, including almost 8,000 ventilators to 56 states, territories, tribal nations, and cities. The budget provides $975 million to the Strategic National Stockpile, an increase of $ 130 million over FY 2022 enacted. Resources would support the procurement products transitioning from BARDA that lack a significant commercial market including a bandage which could be used to treat an addition al 14,000 people in respons e to a radiological or nuclear attack, and a smallpox antiviral to treat an estimated 350,000 people during a smallpox incident . The FY 2023 budget also expand s the Stockpile's capacity and infrastructure, support COVID -19 sustainment needs, maintenance warehouses, and address pandemic stockpiling gaps for influenza antivirals, antibiotics, and medical supplies. Additionally, the budget will support the Stockpile in its continued modernization and operational realignment efforts. These funds are crit ical to ensure SNS assets are available and ready for use to protect America from twenty -first century health security threats. Hospi tal Preparedness Program The Hospital Preparedness Program provides leadership and funding to hospitals and healthcare facilities to prepare them for responses to large -scale emergencies and disasters. As the primary source of federal funding for healthcare system preparedness and response, the Hospital Preparedn ess Program partners with state and local health departments to develop coalitions of heath care facilities that collaborate to prepare for large scale emergencies. By incentivizing preparedness, the program ensures healthcare facilities have the equipmen t, supplies, real - time information, communication systems, and education and training they need to respond to wide - scale emergencies. Using infusions of COVID -19 supplemental funding, the program conducted a host of activities to support pandemic preparedness and response. These activities included expanding the National Special Pathogen System, developing platforms for knowledge sharing among clinical practitioners, supporting sustainment of America's blood supply, and standing up the National Emergency Tele -Critical Care Network. The budget provides $292 million to the Hospital Preparedness Program. The FY 2023 budget will continue to support fund ing for the program's cooperative agreement recipients . This funding amount meets and sustains the prog ram's cooperative agreements and capabilities developed during the COVID -19 response ; supports increased coordination activities ; and effectively maintains response and recovery efforts. The program supported a broad spectrum of stakeholders throughout the COVID -19 response and various concurrent events, including west coast wildfires, cyberattacks, and annual hurricane and tornado seasons. In FY 2023 and beyond, ASPR will use funds to effectively m aintain and strategically serve an expanded recipient pool of healthcare partners who continue to respond to and recover from surges created by COVID -19 and other incidents. National Disaster Medical System The National Disaster Medical System provides personnel, equipment, supplies, and a system of partner hospitals t hat work with state and local personnel to provide healthcare after natural or man- made disasters. As part of the National Disaster Medical System, trained healthcare professionals take actio n and provide care during disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, or pandemics. During a disaster, National Disaster Medical System team members staff medical shelters, augment local hospital staff, conduct mortuary operations, and provide, trauma, criti cal, and emergency care. Teams are made up of doctors, 162nurses, pa ramedics, pha rmacists, lo gistics s pecialists, and information technology s pecialists.

ASPR s u pports t he M edical Reserve C orps n etwork by p r oviding technical assi stance, coordination, c om munications, po licy development, contract o versight, t raining, a nd other se rvices. Since the beginning o f 20 20, the number o f v olunteers has grown from roughly 1 75,000 t o approximately 300,000 Medical Reserve C orp units. During t he 12 -month period e nding June 3 0, 20 21, Medical Reserve C orps units contributed over 2.5 million v olunteer h ours. The b udget i n cludes $6 million for the Medical Reserve Corps, which is flat compared with FY 2022 enacted . This funding builds on the American Rescue Plan supplemental funding to support overarching national and regional coordination and technical assistance to Medical Reserve Corps unit leaders during this time of major growth in volunteering hours for the program. Prepare dness and Response Innovation ASPR's Preparedness will enter its third fiscal year in FY 2023 and continues its work to develop innovative products that go beyond responding to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures. This program places emphasis on advancements in health security products, technologies, and solutions that invigorate operations and response activities, including artificial intelligence, biofeedback sensors, monitoring devices, and data analysis tools. The Preparedness and Response Innovation program is funded at $2 million in FY 2023, flat compared with FY 2022 enacted. Policy and Planning ASPR develop s, evaluates, and implements the policies and plans that save lives and protects the U.S. from twenty -first century threats. The FY 2023 budget includes $21 million for Policy and Planning, an increase of $7 million over FY 2022 enacted . This increase in funds will help support efforts to coordinate preparedness activities , develop COVID policies, and establish quantitative and economics analytics and modeling capabilities, which will enable even more effective and efficient use of resources in the future. This new capability to systematically prioritize across programs will help ASPR effectively harmonize its many preparedness and response activities. As in the past, ASPR will continue to contribute to important strategic and planning activities, such as the National Health Security Strategy . HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element The historic partnership between HHS and the Department of Defense that resulted in the lifesaving COVID -19 therapeutics and vaccines formally ended at the end of 2021. The operations of this partnership, known previously as Operation Warp Speed and then as the Countermeasures Acceleration Group, will now be institutionalized within ASPR and be known as the HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element or H-CORE . H-CORE will continue to lead the whole -of- government response to the COVID -19 pandemic. An important lesson learned from the COVID -19 pandemic response is the need for a permanent, 163 Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund nimble, organizing entity to ensure the synchronization of the Government's medical countermeasure efforts. In the future, H -CORE's capabilities can be refocused on non -COVID -19 priorities as needed . The FY 2023 budget includes $133 million in new funding for H - CORE to address this need. In FY 2023, funding will be used to coordinate and implement the development, production , and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines , antivirals, and other therapeutics. Further, this funding will support staffing, acquisition support, and data analytics for COIVD -19 countermeasures, ensuring that emergency operations may continue in the face of the ongoing pandemic. This investment is a recognition of the applicability of H -CORE's role and responsibilities to future emergency response efforts beyond the pandemic and helps build an enduring response infrastructure at ASPR that does not rely on supplemental funding. PANDEMIC INFLUENZA The budget provides a total of $3 00 million for pandemic influenza preparedness and response, an increase of $ 82 million over FY 2022 enacted to support development of next -generation antivirals, rapid diagnostic assays, and accelerated development and production of influenza vaccine both domestically and worldwide. The Pandemic Influenza program is carried out by ASPR and the Office of Global Affairs in HHS. Pandemic influenza is a constant global threat, as influenza viruses continue to mutate, evolve and spread. Funding will also support manufacturing capacity for non -egg- based flu vaccine technology and the development of a needleless flu vaccine delivery method. These new technologies allow for more flexible and rapid development of vaccines, as well as a more rapid rollout of large -scale vaccinations, both of which will save lives. As HHS works to respond to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, it must continue to prepare for potentially highly severe strains of influenza. The COVID -19 pandemic has shown the importance of using therapeutics and diagnostics in addition to vaccines and other preventative methods during a pandemic response . The budget will continue to support the development and scaling of these products, all of which lead to faster and better treatment of influenza infections. OFFICE OF NATIONAL SECURITY The budget provides $9 million for the Office of National Security, an increase of $473,000 over FY 2022 enacted.

The Office of National S ecurity is responsible for the safeguarding of all classified information, equipment, and facilities across the Department and is HHS's Federal Intelligence Coordination Office a nd the Secretary's Senior Intelligence Official. CYBERSECURITY The FY 2023 budget provides $161 million for the HHS cybersecurity program in the Office of the Chief Information Officer, an increase of $ 90 million, of which $50 million will support the implementation of Executive Order 14028 , specifically focusing on zero trust implementation and security logging requirements. Funding will be prioritized for investments in specific capabilities that protect and defend its most sensitive systems and information, including those designated as high -value assets and national security systems. A total of $0.5 million will go towards standin g up a Supply Chain Risk Management program. The remaining increase includes resources for heightening the security of the D epartment's internet infrastructure, and for enterprise -wide security technologies that provide encryption services, malware protection, and data loss prevention.
