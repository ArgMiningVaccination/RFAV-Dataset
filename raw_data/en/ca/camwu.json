An acupuncture treatment involves inserting very thin, sterile needles at precise points on the body. This stimulates the nervous system to release natural chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord and brain. This can change the experience of pain and/or trigger the release or hormones that influence the body's own internal regulatory system.
