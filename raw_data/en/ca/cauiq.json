Working together to flourish together. 2020 was a year that presented challenges for all Americans, including those of us in Alameda County. We entered the year under continued drought conditions. Ranchers and others depending on rural water availability and forage grasses pulled together as the lack of feed, compounded with wells and springs going dry led to increased costs for purchasing supplemental feed, and hauling water. Many were forced to sell their livestock during a time when prices were low. Family ranchers are no stranger to hardship, and working together, they planned for the uncertain future. As the global COVID-19 pandemic began to affect our lives, we all experienced the impacts of social distancing, and supply shortages. Many, for the first time in their lives, were awakened to the reality of food supply uncertainties. Renewed interest in home gardening, amateur beekeeping and reliance on locally sourced foods grew, as communities banded together to take care of each other during these unforgiving times. Through all this, essential workers kept at their jobs. First responders, agriculturalists, food stores, hospitals and others adapted to new requirements to maintain their safety as they maintained ours. Vaccination teams sprung up around the State as communities stepped up to protect themselves and others from infection, hoping for a quick end to this global crisis. The SCU Lightning Complex fires were the next complication to face agriculturalists in Alameda and surrounding Counties. As rangelands burned so did wildlife, livestock and infrastructure. Soil was blackened, water ponds essential for wildlife and livestock alike were turned unusable. Again, Alameda County residents began to work alongside County, State and Federal partners to rebuild. Alameda County residents can be proud of how we all worked together to adapt and overcome the challenges of 2020. Through it all, we can join together to revel in the wonderful, community-based, flourishing lifestyle we have here in Alameda County. *Cover picture: SCU Lighting Complex fire near San Antonio Reservior.

Because many of these industries require an implicit promise of accuracy in a transaction, the Weights and Measures inspectors of Alameda County also stayed at work. In a year transformed in many ways by our interaction with the virus, Weights and Measures ensured that people continued to pump gas from verified dispensers, buy their groceries over accurate scales, and paid fair prices for their goods. Because a state of emergency was declared, price gouging protection laws came into effect, stipulating the maximum amount a price can be raised. During early days of panic buying, bad actors often raised their prices by more than 50%. Subsequent inspections by Weights and Measures led to price corrections, and in one particularly egregious case of price gouging, a referral to the Alameda County District Attorney for further prosecution. As decreasing COVID-19 case rates and increasing vaccination begin to allow us to return to normalcy, Alameda County Weights and Measures inspectors look forward to continuing their mission of protecting the marketplace and ensuring the public can participate in our reopened economy with confidence.Weights and Measures during COVID-197 Apiary Beekeepers faced many challenges in 2020. Beekeepers with colonies staged in rural parts of the county were impacted by the encroaching SCU Lightning Complex fires and smoky conditions. Many were unable to access their rural apiaries to manage and supplement their colonies with food and water. Stressed colonies also produced significantly less honey due to the harsh conditions and loss of water and forage sources. With COVID-19 restrictions keeping many folks at home, newfound interest in urban farming and self-sufficiency resulted in an uptick in beekeeping hobbyists. As a result, these new urban farmers gained a new awareness in maintaining the health and vitality of honeybees and their importance as pollinators and honey producers. Members of the Alameda County Beekeepers Association and others used technology, such as Zoom hosted meetings, to educate and support their members.

Some nurseries lost significant income to the difficulties of COVID-19, related shut down, social distancing restrictions and supply chain issues. Even with all these obstacles many nurseries found new ways to thrive. An increase in sales above normal numbers reflects an increased interest in gardening and plant care. Sheltering in place offered time for people to pursue gardening activities and fostered their curiosity in plant care. Social media encouraged the growing of house plants, refreshing landscaping and planting your own food as people shared how plants were helping them cope, enjoy nature, and save money. For those without outdoor spaces, house plants brought the natural world inside and boosted morale by providing beauty and an opportunity to learn plant care basics. 2020 was a year filled with yardwork that is often at the bottom of the to-do list. Growing fruits and vegetables at home had a resurgence similar to earlier times of conflict when victory gardens thrived. Gardening provided outdoor lessons for children learning from home and gave people newfound self- sufficiency. Community members looked to nurseries to help get them through tough times by providing plants and supplies. Nurseries tackled obstacles to bring people joy. With the ability to sell online, via email or over the phone, they continued to conduct business in a world of social distancing and contactless transactions. These sales were coupled with home deliveries, and curbside pickup. A few nurseries limited hours and capacity to allow for in person transactions, which provided places for people to have face to face interactions that were outdoor and at safe distances. Throughout the turmoil of 2020 the nurseries in Alameda County showed determination and flexibility. Community engrossment in plants will hopefully endure and multiply in 2021 and beyond. Nurseries will likely continue using these new business models far into the future. 8 LIVESTOCK & POULTRY ITEM YEAR # OF HEAD TOTAL WEIGHT UNIT PER UNIT TOTAL Cattle & Calves2020 14,012 Livestock & Poultry Products2020 Includes sheep, goats, pigs, bee pollination & apiary products. $520,000 2019 $618,000 Total2020 $12,703,000 2019 $12,427,000Livestock Industry Alameda County's cattle industry was greatly impacted in 2020 as fire, drought and COVID-19 created challenges for our ranchers. In August of 2020 the SCU Lightning Complex fires began. These fires affected substantial rangeland acreage in Alameda County. These fires damaged or destroyed forage, fencing, corrals, stock ponds and water systems as well as roads, barns and other buildings. Ranchers had to evacuate their livestock during the fires and often had no rangeland to return them to. This left many with the difficult decision of whether to buy supplemental feed, find land to lease elsewhere or sell their cattle. Alameda County also continued to be impacted by drought conditions. Overall rangeland loss for the year due to drought alone was 73%! This created additional hardships and production costs for ranchers who had to find supplemental grazing ground or purchase feed. COVID-19 also changed the way that beef was consumed. With most restaurants either closed or only providing take-out meals, beef consumption in the food service industry decreased. The closures of packing plants and slaughterhouses because of COVID-19 coupled with the decrease in demand for beef created a surplus of beef and lower prices for ranchers. A new niche market has gained traction during the pandemic as more people are cooking at home. People have found it convient and often cheaper to purchase beef directly from the producer. The farm to table movement has been gaining popularity throughout the county as there are more options available to purchase local beef either online or at certified farmers markets. The cattle industry is resilient. They have been through hard times before. As stewards of the land, ranchers do an amazing job of using the available resources and finding new ways to manage their range and pastures for the benefit of their livestock and wildlife. Many have had to reduce herd size and practice rotational grazing to get the most out of the feed that they have on available pastures. 9 CANINE INSPECTION PROGRAM Our Canine Inspection Team works at various parcel terminals to detect and inspect unmarked parcels containing unprocessed agricultural commodities to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases. Detection dogs have been shown to be highly effective in finding pests in parcels and are used throughout the state to help protect California agriculture. This data reflects work per - formed by our new dog, Zenna, in training and on board for only 8 months of 2020.

There's no way to virtually plant, tend and harvest a garden and social distance in a tightly packed community garden. City Slicker Farms, in the West Oakland Farm Park, developed tools that allowed them to continue to reach the vulnerable senior communities they serve, including online mentorships and gardening kits. Self-service areas making 17,000 new plant starts available for garden members and food donations through Town Fridge helped the community to meet the need for fresh fruits and vegetables. Other gardens had to alter volunteer events and hours, which impacted the ability of the community to participate. Plots were removed to allow more space for social distancing, further limiting access. Still, community gardens provided a refuge from the hustle and bustle of urban living and a chance for people to grow their own food and flowers.
