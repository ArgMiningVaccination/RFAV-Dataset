This study is particularly important as migraine affects more than 30 million women in America and is the most common cause of disability among women of reproductive age (15 - 49 years).1,2 Often for women with migraine, attacks may subside during pregnancy but resume within 4 weeks of childbirth.3 Given a lack of science-based information about migraine medication for nursing mothers, women are often apprehensive about taking their migraine medications while breastfeeding. The results of the study showed that excretion of rimegepant into human milk is very low and rimegepant was safe and well tolerated by lactating women. It was estimated that on a weight-adjusted basis, a nursing infant would receive <1% of the maternal dose of rimegepant which is much below the commonly cited safety threshold of <10% of the maternal dose. Further, there were no serious adverse events and no participants discontinued the study due to treatment related adverse events. Robert Croop, M.D., Chief Development Officer - Neurology at Biohaven commented, \"This is important data for women of reproductive age with migraine as it provides helpful new information for those who are lactating and wish to breastfeed their infants. Recognizing the lack of available data on migraine medications for breastfeeding women, Biohaven is proud to take a science-based approach by conducting a clinical study in this population.\" The study evaluated 12 healthy lactating women who were administered a single-dose of rimegepant 75 mg with a 36-hour follow-up. The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether rimegepant is excreted in human milk after a single 75 mg dose and to determine the concentration-time profiles of rimegepant in the human milk and plasma of healthy lactating women. Thomas W. Hale, Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Dean for Research at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine, noted, \"I'm very pleased with the results of this clinical trial. Lactating mothers often end up having to choose between taking a migraine medication or breastfeeding their infant. Many of the questions we receive at the InfantRisk Center are about using migraine medications when breastfeeding. Now, with this research, we can share with lactating mothers that there is clinical data supporting a treatment option during breastfeeding.\" Dr. Hale and Teresa Baker, M.D., Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine, are coauthors of the publication. About NURTEC ODT NURTEC\u00ae ODT (rimegepant) is the first and only gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist available in a quick-dissolve ODT formulation that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. The activity of the neuropeptide CGRP is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. NURTEC ODT is a CGRP receptor antagonist that works by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide.
