Research carried out with the financial supp ort grante d by the CNPq by means of the PIBIC/CNPq Scientific Initiation J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 133 The g estational period represents a stage of much learning for women and their families. It is a moment of intense physical and psychological transformati ons, therefore requiring specialized and qualified car e. Prenatal care is a service provided to wome n during the pregnancy period, which includes promotion and prevention of maternal and child health and the treatme nt of the problems that occur from the ge stational process u ntil the postpartum.1 Currently, prenatal care in Brazil is ruled by the guidelines of the Program for Humanization of Prenatal and Birth (PHPB), established by the Ministry of H ealth in 2000, which is bas ed on humanization of care as a condition for the proper monitoring of pregnancy , childbirth and the puerperium. It seeks full and quality care.2 The main objectives of the PHPB are to reduce the high rates of mater nal and perinatal morbi mortality, increasing access to the service and es tablish ing criteria in order to qualify the consultations. It promotes the link between patient care and childbirth, as well as indicating the mini mum essential procedures to be performed.3 In this context, nurse s are involved in prenatal care performing consultations for low-risk prenatal care .4 Their activities must be based on the assumptions of humanized care. Nurses must recogniz e the individuality of the subject s during care and establish a bond with each woman , so as to perceive their real needs and their ability to deal with t he process of birth, promoting their well-being and assuring their health and their children's.1 In this r egard, the recognition of socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of pregnant women can influence on meeting the needs of the gestational peri od. To this end, a watchful eye of nurses is necessary regarding the singularities of subjects cared for, in order to base actions on the principles of integrity.5 It is believed that studies dealing with epidemiological data can con tribute to nursing consultation s in health units, since tracing the charac teristics of pregnant women can develop care geared to the reality of women and thus meet their real needs.6 This study aimed to identify the socioeconomic and behavioral pr ofile of pregnant women cared for in nursing consultation s during the prenatal period in a basic health unit in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil in order to know the characteristics of the p opulation served to qualify prenatal care. This is a documentary and r etrospective study, epidemiological ly descriptive with a quantitative approach. The sample wa s composed by nursing records of pregnant women cared for in nursing prenatal consultations in a health unit in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Nursing record s are printed document s, drawn up by t he nurse responsible for consultations in the referred health unit and it is filled out in the first prenatal consultation. It i s considered a document th at provides registered information, constituting a unit that serves for consult ation, study or proof.7 The inclusion criterion was composed of nursing records of pregnant women cared for during the prenatal period from January 2009 to November 2010. From 144 records found in the period described , we included 88 nursing records for the study. The rest were excluded because they did not have nursing records of pregnant women . J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 134 Data collection was carried out between February and March 2011, after authorization by the Municipal H ealth Office and approval of the research project by the Committee of Ethics on Research of the Federal University of Santa Maria , RS, Brazil (Certificate CAAE 03720243000 -10). For the imp lementation of the research , we complied with the provisions of R esolution No. 196 /96 issued by the National Health Council of th e Ministry of H ealth, which regulates r esearch involving human beings.8 The form used for data collection followed a similar orientation to that of the organization of nursing records and included the search of the following inform ation: identification data (age, marital status, occupation, education, and family income); who made th e referral of pregnant women to the se rvice; housing conditions (type, electric light , garbage, waste , and water ); lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol and drug consumption, type of food, dental care, and physical activity); leisure activities; personal history; family history; gynecological history (menarche, age at first sexual intercourse, type of contraceptive method used, occurrence of sexually transmit ted disease s and cy topat hological examination of the uterine cervix); type of menstrual cycle; obstetric history (number of pregnancies, parity, abortions , typ e of delivery, interdelivery interval , previous in the puerperium , and exclusive breas tfeeding); current pregnancy (whether it was planned and how it was experienced by the family); tetanus immunization; current complaints relating to pregnancy ; and gestational age in the first nursing consultation. In this article, we de cided to present the data concerning the identification of pregnant women, housing conditions, in addition to the behavioral characteristics of pregnancy, including lifestyle habits and data about current pregnancies . The data were tabulated using Microsof t Excel for Windows and the statistical analysis was performed by means of the Statistical Pa ckage for Social Sciences (SPSS 13), using the absolute and percentage frequency . A descriptive analysis was performed, which summarizes data from ta bles or graphs and allows analyzing information contained in them, with the objecti ve of synthesizing information.9 In order to have a better visualization of the data obtained, they were grouped in tables and divided into two categories: \"socioeconomic conditions\" and \"conditions of current pregnancy\". The socio economic characteristics of the population studied will be presented with the variables relating to age, marital status, education, occupation in the labor market, family income, housing , and sanitation cond itions. Regarding the behavioral characteristics of the current pregnancy, we present data with respect to smoking, alcohol and drug consumption, dietary habits, phy sical activity, dental care , ge stational age in the first consultation, tetanus immuniz ation, complaints, and pregnancy planning .

In relation to the age of the population studied , there was an average of 26 years. In a total of 88 women, the lowest age was 13 years and highest 46 years. Of this total, 12 women were at a favorable age for pregnancy, and all were in line with the reproductive phase referenced by the Ministry of Health. In Brazil, the reproductive age is considered between 10 and 49 years and women with indi vidual characteristics favorable for pregnancy are those between 15 and 35 years of age.10 Regarding marital status among women cared for , 57 (64.8 %) reported being married and 16 (18.2 %) having a partner. This data are in accordance with the latest demographic census, which showed an increase of 4.5 % in the number of marriages in relation to 2009.11 However, it should be noted that at the time of the nursing consultation, no document certifying the marital status of wome n was required. For this reason, omission of true marital status can occur by conside ring a stable conjugal union as a marriage. In terms of education, we observed that 30 (34.1 %) pregnant women had incomplete elementary school and 21 (23.9 %) had incompl ete high school , thus, incomplete schooling was predominant . This information corrobo rates with a recent study performed in the city of Petrolina, PE, Brazil, showing that the majority of pregnant women s urveyed had incomplete schooling , particularly elementary school .12 This confirms th e concern of the Ministry of Health on the obstetric risk in pregnant wome n who have low education level.10 Therefore, it is necessary to know these women so that nursing can intervene effectively during the gestational process. Regarding the occupation of pregnant women, most of them were housewives 36 (4 0%). Of these, 14 (38.9 %) had incomplete elementary school and 11 (30.6 %) complete; 8 (22.2 %) women had incomplete high school and 3 (8.3%) complete. Similar to these data, a study conducted in Rio de Janeiro also shows the occupation of housewife as the highest prevalence among women su rveyed . In addition, it presents a large number of women with low education. In this line of thought, w e agree with the authors of the study mentioned when they state that due to low schooling, pregnant women do not perform remunerated activities or work in t ertiary sectors, for example working as housemaids5, which may determine the family income. At this respect , we observed that the husbands (or partners) or other relatives were predominantly responsible for supporting t he families of pregnant women. As for family income, we observ ed that 33 (37.5 %) families lived on a minimum wage and 32 (36.4 %) on two minimum wages. This way , family income, occupation and education are directly linked to the determination of the econom ic situation of pregnant women. This highlights the concern with the birth of children considered to be at risk, since the M inistry of Health considers that newborn s are at risk when they are born J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 136 low-income families .10 From this perspective , there is a need for attention to the socioeconomic status of pregnant women in prenatal care.

Regarding housing conditions of the pregnant wome n, there wa s a predominance of 65 (73.9 %) living in their own home s, 58 (65.9 %) lived in houses of masonry and 86 (97.7 %) had electric light. As to basic sanita tion conditions , 84 (95.5 %) had garbage collected, 68 (77.3 %) had sewer network for waste collection and 82 (93.2 %) had running water, while only one pregnant woman needed to get water from her neighbor due to the lack of supply. Accordin g to the last national survey on basic sanitation, co nducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2008, the State of Rio Grande do Sul had 3.8 million people without waste collection service. This document still states that the main solution adopted to make up for the absence of t his service was the construction of septic tanks, which had increased in relation to the survey conducted in 2000. Such data corroborate with the information obtained in this study, which found 12 (13.6 %) houses with septic tank s. However, the same document identified that the public water supply service in the southern region reached 99.7% and waste collection served to all 496 municipalities in the State of Rio Grande do S ul, which confirms the high level of the se data in this study.13 Table 3 - Distribu tion of pregnant women cared for at prenatal nursing consultation s, according to current behavioral characteristics of pregnancy : smoking, alcohol and drugs .

Regarding the behavioral charac teristics of pregnant women, we found that 9 (10.2 %) were smokers, 9 (10.2 %) consumed alcohol during pregnancy and 1 (1.1 %) made use of illicit substances. Of these nine pregnant women who were smokers and consumers o f alcoholic beverages, three smoked and make use of alcohol at the same time, which according to the Minist ry of Health makes pregnancy pos sible to suffer development deficit, risk of premature birth, low -weight childbirth and pr emature separation of placenta.10 In that respect, nursing consu ltation s during the J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 137 opportunity for the professionals to influence in an attempt to : change behavior s that confer risk to pregnancy; promote healthy lifestyles; and , if necessary, direct these women to specialized support .12 This way , it is recommended to perform a detailed interview in the first prenatal consultation regarding aspects pert aining to maternal health. R esearch on the consumption of tobacco and other drugs is intended to advice for the abandonment of their use, du e to the harmful consequences that can be cause d to the hea lth of the woman and her fetus.14 Therefore, it is possible to observe the importa nce of the health service team being prepared t o provide appropriate care and monitor these pregnant women.

We observed that 74 (84.1 %) out of the 88 women studied reported in the interview that their nutritional intake was made up of water, fruits, salads , carbohydr ates and vegetables fractionated on a daily basis, hav ing little consumption of sweets, fried foods and soft drinks, which was considered an adequate diet . The lack of certain nutrient s during the gestational period can cause harms to women and their fetus' health , such as nutritional anemia, which is consid ered the main and less vis ible complication during pregnancy .15 However, the excess of some nutrients can cause weight gain of pregnant women, which is directly related to a higher incidence of ge stational diabetes, hypertension in pregnancy and preeclamps ia.16 To this end, the prenatal consultation should focus on the promotion of healthy eating, highlighting the prevention of nutritio nal disorders and diseases related to food and nutrition, such as low weight, overweight, obes ity, hypertension and diabet es.10 It is known that dental care during pregn ancy is a service proposed by the Ministry of Health for the quality of care provided to pregnant women.10 In the data found in this study, 55 (62.5 %) pregn ant women held regular dental care , while 24 (27.3 %) did not . It should be noted that the denta l service is offered in health units and that during nursing consultations , while questioning to pregnant women about oral health, the se rvice is mentioned and women are forwarded to it , emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary joint action. On the other hand, it is known that many pregnant women are afraid to seek the service of dentists due to beliefs and myths involved in this subject. This fact must be resolved by professionals in a multi -disciplinary and multi - professional activit y, clarifying about the importance of oral hygiene and due care.17 It is also important to highlight the importance of physic al activity during pregnancy. It is reco mmended by health professionals due to its importance in mai ntaining the quality of life and healthy developmen t of pregnancy. The practice currently recommended nowadays is walking , which should be done in moderation, two to three times a week and without feeling tired.10 In this study , we observed that 35 (39.8 %) pregnant women carried out some kind of physical activity. P regnant women 's records stated the performance of light walking with little effort. J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 138 this way, prenatal consultation s are considered an opportune moment to raise awareness among pregnant women about the importance of physical activities . Table 5 - Distribution of pregnant women cared for at prenatal nursing consultation s, according to the current behavioral characteristics of pregnancy: gestational age at the beginning of prenatal period , planning of pregnancy and tetanus immuniza tion.

Regarding the gestational age at which pregnant women began prenatal consult ation , we observed that 54 (61.3 %) initiated it within the first 120 days and 24 (27.3 %) began after 120 days. Of these, the lower gestational age was eight weeks and the largest 36 weeks. It should be noted that all pregnant women , who were in the first c onsultation with the nurse , had already started prenatal care with the obstetrician of the health unit . With respect to this data, a study conducted in the city of Petrolina , PE, Brazil, identified that 33.3 % of pregnant women surveyed started prenatal co nsultations in the first gestational trimester and that 61.1 % started in the second12, which differs from the findings of our study, in which the prevalence observed was in the first trimester . This fact confirms the need and the importance of the early id entification of pregnant women, as well as the achievement of the recommended services. It is known that the identification of women should occur until 120 days of pregnancy10, confirming that the prenatal service of the health unit under study was in acc ordance with what the Ministry of Health advocates about the adequate beginning of consultations. It is also noteworthy that the nursing consultation service during prenatal was disclosed in the unit and also that pregnant women were forwarded by their obstetrician to be cared for by the nurse s. Communitarian agents of health are not mentioned , because during the selected period for the data collection the unit did not offer that service. In this study , it was possible to know whether the curr ent pregnancy of these women had been planned and how its acceptance had occurred . We observed that 49 (55.7 %) pregnancies had not been planned. Regarding the unplanned pregnancies, only one had been rejected by the father of t he pregnant woman, the rest had been accep ted by the couple and received family support. With respect to planned pregnancies, there were references of joy, happiness, and support on the part of the families and partners in all records . With respect to tetanus immunization , 37 (42.05 %) records indicated that pregnant women should perform the reinforcement dose before delivery and 15 (17.05 %) presented the full vaccination chart, be cause they had already received the necessary doses and they were within a peri od of five years laid down by the Minist ry of Health. We observed that there was no historical inform ation about tetanus immunization in 35 (39.8 %) records . Tetanus immunization starts in the second trimes ter of pregnancy and its realization and investigation during prenat al care are cri tical, because they prevent neonatal tetanus.18 Pregnant women can be J. res.: fundam. care. online 2013. jul./set . 5(3):132-141 139 at least two dose s of tetanus vaccine and the second dose should be held until 20 days before the probable date of delivery.10 Another constant data in the reco rds of pregnant women was about the most common complaints of pregnancy. Among these, 59 (67.04 %) pregnant women had nausea, vomiting, heartburn, discomfort, insomnia, polyuria , varicose vein s, loss of appetite and lower abdominal pain . Most of these compl aints are related to physiol ogical changes in the first gestational trimester , since the prevalence of filling out nursing records took place within that period. Such data corroborate with the same information obtained in a study carried out in Rio de Jan eiro, which found the physiological changes of early gestational p eriod as most cited complaints.5 This fact confirms the importance of prenatal care, which should intervene in a beneficial way, seeking prevention and promotion of he alth of the pregnant wo men and their fetus es through relevant information and guidelines in order to explain the adaptations of the body of the pregnant wome n, as well as ways to prevent or reduce these common disorders of pregnancy. We highlight that a significan t amount of records indicated absence of data, making a more accurate analysis of some data difficult, which might have lead the results at a level that was not reliable regarding the population studied . For this reason, it is important to understand that the nursing re cords are in the form of written communicatio n of relevant information about client s and their care.19 This way, it is essential to understand that nursing records are cri tical in the process of care. as well as know ing the population cared fo r in the serv ice. This study showed the characterization of variables related to 88 pregnant women cared for in low -risk prenatal c onsultations carried out by nurse s in a basic health unit. The epidemiological and descriptive analysis of data allowed identifying the socioeconomic and behavio ral profile of pregnant women as being young , married and with low schooling. Housewife was the prevalent occupation of these pregnant women . The family income corresponded to an average between one and two minimum wages. There we re appropriate sanitation conditions in the houses . The life style habits of these pregnant women include d regular dentist consultations; denial regarding the use of alcohol and drugs , and lack of confirmation with respect to smoking; and low achievement of physical activities . Most pregnant women began nursing prenatal consultations before 20 weeks of gestation; requiri ng reinforcement of tetanus immunization and showing common complaints during the first gestational trimester. Most pregn ancies had not been planned . This research allowed a singularized and critical eye with respect to socioeconomic characteristics and health conditions of the pregnant women under study . From the results, it was possible to ide ntify the main needs of these women, as well as w orking with them in the promotion and protect ion of their health and the fetuses' , this way qualifying prenatal care. It is essential to note the importance of a reliable nursing record with regard to the information obtained, as it is a decisive elemen t for nurse s in order to know the characteristics of the population cared for , as well as their individual needs and risk f actors that deserve attention during the prenatal care .
