In today's fast paced lifestyle, it can be overwhelming to make healthy choices, and challenging to be committed to a daily routine. Cultivating an everyday regime is the first place to start on any path of wellness. In Ayurveda, this is called 'Dinacharya'. 'Dina' meaning day and 'acharya' meaning activity, this ancient practice helps to support a life of wellbeing through routine, detoxification, and balance. As per Ayurveda, a good daily morning routine that starts with a healthy ritual helps to vitalize the body and prepare us for the rest of the day. Maintain the equilibrium between your Doshas by following these simple morning rituals for a harmonious beginning to your day and improve the quality of every aspect in your life. Tongue Scraping Cleaning your tongue with a tongue scraper dates back to ancient times in India. Because the tongue reflects the health of so many vital organs, and systemic imbalances, using a tongue scraper daily allows you to take note of any significant changes that may indicate variations in your own internal state of balance. This practice also eliminates the bad breath causing bacteria and draws toxins out of the body. Known as Jivah Prakshalan in Ayurveda, this is the traditional ancient practice of gently grazing the tongue with the help of a u- shaped tool or a scraper to clear out the surface of your tongue. Oil Pulling This Ayurvedic morning ritual is an ancient oral technique that involves swishing oil in your mouth on an empty stomach for around 10-20 minutes. The word 'pulling' signifies how the practice results in toxins being pulled from the mouth. It usually involves coconut, sunflower, or sesame seed oil. Performing this ritual evidently detoxifies the body, primarily to improve oral health but also to enhance your overall wellbeing. This ritual is mentioned in the ancient Ayurvedic text Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita as 'Kavala' or 'Gandusha'. According to traditional methods, 'Kavala' is the oral cleansing technique, now referred to as oil pulling, where a comfortable quantity of oil, usually a spoonful, is held in the mouth and gargled or pulled through the teeth and around the tongue and gums. 'Gandusha' on the other hand involves filling the mouth with oil completely and holding it, rather than swishing or gargling. Both methods provide health benefits beyond a clean mouth, including strengthening the oral cavity muscles and jaws and promoting overall health. Self-Abhyanga Abhyanga is a powerful balancing treatment that stimulates the body's energy channels and opens 'kundalini', a subtle force that opens the mind to the experience of inner wakefulness. Ayurvedic massage is a therapy for cultivating blissful awareness, which is the ultimate basis of radiant and everlasting beauty. You can practice self-abhyanga by massaging your favourite oil onto your whole body, including your hair, in circular motions. Post massage, relax for 10 minutes to let your body absorb the nutrition of the oil. Take a warm bath or shower to complete the ritual. Daily oil application through a loving massage is known to be an important morning ritual in Ayurveda to improve blood circulation for a calmer and healthier nervous system. Asanas and Meditation Just like physical cleansing, inner cleansing is an essential part of every morning ritual. In Ayurveda, practicing yoga and meditation have been suggested to maintain the health of your body and mind. It is recommended to perform 5-20 minutes of Dosha balancing asanas like pose), Adho mukha shvanasana (Downward dog) and more, every morning, to increase circulation and promote calmness and strength. Meditation and breathing techniques like Anulom-Vilom and Pranayama, when practiced regularly, awaken the mind, and cultivate balance and energy. These simple yet profound practices help in bringing you into a present state of awareness with a calm body and focused mind and help in setting the right tone for the rest of the day. Ayurvedic Bath - Snana A therapeutic and rejuvenating ritual to restore the mind, body and soul- bathing has always been considered a sacred ritual in Ayurveda because of its purifying effects. Ancient Ayurvedic texts speak of therapeutic baths with flower petals, honey, milk, and herbs and spices like turmeric, preceded by a comforting full-body massage with warm oils, and followed by skin treatments with healthy herbal pastes and fragrant floral waters. A bath can relax tense muscles, open clogged pores, and restore moisture to the tissues while adding a healing element to your day. It also helps to enhance physical energy levels and improve mental clarity.
