New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) Established: Assesses Effectiveness of Vaccines Influenza Viral Surveillance Flu viruses are constantly changing, so the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated. Over 100 international influenza centers conduct year-round surveillance for influenza, isolates sent to WHO Reference Lab. Twice a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) organizes a consultation and uses these data for strain selection.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) makes the final decision about vaccine viruses for domestic influenza vaccines.As soon as a recommendation has been issued about what viruses should be included in the vaccine, private sector manufacturers begin the process of producing vaccine.Status of Vaccine Confidence in U.S.COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United VaccinatedAt Least One 79,367,22543,036,818% of Total Population23.9%13%Population 18 Years of Age79,175,24142,979,656% of Population 18 Years of Age30.7%16.7%Population 65 Years of Age37,193,72822,307,044% of Population 65 Years of Age68%41%https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinationsBuild TrustShare clear, complete, and accurate messages aboutCOVID-19 vaccinesand take visible actions to build trust in the vaccine, the vaccinator, and the system in coordination with federal, state, and local agencies and partners.Empower Healthcare PersonnelPromote confidence among healthcare personnel in their decision to get vaccinated and to recommend vaccination to their patients.Engage Communities and IndividualsEngage communities in a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive way\u2014using two-way communication to listen, build trust, and increase collaboration.ConclusionsLessons LearnedSafe and highly effective COVID vaccines developedAntibody persists after natural diseaseNeutralization of some variants reduced after vaccinesMuch of U.S. population remains to be vaccinated Vaccine hesitancy existsChallenges that RemainSurveillance systems to assess impact of variants on disease Improving vaccine confidence will increase immunization rates Vaccines directed against variants can be produced and approved "}
