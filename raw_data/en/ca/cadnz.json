Furthermore, no party to a treaty or international agreement subject to registration, which has not been registered, may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly by resolution 97 (I) established regulations to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, Vol. 76, p. XVIII). The terms \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regulations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instrument is a treaty or an international agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply a judgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agreement if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not otherwise have. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series, have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.
