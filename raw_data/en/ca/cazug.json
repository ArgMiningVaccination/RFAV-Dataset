When this warm moist air hits a cold surface such as a window or a cold wall, condensation occurs. Condensation usually occurs during cold weather and can be found in places with little air movement. Look for it behind wardrobes or cupboards or near windows. Condensation can lead to mould growth which can contribute to health problems such as asthma and other respiratory disease. To tackle condensation, a balance of measures must be used. As moisture enters the air from everyday activities, producing less moisture in your home will go some way to tackling th e problem. Tip 1: Cover pans when cooking and do not leave the kettle boiling. This will also help to save on your fuel bills. Tip 2: Avoid using paraffin or bottle gas heaters. Using bottle gas heating for 5 hours will produce 3 litres of moisture.Tip 3: Dry clothes outdoors on a line or put them in the bathroom with the door closed and window open. If you have a tumble dryer ensure it is vented outside. Drying clothes in a tumble dryer can produce up to 10 pints of moisture per year. Tip 4: Keep kitchen and bathroom doors shut to stop moisture moving around your home. Tip 5: Having a bath produces 2 pints of moisture. After having a bath or shower close the door and open the window until the moisture has gone to stop it reaching other parts of the house. Remember to shut windows afterwards. Tip 6: Use an extractor fan or open a window a notch in the kitchen when cooking to let the moisture out. Cooking by gas produces 3 pints of moisture per year. Tip 7: If you have trickle vents above the windows, keep them open all the time. Tip 8: Do not block up any air vents as this will cause problems with condensation.Ventilate cupboards and wardrobes. Avoid putting too many things in them as this stops the air circulating. Where possible position wardrobes and furniture against internal walls. Ventilating your home appropriately by opening your windows a little, using extractor fans or opening vents, will allow moisture to escape outside Try to avoid having cold areas in the home. If you have a condensation problem it is better to heat the whole home to a lower temperature rather than one room to a very high temperature. When condensation forms it is often not in the room where you are making the moisture i.e. kitchens and bathrooms, but in a room you don't often use like a spare bedroom. This is because the room is usually not heated. Try heating all your rooms regularly. Insulating your loft, external walls and draught proofing doors and windows will reduce cold spots and make your home cheaper to heat. Condensation occurs on cold spots, so if you can warm up the cold spots you can reduce condensation.
