The Bradden Method, often described as a \"spiritual reset and facelift,\" was derived from traditional Chinese acupuncture and enhanced by modern technology. The Method is a targeted 360-degree health and anti-ageing treatment combining cutting-edge bio-hacking technologies with cosmetic acupuncture and TCM healing practices designed to specifically reset and recalibrate the parasympathetic nervous system, boost immunity and energy levels, and prevent and reverse premature signs of ageing to give skin a renewed sculpt and glow. In tandem with the Resort's array of spa offerings, Bradden will bring her coveted, cosmetic acupuncture technique to the island offering her signature 90-minute, USD 515 treatment, The Bradden Method. \"I am excited to be joining the team at Four Seasons Resort Anguilla, and to share The Bradden Method here for the first time. This transformative therapy for mind and body combines powerful recovery technologies and traditional Chinese medicine practices that I blend to specifically boost and repair both your physical and emotional healing. It's absolutely life-changing!\" says Sarah Bradden. Though all of Bradden's treatment sessions stem from her signature offering, she famously treats each case differently and tailors her approach to the specific needs of the individual. Crediting her deep understanding of the distinct differences between bodies, experiences, and symptoms for her success, Bradden is truly an expert at healing from within. \"We feel so lucky to welcome Sarah Bradden to the property and to offer our guests access to her expertise. She is a remarkable wellness practitioner and her approach to healing that she has cultivated and shared through The Bradden Method is incredibly impressive. Needless to say, it is an honour to collaborate with her,\" adds [Diego Angarita](https://press.fourseasons.com/anguilla/hotel-team/diego-angarita.html), General Manager of Four Seasons Resort Anguilla.

Her approach to wellness is unique and has enabled her to distinguish herself as the authority on combined cosmetic and spiritual healing.
