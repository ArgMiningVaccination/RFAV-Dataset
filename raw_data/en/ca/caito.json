At Amen Clinics, we follow a simple guiding rule: use the least toxic, most effective treatments. The Amen Clinics Method takes a whole brain-body approach to treatment and personalizes solutions to treat all of the factors that may be contributing to your symptoms. In making treatment recommendations for our patients, we always keep these principles in mind. First, do no harm. Use the least toxic, most effective, science-based treatments. Then, consider short-term pain versus long-term gain (don't fix one problem just to cause another one). Do not start something a patient will have a hard time stopping (withdrawing from many anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications can be very hard) just to deal with the anxiety of the moment. Finally, nutraceuticals or medications should never be the first and only thing people do. Read on to learn more or contact us at the link below. At Amen Clinics, we use brain SPECT imaging to evaluate the health of your brain and identify areas that would benefit from optimization with supplements and/or medication. When it comes to optimizing your brain, one size does NOT fit all. Our brain imaging work has shown that there are different types of mental health conditions (7 types of anxiety and depression, 7 types of ADD/ADHD, 6 types of addicts, and more) as well as multiple brain types (we have identified 16 brain types). Treating everyone who has anxiety, depression, ADD/DHD, addiction, or other conditions with the same supplements and medications will never work. Based on your brain scans and brain type, we develop a personalized supplement and/or medication plan for your needs. In traditional psychiatry, there is a major flaw when it comes to prescribing medications and nutraceuticals\u2014they are generally recommended based on symptoms, rather than biology. At Amen Clinics, our experience shows that treatment with nutraceuticals and/or medications is much more effective when we add the biological information from our brain imaging work. Brain imaging helps: Our brain SPECT imaging work\u2014which includes over 200,000 brain scans of patients from over 155 countries\u2014also shows that certain medications have a negative impact on overall brain health. For example, benzodiazepines for anxiety and opiates for pain are clearly associated with unhealthy looking scans. At Amen Clinics, we are not opposed to medications for your mind and prescribe them when necessary. However, we are opposed to medications being the first and only thing you do to help your brain and your mind. When carefully prescribed and monitored, medications can have a life-changing (and sometimes life-saving) effect. Understand that when medications are prescribed, we also recommend the support of nutraceuticals to help you get better faster. Based on three decades of experience, Amen Clinics has compiled the following list of pros and cons of medications for your mind. Some people wonder if they need to take nutritional supplements if they are consuming a healthy diet. It's important to understand that due to food industry practices, the vast majority of foods today contain fewer nutrients than before. In addition, many people have compromised gut health that reduces their ability to absorb the nutrients that are consumed. Because of this, supplementing your diet with high-quality, naturally derived nutrients can powerfully promote healing and boost your overall health. Even though they have limitations, the benefits of nutraceuticals compared with their minimal risks make them worth considering, especially if you can get thoughtful, research-based information. There are 3 supplements we typically recommend to all of our patients because they are critical to optimal brain function: a multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D. Based on more than three decades of diving into the research on nutraceuticals to help the brain and using them in our clinical practice, Amen Clinics has compiled the following list of pros and cons of nutraceuticals for your mind. \"The unfortunate reality is that current medications help too few people to get better and very few people to get well.\" \u2014Thomas Insel, Former Director of the National Institute for Mental Health "}
