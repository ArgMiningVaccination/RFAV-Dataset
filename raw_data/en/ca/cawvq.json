Bath bombs are hard-packed balls that come in a variety of colors and scents. Despite their name, they're not just spherical but come in many different shapes: from flowers and hearts to cupcakes and shells. How are Bath Bombs Made? Made from a combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, when bath bombs make contact with warm water they effervesce, creating luxuriant, fizzy bubbles. They may also contain oils like vitamin e or sunflower oil, butters, and lotions to moisturize your dry skin, as well as mineral salts such as magnesium sulfate (also known as Epsom salt) or dead sea salt, fragrances, dyes, and flower petals. Are Bath Bombs Toxic? Bath bombs may cause mild skin irritation depending on the ingredients. If swallowed in small amounts, it can cause [nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.](https://www.poison.org/articles/the-baby-ate-a-bath-bomb-194) Swallowing large amounts is more dangerous, and can be potentially toxic. Contact with eyes should be avoided, while reading ingredient labels can help you avoid toxic ingredients that come with negative health and environmental impacts. Potential Health Impacts While bath bombs can have some benefits such as relaxation, there are also a few things to be aware of. Some of the ingredients in select bath bombs could cause negative impacts on your health. Harmful Ingredients Found in Bath Bombs Fragrances. This is a vague term that may encompass thousands of ingredients. Since the FDA does not require companies or brands to break down what ingredients make up a fragrance, you will have no idea of exactly what is in a product when you see this term; therefore, any number of toxic ingredients could be lurking inside. Fragrances may contain ingredients that lead to skin irritation, as well as other toxins with much more serious ramifications. They may contain benzene derivates which are [human carcinogens;](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/benzene/basics/facts.asp)acetaldehyde, also a carcinogen, which has been linked to [effects of the kidneys, nervous system, and respiratory system;](https://draxe.com/health/are-bath-bombs-safe/)and phthalates, which are endocrine disruptors that [affect adults and especially children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157593/). If you do like different scents, look for products scented with natural essential oils instead. Synthetic dyes. These artificial dyes may cause skin irritation and have been linked to [hyperactivity in children](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/red-dye-40-adhd#red-dye-40-and-adhd). In addition, fragrances and dyes [may cause vaginal infections](https://www.consumersafety.org/news/how-bath-bombs-may-secretly-be-hurting-you/)by throwing off the vagina's healthy pH balance leading to irritation or infections like UTI (urinary tract infection). Talc. While it is not a common ingredient, talc may be found in some bath bombs. The link is tenuous but it has been connected to an [increased risk of ovarian cancer.](https://www.consumersafety.org/product-lawsuits/talcum-powder/cancer-risk/) Parabens, used as preservatives in bath and beauty products to increase shelf life, are also [endocrine disruptors](https://www.ewg.org/what-are-parabens). Glitter. To make bath bombs even more alluring and luxurious they are often filled with add-ons such as flower petals and fruit peels. Another popular addition is glitter. However, glitter is made from microplastics. When you drain your tub, bath bomb residue, including glitter, is washed down, entering waterways. These glitter particles [do not break down](https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/yes-glitter-really-is-bad-for-the-environment)but remain in the environment, where they may be ingested by aquatic life. Plastic. The other type of plastic is the more obvious kind: packaging. Bath bombs are often individually wrapped in plastic, creating extra waste. If you accidentally ingest bath water or it makes contact with your eyes, rinse out your mouth and drink a bit of water, or rinse out your eyes if they have been exposed. If you have sensitive skin, take a bath bomb test by [ rubbing it on your arm](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-to-know-bath-bombs) before use to check for irritation. Bath bombs should be kept out of reach of children who may try to eat them, especially when they're shaped like food. Are Organic Bath Bombs Better? If you want to find a safer option for your bathtime routine, try organic bath bombs. These contain ingredients like plant butters and pure essential oils that have been made with organic ingredients which follow [organic standards ](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-standards)such as using less or no pesticides, planting cover crops, and avoiding monocropping - practices that make the product safer for humans and the environment. Tips for Shopping Natural & Organic Bath Bombs When it comes to fragrances, look for natural bath bombs using organic essential oils. For dyes, opt for natural colorants like turmeric, spirulina, and ratanjot. Avoid the glittery balls and rather look for bath bombs filled with flowers or fruit. If your skin is not prone to irritation, you should still practice moderation: don't use bath bombs too often and do not soak for too long in the tub. 7 Natural & Organic Bath Bomb Brands The best organic bath bombs will give you the ultimate bathing experience without any toxic chemicals.
