The Crystal Bog Focus Area encompasses an extensive suite of wetlands. At the core of the site is 1400 acre Crystal Bog, one of Maine's best examples of a Domed Bog Ecosystem. In addition to these large wetland features, the site supports one of Maine's most diverse fens and a large number of rare plants and animals. OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSERVATION \u00bbEncourage best management practices for forestry, vegetation clearing, and soil disturbance activities near significant features. \u00bbEncourage town planners to improve approaches to development that may impact focus area functions. \u00bbMaintain intact forested buffers along water bodies and wetlands to protect water quality and provide valuable riparian habitat for wildlife. \u00bbWork with landowners to encourage sustainable forest management practices on remaining privately owned forest lands in and around the focus area. \u00bbWork with willing landowners to permanently protect undeveloped areas and significant features.

Much of this low-lying landscape is described as an Appalachian-Acadian Basin Swamp Ecosystem. This type of ecosystem is characterized by a broad wetland basin dominat - ed by forested swamp that is drained by mid-sized streams. At the core of the site is 1400 acre Crystal Bog, one of Maine's best examples of a Domed Bog Ecosystem. In addition to these large wetland features, the site supports one of Maine's most diverse fens and a large number of rare plants and animals. RARE AND EXEMPLARY NATURAL COMMUNITIES The focus area includes two large ecosystems, an Appala - chian-Acadian Basin Swamp Ecosystem and a Domed Bog Ecosystem . The Basin Swamp Ecosystem is comprised of a number of natural community types with cedar swamp and spruce flats being the most common. This example is the largest documented in the state. The Domed Bog Ecosystem is pristine and includes numerous pools interspersed among patches of stunted spruce and heath shrubs. Ecologists have identified at least eight different natural communities within Crystal Bog, The Nature Conservancy the two ecosystems, representing incredible plant and animal habitat diversity. The Domed Bog is morphologically very di - verse. It has two large lobes joined by a narrower corridor. The larger of the two lobes is well developed with a concentrically patterned convex dome that has numerous secondary pools. The vegetation patterns within this ecosystem show excellent zonation along a nutrient- gradient that is more minerotro - phic along the margins and more nutrient-poor at the center. The zonation and patterning has been able to develop in the absence of any significant human disturbance, another feature that adds to the uniqueness of this wetland complex. The site also includes one of the state's richest S hrubby Cinquefoil Sedge Circumneutral Fen communities. Open areas of the fen are dominated by shrubby cinquefoil ( Pen - taphylloides floribunda ) and lightly forested areas have young or stunted northern white cedar ( Thuja occidentalis ). CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES Numerous rare plants that require high pH soils to survive grow in this focus area. This site probably has the state's largest population of the rare swamp birch (Betula pumila Other rare species include marsh uliginosa ), Focus Areas of The state endangered Clayton's copper butterfly (Lycaena dorcas claytoni) has been documented Shrubby Cinque - foil Sedge Circumneutral Fen. Clayton's copper is found only in association with its sole larval host plant, shrubby cinquefoil. This uncommon shrub requires circumneutral or alkaline soils and has a scattered distribution throughout Maine. Although not considered rare, there are relatively few cinquefoil stands large enough to support viable Clayton's copper populations. Clayton's copper is currently known from only eleven sites worldwide - nine in Maine centered in and around northeast - ern Penobscot county and two sites just over the border in New Brunswick. With the majority of the population located in Maine, the state has an important role in conserving this rare species. The Appalachian-Acadian Basin Swamp Ecosystem includes two drainage systems: the East Branch of Molunkus Stream drains to the south and Fish Stream drains to the north. The creeper (Strophitus undulatus) , a rare mussel species, inhabits Fish Stream. Although widely distributed across the state and throughout its range, the creeper is rarely abundant. Usually fewer than ten individuals are found at a single location, and there is considerable question about the long-term viability of such small populations. Consequently, this species has been listed as special concern in Maine. The creeper prefers clean, flowing water, and thus habitat degradation and pollution have probably affected this species. The majority of Crystal Bog and its associated tributary streams provide important Inland Waterfowl and Wading Bird Habitat . These areas provide undisturbed nesting habitat and undisturbed, uncontaminated feeding areas and are essential for maintaining viable waterfowl and wading bird populations. CONSERVATION CONSIDERATIONS \u00bbThe ecological integrity of wetlands including peatland ecosytems and the processes and life forms they support including rare plants and animals are dependent on the maintenance of the current hydrology and water quality of the site. Intensive timber harvesting, vegetation clearing, soil disturbance, new roads, and development on buffer - ing uplands can result in greater runoff, sedimentation, and other non-point sources of pollution that can degrade the high quality natural systems that occur here. \u00bbPreserving the natural communities and other sensitive features within the focus area will be best achieved by work - ing to conserve the integrity of the larger natural systems in which these features occur. Conserving the larger systems will help ensure that both common and rare natural features will persist on the landscape in this part of the state. \u00bbPeatland systems benefit from establishing and/or maintain -ing vegetative buffers around their perimeter wherever pos - sible. A buffer of 250 feet or more will serve to limit impacts from adjacent development, help prevent erosion, limit colonization of invasive species, and prevent unnecessary impacts from off road vehicle use. \u00bbThis area includes Significant Wildlife Habitat for inland wading birds and waterfowl. Land managers should follow best management practices with respect to forestry activi - ties in and around wetlands, shoreland areas, and Signifi - cant Wildlife Habitat. Vegetation removal, soil disturbance and construction activities may require a permit under the Natural Resources Protection Act. Contact MDIFW for more information. \u00bbGravel mining in adjacent deposits that includence the local groundwater flow may reduce water levels in the fens espe - cially. Drainage ditches along the railroad and culverts under the railroad bed alsomay have a significant impact on water levels in the fens. \u00bbResearch and education are actively encouraged on all state Ecological Reserves. The state has developed a long term ecological monitoring program for Reserves and seeks op - portunities to promote research efforts that complement its monitoring program.Ecological Services of the Focus Area Provides high quality habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and other wildlife Supports regional biodiversity by providing habitat for rare plants, animals, and natural communities.
