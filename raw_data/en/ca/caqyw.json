Further studies had shown that the [serotype]of the recombinant [strain]was identical to the [parent]SL1344& [Delta];sseK1 and wild SL1344 [strains],and the mutant was stable with the recombinant & [Delta];asd [gene] [in vitro]. It was found that the re-combinant [strain]had displayed identical [growth]profile and biochemical [parent]SL1344& [Delta];sseK1 The recombinant [strain]was to 0. 048%;the immunoprotective effect that [protection]rate infected with wild [strain]of [Salmonella typhimurium]was 62. 5% on the 17th was identical to the [parent]SL1344& the secreted been successfully constructed,and genetic stability,significantly reduced [virulence],which has laid a [foundation]for developing potential oral live vaccin vector to express "}
