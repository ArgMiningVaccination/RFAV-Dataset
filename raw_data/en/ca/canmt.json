My journey started four years ago. And before that I have been suffering from chronic anxiety and depression. I went through a severe attack of anxiety in 2012 and, I went spiralling down with cyclic negative depressive thought without any hope to come out of it and truly live the life with purpose. But with inner calling, I took up running. I prepared and ran my first 5k, 10k and by end of 2013, I ran my first half marathon. I started feeling good, got moral boost, felt self-worth and got a can-do feeling and continued running to my first full marathon in 2015. In the process, I overcame anxiety and depression and able to cope with its episodes without caving in it. This motivated me to go ahead and study effect of running on \"Science of Happiness\", \"Positive Psychology\" and \"Mental Well-Being\". I found out about how different neurotransmitters like endorphins and dopamine released by chemical responses on stimulation of brain helps to boost your confidence and gives euphoric effect (Runner's High). And I also learnt running as \"large clinical impact\" on depression. Based on my studies, I learnt that with applied positive psychology and the euphoric neural conditions that running creates enables to retrain your own brain to start taking things positively and alter its neural pathways to help deal with anxiety and depression by feeling motivated, energetic and confident. My mission, The Marathon for Life, which is alter ego now is to affirm the research and studies conducted on running and its impact on health, happiness and wellbeing. I intend to take the message mainstream and have collective inputs from all the runners with similar stories to potentially raise awareness for positively impacting lives to overcome anxiety/depression and for communities as whole . Biography Roopak Desai participated in the first signature Habits and Happiness Programing 2012 conducted by The Institute of Advance Human Performance (IFHAP). He has been a practitioner of meditation, mindfulness and gratitude journaling since then. He now serves as a member coach at Positive Psychology - The Science of Happiness led by Braco Pobric and a passionate runner. His alter ego is Marathon for Life runner after running helped fighting and negotiating anxiety and depression. The Marathon for Life runner is a strong advocate to take up running as a lifestyle and will be sharing why it is the ultimate source to happiness, health and wellbeing. Applied Positive Psychology principals combined with the euphoric neural conditions that running creates, enabled him to re-train his own brain and alter its neural pathways, allowing him to finally overcome 20 odd years of clinical depression. His sole purpose is to make a difference in world by helping people with their health, happiness and wellbeing by spreading awareness and knowledge. roopakdesai@gmail.comRoopak Desai, J Psy chol Toronto, Canada17th World Summit on Positive Psychology, Psychotherapy & Cognitive Behavioral Sciences Volume 7, Issue 2 (Suppl) J Psychol Psychother ISSN: 2161-0487 JPP Psychology 2017 May 01-03, 2017 Creating a better world through online avenues in positive psychology Jamie Rose Brown Kyani-Team Fusion & the Happiness Ninja, Australia Do positive psychology interventions provide an effective treatment for mental health problems? There is growing evidence to suggest that it does. The research conducted specifically on the benefits of online positive psychology programs is minimal but promising. Results suggest that using an online positive psychology program can decrease symptoms of psychopathology and increase well-being in young people, especially for those who use the website for 30 minutes or longer per week or more frequently. Qualitative data indicated that 49 of 61 users (79%) reported positive experiences using the website and 55 (89%) agreed they would continue to use it after study completion. Compared to the control condition, participants in the condition with high levels of adherence (usage of the website for 30 minutes or more per week) reported significant decreases in depression and stress and improvements in well-being. These findings are encouraging and suggest that the online delivery of positive psychology programs may be an alternate way to address mental health issues and improve youth well-being nationally. The gaps in this overall area is detrimental to the welfare of both our current and future generations and the methods in which maximum reach of preventative programs through technology advancements can be conducted. The project - The Happiness Nina - helps to fill this gap. In my project I will be looking at the impact that online programs and community forums have on people's [not just youth] overall mental health and well-being levels. I argue that online programs are a suitable platform to create mainstream growth, connectedness and awareness, which will create a valuable impact on both individuals and communities as a whole. This project will shed new light on these overlooked areas and help path the way for the future . Biography Jamie Rose Brown has completed the worlds' only government accredited Diploma of Positive Psychology and Wellbeing, recognizing her as a Positive Psychology Practitioner.

According to the CDC, the recommended treatment for ADHD is a combination of medication and behavioral therapy. However, pharmacological entities available have potential adverse effects. Therefore, herbal formulations with extensively researched ingredients such as Bacopa monnieri and Centella asiatica with proven efficacy, tolerability and safety profile are gaining more popularity over conventional drugs in treatment of ADHD. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: This randomized, comparative, 16-week study was conducted to compare the efficacy of cognium syrup and standard behavioral therapy vis-a-vis standard behavioral therapy alone, in school children of 6-14 years of age with ADHD. A total of 76 children were enrolled as per the DSM- IV criteria for ADHD. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups. Children in Group-A were given cognium syrup along with standard behavioral therapy and those in Group-B received standard behavioral therapy only. Efficacy was measured by improvement in total symptom score, average performance score and by physician's global assessment. Findings: Treatment with cognium syrup led to uniform improvement in all parameters. The total symptom score significantly decreased in 96.6% patients in Group-A compared to 46.6% in Group-B. The average performance score for functional impairment significantly improved in 80% patients in Group-A and 36.66% patients in Group-B. Cognium syrup was well tolerated with good patient compliance. Conclusion & Significance: Cognium syrup demonstrated significant improvement in ADHD core symptoms-inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. This study therefore confirms that cognium syrup along with standard behavioral therapy proved more efficacious than behavioral therapy alone in the management of ADHD in children. Herbal formulations can offer a valuable alternative to current drug therapy for the management of ADHD.

The Latin American culture, and especially that of Mexico, is characterized by an intense history of miscegenation, combining not only races and cultures, but also customs, beliefs and, in fact, all of a world vision. This scenario has paved the road for the Mexican School of Existential Therapy to develop, at a psychotherapeutic level, its own proposal that arose upon the integration of elements from Europe (English, German and French), as well as North and South America, to our own experience and history. This approach to Existential Therapy is interested in exploring and analyzing experience, always understanding it as a part of the experience-behavior continuum, and taking into account the four possible languages in which experience is organized, integrated and expressed. These four languages are: a) The Physical-Sensory, b) The Interpersonal-Emotional, c) The Personal-Rational, and d) The Symbolic-Spiritual. The therapeutic exploration begins with the language the client uses to narrate his experience, progressively widening, through dialogue, the narrative expressiveness and, with it, the perspective and understanding of his experience. Biography Yaqui Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Robles is an Existential-phenomenological and Hermeneutical Analyst and Therapist and a Gestalt Therapist. He is the Secretary of the Latin-American Association of Existential Psychotherapy. He is the Founder and Chair of the C\u00edrculo de Estudios en Terapia Existencial, in Mexico. He is the Representative of the Mexican School of Existential Therapy and Analysis and also a Member of the Editorial Board of Existential Analysis (Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis , London). He has authored and co-authored several books and articles on Existential Therapy. yaqui@circuloexistencial.orgYaqui Andres Martinez Robles, J Psy chol Toronto, Canada17th World Summit on Positive Psychology, Psychotherapy & Cognitive Behavioral Sciences Volume 7, Issue 2 (Suppl) J Psychol Psychother ISSN: 2161-0487 JPP Psychology 2017 May 01-03, 2017 Navigating anxiety and stress through mindfulness: Cultivating mindfulness and awareness in a community-based setting Andrew Safer Safer Mindfulness, Canada Statement of the Problem: Stress afflicts 23% of Canadians age 15 and over and 30% of adults between 35 and 54, significantly impacting health and well-being, absenteeism, and health care costs. Anxiety disorders, ranging from mild to severe impairment, impact 12% of Canadians. Community-based non-medical alternatives are needed to relieve pressure from the health care system, provide wellness-based solutions that do not rely on medication, and empower the individual to assume a primary role in self-care. The purpose of the 8-week \"Navigating Anxiety and Stress through Mindfulness\" program is to assist individuals who identify problematic anxiety and/or stress by contextualizing and presenting mindfulness-awareness meditation training and related practices. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Mindfulness training develops precision and accuracy; awareness training fosters openness and a greater connection to the environment. Rather than regarding anxiety and stress as problems to be gotten rid of, participants were coached to relate to these experiences non-judgmentally, with openness, curiosity, and an interest in learning from them. The eight 2.5-hour sessions incorporated mindfulness-awareness meditation, walking meditation, \"head and shoulders\" (pausing practice), tonglen (compassion practice), and mindfulness-in-everyday-life activities. Findings: Data from five groups (40 participants) indicated a 40% improvement in scores. Participants' self-reports indicated significant improvement in: their ability to interrupt storylines (discursive thought patterns), rumination, not being fully present, and their ability to accept things as they are, ranging from 25% to 60%. Conclusion & Significance: It is evident that participants found mindfulness-awareness meditation and related practices beneficial. Their evaluation responses showed significant understanding of the key elements of mindfulness and that they had begun integrating mindfulness into their lives. The majority developed a regular home meditation practice. The program proved to be viable in a community-based setting.

The sample incorporates 100 main caregivers of patients with mental disorders and 100 main caregivers of cancer patients who are residents of Mizoram. They were partitioned on the basis of duration of care giving as the main caregiver and have been giving care to the patient (either with mental disorder or cancer) for more than 6 months in their respective places or at the hospitals, within the age range of 18 years and above were selected following random sampling procedures from targeted population. The psychological test such as - the socio- demographic data sheet, followed by the General Health Questionnaire-28, The Beck Depression Inventory- II, The Resilience Scale, and finally The Zarit Burden Interview were employed for psychological evaluation. The psychometric properties of the tests were checked with an objective to justify the appropriate statistical treatment for further analyses. The results highlighted that being a main caregiver has significant impact on different facets of the caregiver's life and that in many situations the impact also tended to be mostly negative. Many are on the brink of having a major mental illness, while some even exhibited clear cut signs of a serious mental illness. The results suggest the needs of psychological diagnosis and interventions for the main caregiver of patient with mental disorder.

Its practice is a journey in itself starting from body moving to mental capacities and self actualization. As per Maslow's hierarchy of needs also, the journey of human needs and the evolution of mankind raises from mere biological needs to the need of self actualization. This brings the clarity that the natural form of our psyche is positive and progressive. Due to life challenges and complexities of experiences across the life span, human being unknowingly scatters himself from the roots of his existence. The term 'Y oga' is derived from Sanskrit language and it means 'union' . Here union is with reference to physical, mental and spiritual practices. Y oga delineates 196 sutras which are elaborated by Patanjali. Y oga is transferred through a guru (master) - Shishya (disciple) relationship. Spirituality is enunciated in well-known Indian scriptures like, Vedas, Bhagvad Gita, Upanishads and many more. Through regular practice of Y oga one can attain a disease free and fully functioning body and through regular practice of meditation one can attain a disturbance free mental wellness with lots of mental capacities making a person's performance extra ordinary from ordinary. Considering the mental illnesses, Y oga and meditation proves to be highly effective therapeutic techniques of healing and treating symptoms of psychological disorders.

Patients with depression may have suicidal thoughts, depressed mood as well as diminished appetite, sleep and no interest in usual activities. The prevalence of depression ranges from 2 to 9% in the general population. The presence of comorbid conditions, high body-mass index and lower socio-economic status, all have been associated with depression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is described as irreversible loss of kidney functions. The prevalence of depression has been shown to be high in CKD patients and has been linked to mortality. Depression management include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy. Neurochemical imbalance in the central nervous system is the root of the problem in depression. The disease process involves several alterations in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system, including reduced serotonin and increased sympathetic tone. The sympathetic nervous system is governed by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) is one of the substances that is released by the HPA axis and stimulates the secretion of medulla, and increases epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. Previous research showed that the volume of space occupied by CRH neurons increased in depression. The HPA is inhibited by Gamma Amino Butyric acid (GABA) and cortisol feedback. Overall, the underlying pathophysiology of depression is complex, and involves several substances. Due to lack of negative feedback of GABA and/or alpha 2 adrenergic systems, the HPA becomes stimulates ACTH is secreted. As a result, a sympathovagal imbalance is established, contributing to the disease process. Biography Nigar Sekercioglu is a Nephrologist.

The common interpretation of unconventional behavior as a symptom of illness has marginalized the creative class and deterred mental health professionals from developing the skills and perspectives needed to empower their clients. Too often the neuroplasticity of the human brain is ignored in favor of the organizing metaphor of chemical imbalance which often results in the relegation of clients' needs to the pharmaceutical industry. Michael T. Walker encourages psychotherapists to evolve their practice by considering the new information available in neuroscience, psychotherapy outcome studies, and postmodern psychotherapies. Biography Michael T Walker has been exploring client-centered, collaborative and constructivist methods for 25 years while working in community mental health in South Central Los Angeles as well as in private practice.

Introduction: Marriage is an important life event which impacts a person's life and behaviour. Compatibility in marriage, according to one definition, is considered concept of balance which means to keep balance of voluntary and required dimensions of the relationship. Marriage and marriage compatibility affects both the couples and and the social network around them. Methods: A systematic review of relevant articles published in peer reviewd journals between 2000 and 2016 was taken. Results: A person's attachment style with his/her mother during childhood has a significant effect on marriage compatibility. Furthermore, an individual's attachment style determines that person's relationship with others throughtout his/her life. There are different attachments styles from mother to the child as well as from one adult to another adult. From a child to his/her mother three attachments styles are most common: secure, anxious resistant, and anxious aviodant. From one adult to the other there are four attachment styles: Secure, fearful, dismissive, and preoccupied. According to Ertan (2002), the most common attachment styles in marriages, in insecure attachment is in Turkey. The married couples with highest level of compatibility experience the secure attachment style. Another study concluded that individuals with secure-preoccupied attachment styles have higher marriage compatibility compared to the ones with dismissive-fearful attachment styles. In Turkish culture, being jealous towards the partner or maintaining a very close tie with the partner are considered asset qualities in relationships, therefore individuals with preoccupied attachments style are assessed with higher compatibility rates.

In Sultanate of Oman this number was increased too. Despite these optimistic statistics, the process of inclusion has been faced by many challenges: A limited number of certified special education personnel; lack of proper training for teachers in mainstream classrooms and the lack of parental support in children's school. In the Omani context, research about the parental involvement in the mainstream classrooms was rarely conducted. Aim: The purpose of the study is to investigate the parental involvement in educating their children with disabilities in inclusive classrooms at Omani schools as perceived by teachers. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Researcher employs the use of a survey questionnaire to investigate the parent involvement. Quantitative statistical methods are used to analyze the findings of the data collected on the Likert-scale used in the survey questionnaire. The instrument used in the study was adopted from a study recently conducted in Oman by Al Mashaykhi (2015). Findings: Participants' have high perception of the importance of parental involvement in the inclusive classroom but low perception of the practices they use to be involved in these classes. Besides that, findings of Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, among importance and practices of parental involvement showed that these variables correlated negatively. Conclusion & Significance: Descriptive analyses showed that teachers perceive the parental involvement in the inclusive classroom is important to support the education for the children with disabilities, but the study showed also that less action were taken from the parent to activate this involvement. The researcher recommends adding qualitative methods to discuss more related issues with teachers, parents and other stakeholders.

Data was analyzed using Atlas ti.software. Findings: Mothers included in the study have mentioned that at times ambulances do not arrive on time, health care professionals mistreat them and they are not allowed to perform cultural celebrations done after child birth in health facilities and as a result they tend to interrupt their ANC follow up and even be forced to give birth at home. Conclusion and significance: The significance of this study is to identify the gaps in health care facilities in order to improve the health seeking behavior among mothers during ANC follow ups and during labour. Most mothers on or interrupted ANC follow ups complain about mistreatment at health facilities, delayed health services and recommend improvement in the health care provider work ethics based on customer satisfaction and improvement of primary services.

Is the answer found in the scientific approach and rigor of western psychology or in the esoteric wisdom of the east? The answer lies somewhere in between. From a childhood, undifferentiated spiritual perception and worldview, a quest began. Through examination of the evolution of psycho-spiritual beliefs in east and west, to her own psychological development, spiritual growth, research and thirty years of clinical practice accompanying individuals in their quest, self-searching became soul searching. The author realized that the general perception and corresponding approaches to psychology were too limited. In some cases the full human element was missing and, in others, the spiritual. Eastern and western models of integral psychology closed this gap, offering wonderful and limitless possibilities. This talk will convey a vision of human potential and psychology that transcends the borders of east and west and opens the scope for a multi-dimensional, pluri-disciplinary and inclusive theory and practice for psychology. The participant is invited to go beyond current psychological scopes of treating symptoms or simple well-being. The author's journey and insights extend an invitation and means for transformation from ego to soul-consciousness for practitioners and seekers alike. Biography Margot Esther Borden has obtained her Master's degree in Humanistic Psychology from University of Durham, UK and has been working internationally as a Psychotherapist since 1988. She has been trained in a variety of psycho-spiritual healing approaches. She has a long-term dedication to personal and professional exploration of the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of human consciousness. Her search involves ongoing exploration and experience in many psychological and spiritual traditions, experiential therapies as well as eastern meditation and yogic techniques.

The urgent and compelling need to acknowledge and treat the problem of burnout especially in the caregiving, occupational life has become real and crucial. Studies show that burnout has become one of the primary factors contributing toward chronical mental and physical problems such as depression, addiction, family issues, etc. Rarely has any research been done on this topic in connection with both positive psychology and strengths psychology. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: The PERMA model of the Positive Psychology of Martin Seligman that includes five components, namely, Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning, and Accomplishment, was critically analyzed and found to be a descriptive solution to build resilience to cope with potential burnout and to build subjective wellbeing. Along with Positive Psychology, Strength Psychology was examined, and it was found that Donald Clifton's StrengthsFinder assessment tool could be helpful in complementing the PERMA model in accomplishing the hypotheses among university students and seminarians. Thus, a combination of both the PERMA model and the Strengths Finder assessment tool was used in an empirical research study involving four phases: Preparation, classroom lecturing, individual coaching, and evaluation. The results were partially positive. Conclusion & Significance: Recommendations were made to incorporate PERMA model along with the StrengthsFinder Assessment tool into educational programs to instill resilient potentials in university students and seminarians in order for them to cope with possible burnout and to build subjective wellbeing.

How crazy and funny this sentence would sound if it was spoken even once in everyday life. We want to live a healthy life. What exactly is health? Y ou might say being free from illness, injury or pain. Was the person healthy, who never smoked nor drank, had healthy eating habits and took care of his health in all possible ways, but died at age 40 of a heart attack? The word health comes from the old English word \"Hal,\" meaning wholeness or total and not divided. We cannot love ourselves in parts. It is ridiculous to say that I love my right arm more than my left, or my right leg is better than my left eye. I was born with my all body parts, organs, cells and also my thoughts, sentiments and emotions. Everything that happens within me can be considered as my \"Self or Being.\" If I lack something in me, then I have a deficit; this opens up an opportunity for something else to take its place. Life cannot be planned rationally in the terms of a disease. For instance, no one consciously sets out to acquire diabetes at age 15, multiple sclerosis at age 25, cancer at age 30, and then death at age 32, yet we know of loved ones or friends whom have been affected by these illnesses resulting in death at an early age. Who is responsible? Recognizing that we create our disease and knowing the origin is on a deeper level can give us hope that there is a way to restore our health and wellbeing if we choose to accept this. Whether it is cancer, diabetes, dealing with anxiety or any physical or mental disorder, the person creates it, by himself, on an unconscious level. The presence of disease in somebody's life is always considered bad, no matter what. Today I would like to share something out of the box. I have been really exhausted listening to the different conditional health definitions. Disease is unkind and I completely support this idea; in other words, when you are sick, it is important to go to the doctor for medical treatment because it may be necessary. As the symptoms are being relieved, I recommend taking this opportunity to recognize the work has just started, and begin to be curious on a deeper level about the process of a disease. Biography Atul Kumar Mehra is an Author and Director of the Jaagran Psychoanalysis and Wellness Centre. He also teaches yoga, meditation and dancing meditation. His present field of investigation is the mind. He works on subliminal messages with binaural tones and inspirational movies.

Exhaustion, grief, questioning and isolation can quickly impact all spheres of life; the parent-child relationship, the family system and the individual's self-concept if left unchecked. While institutional supports (e.g. case management, teaching, support groups, homecare, and financial programs) are essential in the accompaniment of families, the development of internal strategies for resilience is vital to the healthy coping of caregivers. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Therapeutic humor is any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. This intervention may enhance health or be used as a complimentary treatment of illness to facilitate healing or coping, whether emotional, cognitive, social or spiritual (AATH 2000). Humor can be a powerful method of gaining perspective and temporary emotional reprieve during difficult life experiences. For parents of a disabled or chronically ill child, humor can help momentarily detach from the heaviness of care, to connect with healthcare professionals and to normalize the absurd in a way that can validate the individual, promote their social participation and reinforce the positive elements of their parent-child relationship as well as those with other family members. The creation, expression and/or appreciation of humor anchors both caregiver and healthcare practitioner to their humanness. Conclusion & Significance: Drawing on case studies, humor theory and her own experience parenting a child with disabilities, this presentation serves to highlight the application of humor as a valuable tool to boost resilience in caregiver-parents and to elaborate how healthcare providers can effectively promote and use humor to facilitate caregiver coping and collaboration in care.

Establishing rapport and making psychological contact with people who consistently experience a variety of explicit traumas and more covert micro-aggressions based on their gender variance, diverse non-heterosexual identities and practices and whose relationships lie outside the traditional socially approved dyad is crucial if one is to make an impact as a positive psychologist on the help-seekers experience and to enable them to live more fully in the world. Few if any professional or para-professional mental health workers have more than a few hours on at best 'LGBT mental health issues' and this will exclude many people across a diverse array of other gender, sexuality and relational identities. We have pioneered sex positive, humanistically focussed training courses which adopt critical sexology perspectives to enhance resilience and which seek to depathologise and focus on sexual and relational health for various populations who have traditionally been the subject of mental health treatment. Our goal is to recognise individuals in their social context and enable helping professionals orient their practice towards building rapport, empowerment and self-actualisation. We will present ideas for curriculum development for inclusion into the training of mental health workers from a range of different disciplines. We will take a sex positive approach to viewing issues like BDSM, 'Sex and Porn Addiction' asexuality and lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-identities and offer a unique framework to equip staff with greater knowledge and confidence.

Sadguna C U Arts College for Girls, India Drug abuse is a complex contemporary social problem among youth. It is apparent that drug users have certain personality characteristics and they tend to be impulsive. Impulsivity leads to impaired coping mechanism of a human. It can be viewed as a mediator of vulnerability in those individuals and can be assumed to have difficulty in inhibiting responses. Drug addiction is not a medical problem alone. Medicine might be a control and it reduces the effects of withdrawal symptoms and may detoxify an addict, but it cannot correct the personality aberrations of the individual. Therefore an attempt was made in the present study to observe the efficacy of meditation and counselling on impulses of drug users. A sample of 60 drug users were included through incidental purposive sampling techniques, which were further classified into three groups i.e., 20 subjects for counselling group, 20 subjects for meditation group and 20 subjects in the control group. To measure impulses, IES test developed by Dombrose and Morton S Slobin (1958) was used. Findings of the study revealed that there is a positive impact of meditation and counselling techniques on impulses of drug users. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. The results also clearly indicate that intervention through meditation and counselling sessions decreased significantly the level of the impulse of drug users. It is apparent from the analysis that drug users have certain personality characteristics which encourage the drug users to intake drug. Drug users tend to be impulsive. It plays a very prevailing role in influencing the personality of drug users. The immediate gratification of need is their imperative personality attribute. They take the drug because they anticipate positive results such as a feeling of euphoria, excitation or energy. Meditation and counselling as a therapeutic technique were used to reduce the level of the impulse of a drug user. Meditation is the power which enables to resist our slavery to nature. Meditation brings infinite happiness among humans. Thus, meditation and counselling are effective strategies for controlling the impulses of the drug users.

Application of psychology is being a witness in multiple areas and is a matter of grave concern that, where we are needed most, there our place is being filled by scholars of other discipline. Have we ever paid attention to the thousands of P .G. students who yearly come out of 5000 colleges of about 200 universities? Are they being employed in the field of Psychology? The areas meant for psychologists are mentioned herein and are being encroached by other disciplines. One such area is the area of Special Education which teams with job opportunity and in replete with job satisfaction. The mandate given to RCI is to regulate and monitor services given to persons with disability and to standardize syllabi. Only one solution of all these issues is the role of psychologist in this area-they have behaviour assessment techniques, can counsel parents to bring their children to mainstream of society, can improve social interaction, awareness about misconceptions, initiating to establish special school in reference to inclusive education and application of behaviour modification techniques. UNICEF, few years back suggested that there are at least 93 million children with disabilities in the world. Intellectual impairment is a term used when a person has certain limitations in mental functioning and in skills such as communicating, taking care of oneself and social skills. It is generally present in an individual who has an IQ test score of approximately 70 or below. Inclusive education is the new concept of education in which the disabled children are taught with the normal children in the regular classrooms. It also involves removing barriers in the environment, communication, curriculum, teaching, socialization and assessment at all levels.

This consultancy was conducted in Jamaica and proposes a Parental Involvement Program designed to improve parental involvement of Jamaican parents using positive psychology theories. Parental styles in Jamaica are said to be mostly authoritarian and child-rearing practices are generally authoritarian, austere and abusive. Poor parent-child communication mainly due to cultural beliefs is another characteristic of the Jamaican parenting style. Mosby and Smith (2003) have also asserted that, this form of parenting has affected the psychosocial outcomes of Jamaican children and may have resulted in an increase in antisocial behavior in the society. Many studies have linked parenting programs to effective changes in parental attitudes, including those of Jamaican parents. Positive changes include decreases in parental anxiety and depression, improvement in parent child-relations and improvement in parental and maternal self confidence and identity. The parental program is made up of three components: A parent education program underpinned with positive psychological theories and interventions such as subjective well-being, parenting self-efficacy and self-regulation. A parent support group to assist parents in providing support to each other and a parental involvement program that will see parents actively involved in school activities and the educational life of students.

While the breathing process is automatic, the breath can be consciously controlled. Bringing awareness and control of the breath yields a powerful tool to induce a relaxed, calm, more focused state of being. This \"relaxation response\" can circumvent the \"fight, flight or freeze\" sympathetic nervous system response that individuals may be habituated to experiencing when faced with disruptive emotions or situations. Moments of mindfulness are moments of awareness, peace and stillness. Thus, working with the breath acts creates a bridge between the mind and the environment, bringing awareness to the present and providing space to objectively evaluate thought patterns and accept and experience emotions. From there, a more calm and awakened mind emerges- one that sees more clearly without distortion, so that thoughts and feelings can be experienced prima facie, from a point of objective and compassionate curiosity. Awareness in the moment supports appreciation of the moment, thus seeding cultivation of healthy nourishing positive psychology practices such as gratitude, mindful engagement, and compassion. In this workshop, participants will learn the tools of sama vritti (equal breathing) and 1:2 breathing that may be taught to clients to diffuse the stress response, improve mood, increase internal locus of control, cultivate mindfulness, gratitude and compassion and experience a more profound sense of grounded optimism.

The exposure is among the cognitive behavioural therapy of choice in the treatment of SP . The principle of exposure consists of confronting and accustoming the patient to the stress situations. It can be in vivo or imaginable. The Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) has advantages over imaginable or in vivo exposures, like it provides standardized and controlled environments, with scenes that can be repeated, achieving therapeutic goals; it is held within the office, preserving the privacy of the subject when he presents a sharp discomfort to experience real situations. Methodology: A VRE software for SP treatment was developed, (VRSP program) to evaluate and improve it based on quantitative and qualitative analysis. The scenes created anxiety-generating social situations in three dimensions (3D). Two virtual scenarios were created: One on a street and one at a party. The scenes consisted of walking down the street, approaching people on the street, entering the party, engaging in conversation at the party, welcoming guests at the party, and talking and giving a speech at the party. 21 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of SP took part in the trial and the treatment consisted of up to 12 sessions of exposure to relevant images, each session lasting 50 minutes. Findings: Improvements in social anxiety were seen in all scales and instruments used, including at follow-up 6 months after the end of treatment and the average number of sessions was seven, as the participants habituated rapidly to the process. Conclusion: The VRSP program (English, Spanish and Portuguese versions), can reduce social anxiety, leads to greater treatment adherence, so can be a useful tool for therapists to have in their offices.

As with any democracy, comments can be made about any regulation either supporting or countering the guideline. So, following a twenty year course of moving from more rehabilitative interventions to interventional procedures and opioid analgesia as first line treatment, we now are faced with reality of an economic and social burden on American society of $78.5 billion annually for the challenges of prescription opioid overdose abuse and dependence. In a summary of the CDC Guidelines for Opioids for Chronic Pain from March 2016, some clinical reminders are noted: 1. Opioids are not first-line or routine therapy for chronic pain; 2. Establish and measure goals for pain and function; 3. Discuss benefits and risks and availability of non-opioid therapies with patient; 4. Non-pharmacologic therapy and non-opioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain; 5. If opioids are used, they should be combined with non-pharmacologic therapy and non-opioid pharmacologic therapy. Since interdisciplinary pain services have for the most part been erased from our medical system, the option of a non-medical intervention becomes inconsequential, unavailable or not financially possible. There is some evidence with integrative care models that behavioral health or medical psychology options are emerging. The cultural conditioning and medical path however implies \"relief \" especially with the persistent use of measuring arbitrary pain levels at every visit. At some point as most of us have observed, the magic number of \"eight over ten\" (8/10) becomes the consolidated message, \"my pain is not controlled\" . And for curious psychologists, the possibility of controlling pain becomes the overarching question. After a thirty year career in pain medicine/behavioral medicine ranging from pain rehabilitation programs to interventional centers, I had the opportunity of coming to Canada and observe the benefits of meeting Jackie Gardner Nix MD and seeing the benefits of mindfulness training for chronic pain. Her program was established in Canada in 2002, and now with over 12,000 patients having participated, the outcome data is convincing. I initiated this Canadian program in the Orthopaedic practice. I am aligned within Virginia and would like to share my observations, what this brings to the pain treatment arena within our medical culture, and the benefit for patients. Mindfulness is changing the landscape of pain treatment and offers hope within this rather complicated trajectory. My presentation will share my observations, data from patient outcome measures and comments of the regional physicians involved.

There is relief that the intense pressure of social conformity is removed, but apprehension when looking into the dark abyss of what the future holds. Current Australian research on the quality of life of young adults with autism paints an extraordinarily bleak picture. Y oung people on the spectrum who have completed or stopped attending school have an unemployment rate between 45 and 50%. They have very low rates of tertiary education participation and only a 28% completion rate in post-secondary courses. The most astounding statistic, and one which illustrates the sense of isolation experienced by this cohort, is that on average, adolescents on the autism spectrum spend 68 hours per week engaged in solitary technology based activities. That amounts to over 9 hours each day. Digital creative arts practice is grounded in both an aesthetic framework and a diverse range of ever changing and evolving software tools. And this shared vocabulary of authorship is available to an army of creative autodidacts playing and learning till the wee hours as they build cathedrals of aesthetic and technical knowledge from sources as diverse as online manuals, Y ou Tube tutorials and FAQ chat groups. The altered states project at Queensland University of Technology was a pilot post-school creative media project which sought to introduce these hibernating digital creative on the autism spectrum to undergraduate studies in the creative industries by asking the fundamental question, \"What are you best at in the room?\" The decision to focus on the development of individual strengths rather than deficits is at the core of all community arts practice, and in sharp contrast to most clinical programs which typically devise strategies which address specific areas of need. The prolonged hibernation of autistic teenagers into bedroom digital caves following secondary school is a phenomenon many families observe. This long-term exclusion from social contact with school friends, and in some cases family members, can herald erosion in self-esteem, confidence and social functioning that without intervention, can entrench experiences of social anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. The altered states project brought young people with autism together with creative artists in the fields of music, 3D animation, film making and sound design to create an immersive new work to be premiered at the opening of QUT's new creative industries precinct. Motivation and enjoyment were key ingredients in the psychosocial outcomes of the program with emotional wellbeing, social participation and friendship being key contributors to the success of the project. Biography Michael Whelan is an Academic Writer, Musician and Autism Advocate. In addition to his interdisciplinary live arts practice, he has written and directed a range of short films on topics ranging from post school transition for young people with autism to youth at risk and bullying. In addition to his memoir, \"The Other Country: A Father's Journey with Autism\" which was published by Pan Macmillan in 2008, and he also wrote the documentary film, \"What are you doing ?\", the educational film for school audience on the topic of social inclusion and autism was distributed to every school in Australia and was screened at the United Nations in New York as part of World Autism Day activities in April, 2013. He has worked with Autism Queensland as their Manager of post-school services and was responsible for the development and delivery of Studio G, a post-school transition program for young adults on the autism spectrum, based at the State Library of Queensland. m.whelan@qut.edu.auMichael Whelan, Toronto, Canada17th World Summit on Positive Psychology, Psychotherapy & Cognitive Behavioral Sciences Volume 7, Issue 2 (Suppl) J Psychol Psychother ISSN: 2161-0487 JPP 2017 May 01-03, 2017 Digital game: A scale to evaluate the perioperative cognitive function (MentalPlus\u00ae) L\u00edvia S S Valentin University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine, Brazil Introduction: Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) is a common multifactorial adverse event frequently in elderly patients. POCD diagnosis usually demands a long neuropsychological battery and specific professional to evaluate the results data as a neuropsychologist. As a tentative to overcome that issue, MentalPlus\u00ae video game was developed as a tool to assess cognitive function and future rehabilitation. Aim: The primary study objective was MentalPlus\u00ae reliability evaluation to assess cognition in healthy volunteers. Methods: 163 volunteers were randomized to play MentalPlus\u00ae versions A and B with a week interval between both moments. Mini-Mental state examination was applied to assess the volunteers' mental state, and we excluded those with scores below 18 or 23 related to a determined educational level. MentalPlus\u00ae applicability and reproducibility were evaluated by kappa index and McNemar test. Results: The patients had mean age of 36\u00b116 years; 46% male; school level mean of 5\u00b12 years, the mean income of 4.6\u00b13 Brazilian minimum wage and the Mini-Mental score of 28\u00b13, for an expectation of more than 25\u00b13. The MentalPlus\u00ae A and B versions results revealed the subsequent kappa coefficients for reliability tests. For general cognitive function, kappa coefficient was 0.7122 (p<0.005); selective attention and alternating attention presented 0.4004 and 0.3998 (p<0.005); long-term memory and inhibitory control had comparable coefficients: 0.4103 and 0.4406 (p<0.005); executive function disclosed a kappa coefficient of 0.4406, through construct inhibitory control. The expected cognitive function scores in MentalPlus\u00ae were expressed as a mean and standard deviation and condence interval of 95%, =0.05. MentalPlus\u00ae versions A and B values were similar when compared with values adopted by researchers. Conclusion: MentalPlus\u00ae digital game presented reliable evidence for cognition evaluation. It might be a future accessible tool for POCD evaluation and probable future rehabilitation.

Such an adjustment process is often complicated and lengthy, and may even elicit undesirable consequences. Psychological resilience is thus proposed as an adaptive psychological quality that fosters effective adjustment to stressful life changes. In the extant literature, researchers have conceptualized psychological resilience in a vast variety of ways. Our research team applied this construct to the context of coping, and operationalized it by assessing the levels of coping flexibility. Grounded in the person-situation inter-actionist approach, coping flexibility refers to the ability to deploy coping strategies that meet the specific demands of an array of stressful life events. This construct comprises three components: (a) cognitive flexibility, (b) response flexibility, and (c) a good match or \"fit\" between strategy characteristics and situational demands. Our research team has evaluated the effectiveness of this construct in explaining individual differences in psychological adjustment to stressful life transitions. As consistently shown in the findings derived from our research programs, coping flexibility was positively associated with a range of desirable mental and physical health outcomes among both community and patient samples, thus attesting to the adaptive role of coping flexibility in psychological adjustment to stressful life changes. Biography Cecilia Cheng is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong. She specializes in personality, social, health, and cross-cultural psychology. She received the ICP Early Career Research Award in 2000, Fulbright Senior Scholar Award in 2009, Cambridge Hughes Hall Fellowship in 2013, and RGC Humanities and Social Sciences Prestigious Fellowship in 2015. She was an Associate Editor of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Personality Processes and Individual Differences section). At the University of Hong Kong, her research team seeks to enhance both mental and physical health for quality living for Hong Kong people. To realize this aim, the team applies theoretical frameworks from personality and social psychology to the understanding of real-life problems such as stress and coping, psychosomatic disorders, information technology addiction, emotional disorders, and health-risk behaviors. The research group also organizes workshops, courses, and lectures to promote public awareness regarding mental and physical health. ceci-cheng@hku.hkCecilia Cheng, J Psy chol Toronto, Canada17th World Summit on Positive Psychology, Psychotherapy & Cognitive Behavioral Sciences Volume 7, Issue 2 (Suppl) J Psychol Psychother ISSN: 2161-0487 JPP 2017 May 01-03, 2017 Mindfulness, brainwaves and happiness Ellie Wright EGW Research Institute LLC, USA This research includes PubMed recent publications that focus on the underlying the mechanisms of mindfulness meditation and its effects on emotional acceptance and on reducing cognitive rigidity. The neuroscience and clinical testing data was collected with the purpose of evaluating the effects of mindful meditations on psychological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional functioning. Mindfulness therapy has become a promising field in addressing generalized stress and specific addictions. Some findings provide evidence for changes in brain oscillatory activity during meditation to increase our understanding of the cortical processes. From the framework of preventative science and integrated neuroscience this research explains the impact the mindfulness on psychological outcomes. The investigative methods provide information on the changes in brain waves activity on different areas of the brain during the moment of awareness and emotional acceptance. Numerous studies suggest meditation mindfulness reduces decline of cognitive domain and brain structure and builds resilience .

Integrative grief treatment: A comparison between different generations of single cases, adults and children, facing similar mental suffering Mara Fantinati Italian Association EMDR, Italy The preliminary research included comparison of single clinical cases, which have in common the traumatic loss of a key relative, belonging to different evolutionary ages, divided into two categories: Adults and children. The aim of this study was to observe how the EMDR protocol may have a positive impact on the reorganisation of cognitive-emotional-somatic experiences, potentially failing to prevent reactivation in adulthood, managed with dysfunctional strategies and possible hospitalisation. It is assumed that it is never too late to grieve, but to take a psychotherapeutic intervention with the use of EMDR both near the traumatic episode and at a young age helps to increase awareness of functional memory and to remedy the event in the evolution path of the person. Clinical cases were administered the following tests at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. For adults: The Impact of Event Revised Impact of Scale (CRIES; S.P .Perrin, R.Meiser-Stedman, P .Smith-2005), Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale (A-DES; J.Arstrong, F.W .Putnam, E.Bernstein, 2004). The adults participated in Skill Training Groups (Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, DBT, M.M.Liehan), during the EMDR individual treatment. The conclusions highlight the need to address traumatic memories as soon as possible and invite psychotherapists to include, among the primary objectives in the course of work on trauma intervention with the EMDR protocol in order to speed up the well-being of the person and avoid hospital admissions .

However, practice is still at a basic level. Doctors without borders organization have revealed a lack of psychological and mental health care practices in Lebanon, following its intervention during the 2006 war. Furthermore, mental well-being which falls within the realm of community psychology - a discipline which was developed in the U.S. and later spread to Europe-requires psychologists to apply their knowledge in society and communities. Y et, practitioner intervention in the Lebanese social context remains quite limited. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: The present study is devoted to the concept of mental health - a major concern of society and various fields of science such as psychology and sociology, philosophy - with a focus on the criteria involved in achieving development and growth: global life satisfaction, wellbeing, self-esteem and resilience. The complementarity of physical and mental health is also highlighted, as human beings need to be studied as a whole entity. In addition, we focus on the need to promote the quality of life of individuals and their communities in a societal framework. The basic concepts of community psychology are discussed, followed by a survey undertaken amongst 60 young Lebanese participants in order to study the various factors involved in mental health. Findings: Our survey findings and statistical data analysis have shown that 93.5% of young Lebanese have not received adequate education in the mental health field, nor have they received any community-based psychological intervention. Conclusion & Significance: Results show that, by bolstering one's self-confidence, well-being, resilience, problem solving abilities and social skills, in this context our role is to contribute to the prevention of certain mental health problems.

As a former crisis worker, there is a unique and relevant journey of finding the boundaries, resilience and at times limitless transformation of the mind. To be resilient, you must explore the depths of your emotions, mind, body, spirit and environment and navigating the twists and turns to find coping strategies that align and heal the parts of you that are wounded, falling apart and at times exploring new frontiers. Not everyone on your team makes it through with you, and no one prepares you for that truth, that the shift in worldview that occurs after you have picked up the emotional or physical pieces of individuals impacted by trauma. In the past, there has been minimal preparation for the emotional weight of telling children and families that their loved ones won't be making it home or explaining that there is no answer as to why someone took their life, when someone takes your hand and asks you to pray beside the body of their loved one who is lying in the middle of the living room or while comforting parents after finding out their children have been abused. For decades mind and body wellness practices have not been a mandatory or at times optional avenue when being trained to do this work or after entering in the field. But this is changing. Mindfulness, meditation, tai chi, yoga and other holistic practices are entering into these work environments and shifting cultures, beliefs and well-being of the individuals who have signed up to assist others in crisis. But we must understand why it is important and valuable for the worker, services provider or the officer to be well and have the tools.

Treatment methods for mental disorders that exclude positive personal and interpersonal functioning have shown to be ineffective and risk aggravating or prolonging the disorder. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Initially developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in the 1970's at the University of California, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a language-based methodology of effective communication and understanding. NLP has recently gained popularity within private sector coaching and counselling as a method for communication and personal development used by business managers, trainers, sales people, market researchers, counsellors, consultants and more. The increasing use and application of NLP has given rise to recent academic research and examination of NLP as an approach within education, communication and positive counselling. Research now demonstrates that the use of NLP may be a powerful praxis in the prevention and treatment of mental and physical disorders. NLP has shown to promote general health, relieve depression, decrease anxiety, increase social function and remedy physical problems. Conclusion & Significance: While mental health disorders cover a broad range, a focus on positive development of individual thought processes and/or social functions has shown to be a potentially powerful and effective methodology in both the prevention and/or treatment of mental disorders. NLP methodologies for counselling can be used successfully to assist individuals develop positive personal and interpersonal functioning, which can help to prevent and treat mental disorders.

Practicing positive CBT reveals how traditional CBT can become positive CBT by shifting the focus of therapy from what is wrong with clients to what is right with them, and from what is not working to what is, thus creating a more optimistic process that empowers clients and therapists to flourish. Drawing on insights and techniques from positive psychology and solution-focused brief therapy, Fredrike Bannink reveals how positive CBT combines the best elements of change-based and meaning-based psychotherapeutic approaches to offer a new perspective on traditional CBT. This transition represents an important shift from problem analysis to goal analysis, from a focus on deficits and the learning of new behaviours to one that builds on resources and competences clients already possess and from reducing distress to building success. After the workshop the attendants will have: 1. Knowledge of Positive CBT and how it is different from traditional CBT, 2. Skills to enhance positive emotions and hopeful and optimistic conversations, 3. Practical Positive CBT tools (e.g. positive FBA). The author also discusses the following points: 1. What is Positive CBT? 2. How is Positive CBT different from traditional CBT and how can it be combined? 3. What is the role of the Positive CBT therapist? 4.

In addition, ST is based on a model of early maladaptive schemas (EMS), modes and the basic core needs and their fate during the life course. Therefore, ST in terms of technical and strategic variant of CBT seems to be also and especially in the field of child and adolescent therapy particularly suited to generate action-guiding, diagnostic and therapeutic concept. In this workshop, first the schema therapeutic conceptual model (schemas, modes, coping strategies), the underlying theory (central importance of core needs in the context of developmental tasks) and requirements in the therapeutic attitude (e.g., concept of limited reparenting and empathic confrontation) are briefly outlined. Related to the children's age one of the 18 schemas described by Y oung are outlined with their typical child and adolescent cognitions, coping strategies and parental characteristics. In a glance, schema therapeutic strategies with younger patients are demonstrated: Working with drawings, board-games, using storytelling and fairy tale therapy techniques, cartoons, marionettes, sand-play, metaphors and working with finger puppets. Another focus is laid on the work with parents (Schema Coaching). The participants will learn how to conduct a mode interview with children using finger puppets, hand puppets, people or character puppets, living puppets, marionettes or other play figures .

Parents are praised for things that they are already doing, which effectively manage their children's behavior and suggestions are made in those areas, where they feel that they experience difficulties. Whilst the therapist brings 'expert' knowledge to the sessions, parents know their child best, so that the two work collaboratively in sessions. Parent training is an active process of learning new skills; in the clinic/during the sessions parents practice these skills with a member of the team in an adjacent room. Parent training is the treatment of choice for children with oppositional problems and known to be very effective for reducing behavioural problems. It also increases sensitive responding to the primary mechanism for increasing secure attachments and improving child-carer relations. Individual-based parent-training/education programmes are recommended in the management of children with conduct disorders only in situations, where there are particular difficulties in engaging with the parents or a family's needs are too complex to be met by group-based parent-training/education programme. PIPT is a 1:1 intervention for children with complex conduct disorder, primarily aimed at children aged 3-8. It is designed to promote positive child/parent relationships, to improve pro-social behavior and to reduce undesirable behavior. During the intervention process, parents identify own treatment goals and the sessions include modeling, role-play and home practice/work. Six different skills are practiced/delivered through PIPT; attending, praise/rewards, selective ignoring, clear/calm commands, consequences and time-out. Overall, the parenting intervention takes 6 to 8 sessions with 1-hour duration each and the structure of sessions include; review, introducing new skills (rehearse and role-play is done where necessary), live coaching (therapist through ear bug or within the same room if there aren't a separate one way mirror room available), feedback and home practice given .

And then things happen because you asked for it. In Laughter Wellness, we do not react to a joke or another condition. We choose to laugh because we can. Besides a choice, Laughter Wellness is a recent interactive practice that involves individuals and groups as a context to heal. It focuses on developing a positive attitude and is designed to improve physical, mental, emotional and especially social wellbeing and integration. It is also a way of life. While getting us to a state from \"I can't to \"I can\" , Laughter Wellness provides a channel for many physiological changes to occur. It is a method that opens our inner physical and mental pharmacy. When combined with exercise, and activities like diaphragmatic breathing, clapping and affirmations, then the positive impact on our health tremendously increases. Many examples can confirm its value.
