A public health emergency ( is defined as \"an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition caused by bioterrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease, or (a) novel and highly fatal infectious agent or biological toxin\". Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 4 STANDARD DECLARATION VS. PUBLIC HEALTH DECLARATION STANDARD DISASTER DECLARATION PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARATION A governor may declare a state of public health emergency within their jurisdiction when it is believe d that an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition, caused by bioterrorism, epidemic/pandemic disease, or highly fatal infectious agent. A governor (or a mayor) may declare a state of emergency within their jurisdiction when it is believe d that a disaster has occurred or may be imminent th at is severe enough to require state aid to suppleme nt local resources in preventing or alleviating damages, loss, hardship or suffering. STATE DECLARATION Under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may declare a Public Health Emergency (PHE) if they determine, after consulting with such public health officials as may be necessary, that: A disease or disorder may present a PHE, OR A PHE, including significant outbreaks of infectious diseases or bioterrorist attacks, otherwise exists. https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/Pages/phe -qa.aspx The declaration would be routed through our Regional Emergency Coordinator (REC) to the HHS secretary. In the United States, a public health emergency declaration releases resources meant to handle an actual or potential public health crisis. There are two types of disaster declarations provided for in the Stafford Act : emergency declarations and major disaster declarations. Both declaration types authorize the President to provide supplemental federal disaster a ssistance. All requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the G overnor of the affected state. https://www.fema.gov/disaster -declaration -proc ess The Stafford Act created the system in place today by which a presidential disaster declaration or an emergency declaration triggers financial and physical assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

This collaborative system is built and sustained through daily engagement, strong partnership, and mutually beneficial relationships. In the event of a disaster or a Public Health E mergency, this collaborative system coordinates with Health Care Coalitions, emergency management and first responders to: Communicate timely, accurate, and actionable public information . Provide the environment to make decisions that reduce the impact of disasters and emergencies on people, property and the environment. Manage survivors' expectations of the scope and availability of state and federal assistance programs. When an event causes damage of a sufficient severity to warrant Federal assistance and such assistance is requested, the President may issue a disaster or emergency declaratio n. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 8 EMERGENCY DECLARATION PROCESS IN ARIZONA AT LOCAL LEVEL Arizona is a 'Home Rule' state. Roughly 17,000 local governments operate within Arizona's borders. These include counties, tribes, municipalities (cities and towns), and districts. Some local g overnments enjoy greater autonomy through home rule and have power to make a public health emergency declaration at the local level : https://definitions.uslegal.com/h/home -rule EMERGENCY DECLARATION IS MULTILAYERED PROCESS IN ARIZONA REQUIRES APPROVAL LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY STATE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATE LEGISLATURE The Governor may proclaim a state of emergency after a political subdivision (city, town, county, tribe, state agency) has passed a resolution stating that an emergency exists within their jurisdiction(s) and have been able to demonstrate that the incident is above and beyond their capability t o recover from without assistance from the State. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 9 PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARATION -CRITERIA Deciding that a public health emergency (PHE) exists What is a PHE? A public health emergency (PHE) is any adverse event (natural or man - made) that compromises the health of the population and has the potential to cause widespread illness. If the Director determines that a public health emergency exists, he/she may authorize investigat ion of the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or disorder underlying the public health emergency. Once the determination of PHE is made, the Department of Health Services Director works with sister government agencies to submit a joint letter to the state Governor requesting PHE Declaration by the State. If the Governor declares a PHE, additional funding for advanced surveillance and intervention activities may become available.

When local jurisdictions cannot contain an incident , the Governor may declare a state of emergency and invoke the state's emergency plan to increase individual and public resources as required. INCIDENT ESCALATES - Stafford Act Presidential Disaster Declaration (Title III Page -19): The State Coordinating Officer (SCO) will work with the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to create a plan for state requirements, including those that are beyond state capability. Governor can request resources from other states through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC ). When an event causes damage, or is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant federal disaster assistance and such assistance is requested, the President may issue a major disaster or emergency declara tion. PRESIDENT MAY ISSUE A DISASTER OR EMERGENCY DECLARATION. Under the Stafford Act , states are also responsible for requesting Federal emergency assistance for community governments within their jurisdiction. SEOC and HEOC will support local EOCs and provide multi -agency coordination.

NOTARY PUBLIC (Page -5) Vanessa Renee Gonzales -Notary Public Arizona - Maricopa County Commission # 595757 Expires Feb 21 -2025 Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 32 z BACKGROUND The Arizona Surge Line facilitates the interfacility transfer of patients during an emergency hospital or healthcare facility surge. It was created (on April 21, 2020) to optimize Arizona's patient management through the COVID -19 pandemic, but could be applied to any threat that would lead to a healthcare surge. MISSION OF THE SURGE LINE (*FOR COVID -19 RESPONSE) The mission of the call line is to work with Arizona healthcare facilities to do the following, with efficiency, consistency and ethical consideration: o Expedite transfer of patients with presumed or confirmed COVID -19* to a higher level of care. o Expedite transfer of patients with presumed or confirmed COVID -19* to a lower level of care. o Equalize and optimize patient numbers across hospital facilities. o Optimize clinician time spent doing patient care. o Support clinicians managing COVID - 19* and end-of-life care. SCOPE OF THE SURGE LINE The Arizona Surge Line is a 24/7 toll - free call line that acts as a \"doorway\" for clinicians to other facility transfer centers and independent clinical consultants. The Arizona Surge Line is a free service to hospital providers and systems. It is facilitated by the Arizona Department of Health Services and protocolized by the input from hospital facilities and post -acute care facilities in Arizona. KEYS TO SUCCESS ON THE ARIZONA SURGE LINE Initiate early, before hospitals overwhelmed Hospital bed visibility Executive Order for participation Transparency of data for all hospital partners Steering committee comprised of all hospitals Clear governance Arizona Governor, Douglas. A. Ducey, issued an Executive Order 2020 - 38 (ensuring statewide access to care for COVID -19 cases) on May 28, 2020 as follows : 1.A hospital, as defined in Arizona Administrative Code R9 -10-101, shall: a.Utilize the Arizona Surge Line for interfacility transfer of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 outside of their healthcare system; b.Accept and transfer patients as directed by the Arizona Surge Line, wh en clinically appropriate and resources allow; c.Create internal protocols to complete the bed placement within thirty minutes; and d.Electronically update bed and ventilator status in a format and frequency specified by the Arizona Department of Health Serv ices. 2.Alternate care sites designated by State or local health departments shall: a.Utilize the Arizona Surge Line for interfacility transfer of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID -19; b.Accept and transfer patients as directed by the Arizona Surge Lin e when clinically appropriate and resources allow; c.Create internal protocols to complete the bed placement within thirty minutes; and d.Electronically update bed and ventilator status in a format and frequency as specified by the Arizona Department of Health Services 3.The Arizona Department of Insurance, in conjunction with the Arizona Department of Health Services, shall require that all insurers regulated by the State cover COVID -19 transfer and treatment to and from all hospitals, healthcare instituti ons, or alternate care sites designated by the Arizona Department of Health Services at in -network rates without regard to whether the facility is in -network if the patient's transfer is facilitated by the Arizona Surge Line. Transfer and treatment shall b e covered on the basis of admission date, and in -network coverage for treatment shall remain in place for the duration of a patient's admission facilitated by the Arizona Surge Line ... Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 33 EXAMPLE 1 MAY REQUIRE STATE OR FEDERL EMERGENCY DECLARATION CRISIS STANDARD OF CARE (CSC) PLAN BACKGROUND Arizona's CSC Plan was originally published in 2015; the 4th edition of the CSC plan we published in 2021. Statewide CSC activation will only occur during the most extreme disasters that dramatically impact the healthcare system. A CSC disaster has the following attributes: 1) most or all of the community's infrastructure is impacted; 2) local officials are unable to perform their usual roles for a period of time, extending well beyond the initial aftermath of the incident; 3) most or all routine community functions are immediately and simultaneously disrupted; and 4) surrounding communities a re similarly affected, and thus there are no regional resources (IOM, 2012) CONVENTIONAL CONTINGENCY CRISIS SPACE Usual patient care space fully utilized Patient care areas repurposed Facility unsafe/damaged or non -patient care areas (classrooms, etc.) used for patients STAFF Usual staff called in broader groups of patients, change in responsibilities or documentation, etc.) Trained staff unavailable or unable to adequately care for volume of patients even with extension techniques SUPPLIES Cached and usual supplies used Conservation, adaptation, and substitution of supplies Critical supplies lacking, possible reallocation of life-sustaining resources STANDARD OF CARE Usual care Functionally equivalent care Crisis Standard of Care HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? Disaster occurs or escalates to crisis level Indicators for Statewide CSC One of more counties/regions request state to implement CSC Medical countermeasures depleted Patient transfers insufficient or impossible, statewide County resource requests unfillable or undeliverable Multiple healthcare access points impacted ADHS Director considers statewide CSC Activation Considerations for Statewide CSC Activation The Governor's Office or ADHS Director initiates CSC activation Local Health Officer or healthcare coalition asks ADHS to activate CSC ADHS Director evaluates any local, state, federal disaster declarations that may be in place ADHS authorizes CSC activation CSC Activation Steps State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee ( SDMAC ) members and required subject matter experts (SMEs) identified ADHS emergency conference call with SDMAC members ADHS staff notifies other local, state, tribal and federal partners SDMAC works with public information officers in the Joint Information Center (JIC) to distribute messaging about forthcoming CSC SDMAC notifies healthcare coalitions to support CSC at the local level SDMAC develops CSC Guidelines SDMAC Activities Recommend priorities for allocation of medical resources Recommend EMS, triage, and clinical protocols (e.g., ventilator use) Coordinate with healthcare coalitions and EOCs, as appropriate Work with JIC/PIO staff to develop public messaging regarding CSC Distribute priorities and protocols to healthcare facilities, providers, and EMS Work with JIC/public information officers to ensure timely delivery of public messaging describing CSC implementation at healthcare facilities Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 34 CRISIS STANDARD OF CARE PLAN (CONTINUED ) WHAT DOES CRISIS STANDARD OF CARE ACTIVATION MEANS FOR THE HC FACILITIES, COUNTIES AND STATE? TACTICS FOR HEALTHCARE FACILIT IES TACTICS FOR COUNTIES TACTICS FOR THE STATE Conventional Tactics for Healthcare Facilities Place facility Incident Command staff on standby Notify county PHEP and/or emergency management partners of conventional surge conditions Contingency Tactics for Healthcare Facilities Activate incident command and Emergency Operations Plan/Emergency Response Plan Notify county PHEP and/or emergency management partners of contingency surge conditions Crisis Tactics for Healthcare Facilities Notify PHEP/emergency management partners of crisis level Consider alternate care sites Implement facility CSC plans and procedures Re-use and repurpose supplies Assign primary, secondary, and tertiary Triage Officers, as needed Conventional Tactics for Counties Place emergency operations/incident command staff on standby Notify state PHEP and emergency management partners of surge conditions Contingency Tactics for Counties Activate EOC Participate in unified command with on scene operations and state EOC Process space, staff, and supply requests from facilities Crisis Tactics for Counties Activate state -designated healthcare coalition to implement CSC locally Participate in public information activities with the J oint Information Center (JIC) Activate medical countermeasure, medical materiel, volunteer management, and alternate care site plans Conventional Tactics for the State Place emergency operations/incident command staff on standby Notify statewide partners of surge conditions Contingency Tactics for the State Activate state EOCs Participate in unified command with on scene operations and local EOCs Process space, staff, and supply resource requests from local jurisdictions Notify SDMAC committee of possible activation Notify federal partners of medical surge Crisis Tactics for the State Activate SDMAC to develop and implement CSC Direct statewide public information activities Activate state medical countermeasure, medical materiel, volunteer mana gement, and alternate care site/system plans Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 35 EXAMPLE 2 REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION (1135 WAIVERS ) BACKGROUND Under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act (SSA), the HHS Secretary may waive or modify certain requirements as necessary to ensure to the maximum extent feasible that, in an emergency area during an emergency period, sufficient health care items and services are available to meet the needs of individuals enrolled in SSA programs (including Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP) and that providers of such services in good faith who are unable to comply with certain statutory requirements are reimbursed and exempted from sanctions for noncompliance, absent fraud or abuse. There must also be a Presidential declaration of an emergency or disaster in order to exercise this authority. HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? When the President declares a disaster or emergency under the Stafford Act or National Emergencies Act and the HHS Secretary declares a public health emergency under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary is authorized to waive certain requirements for health care providers. 1135 waivers can only be granted in a Federally - identified disaster area. WHAT DOES 1135 WAIVER DO? The following requirements m ay be waived or modified: (1) (A) conditions of participation or other certification requirements for an individual health care provider or types of providers, (B) program participation and similar requirements for an individual health care provider or typ es of providers, and (C) pre -approval requirements; (2) requirements that physicians and other health care professionals be licensed in the State in which they provide such services, if they have equivalent licensing in another State and are not affirmativ ely excluded from practice in that State or in any State a part of which is included in the emergency area; (3) actions under section 1867 (relating to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor) for \u2014 (A) a transfer of an individual who has not been stabilized in violation of subsection (c) of such section if the transfer arises out of the circumstances of the emergency; (B) the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening in an alternative locatio n\u2014 (i) pursuant to an appropriate State emergency preparedness plan; or (ii) in the case of a public health emergency described in subsection (g)(1)(B) that involves a pandemic infectious disease, pursuant to a State pandemic preparedness plan or a plan referred to in clause (i), whichever is applicable in the State; (4) sanctions under section 1877(g) (relating to limitations on physician referral); (5) deadlines and timetables for performance of required activities, except that such deadlines and timeta bles may only be modified, not waived; (6) limitations on payments under section 1851(i) for health care items and services furnished to individuals enrolled in a Medicare + Choice plan by health care professionals or facilities not included under such pla n; and (7) sanctions and penalties that arise from the noncompliance with the following requirements (as promulgated under the authority of section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996[135] (42 U.S. C. 1320d -2 note) \u2014 (A) section 164.510 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, relating to \u2014 (i) requirements to obtain a patient's agreement to speak with family members or friends; and (ii) the requirement to honor a request to opt out of the facility directory; (B) section 164.520 of such title, relating to the requirement to distribute a notice; or (C) section 164.522 of such title, relating to \u2014 (i) the patient's right to request privacy restrictions; and (ii) the patient's right to request confidential communications. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 36 EXAMPLE 3 REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION EMERGENCY PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM (EPAP) What is EPAP? BACKGROUND The purpose of EPAP is to provide pharmaceutical supplies, limited durable medical equipment (DME), and personnel during emergency response operations. As directed by and in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS) will activate a federally qualified contractor to administer a national network of pharmacies and sufficient personnel to address emergency response requirements through EPAP. HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? EPAP can only be used in a federally identified disaster area. FEMA, or its designee, will identify evacuee populations who may be eligible for EP AP prescription and DME assistance. EPAP provides \"essential assistance\" to support State and local jurisdictions as defined in Section 403 of the Stafford Act, 42 USC 5170b. HOW DOES IT WORK? 1)EPAP helps people affected by a disaster who do not have health insurance. 2)EPAP only covers items prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider. 3)Eligible people can receive a free 30 -day supply of their medications when EPAP is activated. 4)Prescriptions can be renewed under EPAP for free every 30 days for as long as EPAP is active. 5)People can also use the program to receive vaccinations or to replace certain medical supplies or some forms of medical equipment that were lost or damaged because of the emergency or while evacuating. 6)HHS/FEMA would incur no c osts for prescription drugs or DME until after the product is dispensed by a participating pharmacy to an eligible individual. 7)The State incurs a 25% cost share - State signature is required for EPAP activation. 8)Product inventory dispensed through the EPAP will flow through the normal supply chain distribution, so neither FEMA nor its shelter operations will be responsible for physical possession, storage, or distribution of product inventory. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 37 EXAMPLE 4 REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION FEDERAL MEDICAL STATION (FMS) BACKGROUND A FMS consists of equipment and supplies to operate a temporary medical facility for up to 250 patients within an appropriate \"building of opportunity.\" Supplies are adequate for three days of clinical care before resupply is required. FMSs provide surge clinical bed capacity to meet patients' needs for low acuity or chronic medical and nursing c are, and behavioral health care. FMSs require significant logistical wrap around services, as well as proper staffing (local, state, or federal) to support disaster -impacted health systems. Often, an FMS supports a health system by temporarily meeting th e needs of patients displaced from their usual local or home health care options and those evacuated from skilled nursing facilities. Before an FMS is shipped to the requestor, the \"building of opportunity\" and facility point of contact must have been iden tified, and the facility assessed for suitability (based on building space and layout, accessibility, utilities, hygiene facilities, safety, potable hot and cold water, and other attributes). The logistical wrap around services must also have been planned and coordinated. These include, but are not limited to security, material handling equipment, housekeeping and hazardous waste removal, patient feeding, laundry services, medical oxygen, availability of EMS, and mortuary support. The State will work with local emergency management on site location if not previously approved. HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? The decision to deploy an FMS occurs after the depletion of local health system capability during a large -scale public health emergency or other disaster. Local public health, emergency management, ADHS, HHS, and other experts evaluate the situation and determine the need for additional sub - acute care within the disaster area. If required, the Governor requests the FMS through the HHS Regional Emergency Coordinator (REC). The St ate incurs a 25% cost share - State signature is required for FMS activation. Federal, state and local Public Health/Emergency Management will discuss potential location s of FMS, based on specific selection criteria. Once an FMS request has been approved, e quipment and supplies will be delivered within 24 -48 hours. A typical set up normally takes up to 24 hours. HOW DOES IT WORK? A 50 -bed FMS is shipped in one 53' tractor trailer and one refrigerated box truck; it requires about 15,000 square feet of climate controlled space. A 250 -bed FMS is shipped in four 53' tractor trailers and one refrigerated box truck ; it requires about 40,000 square feet of climate controlled space. Number of beds requested is flexible based on identified needs. Each FMS includes a three -day supply of medical and pharmaceutical resources. Materi el arrive s packed in durable tri -wall shipping containers that must be unloaded, moved into the facility, unpacked and set up. Staffing for an FMS may be provided using displaced local, regional or EMAC providers, or may be provided by the federal government. Primary federal staff are Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 38 EXAMPLE 5 REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION NATIONAL AMBULANCE CONTRACT BACKGROUND The purpose of the Federal National Ambulance and Para -transit Support Services contract is to provide a full array of licensed ground and air ambulance services and para -transit services that may be ordered as needed to supplement the federal a nd military response to a disaster, act of terrorism, or other public health emergency. HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? State/locals identify numbers needing specific type of support during planning - advanced life support ALS, basic life support (BLS), and para - transit. State incorporates EMAC assets in planning. The State has to demonstrate that no EMAC assets are available. State works with ASPR Region IX Regional Emergency Coordinator (REC) to process the federal request. Standard FEMA Action Request Form (ARF) process applies. State determines need and requirements. ARF is crafted and signed by DEMA. ARF is forwarded to FEMA for action. FEMA will consult with HHS to validate request prior to activation of contract. The St ate incurs a 25% cost share - FEMA will not process without State signature. HHS prepares list of detailed requirements based on the capabilities and numbers requested and forwards to FEMA Operations/Logistics and ESF #8 in the National Response Coordinati on Center (NRCC). FEMA will forward approved request to the contracting officer. Contracting officer executes Task Order. HOW DOES IT WORK? The role of EMS during a disaster may include: o Patient triage, treatment, and transport. o Symptom surveillance and reporting. o On-scene medical standby. o Redistribution of patients to free up hospital beds. o Distributing immunizations and administering vaccine. o Staffing shelters. o Staffing emergency departm ents. o Setting up mobile medical units. Ambulance contract assets include: o 300 Ground Ambulances typically with 60% ALS and 40% basic life support BLS units. o 25 air ambulances including helicopter and/or fixed wing. o Para -transit (e.g. wheel chair accessible vehicles) capability for up to 3,500 individuals, not 3,500 vehicles. Public Health Emergency Declaration Playbook ( REVISED JUNE , 2023) 39 EXAMPLE 6 REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE (SNS) What is SNS? BACKGROUND The SNS is the nation's largest supply of potentially life - saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. The stockpile ensures the right medicines and supplies are available when and where needed to save lives. When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that medicine and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, the repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large -scale emergencies, simultaneously. ADHS maintains a SNS Plan and a full time SNS coordina tor position. HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? The decision to deploy SNS assets occurs after the depletion of local assets during a large -scale public health emergency or other disaster. Local public health, emergency management, ADHS, HHS, and other experts collaborate with local ju risdictions, evaluate the situation, and determine a prompt course of action. If required, the Governor or designee requests the SNS through the HHS REC. After delivery to the State, SNS assets are then distributed to the affected areas The State may not incur a cost share requirement for SNS assets, however , State signature is required. Requesting agencies will need to provide Essential Element of Information (EEI) and data to support their request for SNS. Local public health will coordinate local distribution and dispensing operations . Products from the SNS may require an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which is granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). HOW DOES IT WORK? SNS assets are distributed from the federal stockpile to the State's Receipt Storage and Staging (RSS) site. The State's RSS then delivers assets to partner local distribution sites. Partner distribution sites are used to distribute assets within local communities. If necessary, s tate and local law enforcement are tasked with providing security for SNS assets during storage and transport. SNS assets may include: antibiotics, vaccines, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, life -support medications, IV administration kits, airway maintenance supplies, surgical items, and general protective equipment.
