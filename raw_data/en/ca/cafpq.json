Shine on, little ones, shine on. We can starve as much from a lack of wonder as we can from a lack of food. If only for a little while, let us open our heart and see what glories unfold. - Ted Andrews Foreword Have you ever read a book on the subject of vibrational healing and thought to yourself, I want to do what they are talking about, only to put down the book and walk away because what you read just wasn't quite clear enough on the how-to? This wonderful book will guide and direct you through the many modalities of vibrational healing. You will feel like Maya is sitting right there with you, talking to you on a personal level. She'll take you on your journey towards a new way of living life. Here she takes her personal experience to a new level and gets you started in vibrational healing. As you begin to explore the beautiful world of flower essences and minerals you might wonder why you haven't explored this before. All I can say is that, you never picked up one of Maya's books. She makes it easy to relate to the material of whatever she is writing about. Her words will leave you feeling confident and self-empowered, ready to approach a world you might not have been able to before. I have been in the field of energy healing since 1992 as a Polarity Therapy Practitioner. I have been working with Maya in the field of energy healing for ten years. I know who is just writing about this type of material and I know who lives what they are talking about. Maya lives what she talks about, and is sharing her wealthof information and insights with you. How blessed we are! Kathy LaLonde, Polarity Therapy Practitioner What are Vibrational Remedies? We are all made of energy. Our bodies are actually a fantastic mixture of empty space, light-waves, and pure energy. All of it pulsating, dancing, mixing and twirling on sub-atomic levels which in turn fuel these powerhouses of possibility we call bodies. Everything we know here on earth, each thing we can touch, taste, and smell, these are also made of energy. The air, the furniture, the foods, the perfume, even the living. It's all just energy. Nothing more. Nothing less. Complex, yet simple. Vibrational remedies are energy medicine. They are physical tools that heal and alter the energetic imprint contained within our physical body. The most well-known of these remedies in the West are probably homeopathy and reiki. However, there are many forms of vibrational remedies, including flower essences, Rife machines, bioenergetic medicine, and light therapy. Some remedies seek to obliterate dis-ease by using its very own energy imprint to weaken it (homeopathics) or finding the specific frequency that will destroy it (Rife, bioenergetics). Others focus on strengthening the body and spirit so that the body can lift itself out of dis-ease (flower and crystal essences). All vibrational remedies shift our energy so that we can feel better. So that we can be better. Everything has its own unique frequency. Atoms ripping through space and time to create what we hear, see, smell and touch. Even images and words have their own power, their own energy. They have frequencies that can affect the structure of water, literally imprinting it with their energetic signature. Studies have been conducted in many parts of the world that bear out this idea - Masaru Emoto's book The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves lists many examples. It is filled with both gorgeous and disturbing images of how our very thoughts can change the structure of water. The words ugly and hate create deformed ice crystals without structure, while words like joy, love and gratitude can transform the same damaged water so that it will form crystals with the most intricate, breathtakingly beautiful crystalline symmetry, or even the image of the Buddha himself. Taping words or placing objects in water has been found to alter its energy signature, which in turn can have a beneficial impact upon the cellular structure of the body. Vibrational remedies are about possibility. There is no can't, won't or shouldn't. It is one of the most hopeful and optimistic aspects of medicine, using light and love, the pure energies of Source which flows through all life on earth, to improve our condition. Those who have been bogged down by minds set in fearand doubt are quick to laugh at the ideas behind most vibrational medicine, but the beneficial effects clearly outweigh those of placebos. Rife machines are used extensively in hospitals and clinics throughout Eastern Europe, and Homeopathy has enjoyed countless documented successes in scientific trials. Throughout most of the world, homeopathy is accepted as regular medicine, and its derivatives are sold at pharmacies. Flower and crystal essences have also been the subject of many in-depth trials. In my own practice, we have used them with babies and animals and seen remarkable effects - in other words, we have used them on beings that do not experience placebo effects. Either something works on a dog or a baby, or it does not. They do not expect that a splash of something in their food is designed to help them sleepthrough the night or stay calm during the day. Their energy merely shifts and flows, without them knowing why. Vibrational remedies balance inharmonies on an emotional, physical and spiritual level. They may be used to heal the mind and ease bodily discomfort stemming from emotional or spiritual issues. Physical remedies made of water, alcohol, vinegar or sugars are considered safe for any age or size animal, whether human, horse, dog, cat or bird. Generally vibrational remedies are taken close together for acute situations or in times of extreme stress(15-30 minutes apart), or daily or weekly to trigger long-term change and healing. Unlike conventional medicines, side-effects tend to be minimal with the use of vibrational remedies, although sometimes a healing crisis or Herxheimer Reaction may occur, wherein the subject initially feels worse as the therapy drives toxinsfrom the body and re-aligns our polarity. This is a good sign to back off the remedy slightly, or to supplement your regime with complementary, supportive herbs or remedies. Bach's Rescue Remedy and Earth Lodge's Ease and Flow both have calmingeffects on the body and mind and are perfect for this sort of situation. The best vibrational healers have learned how best to avoid these sorts of reactions in their clients, preferring a gentle progression of healing rather than conducting an all-out war on the body. How Do These Remedies Work with Our Bodies? There are a variety of ways to explain the energy systems of the body. In Ayurveda and Kabbalah we have the chakrasand the tree of life, in traditional Chinese medicine we have the meridians, and in polarity therapy we have the elements and the oval fields. Holistic healers talk about the aura, the merkaba, the energy body and light body as if they are all easily discerned and verifiable facts. Of course, this can be confusing. What we do know, what has been proven through regular scientific method and observation, is that the body is energy and that this energy is measurable at a distance from the body. We know that our energy reacts with and affects the world around us. We know that not only does our body emit heat and sound through its electrical and physical activity, but measurable levels of light. We are all walking around giving off approximately 100 watts of infrared radiation, as well as hundreds of thousands of photons of every second - low-level light. So can we really measure the aura? This thing called a biofield? Well, scientists have been using SQUID magnetometers for over 35 years to quantify the biomagnetic fields of humans. Scientists at MIT and other universities have verified that not only does each organ in the body emit a distinct, measurable field of energy, but also that energy healers and Qigong practitioners emit the full spectrum of frequencies needed for cellular repair from their hands when they are participating in active hands-on healing. Quantum physicists have seen that the mere act of a human observing an electron experiment from another room has an effect upon its outcome. Scientists such as Reinhold Voll have measured the electrical status of meridians and acupuncture points and found that they do indeed have definite, measurable variations in frequency or flow. Furthermore, when an associated organ is debilitated or the person is in proximity to a harmful substance, readings will drop significantly. This research has been used to grow an entire field centered on the biofeedback one can receive from such instruments, allowing practitioners to easily determine whether a vitamin or food substance will actually benefit or harm a specific client. The remedies in this book are all designed to balance or enhance the energy patterns in the body so that it can heal itself. All adults and childrenhave stem cells in their body called somatic stem cells which are capable of renewing dying cells and regenerating entire organs from just a few cells. Yet most of humanity continues to sicken on a regular basis and our organs do not always regenerate themselves perfectly. We die. Why? Because our energetic blueprintbecomes corrupted. We take medicine to heal ourselves, but modern allopathic medicine is not designed to recalibrate our blueprint, to balance our energy. Our cells can not heal themselves because we are, on an atomic level, distorted. This is where life energy healing modalities come in. This is where the miraclesbegin. Loving Life Before you can begin to bring your body back into balance and facilitate a state of self-healing, you need to reawaken your mind-soul connection. It is not enough to simply live life. I want you to love life. What's the difference? When you are living life, you are going from task to task, moment to moment, without any real awareness of the process or the goal. Sometimes you are happy. Sometimes you are not. When things change, you worry. When things get better, you get excited. You try to do some things to help yourself and others, but mostly you are a passive member of humanity, reacting to circumstances as they occur and never quite feeling fulfilled or joyful. When you are loving life, you are L-I-V-I-N-G. You approach each moment with your eyesand your heartwide open. You are accepting of each new circumstance, and you are consistently approaching other people with compassion and seeking to understand and enjoy life to its fullest. You want to be a better person. You want to improve the life of all beings. You want to make the world a better place. Where you go, light shines. Why does it matter? When you are loving life, you are inviting your higher self, your oversoul, your infinite-I, your spark-of-god-self into your life. Your actions result in improvements for the highest good of all involved. You feel happier. You age more slowly, or not at all. Your health improves. Progress is made more easily at work and at home. People around you seem happier - when you smile, they smile. You are, indeed, making the world a better place. When you are living life, you are not improving on anything. You are merely subsisting. You develop illnesses. You age. You fear. You cry. When you shout or glare, other people feel bad. You are, unfortunately, making the world a little bit worse. A little bit sadder. A little bit colder. What can you do? There are so many ways to begin loving life. It all starts with you. In your heartand in your mind. Sometimes, we are so not loving life that we need to begin with baby steps. Many vibrational remedies help open the mind to new solutions, making it easier to change gears and propel ourselves into higher realms of consciousness, or at least help us achieve a healthier emotional state. Affirmationsand EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) both help to reprogram the mind and are great places to start. Affirmations are very, very easy to incorporate into your everyday life. Simply choose life-affirming statements and say them to yourself throughout the day: stick post-its on your mirror or your computer, in your car or on your lunch. Keep these statements positive, always confirming the best aspects you are seeking to encourage in your life. Here are some examples of affirmations: I am happy and relaxed. I greet each new day with anticipation and enjoyment. I am surrounded by loving, caring people. I see friendly faces wherever I go. My food sustains my soul and body. I am nourished by healthy meals and a positive environment. My work fulfills me and is for the highest good of all. I enjoy going to the office each day and creating a better world. Every little thing I do makes a difference. The wonderful thing about affirmations is that every time you say one of these statements, both your ego and your subconscious minds take note. You use your conscious mind to utter words, and your ego hears you. Your subconscious mind also notices that you are making these statements and proceeds to adjust your hormone levels and synchronize your heartand mind so that you will notice more of the positive aspects of life that are regularly occurring around you. Meanwhile, each affirmation is like a prayer, too. The words you speak emerge as sound waves that literally go on forever. Every positive statement you utter creates a positive vibration that will emanate throughout the universe for all time. The same holds true for each negative statement. Which would you rather fill up the universe with? Which sort of frequencies would you rather surround your descendents with? These "}
