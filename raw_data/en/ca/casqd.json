Subjects enrolled in this treatment protocol will receive oral continuous dosing with ibrutinib at the same dose and schedule they were receiving at the end of the respective parent study. Treatment may be continued as long as the subjects continue to derive benefit from treatment with ibrutinib until such time that ibrutinib becomes commercially available for the indication of the parent study. Clinical evaluations (including safety assessments) will be performed per local standard of care for each disease that was studied in the parent protocol. At each visit, all ongoing and new onset non-serious AEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), pregnancy events, other malignancies, and special reporting situations will be recorded. |Study Protocol for Subjects Continuing to Benefit From Ibrutinib After Completion of Ibrutinib Clinical Trials.| |Actual Study Start Date :||May Primary Date :||July Treatment with Ibrutinib, once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. | Drug: Ibrutinib | Subjects will continue with the current ibrutinib dosing regimen established in the parent ibrutinib study. - The objective of protocol PCYC-1145-LT is to provide long-term access to ibrutinib for subjects who meet the selection criteria. [ Time Frame: The duration will be 3 years and will be re-evaluated. ]Assessment of percentage of patients rolling over from each parent study. - Characterize the drug safety profile by collecting long-term safety data for ibrutinib. [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years and will be re-evaluated. ]Number of participants with treatment emergent serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest as assessed by CTCAE v4.0.
