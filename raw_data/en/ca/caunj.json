KATINA JONES, FOUNDER & MANAGING DIRECTOR \"Probably the best place to visit, surrounded by professionals and people who love their job and the human above all.\" - Christos Beautiful massage, intuitive and relaxing pressure and a clearly very knowledgeable therapist, Gabriella. Hope to be back in soon.\" - Bernie \"I highly recommend this place. I had my first reiki session. I didn't know what to expect, to be honest. I didn't even know if it would even work. I was surprised how I felt afterwards, it was like I felt all my anxiety, I didn't even know I had lifted. I left there in peace and felt calm and happy afterwards.\" - Cee \"On the outskirts of a quiet Adelaide Hills town, nestled amongst an array of birdlife, animals and trees you will find Ayurveda Village. The treatments, yoga sessions and food are designed to rebalance our overloaded systems. It is the perfect retreat for relaxation and rejuvenation, with professional, nurturing staff making our stay memorable in every way.\" - Leanne \"I had the best experience in years when I attended the Village. The physical surroundings combined with the beautiful clean and superbly decorated interiors create a feeling of tranquility and calm. The food was not only delicious and nutritious, you could taste the love with which it was prepared. All treatments were soothing and the gentleness of the practitioner was very appreciated. I can't wait to visit again.\" - Wendy \"My stay at Ayurveda Village was rejuvenating for the body, mind and spirit. Starting each day with yoga reignited my love for the practice. The treatments were wonderful and the food was delicious. Thank you to the lovely team who were so genuine in their care and contributed to the serene and positive energy in the Village.\" - Jacqui Shop online from our product range View our products and shop online FAQ's Holistic Health What is holistic health? Holistic health is a form of healthcare that addresses the entire person, including their physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellness. It aims to treat the underlying cause of an illness rather than just the symptoms. What are the benefits of holistic health? Holistic health can provide a wide range of benefits, including reduced stress, improved immune system function, better sleep, increased energy levels, improved mental clarity and relief from chronic pain. What are some examples of holistic health therapies? Holistic health covers a wide range of therapies including acupuncture, naturopathy, Ayurveda, massage therapy, chiropractic care, herbal medicines, Chinese medicine, meditation, yoga, reiki and much more. How does holistic health differ from traditional medicine? Traditional medicine tends to focus on treating specific symptoms or illnesses, while holistic healthcare takes a more comprehensive approach that looks at the entire person's health including physical, mental and emotional factors. Instead of using drugs, holistic healthcare practitioners often use natural therapies and treatments that support the body's natural healing processes. Is holistic health safe? Holistic health is generally considered safe when practised by trained and accredited professionals. However, it's always important to talk to your healthcare provider before trying any new therapies or treatments.
