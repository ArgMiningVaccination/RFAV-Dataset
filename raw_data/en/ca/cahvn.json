[Spirituality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality)can mean different things to different individuals, depending on their experiences, beliefs, and life histories. Some individuals focus on strengthening their belief system, while others experience spirituality in secular ways, such as through meditation, yoga, or by spending time in nature. Clients can expect a therapist to help guide and grow their spirituality through any of these techniques, encouraging the individual to cope with the challenges they face and develop strategies to build resilience and purpose to improve their outlook in life. What are the most common treatments that include spirituality? There are several treatments that incorporate spirituality. [Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy)) helps a person examine and reframe their negative thoughts and behaviors. [Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy)) focuses on emotional acceptance and psychological flexibility. [Existential therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/existential-therapy)is most often used to address anxiety, depression, grief, loneliness, apathy, despair, questions of identity, and feelings of purposelessness and existential dread. [Transpersonal therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/transpersonal-therapy)focuses on a client's spirituality and meaning in life and may incorporate techniques including meditation, visualization, hypnotherapy, dream analysis, and or breathwork. Can therapy incorporating spirituality help atheistic or agnostic individuals? Yes. For non-believers, spirituality can offer benefits including a greater sense of connection to others and to the natural world. An interest in spirituality may also spur individuals to pursue [mindfulness practices](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mindfulness), or to contemplate their purpose in life and how to achieve it. How effective is spirituality as a therapeutic remedy? Research suggests spirituality is generally beneficial for individuals. It is correlated with better health habits, such as less substance use, and an improved capacity to cope with stress and other mental health challenges.
