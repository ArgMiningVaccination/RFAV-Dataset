CRS uses mean of last three BPs documented on non- ER visits during the report period. If three BPs are not available, uses mean of last two non- ER BPs. If a visit contains more than one BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the lowest systolic value. The mean Systolic value is calculated by adding the last three (or two ) systolic values and dividing by three (or two ). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic val ues from the last 3 (or two ) blood pressures and dividing by three (or two ).

IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 39 28. Immunization Program Numerator : Patients who have received the 4:3:1:3:3:1 combination (i.e., 4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 HiB, 3 Hepatitis B, and 1 Varicella), not including refusals, contraindications, and patients with evidence of disease. 29. Immunization Program Numerator : Patients who have received the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 combination (i.e., 4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 HiB, 3 Hepatitis B, 1 Varicella, and 4 Pneumococcal), not including refusals, contraindications, and patients with evidence of disease. Definitions Patient Age Since the age of the patient is calculated at the beginning of the report period, the age range will be adjusted to 7 -23 months at the beginning of the report period, which makes the patient between the ages of 19 -35 months at the end of the report period. Timing of Doses Because IZ data comes from multiple sources, any IZ codes documented on dates within 10 days of each other will be considered as the same immunization. Active Immunization Package Patients Denominator Same as User Population definition except includes only patients flagged as active in the Immunization Package. Note: Only values for the current period will be reported for this denominator since currently there is not a way to determine if a patient was active in the Immunization Package during the previous year or baseline periods . Dosage and Types of Immunizations 4 Doses of DTaP - 4 DTaP/DTP/Tdap - 1 DTaP/DTP/Tdap and 3 DT /Td - 1 DTaP/D TP/Tdap and 3 each of Diphtheria and Tetanus - 4 DT and 4 Ac ellular Pertussis - 4 Td and 4 Acellular Pertussis - 4 each of Diphtheria, T etanus, and Acellular Pertussis 3 Doses of Polio - 3 OPV - 3 IPV - Combination of OPV and IPV totaling 3 doses IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 40 1 Dose of MMR - MMR - 1 M/R and 1 Mumps - 1 R/M and 1 Measles - 1 each of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 3 doses of Hep B OR 2 dos es IF documented with CPT 90743 3 doses of HIB 1 dose of Varicella 4 doses of Pneumococcal 2 doses of Hep A 2 or 3 doses of Rotavirus, depending on the vaccin e administered 2 doses of Influenza Refusal, Contraindication, and Evidence of Disease Information Except for the Immunization Program Numerators , NMI refusals, evidence of disease and contraindications for individual immunizations will also count toward meeting th e definition, as defined below. Refusals will count toward meeting the definition for refusal numerators only. Note : NMI refusals are not counted as refusal s; rather, they are counted as contraindications. For immunizations that allow a different number of doses (e.g. 2 or 3 Rotavirus): To count toward the numerator with the smaller number of doses, all of the patient's vaccinations must be part of the smaller dose series. For example, for a patient to count toward the Rotavirus numerator with only 2 doses, all two doses must be included in the 2- dose series codes listed in the Rotavirus definition. A patient with a mix of 2 -dose and 3- dose series codes will need 3 doses to count toward the numerator. Each immunization must be refused and documented separately. For example, if a patient has an NMI refusal for Rubella only, then there must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate NMI refusal for the Measles and Mumps immunizations. For immunizations where required number of doses is >1, only one NMI refusal is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single NMI refusal for Hepatitis B, the patient will be included in the numerator. IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 41 For immunizations where required number of doses is >1, only one contraindication is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single contraindication for HiB, the patient will be included in the numerator. Evidence of disease will be checked for at any time in the child's life (prior to the end of the report per iod). To be counted in Subnumerator A, a patient must meet the numerator definition AND have evidence of disease, a contraindication, or an NMI refusal for any of the immunizations in the numerator. For example, if a patient was Rubella immune but had a Me asles and Mumps immunization, the patient would be included in Subnumerator A . For the separate numerator for REF refusal (Patient Refusal for Service) in PCC or a Parent or Patient refusal in the IZ program, all conditions shown below must be met: - Each im munization must be refused and documented separately. For example, if a patient has an REF refusal for Rubella, then there also must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate REF refusal for Measles and Mumps. - Where the required number of doses is >1, only one REF refusal in PCC or one Parent or Patient refusal in the IZ program is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For exampl, for the 4 DTaP numerator, only one refusal is necessary to be counted in the refusal numerator.

Incidents of an STI are identified beginning with the date of the first key STI diagnosis (see definition above) occurring between 60 days prior to the beginning of the report period through the first 300 days of the report period. A second incident of the same STI is counted if another diagnosis with the same STI occurs two months or more after the initial diagnosis. A different STI diagnosis that occurs during the same 60 -day time period as the first STI counts as a separate incident. IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 142 Example of Patient with Multiple Incidents of Single STI: Date Visit Total Incidents 08/01/ 10 Patient screened for Chlamydia 0 08/08/ 10 Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 1 10/15/ 10 Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 10/25/ 10 Follow -up for Chlamydia 2 11/15/ 10 Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 03/01/ 11 Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 3 Denominato r Logic for Needed Screenings (D enominator #1) One patient may need multiple sc reening tests based on one or more STI incidents occurring during the time period. To be included in the needed screening tests denominator, the count will be derived from the number of separate STI incidents and the type(s) of screenings recommended for e ach incident. The recommended screenings for each key STI are listed in the following table. STI Screenings recommended screenings that are further evaluated for contraindications. The following are reasons that a recommended screening is identified as not needed (i.e., contraindicated). The patient has a document ed STI diagnosis corresponding to the screening type in the same time period. For example, a patient with both a Chlamydia and a gonorrhea diagnosis on the same visit does not need the recommended Chlamydia screening based on the gonorrhea diagnosis. Only one screening for each type of STI is needed during the relevant time period, regardless of the number of different STI incidents identified. For example, if a patient is diagnosed with Chlamydia and Gonorrhea on the same visit, only one screening each is needed for HIV/AIDS and Syphilis. A patient with HIV/AIDS diagnosis prior to any STI diagnosis that triggers a recommended HIV/AIDS screening does not need the screening ever. IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Meas ure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 143 Numerator Logic To be counted in the numerator, each needed screening in the denominator must have a corresponding lab test or test refusal documented in the period from one month prior to the relevant STI diagnosis date through two months after the STI incident.

However, if the patient were diagnosed agai n on February 16, 2008 (46 days after onset), that diagnosis counts as a separate visit. Because RPMS does not store the date of onset, visit date will be used as a surrogate for onset date.

IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 171 Denominator Inclusion Patients must have at least two prescriptions for that particular type of medication on two unique dates of service at any time during the Report Period. Medi cations must not have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK. Index Prescription Start Date The date when the medication was first dispensed within the Report Period. This date must be greater than 90 days from the end of the Report Period to be counted in the den ominator. Medications Medication s are defined with the following taxonomies: Numerator Proportion of days covered = # of days the patient was covered by at least one drug in the class / # of days in the patient's measurement period. The patient's measurement period is defined as the number of days bet ween the Index Prescription Start Date and the end of the Report Period. When calculating the number of days the patient was covered by at least one drug in the class, if prescriptions for the same drug overlap, the prescription start date for the second p rescription will be adjusted to be the day after the previous fill has ended. Note: If the medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e. visit date) from the V Medication Discontinued Date. Example: Rx Date=11/15/2011, Discontinued Date=11/19/2011, Recalculated # Days Prescribed=4. Example of Proportion of Days Covered Report Period: Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2011 1st Rx is Index Rx Start Date: 3/1/11, Days Gap = (9/11/11 - = Rx patient period: 3/1/11 = 306 Days IHS Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 11.1 Performance Measure List and Definitions Performance Measure Topics and Definitions May 2011 172 Days patient was covered: 3/1/11 through 8/27/11 + 9/11/11 through 12/31/11 = 292 Days PDC = 292 / 306 = 95% Each Gap Numerator CRS will calculate whether a gap in medication therapy of 30 or more days has occurred between each consecutive medication dispensi ng event during the Report Period. A gap is calculated as the days not covered by the days supply between consecutive medication fills. Example of Medication Gap >=30 Days: Report Period: Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2011 1st Rx: 4/1/11, Days Supply=30 Rx = (7/1/11 4/30/11) days covers through 3rd 10/1/11, Days Supply=90 #2 = (10/1/11 9/28/11) days Rx covers patient through 12/29/11 Gap #1 >=30 days, therefore patient will be included in the numerator for that medication.
