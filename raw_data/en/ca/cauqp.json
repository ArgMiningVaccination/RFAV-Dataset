What Ayurvedic Medicine, Yoga & Meditation; Homeopathic Medicine; Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine, Tai Chi, Qigong, & Tao; Energy Healing; Remote Healing; & William Tiller's Imprinted Intention Technology Devices (IIEDs) add to the U.S. Medical Framework August 2008 I wanted to make the world a better place and created a company and foundation with the mission of education and dialogue about health. My long-term goal was to help evolve the U.S. medical framework to include the best of the world's medicines. Initially I set annual goals that resulted in my listening to and dialoguing with 200+ doctors, health professionals, scientists, quantum physicists, psychologists, and people about health; reading 200+ books; sharing 200+ books; attending lectures and classes through various medical and health schools; touring various health clinics, schools, and laboratories; and experimenting with and proving various medicines, practices, and phenomena to myself. From these 3+ years of researching and experimenting with various conventional and natural medicines including subtle energy medicines, practices, phenomena, and technologies such as Ayurvedic medicine, yoga & meditation; homeopathic medicine; acupuncture, Oriental medicine, tai chi, qigong, Tao; energy healing; remote healing; spiritual healing; & William Tiller's Imprinted Intention Technology Devices (IIEDs), I understand that we live in a classical AND quantum multi-dimensional world with different truths at different levels of reality and need to evolve our U.S. and global medical framework to include these natural medicines, practices, phenomena and technologies and the importance of consciousness, beliefs, intentions, dharma, and spirit. Furthermore, from combining Ayurveda with quantum physics and neuroscience, all these natural medicines, practices, phenomena and technologies at their deepest levels likely relate to the unified or superstring field that connects all living things (such as humans, plants, animals & minerals) and is consciousness and you can access and explore this field by meditating. Progressive health, medical, science, philosophy, and theology schools and health foundations, doctors, technology companies, and entrepreneurs could facilitate further dialogue and fund further research leading to improved human well-being, improve health care, agriculture, education, veterinary medicine, and possibly improved and new diagnostic and treatment methodologies, improved and new personal and business technologies including enhanced environments. Currently in Western medicine (also known as conventional or allopathic medicine) we define health as the absence of disease. We treat individual symptoms as disconnected from other symptoms, and we separate the physical body from the mind, the emotions and the spirit. In ancient times, healers understood our bodies holistically and energetically. Matriarch energy healer Rev. Rosalyn Bruyere says that some fifty thousand years ago the Egyptian priest-scribe Tehuty, more familiarly known by his Greek name Hermes, is credited with defining the elementary nature of the chakra system. Some seven thousand years ago, prana (Ayurvedic medicine) was identified in India and some five thousand years ago, chi (qi) was identified in China. John White in Future Science lists 90+ different cultures each with their naming of a healing or life energy force. Health is about physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being and relates to a life's purpose or dharma. I live in Seattle where Microsoft is significant. Prana, chi, ki (Japan), or our vital force (homeopathic medicine) is the unique software that drives our physical body, our hardware. If we are in a serious accident, we have excellent emergency rooms to repair our physical body. If on the other hand we have chronic physical, mental or emotional symptom(s), we may need to debug our software to fix the problem at a deeper level. Ayurvedic medicine, yoga & meditation; homeopathic medicine; acupuncture & Oriental medicine, tai chi, qigong, Tao; energy healing; remote healing; and Tiller's IIEDs all help maintain or debug our software. Ayurvedic Medicine, Yoga & Meditation Since August 2008 for diet and daily living, I have enjoyed applying the principles of Ayurvedic medicine, an Indian medicine dating from 3000 to 5000 B.C.E, and its sister science yoga. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine is based on the principles that \"like increases like and opposites reduce.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In Ayurvedic are three energies, vata, pitta and kapha, made-up of air, wind, fire, water and earth elements in our universe. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Some of us have predominately one energy, some two, such as vata-pitta or vata-kapha, or less common, maybe ten percent, have all three energies, vata, pitta and kapha. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 You can take a questionnaire to estimate your energies or you can have an Ayurvedic doctor read your pulse to precisely tell you your current energies and your birth energies. (I did this and confirmed I had all three energies.) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The key to good health is to have your current energies match your birth energies. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In Ayurvedic medicine, you can use foods, fasting, breathing techniques, yoga, meditation, herbs, sleep, exercise, colors, sounds, scents, and more to stimulate or calm various energies. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 What I especially like about Ayurvedic medicine is that it honors all living things and the environment and promotes personal responsibility in diet and lifestyle. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Furthermore, the principles of the Ayurvedic diet can be applied to the American and other cultures' diets and work well for healthful weight loss, gain, or long-term maintenance. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Moreover, Ayurvedic medicine can explain the who, what, where, when, why, and how of many acute and chronic diseases such as colds, coughs, influenzas, herpes, pain, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, migraines, obesity, cancer, and more. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine helps explain genetics and epigenetics, including identifying the importance of parent health when conceiving children, differences between siblings at birth, and much of the health differences in identical twins as they age. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine offers much for preventative health. For example, in Ayurveda there are six stages to disease so conventional doctors could learn to identify and treat diseases before disease symptoms develop- something we are currently unable to do in conventional medicine. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine offers doctors an end health state to look for when healing patients. This is especially helpful in quick healing medicines like homeopathy. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine identifies disease susceptibilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Furthermore, Ayurvedic medicine connects disconnected groups in disease susceptibilities. For example, with swine flu, several of the susceptible groups included people with asthma, pregnant women, people with diabetes, and young children: all people with high Kapha energy. A second example is herpes virus 1 which involves people with high Pitta energy. A third example is cancer with all three energies possibly imbalanced. Two final examples are the research of the China Study and obesity and Kapha energy. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurveda medicine likely explains high, medium and low sensitivities to various doses of medicines and which qualities of allopathic medicines are aggravating or calming to various people. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine helps explain how and why acupuncture works and offers a self-healing tool through marma therapy. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine includes tongue and seven-level pulse diagnosis, further diagnostic tools. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine has public policy implications such as understanding what foods, lifestyles and environments we want to encourage in our schools and prisons and how to help counteract such public health issues as obesity, violence, depression, hyperactivity, and learning disabilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ayurvedic medicine identifies the wide diversity of humans mentally, physically and emotionally and offers schools, businesses, and governments an important diversity tool when assembling effective diverse groups. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 For businesses, the principles of Ayurveda can be applied to improve consumer and business products and develop new ones. For example, scents, colors, hot/cold, sound and more can be used to stimulate or calm various energies. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Most important, Ayurveda, yoga, & meditation at its deepest levels leads to the unity of mind, body, and spirit and dharma. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 David Frawley in Ayurveda and the Mind writes: \"True awareness is the recognition of unity through which we transcend personal limitations and understand the Self as Allium\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Deepak Chopra in Ageless Body, Timeless Mind writes: The universe evolves because the stream of dharma guides it; it is the invisible intelligence that weaves the fabric of life. . . For someone who is conscious only of the material world, power is limited to materials forces; but at a more profound level there is a creative power shaping mind and body\u00e2\u20ac\"the power of evolution, or dharma.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Then in Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul, Chopra writes, \"A noted Indian guru was asked, 'Is my personal evolution something I'm doing or something that is happening to me?' His answer: 'It's both, but if we must choose, it's something that is happening to you.'\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This \"something that is happening to you\" is your prana, chi, ki, or vital force. Homeopathic Medicine Homeopathic medicine, the most common form of alternative medicine in North and South America, in my observation and experience can be the most powerful medicine likely because the medicines are subatomic subtle energy medicines and the higher potencies can be quite powerful. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 For example a 1M potency is a 1,000c dilution which is a 1:100 times, and 10-2,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A is a 10,000c dilution which 1:100 dilution, 10,000 times, and exponent designation 10-20,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 With Planck scale at 10-33, a 1M is resonating powerfully within the quantum world. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathy has greatly evolved in the past twenty years and I recommend visiting a homeopath with the C.C.H. (Certified Classical Homeopath) certification. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I trained through the American Medical College of Homeopathy (AMCH) headed by Dr. Todd Rowe, M.D., M.D.(H) (Medical Doctor of Homeopathy), C.C.H., D.Ht. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 AMCH is currently offering a three year, 1,104 hour Homeopathic Practitioner Program on-line and in Phoenix that works well for doctors and others specifically interested in homeopathic medicine and a four year, 4,280 hour Doctor of Homeopathy Program. I applaud the state of Arizona for its Doctor of Homeopathy legislation: www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/sb1175h.pdf \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I also studied under Rajan Sankaran M.D.(H) of India and thank him along with many of the current leading and former homeopaths for the evolution of homeopathy to the 4,000+ homeopathic medicines today and the Vital Sensation methodology that pairs traditional case-taking rubrics with nonsense and holistic concepts. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Samuel Hahnemann, 1755-1843, a German physician, chemist, and linguist was discouraged with the healing methods of his day and discovered homeopathy while translating information related to treating malaria for the Scottish physician William Cullen's Materia Medica. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathy is based on the principle of \"like curing like.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathic medicines are regulated by the Federal Drug Administration and as explained above higher potencies are gained through increased succession and dilution making them more quantum and thus more powerful. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 From clinical training and personal experience, I have observed that homeopathic medicines offer healing for a wide variety of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual acute and chronic ailments including long-standing allergies, sinusitis, migraines, menstrual problems, eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, panic attacks, pain, depression, manic-depression, anxiety, phobias, delusions, anger, ADD, ADHD, autism, obesity, alcoholism, and more. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Students are typically initially trained in James Kent's classic repertory which was published in segments in the early 1900s and includes 1,423 pages of homeopathic symptoms and the homeopathic medicines which produced or healed these symptoms as a result of homeopathic medicinal clinical trials on healthy people and clinical successes from healing patients' diseases. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In time, students advance to using computer software that accesses a larger number of clinical trials on healthy people and clinical successes from healing patients' diseases. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The medicines work quickly and results can often be experienced in minutes to hours for first aid and acute prescribing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Healing can take longer for chronic situations and there are laws and principles to help doctors, health professionals and homeopaths identify the action of healing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The most inspiring healings I have viewed are young autistic boys who have become much more functional from homeopathic medicines. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The book Impossible Cure by Amy Lansky, Ph.D., a former NASA computer scientist, highlights her own son's cure of autism with homeopathy and people can connect with Dr. Lansky, Dr. Rowe and other homeopaths through voicesofhomeopathy.com. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Laurel Chiten, accomplished filmmaker, has short five minute films of various homeopathic successes that can be viewed at blinddogfilms.com, including the super-bug MRSA and a child with autism. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The correct constitutional homeopathic medicine offers patients an opportunity to heal current disease symptoms and avoid future genetic diseases and could be used to improve parents' health before conceiving children. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The ringworm, cancer, tubercular, and leprosy miasms provide a framework for further understanding the depth and pace of people's past, current, and future possible disease states and matching homeopathic medicines for healing these possible states. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Moreover, homeopathic medicines over the past two hundred years have been shown to be very helpful for various influenzas and epidemics and are cost effective: read The Homeopathic of Influenza by Sandra Perko, Ph.D., C.C.N. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathic medicines transport and store easily so they can be used in remote areas. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathy is the ultimate green medicine because the medicines can be easily duplicated in water or inhaled to maximize scarce resources such as during an epidemic. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Furthermore, Dr. Masaru Emoto's research with water, The Hidden Messages in Water, can be applied to LM potencies, vastly expanding the number of homeopathic medicinal possibilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathic medicines could also possibly be used instead of chemicals on our food and agriculture to improve our agricultural system including Pittsburgh homeopath Betsy Reilling's PlantEase: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Barbara Brennan, Ph.D. and energy healer, in part one of Light Emerging seems to describe the homeopathic experience of releasing old symptoms and there appear to be other commonalities between homeopathy, energy healing, and acupuncture. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Moreover, the homeopathic software systems and books detail two hundred years of mental, emotional and physical disease symptoms and corresponding healing medicines. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Rajan Sankaran in Homeopathy for Today's World describes a nonhuman or second song that plays within each of us. As children, we generally can freely express this nonhuman song through our higher energy, sensation, and delusion (dream) level. As we age, we can suppress this second song or nonhuman energy, leading to its sounding at mental, emotional, and ultimately physical levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Julian Jonas, C.C.H., Lic. Ac., Center for Homeopathy of Southern Vermont explains: \"The most important development in homeopathy since its discovery in the late 18th century by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the Sensation Method of diagnosis developed by Dr. Rajan Sankaran explains that our experience and perceptions of life's stresses are shaped by an inner pattern, or 'song,' connected to one of the three kingdoms in nature\u00e2\u20ac\"animal, plant, mineral(can be any living thing of the universe). Revealing itself as a constant underlying sensation felt in both mind and the body and expressed through illness and chronic ailments, this inner song of reoccurring reactive patterns\u00e2\u20ac\"be it that of a competitive lion, a sensitive daisy or structured phosphorous\u00e2\u20ac\"drives our emotions, dreams, ambitions, careers, and relationships and is the underlying factor behind why stress affects each of us so differently. . . he reveals how becoming aware of our inner song can reduce the intensity of its negative effects, leading to less stress, better health, and more harmony in our lives.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Homeopathy for Today's World is helpful for businesses, advertisers, health foundations, health professionals and interested people because it introduces the nonhuman energy and sensitivities that drive our core being and identifies homeopathic and other ways to uncover these deeper realities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Most important, constitutional homeopathy leads to the healing of mind, body and spirit and at the deepest levels the co-creating of new realities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A constitutional homeopath interviews you for one and half to two and half hours initially to find the constitutional homeopathic medicine that matches your unique energetic being, typically an animal, mineral, or plant. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow-up interviews usually last about an hour or less and can be done through Skype or other technology if needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Doug Brown, C.C.H., R.S.Hom., F.N.P., Homeopathic Healing, Portland, and Faculty, American Medical College of Homeopathy, realizes the deep level of classical constitutional homeopathy and in his 2006 article \"Paradigm Shift: Homeopathy as Applied Consciousness,\" he writes: \"Disease is not something that happens TO us. It is not ultimately the product of attacks by germs or faulty organs. Disease is, rather, an expression of a vital force. A spirit-like essence, a unity, which permeates the human body but is not limited to it. This life force energizes the human body; indeed it is responsible for the very materialization of the body...The life force does not only govern the individual's health, physical and mental, but also what happens to him.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Later Brown asks: \"How is it possible that we create our own illness(?) . . . Perhaps at some point in the soul's journey there is a decision made to conform in some way to this field. Perhaps it is because hidden within the information and layered meanings of each kind of experience, lies a lesson the soul needs for its own evolution.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In an address to 2006 homeopathic graduates Brown describes depth homeopathy and the potential to co-create new realities: \"Reality is the ACT of PERCEPTION . . . Homeopathy is the art of perception, highly developed, highly refined, expertly utilized in the service of healing. Isaac Luria, the renowned 16th century Jewish Mystic and kabbalist, used the expression Tikkun olam, to refer to the discipline of healing, repairing the world. So the path you have taken, my friends, is not just about healing the sick . . . it is about creating a new reality, aligning with a universe that chooses healing, evolution, integration, unfolding and harmony. Depth homeopathy involves active participation in the creative act of bringing healing, congruency, clarity, and meaning into existence.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Later Brown remarked: \"She (a patient) felt support from Silica, but her true, deep simillimum (constitutional homeopathic medicine) turned out to be the remedy Hummingbird . . . We think there must be a high level of trust, confidence, and perhaps blind faith, when people allow themselves to be anesthetized and put under the care of a surgeon with a scalpel. But isn't the trust, isn't the faith, isn't the risk, even greater, when we entrust the care of our soul to a healer, not just the physical body.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In closing, he commented: \"I liken my job to having a front row seat at a window into the inner workings of the universe, into mystery and wonder. Of course the metaphor falls short because we are not merely spectators. . . If we perceive correctly, and touch the vital force in the right place, we will align ourselves with the healing impulse of nature, and conscious attention and intention will do all the rest.\" Energy Healing Traditional energy healers can perceive people's energy fields and therefore know a lot about health and dis-ease. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Blocks in the flow of energy create imbalances and if not cleared may lead to illness and disease. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Practitioners work with chakras, meridians, and subtle energies to restore balance. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 They clear, charge and balance patients' energy fields to generate health and well-being. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Some energy healers practice by laying on of hands, while others work without touching the body directly. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Furthermore, some energy healers teach energy exercises to maximize self-health, including brain power exercises, grounding exercises, and more. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In addition to treating people themselves, because energy healers perceive human energy fields, they can work with researchers to better understand the causes and cures of illnesses and possibly help develop further diagnostic and healing technologies. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 For example, Rev. Rosalyn Bruyere, a pioneer of energy healing, identifies the following diseases with the first chakra: anemia, cancer, arthritis, colitis, Alzheimer's, excessive fear, chronic pain, hypertension, heart disease, genetic diseases, addictions, and compulsive and obsessive behaviors. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Furthermore, she describes anemia and cancer as relating to the issue of power and cancer cells vibrating slower than regular cells, imitating embryonic cells which is why the body allows them to multiply and divide rapidly. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Most important, traditional energy healers describe a holographic health model and 10 or 12 dimensions to our being-a physical, auric (7 level human energy field), haric and core star level-that drastically evolves our understanding of health, healing, people, relationships, cultures, and our universe at the deepest levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Barbara Brennan, Ph.D., a former NASA scientist and another pioneer of energy healing, offers detailed descriptions and illustrations in her books Hands of Light and Light Emerging. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Beliefs, consciousness, intentions, and other dimensions lie at the deepest levels of energy healing and remote healing, spiritual guides, high sensory perception and much more are all possibilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Brennan writes, \"The purpose of incarnation is the creation of awareness of self as divine co-creator of the universe...each of us is born with a life task to reconnect to the core of our being. In order to do this, we must remove the blocks between our conscious awareness and our core. This is called our personal life task.\" Acupuncture & Oriental medicine, Tai Chi, Qigong, & Tao Acupuncture & Oriental medicine, tai chi, qigong, & Tao has similarities to Ayurvedic medicine & yoga & meditation and energy healing and at its deepest levels is about reconnecting patients to spirit. In The Clinical Practice of Chinese Medicine (2003) Lonny Jarrett, M.Ac. writes: \"In restoring a patient's memory of original nature and purpose, we have saved life in perhaps an even greater sense than is possible with critical care medicine. For surgery and medication may save the form of a life, but Chinese medicine can resurrect its purpose. Therefore, we must approach the return of spirit as the guiding force in an individual's life with the same seriousness and sense of urgency as we would approach the study and cultivation of our art with the highest sense of purpose and discipline.\" Chapters 1 to 7 of Nourishing Destiny describe this deeper level even for the non-practitioner and the Appendix offers his 1998 understanding of Chinese and Western Medicine. In Part V of Clinical Practice Jarrett describes the relationship between the eight- principle and five-element tradition and between herbal medicine and acupuncture and introduces Don Beck's spiral dynamic evolutionary model that comes from Claire Graves's work. In Acupuncture: Is It for You? J R Worsley writes, \"Traditional Chinese acupuncture helps cultivation of the Tao. It is a form of healing that is in tune with the Tao; its practice is ever-mindful and trusting that Nature, allowed to flow unimpeded, leads to health in body, mind and spirit, as Nature ordained it to be . . . The Tao is more a way of mind than the body, being the Way of realizing the beauty and potential of the spirit within us all.\" Moreover, Wayne Dyer in Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life writes about the 14th verse of the Tao Te Ching, \"Some scholars have singled out this 14th verse of the Tao Te Ching as the most significant of all its 81 offerings because it stresses the significance of the single principle that's the underpinning of all existence. Tapping into this invisible, untouchable, immeasurable force will enable you to gain the harmony that comes with being connected to the oneness, and harmony is your ultimate objective in deciding to live an 'in-Spirited' life. . . This 14th verse of the Tao calls for you to immerse yourself in inspiration rather than information, to become at one with that which has always been. And as this verse of the Tao concludes so insightfully, 'Discovering how things have always been brings one into harmony with the Way.'\" Quantum Physics Towards the end of my journey of exploring health, I stumbled upon What the Bleep Do We Know? and What the Bleep Do We Know?! Down the Rabbit Hole which includes William Tiller, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Material Science and Engineering, Stanford University, John Hagelin, Ph.D., Quantum Physicist, Director, Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy, Maharishi University of Management (Ayurveda); Dean Radin, Ph.D., Sciences; Candace Pert, Ph.D., former Clinical Neuroscience Branch of NIH, now The Institute of New Medicine; Fred Alan Wolf, Quantum Physicist, Ph.D, UCLA; Amit Goswami, Ph.D., retired Professor, Theoretical Physics Department, University of Oregon; Andrew Newberg, M.D., Director, Center for Spirituality and Neurosciences, University of Pennsylvania; and others and became excited at finding some conventional scientists who thought unconventionally and expressed some of what I had come to understand: we live in a classical AND quantum world; we are entangled; different truths exist at different levels of reality, and the importance of consciousness, intentions, beliefs, dharma and spirit. From various correspondences and further research, I read three of William Tiller's books, Science and Human Transformation (1997), Some Science Adventures with Real Magic (2005), and Pschoenergetic Science (2007) and felt like I had come full circle in my exploration when I found his conjugate physical, reciprocal space and reciprocal time table on page 127 and his human metaphor model on page 147 Psychoenergetic Science and his energy photographs on pages 19, 21 and 22 and list of subtle energy phenomena on page 23 Science and Human Transformation. Tiller's emphasis on consciousness and intentions fits very much with Barbara Brennan's descriptions of our deeper haric and core star levels. Furthermore, my studies of these energy medicines and what I have observed and experienced fit very much with Tiller's reciprocal dimension and Brennan's work. Moreover, I followed up with Bastyr Researcher Ph.D., N.D., L.Ac. whose UW and Bastyr telepathy research is included in Something Unknown is Doing We Don't Know What. Currently her research is using remote qigong to shrink brain tumors. William Tiller's Imprinted Intention Technology Devices Physicist Tiller, Professor Emeritus, Material Science and Engineering, Stanford University, has developed Imprinted Intentional Technology Devices (IIEDs) which use specific human intentions to challenge the assumption that \"No human qualities of consciousness, intention, emotion, mind or spirit can significantly influence a well-designed target experiment in physical reality.\" His first four experiments were to raise and lower the pH of water by 1.0 unit, significantly increase the in vitro thermodynamic activity of the liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and significantly shorten the fruit fly larval stage. Psychoenergetic Science: A Second Copernican-Scale Revolution describes these successful experiments and further ones. White papers can be found at tillerfoundation.org. Green and Green's symbolic interpretation of human substance and perceptual structure is on page 33 of this book. Then I watched further movies, read further books, corresponded further, and explored further including remote and near energy healing, telepathy, psychokinesis, Sankaran's work, Reconnective Healing, meditation, and the multidimensions of the universe. Furthermore, I set up a Facebook page with short videos related to these subtle energy medicines, quantum physics, neuroscience, and more: http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100002983625186&sk=wall. Moreover, I explored physicist John Hagelin's Physics of Consciousness which fit very much with my research.
