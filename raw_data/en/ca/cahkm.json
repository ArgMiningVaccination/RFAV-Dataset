ARC 1542A CREDIT UNION DIVISION[189] Notice of Intended Action Twenty-five interested persons, a governmental subdivision, an agency or an association of 25 or more persons may demand an oral presentation hereon as provided in Iowa Code \u00a717A.4(1) \"6\". Notice is also given to the public that the Administrative Rules Review Committee may, on its own motion or on written request by any individual or group, review this proposed action under \u00a717A.8(6) at a regular or special meeting where the public or interested persons may be heard. Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 533.1, the Superintendent of Credit Unions hereby gives Notice of Intended Action to amend Chapter 8, \"Accounts, \" Iowa Administrative Code. Subrule 8.5(3) is being rewritten for the following reasons: 1. The subrule contained an apparent \"statute of limitation \" which appeared to eliminate a credit union 's liability to creditors of a decedent by the credit union holding a payable-upon-death account for six months after the death of the owner. If the credit union declined to release the funds for six months, the purpose behind creating the payable-upon-death account is defeated. 2. Since an executor may not be appointed within 14 days of the death of an owner, the 14-day requirement was removed from subrule 8.5(3). It is not significant who is notified of the existence of the account, as long as either the executor or the beneficiary is notified. 3. The reference to \"claims \" was also removed, since the Credit Union Division lacks authority to make funds subject to \"claims \" against an owner. It is sufficient to state that the funds held in trust shall be subject to debts and inheritance taxes as required by law. 4. The rewritten subrule is now applicable to both revocable trust accounts and ,to testamentary accounts, as both are generally considered part of the decedent 's estate. Persons who want to orally convey their views should contact James E. Forney, Superintendent of Credit Unions, Credit Union Division, at (515)281-6514 by January 14, 1991.Written comments must be received by the Division by January 14,1991, and should be sent to: James E.

This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 533. The following amendment is proposed: Rescind subrule 8.5(3) and insert in lieu thereof the following: 8.5(3) Funds held in revocable trust accounts and testamentary accounts shall be subject to the debts of the owner of the account and to inheritance tax as required by law. Within 30 days of notice of the death of an owner of funds held in a revocable trust account or a testamentary account, the credit union shall notify the executor of the deceased owner 's estate, or the beneficiary, of the existence and current balance of the account.

Notice is also given to the public that the Administrative Rules Review Committee may, on its own motion or on written request by any individual or group, review this proposed action under \u00a717A.8(6) at a regular or special meeting where the public or interested persons may be heard. Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 523A.16 and 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1213, section 26, the Iowa Division of Insurance hereby gives Notice of Intended Action to amend Chapter 19, \"Prearranged Funeral Contracts, \" Iowa Administrative Code. These proposed amendments add definitions of \"Establishment \" and \"Burial account \" and amend the definition of \"Seller \" to specifically include any establishment identified as the provider of the funeral merchandise, funeral services or cemetery merchandise under a burial account. Also, subrule 19.4(1) is amended to clarify that Iowa Code chapter 523A applies to any burial account that identifies an establishment as the provider of. funeral merchandise, funeral services or cemetery merchandise. To ensure that the information filed with the Appli \u00ad cation for Establishment Permit remains current, proposed rule 19.24(523A,73GA,ch 1213) establishes a biennial informational filing to update the establish \u00ad ment 's permit application. The filing will not require any filing fee, and a Certificate of Authority will be issued to document that the establishment 's permit remains in good standing. Subrule 19.33(2) is amended to clarify the situations under which the per-contract fee would not apply. Proposed rule 19.44(523A) lists the Consumer Price Index Adjustments for 1987,1988 and 1989 and provides guidelines for calculating the amounts of the adjustments and the amounts of any permissible withdrawals. Proposed rule 19.45(523A,73GA,ch 1213) establishes prohibitions and requirements for the regulation of burial accounts. The other proposed amendments make technical changes in the language of the rules to delete references to 1987 Iowa Acts, House File 614 and to implement 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1213. Since the revised rules relate to two separate statutes, the rules have been divided into three sections clarifying which rules apply to both statutes, which rules apply only to Iowa Code chapter 523A and which rules apply only to 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1213, sections 13 to 30. As a result of 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1213, the Insurance Division may now approve warehouse or storage facilities which are not under the control of the seller. The Division requests comments on that approval 1102 NOTICES IAB 12/12/90 INSURANCE DIVISION[191] (cont 'd) process. Specifically, the Division requests comments on the nature of any general standards that should be applied in determining whether to approve a warehouse or storage facility that is not under the control of the seller. The Division seeks comments on the following questions: 1. Should the Insurance Division approve facilities not located in the state of Iowa? 2. What authorization should the Insurance Division require from establishments and storage facilities to ensure the ability of the Division to audit and inspect warehoused merchandise? Should the Division require independent audits by accountants? Should the Division coordinate audits and inspections with other organiza \u00ad tions or agencies of other states if possible? 3. What method of funding should be utilized to pay the costs of Insurance Division audits? If costs are prorated among establishments who have merchandise stored at an audited facility, should costs be prorated by the number of establishments, on a volume basis (the number of items in storage), or some alternative method? 4. Should storage facilities be required to submit annual reports to the Insurance Division? 5. What protection should be provided to the purchaser against the possibility of bankruptcy or financial distress of the storage facility? The statute already requires (a) a receipt of ownership in the name of the purchaser that must be delivered to the purchaser and (b) appropriate identifications and descriptions in a manner that each item of merchandise can be distinguished from other similar items of merchandise. 6. What protection to the purchaser should be provided against the possibility of loss or damage? The statute already requires (a) insurance against loss and (b) a manner of storage that protects against damage. Should the Insurance Division accept general insurance policies or require a separate policy for Iowa liabilities? If a general policy is accepted, what method should be utilized to ensure that the amount of insurance is adequate? What type of insurance policy should the Division require? What types of risks and perils should be insured against? 7. Should the Insurance Division require storage only at bonded and licensed warehouses? If so, should minimum standards be established or should the Division rely upon the standards established by the state where the facility is located? Should a separate bond be required for the state of Iowa? If not, what method should be utilized to ensure that the amount of the bond is adequate? 8. To what degree should the manufacturing process for the merchandise be complete and the merchandise ready for shipping? 9. Should the Insurance Division require that estab \u00ad lishments place funds in trust equal to the amount they will incur for the delivery of the merchandise and any installation costs, if applicable? If the cost of delivery is guaranteed by the storage facility, should that facility be required to place funds in trust for the cost of delivery? 10. In the event that it is not currently practical to finish the merchandise, should the Insurance Division require that an appropriate amount to fund finishing costs be placed in trust by either the establishment or the storage facility? 11. In the event that the Insurance Division requires trust accounts for certain anticipated expenses (finish \u00ad ing, delivery, installation, etc.), what process or methodshould be utilized to certify or establish the required amounts that must be deposited in trust? The Insurance Division has concluded that these rules may have an impact on small business pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.31. These rules will not necessitate additional expendi \u00ad tures by political subdivisions or agencies and entities which contract with political subdivisions. There will be a public hearing on January 7, 1991, at 10 a.m. in the Sixth Floor Conference Room of the Lucas State Office Building, East 12th and Grand Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50319.

IAB 12/12/90 NOTICES REVENUE AND FINANCE DEPARTMENT[701] (cant 'd)1119 The amendment to rule 701\u201451.1(422) defines the terms \"consolidation \" and \"merger \" in the context of corporate reorganizations. The amendment to Chapter 52 creates a new rule 701\u2014 52.10 which establishes a sequence for deducting credits against the corporation income tax liability. The credits are deducted such that those with the shortest carry \u00ad forward time are used first, then the credits with an unlimited carryforward period and finally those credits which are refundable are deducted last. By following this sequence, it ensures that taxpayers will get maximum use of the various credits they earn. The amendment to rule 701\u201453.12(422) sets forth the Department 's position that the federal environmental tax is an income tax in that it is imposed on a modified alternative minimum taxable income. Because the federal environmental tax is deductible in computing the federal taxable income,'the federal environmental tax must be added to federal taxable income and then a deduction of 50 percent is allowed under Iowa Code section 422.35(4).. This amendment is made prospective in that some corporations were allowed a deduction of 100 percent of the federal environmental tax in computing federal taxable income, rather than only 50 percent as a deduction for federal income taxes, for tax. years commencing before January 1, 1990. The proposed rule will not necessitate additional expenditures by political subdivisions or agencies and entities which contract with political subdivisions. The Department has determined that this proposed rule may have an impact on small business. The Department has considered the factors listed in Iowa Code section 17A.31(4). The Department will issue a v regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Iowa Code sections 17A.31 to 17A.33 if a written request is filed by delivery or by mailing postmarked no later than ' January 2,1991, to the Policy Section, Technical Services Division, Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance, Hoover State Office Building, P.O.

A \"consolidation \" is unifica \u00ad tion of two or more constituent corporations into a single newly existing corporation in which new corporation takes over assets and assumes liabilities of constituent corporations which pass out of existence; a \"corporate merger \" is distinguished by continuing existence of one of the constituent corporations into which other corporations are merged. Handley v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 352 N.W.2d 447, 450, 118 Mich. App. 423. Item 2. Amend Chapter 52 by adding the following new rule 701\u201452.10(422) and renumbering the existing rule 701\u201452.10(422) as rule 701\u201452.11(422). 701\u201452.10(422) Deduction of credits.

Research activities credit. 5. Motor fuel credit. 6. Estimated tax and payments with extensions. ITEM 3. Amend the introductory paragraph of rule 701\u201453.12(422) to read as follows: 701\u201453.12(422) Federal income tax deduction. \"Federal income taxes \" shall mean those income taxes paid or payable to the United States Government and shall not include taxes paid or payable or taxes deemed to have been paid to a foreign country. Construction Products, Inc. v. Briggs, State Board of Tax Review, Case No. 25, February 1, 1972. \"Federal income taxes \" includes the federal alternative minimum tax. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1990, \"Federal income taxes \" includes the federal environmental tax. Because the federal environmental tax is deducted in computing federal taxable income and Iowa Code section U22.35(U) only allows a deduction for 50 percent of the federal income tax paid or accrued, the federal environ \u00ad mental tax deducted in computing federal taxable income must be added to federal taxable income. 1120 NOTICES TAB 12/12/90 NOTICE \u2014 USURY In accordance with the provisions of Iowa Code section 535.2, subsection 3, paragraph \"a,\" the Superintendent of Banking has determined that the maximum lawful rate of interest shail be: May 1, 1988 \u2014 May 31, 1988 10.25% June 1, 1988 \u2014 June 30,1988 10.75% July 1, 1988 \u2014 July 31, 1988 ' 11.00% August 1, 1988 \u2014 August 31,1988 11.00% September 1, 1988 \u2014 September 30,1988 11.00% October 1, 1988 \u2014 October 31, 1988 11.25% November 1, 1988 \u2014 November 30,1988 11.00% December 1, 1988 \u2014 December 31,1988 10.75% January 1,1989 \u2014 January 31, 1989 11.00% February 1, 1989 \u2014 February 28, 1989 10.75% March 1,1989 \u2014 March 31,1989 11.00% April 1, 1989 \u2014 April 30, 1989 11.25% May 1, 1989 \u2014 May 31, 1989 11.25% June 1, 1989 \u2014 June 30, 1989 11.25% July 1, 1989 \u2014 July 31,1989 10.75% August 1, 1989 \u2014 August 31, 1989 10.25% September 1, 1989 \u2014 September 30,1989 10.00% October 1, 1989 \u2014 October 31, 1989 10.00% \" November 1, 1989 \u2014 November 30,1989 10.25% December 1, 1989 \u2014 December 31,1989 10.00% January 1, 1990 \u2014 January 31, 1990 9.75% February 1,1990 \u2014 February 28, 1990 9.75% March 1, 1990 \u2014 March 31,1990 10.25% April 1, 1990 \u2014 April 30,1990 10.50% May 1, 1990 \u2014 May 31, 1990 10.50% June 1,1990 \u2014 June 30, 1990 10.75% July 1, 1990 \u2014 July 31, 1990 10.75% August 1, 1990 \u2014 August 31, 1990 10.50% September 1, 1990 \u2014 September 30,1990 10.50% October 1,1990 \u2014 October 31, 1990 10.75% November 1, 1990 \u2014 November 30,1990 11.00% December 1, 1990 \u2014 December 31,1990 - 10.75% IAB 12/12/90 FILED EMERGENCY 1121 ARC 1536A ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IOWA DEPARTMENT OF[261] Adopted and Filed Emergency Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 15.104 and 15.106, the Iowa Department of Economic Devel\u00ad opment emergency adopts and implements a new Chapter 11, \"Productivity and Quality Enhancement, \" Iowa Administrative Code.

The filing of the emergency rules rescinds previous rules for teacher education and certification which were in effect prior to October 1, 1988, the date on which the current certification and teacher education rules became effective. This rescission will reduce possible confusion about which rules are in force and effect. The transfer implements changes in licensing and rule- making authority relating to practitioner licensure mandated by Iowa Code Supplement chapter 260 and retains for the Board of Educational Examiners the rules for the human relations requirement. In compliance with Iowa Code section 17A.4(2), the Department finds that public notice and participation are impracticable since these rules have not been in effect since September 30,1988, and this transfer and rescission make no substantive changes. The Department also finds, pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2) \"b\"(2), that the normal effective date of this amendment, 35 days after publication, should be waived and the amendment be made effective upon filing with the Administrative Rules Coordinator on November 14,1990. The State Board of Education rescinded these rules on November 14, 1990. These rescissions are intended to implement Iowa Code section 256.7(5). These amendments became effective November 14, 1990. The following rescissions are adopted. Rescind rules 281\u201484.1(256) to 84.17(256) and rule 84.23(256).

IAB 12/12/90 FILED EMERGENCY 1125 ARC 1523A HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT [441] Adopted and Filed Emergency Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 249A.4, the Department of Human Services hereby amends Chapter 81, \"Nursing Facilities, \" appearing in the Iowa Administrative Code. These amendments implement the following change and corrections to the nursing facility policies: 1. Nursing home reform policies which were adopted effective October 1, 1990, contained a requirement that nursing facilities provide six hours of in-service training per quarter. The Administrative Rules Review Commit \u00ad tee voted to delay that requirement as they felt the requirement was excessive. The Department agrees and has received indication that final federal policy will also require less than six hours of in-service training per quarter. Therefore, this amendment lowers the in-service training requirement for nursing facilities to 12 hours per year. 2. At the time the nursing home reform policies were adopted, the Department inadvertently deleted a rule (subrule 81.13(3) \"j\") which it had adopted previously in response to 1989 Iowa Acts, chapter 304, section 903, which requires the Department to adopt rules which require all intermediate care facilities (nursing facilities) to execute separate written contracts for pharmaceutical vendor services and consultant pharmacist services. The consultant pharmacist contract shall require monthly drug regimen review reports and shall provide for reimbursement on the basis of fair market value. These amendments reinstate the rule which was rescinded in error. 3. These amendments also correct the implementation clauses to the rules in 441\u2014Chapter 81. The Department of Human Services finds that notice and public participation on the amendment regarding in-service training are impracticable because it appears the federal government will settle on 12 hours a year and notice would unduly delay implementation. Notice and public participation on the amendments correcting the inadvertent rule deletion and the implementation clauses are unnecessary because the rule is mandated by statute and has previously been through the rule process and the implementation clause corrections are merely technical and do not affect any program provisions. Therefore, these amendments are filed pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.4(2). The Department finds that these rules confer a benefit by removing an unduly restrictive in-service training requirement and by eliminating confusion over unstated policy and incorrect references. Therefore, these amendments are filed pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2) \"b\"(2). The Council on Human Services adopted these rules November 14,1990.

A system providing filtration on or before December 30, 1991, shall meet the requirements of this subrule on June 29, 1993. A system providing filtration after December 30, 1991, shall meet the requirements of this subrule when filtration is installed. The department may require and the system shall comply with any interim turbidity requirements the department deems necessary. Failure to meet any requirement of this subrule, in accordance with 567\u201443.5(455B), after the date specified in this paragraph is a treatment technique violation. b. Maximum contaminant levels (MCL or treatment technique requirement) for turbidity. The maximum contaminant levels (treatment technique requirements) for turbidity in drinking water, measured at represen \u00ad tative entry point(s) to the distribution system, are as follows: (1) Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration. 1.

The turbidity level of representative samples of a system 's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU when measured as specified in 41.7(l) \"c\" and \"e.\" (4) Other filtration technologies. A public water system may use either a filtration technology not listed in 41.7(l) \"b\"(l) to 41.7(l) \"b\"(3) or a filtration technology listed in 41.7(1) \"b\"(l) and \"b\"(2) at a higher turbidity level if it demonstrates to the department through apreliminary report submitted by a registered profes \u00ad sional engineer, using pilot plant studies or other means, that the alternative filtration technology in combination with disinfection treatment that meets the requirements of 43.5(2), consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts and 99.99 percent removal or inactivation of viruses. For a system that uses alternative filtration technology and makes this demon \u00ad stration, the maximum contaminant levels (treatment technique requirements) for turbidity are as follows: 1. The turbidity level of representative samples of a system 's filtered water must be less than or equal to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month when measured as specified in 41.7(l) \"c\" and \"e.\" 2. The turbidity level of representative samples of a system 's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU when measured as specified in 41.7(l) \"c\" and \"e.\" c. Monitoring requirements. (1) Routine turbidity monitoring. Turbidity measure \u00ad ments as required by 43.5(3) must be performed on representative samples of the system 's filtered water every four hours (or more frequently) that the system serves water to the public. A public water system may substitute continuous-turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if it validates the continuous measurement for accuracy on a regular basis using a calibration protocol approved by the department and audited for compliance during sanitary surveys. Major elements of the protocol shall include but are not limited to: method of calibration, calibration frequency, calibration standards, documentation, data collection and data reporting. For any systems using slow sand filtration or filtration treatment other than conventional treatment, direct filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the department may reduce the sampling frequency to once per day if it determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance. For systems serving 500 or fewer persons, the department may reduce the turbidity sampling frequency to once per day, regardless of the type of filtration treatment used, if the department determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance. Approval shall be based upon documentation provided by the system, acceptable to the department and pursuant to the conditions of an operation permit.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinking water standards and has determined that the presence of microbiological contaminants is a health concern at certain levels of exposure. If water is inadequately treated, microbiological contaminants in that water may cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and possibly jaundice, and any associated headaches and fatigue. These symptoms, however, are not just associated with disease- causing organisms in drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factors other than drinking water. EPA has set enforceable requirements for treating drinking water to reduce the risk of'these adverse health effects. Treatment such as filtering and disinfecting the water removes or destroys microbiological contaminants. Drinking water which is treated to meet EPA require \u00ad ments is associated with little or no risk and should be considered safe. ITEM 8. A new Chapter 567\u201448 entitled \"Water Supplies - Design and Operation \" is created by transferring portions of Chapter 41 and adding new rules.

Renumber rule 41.13 \"Certification of completion \" as 567\u201443.4(455B). Add a new rule to read as follows: 567\u201443.5(455B) Filtration and disinfection. 43.5(1) Applicability/general requirements. a. These rules apply to community and noncommunity public water supply systems using surface water or groundwater under the direct influence of surface water in whole or in part. The rules establish criteria under which filtration is required as a treatment technique. In addition, these rules establish treatment technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for Giardia lamblia , heterotrophic bacteria, Legionella, viruses and turbidity. Each public water system with a surface water source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water must provide treatment of that source water which complies with these treatment technique requirements. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve: (1) At least 99.9 percent (3-log) removal or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer; and (2) At least 99.99 percent (4-log) removal or inactivation of viruses between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer. b. Criteria for identification of groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. \"Groundwater under the direct influence of surface water \" means any water beneath the surface of the ground with: (1) significant occurrence of insects or other macroorganisms, algae, or large-diameter pathogens such as Giardia lamblia ; or (2) significant and relatively rapid shifts in water characteristics such as turbidity (particulate content), temperature, conductivity, or pH which closely correlate to climatological or surface water conditions. Direct influence must be determined for individual sources in accordance with criteria established by the department. The department determination of direct influence may be based on site-specific measurements of water quality or documentation of well construction characteristics and geology with field evaluation. Only surface water and groundwater sources under the direct influence of surface water that are at risk to the contamination from Giardia cysts are subject to the requirements of this rule. Groundwater sources shall not be subject to this rule. The evaluation process shall be used to delineate between surface water, groundwater under the direct influence of surface water and groundwater. The identification of a source as surface water and groundwater under the direct influence of surface water shall be determined for an individual source, by the department, in accordance with the following criteria. The public water supply shall provide to the department that information necessary to make the determination. The evaluation process will involve one or more of the following steps: (1) Preliminary review. The department shall conduct a preliminary evaluation of information on the source provided by the public water supply to determine if the source is an obvious surface water (i.e., pond, lake, stream, etc.) or groundwater under the direct influence 1140 FILED IAB 12/12/90 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cont 'd) of surface water. The source shall be evaluated during that period of highest susceptibility to influence from surface water. The preliminary evaluation may include a review of surveys, reports, geological information of the area, physical properties of the source, and a review of departmental and public water system records. If the source is identified as a surface water no additional evaluation shall be conducted. If the source is a groundwater and identified as a deep well, it shall be classified as a groundwater not under the direct influence of surface water and no additional evaluation shall be conducted, unless through direct knowledge or documen \u00ad tation the source does not meet the requirements of 43.5(l) \"b\"(2). The deep well shall then be evaluated in accordance with 43.5(l) \"b\"(3). If the source is a shallow well, the source shall be evaluated in accordance with. 43.5(l) \"b\"(2). If the source is a spring, infiltration gallery, Ranney well, or any other subsurface source it shall be evaluated in accordance with 43.5(l) \"b\"(3). (2) Well source evaluation. Shallow wells greater than 50 feet in lateral distance from a surface water source shall be evaluated for direct influence of surface water through a review of departmental or public water system files in accordance with 43.5(l) \"b\"(2)\"l,\" first unnum \u00ad bered paragraph, and 43.5(l) \"b\"(2)\"2.\" Sources that meet the criteria shall be considered to be not under the direct influence of surface water. No additional evaluation will be required. Shallow wells 50 feet or less in lateral distance from a surface water shall be in accordance with 43.5(l) \"b\"(3) and (4). 1. Well construction criteria. The well shall be constructed so as to include: A surface sanitary seal using bentonite clay, concrete, or other acceptable material. The well casing shall penetrate a confining bed. The well casing shall be perforated or screened only below a confining bed. 2. Water quality criteria. Water quality records shall indicate: No record of total coliform or fecal coliform contamination in untreated samples collected over the past three years. No history of turbidity problems associated with the well, other than turbidity as a result of inorganic chemical precipitates. No history of known or suspected outbreak of Giardia or other pathogenic organisms associated with surface water (e.g., Cryptosporidium) which has been attributed to well. 3. Other available data. If data on particulate matter analysis of the well are available, there shall be no evidence of particulate matter present that is associated with surface water.'If information on turbidity or temperature monitoring of the well and nearby surface water is available, there shall be no data on the source which correlates with that of a nearby surface water. 4. Wells that do not meet all the requirements listed shall require further evaluation in accordance with 43.5(l) \"b\" (3) and (4). (3) Formal evaluation. The evaluation shall be conducted by the department or registered engineer at the direction of the public water supply. The evaluation shall include: 1. Complete file review. In addition to the information gathered in 43.5(l) \"b\"(l), the complete file review shall consider but not be limited to: design and construction details; evidence of direct surface water contamination;water quality analysis; indications of waterborne disease outbreaks; operational procedures; and customer complaints regarding water quality or water-related infectious illness. Sources other than a well source shall be evaluated in a like manner to include a field survey. 2. Field survey. A field survey shall substantiate findings of the complete file review and determine if the source is at risk to pathogens from direct surface water influence. The field survey shall examine the following criteria for evidence that surface water enters the source through defects in the source which include but are not limited to: a lack of a surface seal on wells, infiltration gallery laterals exposed to surface water, springs open to the atmosphere, surface runoff entering a spring or other collector, and distances to obvious surface water sources. . A report summarizing the findings of the complete file review and field survey shall be submitted to the department for final review and classification of the source. If the complete file review or field survey demonstrates conclusively that the source is subject to the direct surface water influence, the source shall be classified as under the direct influence of surface water. Either method or both may be used to demonstrate that the source is a surface water or groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. If the findings do not demonstrate conclusive evidence of direct influence of surface water, the analysis outlined in 43.5(l) \"b\"(4) should be conducted. (4) Particular analysis and physical properties evaluation. 1. Surface water indicators. Particulate analysis shall be conducted to identify organisms which only occur in surface waters as opposed to groundwaters, and whose presence in a groundwater would indicate the direct influence of surface water. - Identification of a Giardia cyst, live diatoms, and blue-green, green, or other chloroplast containing algae in any source water shall be considered evidence of direct surface water influence. Rotifers and insect parts are indicators of surface water. Without knowledge of which species is present, the finding of rotifers indicates that the source is either directly influenced by surface water, or the water contains organic matter sufficient to support the growth of rotifers. Insects or insect parts shall be considered strong evidence of surface water influence, if not direct evidence. The presence of coccidia (e.g., Cryptosporidium) in the source water is considered a good indicator of direct influence of surface water. Other macroorganisms (>7 um) which are parasitic to animals and fish such as, but are not limited to, helminths (e.g., tapeworm cysts), ascaris, and Diphyllobothrium, shall be considered as indicators of direct influence of surface water. 2. Physical properties. Turbidity, temperature, pH and conductivity provide supportive, but less direct, evidence of direct influence of surface water. Turbidity fluctua \u00ad tions of greater than 0.5 - 1 NTU over the course of a year may be indicative of direct influence of surface water. Temperature fluctuations may also indicate surface water influence. Changes in other chemical parameters such as pH, conductivity, hardness, etc., may also give an indirect indication of influence by nearby surface water. c. A public water system using a surface water source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of IAB 12/12/90 FILED 1141 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cont 'd) surface water is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of this subrule if it meets the filtration requirements in 43.5(3) and the disinfection require \u00ad ments in 43.5(2) in accordance with the effective dates specified within the respective subrules. d. Each public water system using a surface water source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water must be operated by a certified operator who meets the requirements of 567\u2014Chapter 81. 43.5(2) Disinfection. All community and noncommu \u00ad nity public water supply systems using surface water or groundwater under the direct influence of surface water in whole or in part shall be required to provide disinfection in compliance with this subrule and filtration in compliance with 43.5(3). If the department has determined that filtration is required, the system must comply with any interim disinfection requirements the department deems necessary before filtration is installed. A system providing filtration on or before December 30, 1991, must meet the disinfection require \u00ad ments of this subrule beginning June 29,1993. A system providing filtration after December 30,1991, must meet the disinfection requirements of this subrule when filtration is installed. Failure to meet any requirement of this subrule after the applicable date specified in this subrule is a treatment technique violation. The disin \u00ad fection requirements are as follows: a. The disinfection treatment must be sufficient to ensure that the total treatment processes of that system achieve at least 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation or removal of Giardia lamblia cysts and at least 99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation or removal of viruses, acceptable to the department. b. The disinfection system must include: (1) Redundant components, including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-up and alarm to ensure that disinfectant application is maintained continuously while water is being delivered to the distribution system, or (2) Automatic shut-off of delivery of water to the distribution system whenever there is less than 0.3 mg/1 of residual disinfectant concentration in the water. If the department determines that automatic shut-off would cause unreasonable risk to health or interfere with fire protection, the system must comply with 43.5(2) \"b\"(l). c. Disinfectant residual entering system. The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as specified in 41.7(2) \"c\" and \"e,\" cannot be less than 0.3 mg/1 for more than four hours. d. Disinfectant residual in the system. The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in 41.7(2) \"c\" and \"e,\" cannot be undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month for any two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in 41.2(3) \"e,\" is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining compliance with this require \u00ad ment. Therefore, the value \"V\" in the following formula cannot exceed 5 percent in one month for any two consecutive months.V =c+d+e x 100 a+b where: a = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured; b = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured but heterotrophic bacteria plate count (HPC) is measured; c = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not detected and no HPC is measured; d = number of instances where no residual disinfectant concentration is detected and where the HPC is >500/ml; and e = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is >500/ml. 43.5(3) Filtration. A public water system that uses a surface water source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water must provide treatment consisting of both disinfection, as specified in 43.5(2), and filtration treatment which complies with the turbidity requirements of subrule 41.7(1). A system providing or required to provide filtration on or before December 30, 1991, must meet the requirements of 41.7(1) by June 29,1993. A system providing or required to provide filtration after December 30,1991, must meet the requirement of 41.7(1) when filtration is installed. A system shall install filtration within 18 months after the department determines, in writing, that filtration is required. The department may require and the system shall comply with any interim turbidity requirements the department deems necessary. Failure to meet any requirements of the referenced subrules after the dates specified is a treatment technique violation. 43.5(4) Analytical and monitoring requirements. a. Analytical requirements. Only the analytical method(s) specified in this paragraph, or otherwise approved by the department, may be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 43.5(2) and 43.5(3).

IAB 12/12/90 FILED 1143 ARC 1551 A ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION [567] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 455B.105 and 455B.173, the Environmental Protection Commission for the Department of Natural Resources hereby adopts revisions to Chapter 40, \"Scope of Division- Definitions-Forms-Rules of Practice, \" and Chapter 41, \"Water Supplies, \" Iowa Administrative Code. The Notice of Intended Action was published in the June 13, 1990, Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 968A. Public hearings were held on July 9, July 10, July 11, and July 12, 1990. The amendments were adopted November 19-20,1990, by the Environmental Protection Commission. Minor changes to the amendments to Chapters 40 and 41 proposed in the Notice of Intended Action have been made as the result of comments and are reflected in the responsiveness summary. These water supply rules pertain to major revisions of the coliform bacteria monitoring requirements. The rule changes are proposed due to promulgation of regulations by EPA which become effective December 31,1990. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 455B, Division III, Part 1. These rules shall become effective January 16, 1991, after filing with the Administrative Rules Coordinator and publication in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin. Item 1. Amend rule 567\u201440.2(455B) by inserting in alphabetical order the following new definitions and amending the definition of \"sanitary survey \" and \"standard methods \": \"Confluent growth \" means a continuous bacterial growth covering the entire filtration area of a membrane filter, or a portion thereof, in which bacterial colonies are not discrete. \"Sanitary survey \" means a review and on-site inspection conducted by the department of the water source, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance and records of a public water supply system for the purpose of evaluating the adequacy of such source, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance for producing and distributing safe drinking water and identifying improvements necessary to maintain or improve drinking water quality. \"Standard methods \" means \"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater \" fourte enth seventeenth edition, American Public Health Association, 1015 18th 15th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036 20005 (1975) (1989). \"Too numerous to count\" means that the total number of bacterial colonies exceeds 200 on a 47-mm diameter membrane filter used for coliform detection. ITEM 2. Rescind 567\u201441.1(455B) and 567\u201441.2(455B) and insert following: to 41.5(455B) and 43.2(455B) shall apply to each public water supply system, unless the public water supply system meets all of the following conditions: 1. Consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and does not have any collection and treatment facilities);2. Obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water supply system to which such regulations apply; 3. Does not sell water to any person; and 4. Is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce. 567\u201441.2(455B) Biological maximum contaminant levels (MCL) and monitoring requirements. 41.2(1) Coliforms, fecal coliforms and E. coli. a. Applicability. These rules apply to all public water supply systems. b. Maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for total coliforms, fecal coliforms/ E1. coli. (1) The MCL is based on the presence or absence of total coliforms in a sample. The system is in compliance with MCL requirements for total coliform if it meets the following requirements: 1. For a system which collects 40 samples or more per month, no more than 5.0 percent of the samples collected during a month may be total coliform-positive. 2. For a system which collects less than 40 samples per month, no more than one sample collected during a month may be total coliform-positive. (2) Any fecal coliform-positive repeat sample or E. coli- positive repeat sample, or any total coliform-positive repeat sample following a fecal coliform-positive or E. compositive routine sample constitutes a violation of the MCL for total coliforms. For purposes of the public notification requirements in 41.5(2) \"a\"(2), this is a violation that may pose an acute risk to health. (3) Compliance of a system with the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b\"(l) and (2) is based on each month in which the system is required to monitor for total coliforms. (4) Results of all routine and repeat samples not invalidated by the department or laboratory must be included in determining compliance with the MCL for total coliforms. c. Monitoring requirements. (1) Routine total coliform monitoring. 1. Public water supply systems must collect total coliform samples at sites which are representative of water throughout the distribution system according to a written sample siting plan. The plan shall be reviewed or updated by the public water supply system every two years and shall be retained on file at the facility. Major elements of the plan shall include, but are not limited to, a map of the distribution system, notation or a list of routine sample location(s) for each sample period, resample locations for each routine sample, and a log of samples taken. The plan must be made available to the department upon request and during sanitary surveys and must be revised by the system as directed by the department. 2. The public water supply system must collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that a system which uses only groundwater (except groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in 43.5(l) \"b\") [see ARC 1552A herein], and serves 4,900 persons or fewer, may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites. 3. Community water systems. The monitoring fre\u00ad quency for total coliforms for community water systems and noncommunity water systems serving schools, to include preschools and day care centers, is based on the population served by the system as listed below, until 1144 FILED IAB 12/12/90 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cant 'd) June 29,1994. Public water systems which do not collect five or more routine samples each month must undergo an initial sanitary survey by June 29, 1994. After June 29, 1994, the monitoring frequency for systems serving less than 4,101 persons shall be a minimum of five routine samples per month unless the department determines, after completing sanitary survey's (at intervals not to exceed five years), that the monitoring frequency may continue as listed below. The monitoring frequency for regional water systems shall be as listed in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"4\" but in no instance less than that required by the population equivalent served.

Regional water systems. The supplier of water for a regional water system as defined in rule 567\u2014 40.2(455B) shall sample for coliform bacteria at a frequency indicated in the following chart until June 29, 1994, but in no case shall the sampling frequency for a regional water system be less than as set forth in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"3,\" based on the population equivalent served. Public water systems which do not collect five or more routine samples each month must undergo an initial sanitary survey by June 29, 1994. After June 29, 1994, the monitoring frequency of systems with less than 82 miles of pipe shall be a minimum of five routine samples per month unless the department determines, after completing sanitary surveys (at intervals not exceeding five years), that the monitoring frequency may continue as listed below. The following chart represents sampling frequency per miles of distribution system andis determined by calculating one-half the square root of the miles of pipe.

Noncommunity water systems. The monitoring frequency for total coliforms for noncommunity water systems is as listed in the four unnumbered paragraphs below until June 29, 1999. Public water systems which do not collect five or more routine samples each month must undergo an initial sanitary survey by June 29,1999. After June 29, 1999, the minimum number of samples shall be five routine samples per month unless the department determines, after completing sanitary surveys (at intervals not exceeding five years), that the monitoring frequency may continue as listed below. A noncommunity water system using only ground- water (except groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in 567\u201443.5(l) \"b\") and serving 1,000 persons or fewer must monitor each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public. Systems serving more than 1,000 persons during any month must monitor at the same frequency as a like- sized community water system, as specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"3.\" A noncommunity water system using surface water, in total or in part, must monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"3,\" regardless of the number of persons it serves. A noncommunity water system using groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in 567\u201443.5(l) \"b,\" must monitor at the same frequency IAB 12/12/90 . FILED ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cant'd)1145 as a like-sized community water system, as specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"3.\" The system must begin monitoring at this frequency beginning six months after the depart \u00ad ment determines that the groundwater is under the direct influence of surface water. A noncommunity water system serving schools must monitor at the frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(l)\"3.\" 6. If the department, on the basis of a sanitary survey, determines that some greater frequency of monitoring is more appropriate, that frequency shall be the frequency required under these regulations. This frequency shall be confirmed .or changed on the basis of subsequent surveys. 7. Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are sufficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, shall not be used to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b.\" Repeat samples taken pursuant to 41.2(l) \"c\"(2) are not considered special purpose samples, and must be used to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b.\" (2) Repeat total coliform monitoring. ' 1. Repeat sample time limit and numbers. If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, the public water supply system must collect a set of repeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result and in no case more than 24 hours .after being notified by the department. A system which collects more than one routine sample per month must collect no fewer than three repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. A system which collects one routine sample per month or fewer must collect no fewer than four repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. The department may extend the 24-hour limit on a case- by-case basis if the system has a logistical problem in collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyond its control. In those cases, the public water supply system must report the circumstances to the department no later than the end of the next business day after receiving the notice to repeat sample and initiate the action directed by the department. In the case of an extension, the department will specify how much time the system has to collect the repeat samples. 2. Repeat sample location(s). The system must collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken, and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections upstream and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections downstream of the original sampling site. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or at the first or last service connection, the system will be required to collect the repeat samples from the original sampling site and locations only upstream or downstream. 3. The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day, except that the department may allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a four-day period. \"System with a single service connection \" means a system \"which supplies drinking water to consumers through a single service line. 4. Additional repeat sampling. If one or more repeat samples in the set is total coliform-positive, the public water supply system must collect an additional set of repeat samples in the manner specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(2)'T\"to 41.2(l) \"c\"(2)\"3.\" The system must repeat this process until either total coliforms are not detected in one complete set of repeat samples or the system determines that the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b\" has been exceeded, notifies the department, and provides public notification to its users. 5. If a system collecting fewer than five routine samples per month has one or more total coliform-positive samples and the department does not invalidate the sample(s) under 41.2(l) \"c\"(3), it must collect at least five routine samples during the next month the system provides water to the public. For systems monitoring on a quarterly basis, the additional five routine samples may be required to be taken within the same quarter in which the original total coliform-positive occurred. The department may waive the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the system provides water to the public if the department has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and estab \u00ad lishes that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end of/the next month the system serves water to the public. In this case, the department must document this decision to waive the following month 's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the water supply section and the department official who recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA and public. The written documentation will generally be provided by the public water supply system in the form of a request and must describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken to correct the problem. The department will not waive the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform- negative. Under this paragraph, a system must still take at least one routine sample before the end of the next month it serves water to the public and use it to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b.\" (3) Invalidation of total coliform samples. total coliform-positive sample invalidated under this subpar \u00ad agraph does not count towards meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of 41.2(l) \"c.\" The department may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if one or more of the following conditions are met. 1. The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive result. A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected, in which case, the sample is valid) if the sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas formation is examined (e.g., the multiple-tube fermentation technique), produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the presence-absence (P-A) coliform test, or exhibits confluent growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g., membrane filter technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system must collect another sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system must continue to resample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The FILED IAB 12/12/90 1146 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cont 'd) department may waive the 24-hour time limit on a case- by-case basis. 2. The department, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collected as required by 41.2(l) \"c\"(2)\"l\" to \"4,\" determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other nondistribution system plumbing problem. \"Domestic or other nondistribution system plumbing problem \" means a coliform contam \u00ad ination problem in a public water supply system with more than one service connection that is limited to the specific service connection from which . the coliform- positive sample was taken. The department will not invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat samples collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample are also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected within five service connections of the original tap are total coliform-negative (e.g., the department will not inval \u00ad idate a total coliform-positive sample on the basis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform-negative, or if the public water supply system has only one service connection). 3. The department has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform-positive result is due to a circum \u00ad stance or condition which does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case, the system must still collect all repeat: samples required under 41.2(l) \"c\"(2)\"l\" to \"4,\" and use them to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b.\" To invalidate a total coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the decision with the rationale for the decision must be documented in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the water supply section and the department official who recom \u00ad mended the decision. The department must make this document available to EPA and the public. The written documentation generally provided by the public water supply system in the form of a request must state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, and what action the system has taken to correct this problem. The department will not invalidate a total coliform- positive sample solely on the grounds of poor sampling technique or that all repeat samples are total coliform- negative. (4) Fecal coliforms /Escherichia coli (E. eoli) testing. 1. If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform- positive, the system must analyze that total coliform- positive culture medium to determine if fecal coliforms are present, except that the system may test for E. coli in lieu of fecal coliforms. 2. The department may allow a public water supply system, on a case-by-case basis, to forego fecal coliform or E. coli testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the total coliform-positive sample is fecal coliform-positive or E. coZ^-positive. Accordingly, the system must notify the department as specified in 41.2(l) \"c\"(5)\"l\" and meet the provisions of 567\u201441.5(455B) pertaining to public notification. (5) Public water supply system 's response to violation. 1. A public water supply system which has exceeded the MCL for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b\" must report the violation to the water supply section of the depart \u00ad ment by telephone no later than the end of the next busi\u00ad ness day after it learns of the violation, and notify the public in accordance with 41.5(2)\" a.\" 2. A public water supply system which has failed to comply with a coliform monitoring requirement mustreport the monitoring violation to the department within ten days after the system discovers the violation and notify the public in accordance with 41.5(2) \"b.\" 3. If fecal coliforms or E. coli are detected in a routine or repeat sample, the system must notify the department by telephone by the end of the day when the system is notified of the test result, unless the system is notified of the result after the department office is closed, in which case the system must notify the department before the end of the next business day. d. Best available technology (BAT). The U.S. EPA identifies, and the department has adopted the following as the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means available for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for total coliforms in 41.2(l) \"b.\" (1) Protection of wells from contamination by coliforms by appropriate placement and construction; (2) Maintenance of a disinfectant residual throughout the distribution system; (3) Proper maintenance of the distribution system including appropriate pipe replacement and repair procedures, main flushing programs, proper operation and maintenance of storage tanks and reservoirs, and continual maintenance of a minimum positive water pressure of 20 psig in all parts of the distribution system; and (4) Filtration or disinfection of surface water in accordance with 567\u201443.5(455B) or disinfection of groundwater using strong oxidants such as, but not limited to, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone. e. Analytical methodology. (1) The standard sample volume required for total coliform analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is 100 ml. (2) Public water supply systems shall determine the presence or absence of total coliforms. A determination of total coliform density is not required. (3) Total coliform analyses. Public water supply systems must conduct total coliform analyses in accordance with one of the following analytical methods: 1. Multiple-Tube Fermentation (MTF) Technique, as set forth in Methods, Method 9921, 9921A, and tubes must be used; or \"Microbiological Methods for Monitoring the Environment, Water and Wastes, \" U.S. EPA, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268 (EPA-600/8-78-017, December 1978, available from ORD Publications, CERI, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268), Part III, Section B.4.1-4.6.4, pp. 114-118 (Most Probable Number Method), except that 10 fermentation tubes must be used; or 2. Membrane Filter (MF) Technique, as set fopth in \"Standard Methods, \" Method 9222A, 9222B, - pp. 9-82 to 9-93; or \"Microbiological Methods for Monitoring the Environment, Water and Wastes, \" U.S. EPA, Environmental Monitoring and Support Labor \u00ad atory, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268 (EPA-600/8-78-017, December 1978, available from ORD Publications, CERI, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268), Part III, Section B. 2.1-2.6, pp. 108-112; or 3. Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, in \"Standard Methods, \" Method 9921E \u2014pp. 9-80 to 9- 82; or 4. Minimal Medium ONPG-MUG (MMO-MUG) Test, as set forth in the article \"National Field Evaluation IAB 12/12/90 FILED ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567] (cont 'd)1147 of a Defined Substrate Method for the Simultaneous Detection of Total Coliforms and Escherichia coli from Drinking Water: Comparison with Presence-Absence Techniques \" (Edberg et al), Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Volume 55, pp. 1003-1008, April 1989. (Note: The MMO-MUG Test is sometimes referred to as the Autoanalysis Colilert System.) (4) In lieu of the 10-tube MTF Technique specified in 41.2(l) \"e\"(3)\"l,\" a public water supply system may use the MTF Technique using either five tubes (20-ml sample portions) or a single culture bottle containing the culture medium for the MTF Technique, i.e., lauryl tryptose broth (formulated as described in \"Standard Methods, \" Method 9221B \u2014p. 9-68), as long as a 100-ml water sample is used in the analysis. (5) Fecal coliform analysis. Public water systems must conduct fecal coliform analysis in accordance with the following procedure. When the MTF technique of presence-absence (P-A) coliform test is used to test for total coliforms; shake the lactose-positive presumptive tube or P-A bottle vigorously and transfer the growth with a sterile 3-mm loop or sterile applicator stick into brilliant green lactose bile broth and EC medium to determine the presence of total and fecal coliforms, respectively. For EPA-approved analytical methods which use a membrane filter, remove the membrane containing the total coliform colonies from the substrate with sterile forceps and carefully curl and insert the membrane into a tube of EC medium. (The laboratory may first remove a small portion of selected colonies for verification). Gently shake the inoculated EC tubes to ensure adequate mixing and incubate in a waterbath at 44.5 (\u00b1) 0.2 \u00b0C for 24 (\u00b1) 2 hours. Gas production of any amount in the inner fermentation tube of the EC medium indicates a positive fecal coliform test. The preparation of EC medium is described in \"Standard Methods, \" Method 9921C \u2014p. 9-75, paragraph la. Public water supply systems need only determine the presence or absence of fecal coliforms; a determination of fecal coliform density is not required. Giardia herein] 41.2(4) Macroscopic organisms and algae. a. Applicability. These rules apply to both community and noncommunity public water supply systems using surface water or groundwater under direct influence of surface as defined by 43.5(1). b. Maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for macro \u00ad scopic organisms and algae. Finished water shall be free of any macroscopic organisms such as plankton, worms, or cysts. The finished water algal cell count shall not exceed 500 organisms per milliliter or 10 percent of the total cells found in the raw water, whichever is greater. Compliance with the maximum contaminant level for algal cells is calculated in accordance with 41.2(4) \"c.\" c. Monitoring requirements \u2014reserved. d. BAT \u2014reserved. e. Analytical methodology. Measurement of the algal cells shall be in accordance with Method 10200F, \"Standard Methods, \" pp. 10-23 to 10-28. Such measure \u00ad ment shall be required only when the department determines on the basis of complaints or otherwise that excessive algal cells are present. Item 3, Rescind and reserve subrule 41.3(4). This subrule has been completely rewritten and the require \u00ad ments are included within 41.2(l) and the implemen \u00ad tation clause at the end thereof. Provisions of 41.3(7) are now found within 41.2(4) without material change. Item 5. Rescind and reserve subrule 41.4(1). This subrule has been completely rewritten and the require \u00ad ments are included within 41.2(l) \"c.\" Item 6. Rescind and reserve subrule 41.4(10). Provisions of 41.4(10) are now found within 41.2(4) without material change. Item 7. Rescind subrule 41.5(1), paragraph \"b,\" and insert the following: b. Except where a different reporting period is specified in this part, the supplier of water shall report to the department within U8 hours after any failure to comply with the monitoring requirements set forth in this rule. The supplier of water shall also notify the department within U8 hours of failure to comply with any primary drinking water regulations. ITEM 8. Subrule 41.5(2) \"a\"(2) is amended by adding a numbered paragraph \"3\" to read as follows: 3. Violation of the MCL for total coliforms, when fecal coliforms or E. coli are present in the water distribution system, as specified in 41.2(l) \"b\"(2). ITEM 9. Subrule 41.5(2) \"e\" is amended by adding the following: (11) Total coliforms (to be used when there is a violation of 41.2(l) \"b\"(l) and not a violation of 41.2(l) \"b\"(2).

ARC 1554A ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMMISSION [567] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 455B.105 and 455B.173, the Environmental Protection Commission for the Department of Natural Resources amends Chapter 61, \"Water Quality Standards, \" Iowa Administrative Code. The recent revisions which amended the numerical and narrative criteria of the water quality standards, effective May 23, 1990, included new aquatic useprotection designations for Iowa 's various water bodies. It is anticipated that approximately three years of field activities will be required to properly determine and assign the appropriate use designations to all individual rivers, streams and lakes. The determination and adoption of use designations are required prior to implementation of the amended water quality standards in establishing individual effluent limits for wastewater treatment facilities. This amendment is the second group of waters for which the new use designations are warranted. A Notice of Intended Action was published on September 19, 1990, as ARC 1269A reflecting the proposed changes to stream use designations. Public hearings were held on October 9,10, and 11,1990. The amendments in use designations were adopted on November 19,1990. Modifications to the proposed rules, as published under the Notice, have been made in the use designations for one stream in northeastern Iowa, as requested by a written comment. Only one written comment was received'. This comment has been addressed in a responsiveness summary available from the Department. This summary is on file with the Administrative Rules Coordinator. No economic impact statement was prepared for these particular use designations as the economic impact was addressed in the statement prepared for the original water quality standards revisions adopted on March 20,1990. No changes were made as a result of the public hearings. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 455B, Di vision III, Part 1. These rules become effective January 16, 1991, after filing with the Administrative Rules Coordinator and publication in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin.

ARC 1525 A HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT[441] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 249A.4, the Department of Human Services hereby amends Chapter 76, \"Application and Investigation, \" appearing in the Iowa Administrative Code. The Council on Human Services adopted this rule November 14,1990. Notice of Intended Action regarding this rule was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on October 3, 1990, as ARC 1314A. Recipients that utilize Medicaid services at a frequency or in an amount which is considered to be overuse of services may be restricted (locked-in) to receive services from a designated provider(s) to promote high quality health care and to prevent harmful practices such as duplication of medical services, drug abuse or overuse, and possible drug interactions. Under current policy recipients are locked-in for a minimum of six months, with longer restrictions determined on an individualbasis. This amendment changed the minimum period for lock-in to 24 months. A six-month lock-in period is too short to ensure behavior changes. A survey of other states has deter \u00ad mined Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, and Missouri have a 24-month lock-in period and Nebraska and Colorado have 12 months. This rule is identical to that published under Notice of Intended Action. This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 249A.4. This rule shall become effective February 1,1991. The following amendment is adopted: Amend subrule 76.9(1) as follows: 76.9(1) A lock-in or restriction shall be imposed for a minimum of she 2J) months with longer restrictions determined on an individual basis. .

The Council on Human Services adopted these rules November 14, 1990. Notices of Intended Action regard \u00ad ing these rules were published in the Iowa Administra \u00ad tive Bulletin on September 19, 1990, as ARC 1261A and on October 3, 1990, as ARC 1290A. These amendments provide Medicaid coverage of the drug Clozapine for treatment of chronic schizophrenia when certain criteria are met and provide that payment will be made for a physical examination when the examination is required for a disabled adult for attendance at school or camp. Clozapine is a newly marketed antipsychotic drug found to be clinically effective in the psychiatric - management of treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients who have derived little benefit from standard neuroleptic medications. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disturbances in thinking and communication, and by deteriorating social functioning which have historically been treated with neuroleptic medications. Many of the neuroleptic medications have unpleasant side effects including blurred vision, dry mouth, depression, restlessness, parkinsonism and, in a few cases, generally after several years of usage, irreversible abnormal movements of facial and limb muscles called tardive dyskinesia. In addition to the positive symptoms there are negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as loss of motivation, withdrawal, emotional flatness, arid lack of interest or pleasure from activities or social relations. These symptoms receive little relief from current neuroleptic medications. Persons treated with Clozapine experience limited side effects, do not develop tardive dyskinesia, _ and show improvement in both positive and negative symptoms, often greater than with other medications. However, the main side effect of Clozapine is an acute disease which affects the white blood cell count in approximately 1 percent of the persons taking the medication. Therefore, persons on Clozapine require weekly hematology tests to ensure that the white blood cell count has not been affected. Approximately. 1 percent of the population (29,080 in Iowa) suffers from schizophrenia. It is estimated that 10 to 30 percent of persons with schizophrenia (2,908 to 8,724) are considered treatment-resistant, e.g., have received various treatments with little or no benefit. It is recognized that many persons with treatment-resistant schizophrenia may be tried on Clozapine, but only one- third of the persons will benefit and be maintained on it. It is estimated that 85 to 90 percent of the persons with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are on, or eligible for, Medicaid. - Upon receipt of the Federal Food and Drug Admin \u00ad istration approval, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals establisheda pricing and distribution mechanism which packaged the laboratory work, medication, and monitoring service. As a result, Clozapine is costly ($172 per week) and is currently available only on a limited, case-by-case basis in Iowa. Costs are being paid by family members in several areas of the state, by several Iowa counties who have agreed to assume responsibility for the_costs in anticipation of a long-term savings, and by a private insurer in at least one known case. . Due to the costs and numbers involved and the limited experience Iowa has had with the drug, the Department of Human Services -is proposing to require prior authorization for payment of Clozapine using criteria developed by the state mental health institutions. Those criteria are as follows: 1. The condition being treated must meet the Diag \u00ad nostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III-R criteria for a schizophrenic disorder. ' 2. The patient must have had an unsuccessful trial on at least three or more different antipsychotic medications or be unable to tolerate other neuroleptics due to tardive dyskinesia or other side effects. 3. The patient must be treatment-resistant as evi\u00ad denced by a documented duration of illness longer than five years with multiple hospitalizations, or continuous hospitalization for more than one year. 4. The patient must have a score of 50 or higher on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). 5. Payment will be approved for 12 weeks of therapy for patients meeting criteria 1 through 4 above if there are no contraindications for use of the drug, and the patient has undergone a medical evaluation prior to the beginning of drug therapy. 6. After 12 weeks, patients showing improvement (a 20 percent reduction in the total BPRS score from baseline and documented progress) will continue to be covered. 7. Patients showing some documented clinical improve \u00ad ment after 12 weeks but not meeting continuation criteria must be reviewed for consideration of an additional 12 weeks of therapy. If an additional 12 weeks is granted, continuation criteria must be met to continue coverage after a total of 24 weeks of therapy. 8. Patients showing no improvement after 12 weeks of therapy are not eligible for continued therapy with Clozapine. Physicians disagree over the number of persons with schizophrenia who might benefit from use of the drug. These criteria are intended to describe a conservative definition of medical necessity for treatment. Other options would include giving more people the initial 12 weeks of payment. These options were avoided because of increased costs. Another option would be to refuse to pay for the drug altogether. This option was rejected because it very likely violates the Medicaid statute by discriminating against persons on the basis of diagnosis. There may be significant savings from the use of Clozapine by persons with schizophrenia in Iowa. For about 30 percent of the clients in-patient hospitalization can be avoided. Anticipated savings need to be evaluated carefully in light of potential alternative placement or living arrangements and the individual 's capacity for self-sufficiency. Medicaid already pays for an examination required for a child for attendance at school or camp. This change IAB 12/12/90 HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT[441] (cont 'd)FILED 1153 is being made in response to requests from advocates of disabled adult recipients whose families are unable to cover the costs of the physical examination required for attendance at school or camp.

In addition, when the established criteria have not been met, rules were revised to provide that payment for Clozapine will be approved if recommended as appro \u00ad priate treatment for chronic treatment-resistant schizo \u00ad phrenia by a physician review panel established by the Department. The review panel shall base its recommen \u00ad dation on clinical documentation provided by the prescribing physician. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code section 249A.4.

ARC 1547A REVENUE AND FINANCE DEPARTMENT[701] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 421.14, the Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance hereby adopts amendments to Chapter 10, \"Interest, Penalty, and Exceptions to Penalty, \" Iowa Administrative Code. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin, volume XIII, number 8, on October 17,1990, page 734, as ARC 1330A. This amendment implements Iowa Code section 421.7. This Code section requires the Director of Revenue and Finance to determine the interest rate for each calendar year. The Director has determined that the rate of interest on interest bearing taxes arising under Iowa Code Title XVI shall be 12 percent for the calendar year IAB 12/12/90 FILED REVENUE AND FINANCE DEPARTMENTS 01] (cant 'd)1159 1991. The interest rate is 2 percent above the average prime rate charged by banks on short-term business loans as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for the 12-month period ending September 30, 1990. For the past 12 months, the average prime rate was 10 percent. 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1172, amended Iowa Code subsection 421.7(2) to provide that beginning with calendar year 1991, the interest rate charged on outstanding taxes or paid on refunds to taxpayers would be increased to. 2 percent above the average prime rate for thes 12 months ended September 30 of the previous calendar year. This provision increases the interest rate on outstanding taxes or on refunds to taxpayers to 12 percent. The 12 percent annual rate is equivalent to an interest rate of 1.0 percent per month on all outstanding taxes. The rate will be applied to all taxes owing or becoming payable on or after January 1, 1991. Under Iowa law, each fraction of a month is considered a whole month when interest is computed. When required to pay interest on taxpayers ' refunds, the Department will also pay interest at the 12 percent rate on refunds owing or becoming payable on or after January 1,1991. These amendments are identical to those published under Notice of Intended Action. These amendments will become effective January 16, 1991, after filing with the Administrative Rules Coordinator and publication in the , Iowa Administrative Bulletin. The amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 421 as amended by 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1172. The following amendments are'adopted. ITEM 1. Amend rule 701\u201410.2(421) by adding the following new subrule: 10.2(10) Calendar year 1991. The interest upon all unpaid taxes which are due as of January 1, 1991, will be 12 percent per annum (1.0% per month). This interest rate will accrue on taxes which are due and unpaid as -of, or after, January 1, 1991. In addition, this interest rate will accrue on tax refunds which by law accrue interest, regardless whether the tax to be refunded is due before, on, or after January 1, 1991. This interest rate of 12 percent per annum, whether for unpaid taxes or tax refunds, will commence to accrue in 1991. ITEM 2. Amend the implementation clause of rule 701\u201410.2(421) to read as follows: This rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 421.7a s amended by 1990 Iowa Acts, chapter 1172.

ARC 1540 A UTILITIES DIVISION[199] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 17A.4(1) and 476.2, the Iowa State Utilities Board (Board) gives notice that on November 21, 1990, the Board issued an order in Docket No. RMU-90-19, In Re: Options for Demand Charge Allocations , \"Order Adopting Rules. \"On April 13, 1990, the Board issued an order in this docket commencing a rule making to consider the adoption of an amendment to 199 IAC 19.10(3), setting forth options for allocation of demand charges assessed to local distribution companies by pipelines. The rule making was necessitated by Northern Natural Gas Company 's unification of D-l charges and D-2 charges into a single demand charge. On the same date the proposed rule making was initiated, the Board emer \u00ad gency adopted and implemented a subrule allocating demand charges according to the same percentage the charges were allocated in the last month in which D-2 rates were not zero. [IAB 5/2/90, ARC 846A] The emergency rule was intended to provide the basis for allocation until the options could be assessed through the rule-making process. A Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on May 2, 1990, as ARC 845A. In order to allow for public comment on the proposed rule, a deadline of May 22, 1990, was set for written comments and an oral presentation was held on May 31,1990: The Board proposed five separate options for consid\u00ad eration. The Board will adopt Option 1, modified to use the average percentage over a 12-month period rather than a single month. Option 1 is nearly identical to the rule currently in effect. The allocation has proved workable and is easy to administer. The modification, suggested by Midwest Gas, a division of Iowa Public Service Company, and the Consumer Advocate Division of the Department of Justice (Consumer Advocate), will provide a more representative percentage than the single month of January 1990, which left the outcome sensitive to seasonal factors. In addition, the term \"current demand charges \" will be defined to remove any ambiguity. Option 2, which allocated the demand' charges in the amount allocated in the month before the change became effective was not supported by any of the commenters. According to the comments, using the total D-2 dollar amount from the last month charges were allocated is less relevant than a percentage since the total amount of demand charges is a changing number. The third option, which allocated the charge uniformly over all units sold, was supported by Consumer Advocate. However, no method for setting this charge was offered and Board action would be required to change the amount as total demand charges changed. Option 4 assigned demand costs on the basis of peak day hours in which service was available and was rejected because the calculation would be difficult to perform and check. Several commenters were concerned that this method would cause large year-to-year variations in prices to interruptible customers. Option 5, which restored the previous rule and resulted in the assignment of all demand costs to firm sales customers, was favored by the interruptible customers commenting and by some of the utilities concerned about the possible loss of industrial sales. Other commenters opposed Option 5 arguing the interruptible customers benefit from the pipeline system and should pay a portion of the fixed distribution costs in recognition of the use of the system. The rule finally adopted incorporates certain revisions proposed by the parties filing comments. The Board has also provided a definition of the term \"current demand charges \" for clarity. The Board does not believe additional public comment on the adopted rule is necessary because the changes made to the rule are a logical outgrowth of the prior Notice and public hearing. 1160 FILED IAB 12/12/90 UTILITIES DIVISION[199] (cont 'd) The rule is intended to implement Iowa Code section 476.6(11) and will become effective on January 16, 1991, pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5. The Board, having given due consideration to each of the comments received, adopts the following: Amend subrule 19.10(3) by rescinding the fifth unnumbered paragraph and inserting the following in lieu thereof: If a supplier 's entitlement charge is zero, the same percentage of current demand charges shall be allocatedto each customer class or grouping as the average of demand charges allocated during the last 12-month period for which entitlement rates were not zero. \"Current demand charges \" means the amount (D x Rd) used in computing, the formula set out in 19.10(1).

The Notice of Intended Action was published in Iowa Administrative Bulletin Vol. XIII, No. 7 (10/3/90) p. 624, ARC 1292A. Specifically, the Rules Committee directed the Department to address the economic impact on commer \u00ad cial fishermen- and the Department of the proposal to remove flathead catfish and channel catfish from the commercial species list on the Missouri River effective January 1, 1992. The restriction of catfish from commercial harvest on the Missouri River is being proposed because of severe overexploitation. Channel modification brought about by the Army Corps of Engineers ' Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project has dramatically reduced the available aquatic habitats for catfishes and most other riverine species. Because of limited habitat, there exists today a fraction of the fish community that there was in the preproject period. The small amount of commercial fishing activity by Iowa and Nebraska fishermen accounts for 93 percent of the total harvest of channel catfish from the Missouri River. During 1990, the Department of Natural Resources received $4,246 income from license sales and gear tags purchased by commercial fishermen fishing the Missouri River (Table 1). This amount represents the maximum annual revenue lost to the Department beginning in 1992 if all 13 commercial fishermen ceased operations. The majority of commercial fishermen are expected to exit the Missouri River if catfishes are removed from the permitted take; however, a lesser amount of commercial fishing is expected to continue for carp, buffalo, and other commercial food-fish species. The remaining commercial fishing activity will provide an undetermined amount of revenue to the Department. Table 1 Revenue Received by Department of Natural Resources from Missouri River Commercial Fishermen During 1990 Number Sold Each Total Owner 's License 13 $200 $2,600 Operator 's 26 50 1,300 License Operator 's 2 100 200 License (Nonresident) Gear Tags 146 1 146 Total State Revenue $4,246 The 13 licensed Missouri River commercial fishermen reported a harvest of 9,393 pounds of catfish from the Missouri River in 1989 (Table 2). At a reported market price of $1 per pound by Missouri River fishermen, total revenue generated to the commercial fishermen was$9,393. The average income from catfish sales among the 13 fishermen in 1989 was $723. The sale of other commercial species such as carp and buffalo brought an additional $285 on average to each fisherman. Comparison of the commercial fishing activity on the Missouri River to that conducted on the Mississippi River may better describe the nature of the Missouri River fishery and status of the catfish populations. In 1989 there were 172 licensed commercial fishermen on the Mississippi River who reported a harvest of 2,965,147 pounds of fish valued at $627,775 (Table 3). Combined harvest of flathead and channel catfish from the Mississippi River totaled 693,352 pounds with an estimated value of $294,064. Reported market price for Mississippi River catfish in 1989 was $.45 for channel catfish and $.33 for flathead catfish. Table 2 Commercial Harvest and Value of Fish From the Missouri River in 1989 Pounds HarvestPrice Per Pound Value Channel Catfish 3,989 $ 1 $3,989 Flathead Catfish $13,095 Table 3 Commercial Harvest and Value of Fish From the Mississippi River in 1989 Pounds HarvestPrice Per Pound . Value Total All Species 2,965,147 $627,775 Iowa Missouri River commercial fishermen report they receive an average of $1 per pound for catfish. This represents a market price at least double that demanded by Mississippi River catfish. Yet, the total reported harvest of catfish in 1989 from the Missouri River was only 9,393 pounds compared to a reported harvest of 693,352 pounds from the Mississippi River. Catfish are not harvested from the Missouri River in large numbers by commercial fishermen because the population of catfish is in short supply. The term \"commercial fishing \" hardly describes the current level of activity on the Missouri River. Most of the 13 licensed fishermen by their own admission are \"weekenders, \" in it for an interesting pastime or hobby or \"food gathering. \" We have on the Missouri River a small group of people who are, in essence, sportfishing with commercial fishing gear. This small group of people account for 93 percent of the harvest of a limited catfish population. It is the conclusion of the Department of .Natural Resources that catfish population on the Missouri River has been reduced dramatically by systemwide habitat decline brought on by the Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project. Continuation of commercial fishing for catfish threatens the viability of future catfish populations. IAB 12/12/90 EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT 1163 In The Name and By The Authority of The State of Iowa EXECUTIVE ORDER 41 WHEREAS , WHEREAS , WHEREAS , WHEREAS ,1990 Iowa Acts ch 1146 empowers the Governor to accept on behalf of the State of Iowa, retrocession of Federal Jurisdiction if offered by the appropriate Federal authority. Section 5 of the Public Buildings Amendments' of 1988 (Public Law 100-678), 102 Stat.4050, gives General Services Administration (GSA) the authority to offer an assignment of jurisdiction for the administration of criminal, health and safety laws for property under their charge and control . on September 13, 1990, GSA offered assignment of jurisdiction to the State of Iowa for the administration of Iowa criminal laws and health and safety laws; provided that such jurisdiction is to be concurrent with jurisdiction of the United States who will continue to administer Federal laws. the offer of assignment and concurrent jurisdiction pertains to the following Federal properties : U.S. Courthouse, 123 East Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa Ft. Des Moines, Iowa, Buildings 87 and 309 Federal Building and Courthouse, 4th and Perry, Davenport, Iowa NOW, THEREFORE, I, TERRY E. BRANSTAD, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF IOWA, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of Iowa, do accept the offer of assignment of concurrent jurisdiction. 1164 EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT IAB 12/12/90 This Executive Order shall become effective immediately upon its execution. Attest :IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the Great Seal of the State of Iowa to be affixed.

GOVERNOR O IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1165 SUMMARY OF DECISIONS - THE SUPREME COURT OF IOWA FILED NOVEMBER 21, 1990 NOTE: Copies of these opinions may be obtained from the Supreme Court Clerk, State Capitol Building, Des Moines, IA, 50319, for a fee of 40 cents per page. No. 89-983. RUDEN vs. PARKER. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Scott County, James A. Kelley, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by McGiverin, C.J. (8 pages $3.20) Plaintiff parents brought a claim for parental consortium due to the death of their adult child. The district court granted defendant's partial summary judgment motion, ruling that Rudens have no claim for loss of consortium of their adult daughter Darci. Rudens appeal with our permission, Iowa R. App. P. 2, from the district court's grant of the partial summary judgment motion. OPINION HOLDS: I. We will assume, without deciding, that Rudens have standing to challenge Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 8 because we conclude that rule 8 does not deny equal protection as it applies to Rudens. II. Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 8 provides that parents may sue for the loss of services, companionship and society resulting from injury to or death of \"a minor child.\" Rudens argue that the equal protection guarantees of the United States and Iowa constitutions will be violated if rule 8 is applied in a manner that denies them a right to recover for the loss of consortium .that resulted from the death of their adult child, while allowing parents to recover for the loss of consortium of a minor child. The parent-child relationship is different when a child is a minor as opposed to when a child is an adult. We affirm the district Court's ruling on the partial summary judgment motion. o 1166 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-1692. AMERICAN ASBESTOS TRAINING CENTER, LTD. vs. EASTERN IOWA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Jones County, Thomas M. Horan, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Andreasen, J. (6 pages $2.40) American Asbestos Training Center Ltd. is a private enterprise which offers asbestos training courses. Eastern Iowa Community College also offers asbestos training courses. American Asbestos sought injunctive relief to bar the community college from offering such courses. American Asbestos claimed the community college was violating Iowa Code chapter 23A, which restricts governmental competition with private enterprise. The district court found no violation of chapter 23A and therefore granted the community college a summary judgment. American Asbestos has appealed. OPINION HOLDS: I. Chapter 23A bars governmental entities from dispensing \"goods\" or \"services\" to the public in competition with private enterprise. However, the word \"services\" does not include the teaching and training functions of a community college. The community college's training course involved here is within the parameters of the community college educational mission and is not in violation of chapter 23A. II. Even if the term \"services\" is given broad interpretation, the court's judgment for the community college is correct- because chapter 23A expressly permits the offering of \"services\" that are specifically authorized by statute. Community colleges are expressly authorized to offer vocational and technical training. Here the state board of education had approved the community college asbestos training programs . We agree with the district court that specific authorization was given to the community college to provide asbestos training courses. No. 89-1176. SHAW vs. SOO LINE RAILROAD CO. On review from the Iowa Court of Appeals. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Clayton County, John Bauercamper, Judge. DECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS AND JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Snell, J. (13 pages $5.20) The plaintiffs appeal from a pretrial summary judgment finding that landowner and trucking company defendants owed no duty to guard against the risk of harm from obstructed visibility. OPINION HOLDS: Under the circumstances of this case, the private landowner and its business invitee (which parked trucks on land adjacent to a highway) owed neither a statutory nor a common law duty to highway travelers to guard against the risk of harm from obstructed visibility caused by the parked trucks. IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1167 No. 90-1059. COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND CONDUCT vs. HALL. On review of the report of the Grievance Commission. LICENSE REVOKED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by McGiverin, C.J. (16 pages $6.40) The Grievance Commission found that respondent violated numerous disciplinary rules. The violations stem from a $350,000 loan respondent received from the Citizens State Bank, Hopkinton, Iowa, allegedly through dishonesty, and numerous business ventures with a client, Walter Ronk. The commission recommended a four month suspension of Hall's license to practice law. OPINION HOLDS: I. As a preliminary matter, respondent asserts that we should not reach the merits of this case on appeal because the Grievance Commission erred when it failed to grant respondent's motion to dismiss. Hall urges defenses of res judicata, estoppel, laches and deprivation of due process. The commission found no- merit in these contentions and neither do we. II. On May 14, 1982, Citizens State Bank loaned respondent $350,000 in the form of two promissory notes in the amounts of $200,000 and $150,000. Respondent signed the notes. Respondent falsely represented to the bank that the loans would be used to purchase 60,000 laying hens and equipment for the hen operation of Lux Pullets, Inc. In fact, the notes provided on their face that they were purchase money loans and would be used to purchase hens and equipment. The equipment and laying hens were never acquired by respondent or his company and, thus, the bank received no collateral or security for the loans. The $350,000 was used by respondent for other purposes, and most of the money was never repaid to the bank by respondent or his company. The bank sustained a loss of more than $300,000 on the two notes. The Grievance Commission also concluded, and we agree, that respondent made later false statements regarding the transaction with .Citizens State Bank. The first of these statements occurred when respondent testified in a sworn deposition in a related civil lawsuit that the $350,000 in loans from Citizens State Bank were unsecured loans . The second false statement was a written response to a committee inquiry in which respondent stated that the bank knew that the money loaned on May 14 , 1982 , would not be used to purchase hens. The commission found, and we agree, that the untruthful deposition testimony that the loans were unsecured violated numerous disciplinary rules. III. Ronk had been a client of respondent's law firm for several years and at various times prior to 1978 respondent had acted as Ronk's legal counsel. Beginning in 1978, respondent and Ronk entered into several joint business ventures. During all of their joint business dealings, ? 1168 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 90-1059. COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND CONDUCT vs. HALL (continued). Ronk regarded respondent as his attorney and looked to him for advice. Respondent's ethical violations in his dealings with Ronk were severe. Respondent did not enter into a one time transaction with Ronk but, rather, a series of transactions occurring over a four year period. These business transactions were largely failures which ended up costing Ronk several hundred thousand dollars. Some of the transactions were solely for the benefit of respondent. Finally, an additional factor with regard to respondent's dealings with Ronk is that respondent attempted to exonerate himself from any professional responsibility for his actions. This alone is a serious ethical violation. IV. We conclude there are aggravating factors that suggest a more severe punishment should be imposed than the punishment recommended by the commission. First, respondent has been reprimanded by the Ethics Committee in 1987 in connection with a separate business transaction with a separate client. Second, the.number and variety of respondent's ethical violations support an enhanced sanction. Finally, although respondent has admitted that he was involved in a conflict of interest with regard to the Ronk matters, his true belief, as evidenced by his brief, is that he really did nothing wrong. Based upon our de novo review, we revoke Hall's license to practice law in Iowa . No. 89-1656. MIDWEST RECOVERY SERVICES vs. WOLFE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Jack D. Levin, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Larson, Schultz,. Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Snell, J. (9 pages $3.60) Midwest filed two separate small claims actions for. four dishonored checks written by Helen Wolfe. Wolfe filed an answer and counterclaim in each of the actions, alleging that Midwest had violated provisions of the Iowa Debt Collection Practices Act in attempting to collect on the dishonored checks. The court entered judgment against Wolfe on the checks. However, the court further found that the behavior of Midwest was in violation of the Act. Judgment was entered against Midwest pursuant to the Act and was set off against the judgment in favor of. Midwest. Midwest's request for a new trial was denied, and Midwest appealed. OPINION HOLDS: A check negotiated for cash is not subject to the Iowa Debt Collection Practices Act. ' The judgment for damages and attorney fees against Midwest is reversed . <5 IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1169 No. 89-1235. FARMERS STATE BANK vs. UNITED CENTRAL BANK. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Theodore H. Miller, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Larson, Schultz, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Schultz, J. (9 pages $3.60) Farmers State Bank used United Central Bank, now named First Interstate Bank of Des Moines, N.A., as a 'correspondent bank and also sold it loan participations. J.E.M.S., Inc., a one-bank holding corporation, owns over eighty percent of Farmers' stock. In 1982, Farmers loaned money to a farmer, evidenced by three notes, and Interstate purchased loan participations in the notes. After the notes were due in 1983 , Farmers consolidated the three notes into one. Interstate refused to continue as a loan participant in the renewal of the loan. J.E.M.S. then participated in this loan. Following a loss on the loan, Farmers and J.E.M.S. filed an action against Interstate for reimbursement of the portion of the loss attributed to Interstate's failure to renew its loan participation. The district, court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. Farmers and J.E.M.S. appeal. OPINION HOLDS: I. Farmers did not suffer damages as a result of Interstate's refusal to participate in the renewed loan.. In addition, Farmers cannot recover damages under the collateral source rule because J.E.M.S.'s payment of the nonrenewed portion of the loan is not the type of benefit contemplated under this rule. II. J.E.M.S. argues that even in the absence of a contract, promise, or representation between J.E.M.S. and Interstate, it is entitled to recover the' amounts actually expended for its forced assumption of a debt owed by Interstate. J.E.M.S. identifies its theory of recovery as \"money had and received.\" . However,- this theory of recovery was neither identified or asserted by J.E.M.S. nor ruled on by the district court. If J.E.M.S. was advancing the \"money had and received\" theory of recovery that it now seeks on appeal, a rule 179(b) motion would have been the appropriate method to remind the district court that it had not addressed all of J.E.M.S.'s theories of recovery. This was not done. Consequently, the legal theories not included in the district court's ruling were -not preserved for review on appeal. The district court's dismissal of J. E.M.S.'s claim is affirmed. 1170 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-1123. DENTAL PROSTHETIC SERVICES, INC. vs. HURST. On review from the Iowa Court of Appeals. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Linn County, Thomas M. Horan, Judge. DECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS AND JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Schultz, J. (8 pages $3.20) In this appeal, Dental Prosthetic Services, Inc. (DPS) brought suit against James P. Hurst, a former employee, to enforce a covenant not to compete contained in the written employment agreement between the parties. Following a bench trial, the district court dismissed the petition. The court found that DPS failed to prove that Hurst's business was located within a fifty-mile radius of DPS' s business. Alternatively, the court concluded ,that the restrictive covenant was unreasonable as to time and area. DPS appealed this decision, and the court of appeals affirmed by operation of law. DPS's application for further review was granted. OPINION HOLDS: I. Hurst testified that his laboratory was more than fifty miles away from ;the site of DPS's laboratory. We agree with the trial court that DPS did not present conclusive evidence that contradicted Hurst's testimony, Thus, DPS failed to establish that the two laboratories are within a fifty-mile radius of each other. II. The term \"business\" in the restrictive, covenant is ambiguous, thus requiring construction of the employment contract. III. Based on the language of the covenant considered as a whole together with the extrinsic evidence provided, the contractual provision \"directly or indirectly engage in business\" encompasses only the activities conducted at Hurst's laboratory and not the incidental deliveries and service calls made within the prohibited fifty-mile area. Therefore, Hurst did not directly or indirectly engage in business within the restricted area, thus he did not violate the restrictive covenant. Consequently, it is unnecessary to decide whether the covenant was unreasonable as to time and area. IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1171 No. 89-592. ARBIE MINERAL FEED CO. vs. FARM BUREAU MUTUAL INSURANCE . Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Rodney J. Ryan, Judge. REVERSED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Andreasen, J. (10 pages $4.00) In 1983, Arbie obtained a default judgment against James Elgin. Previously, in 1982, Elgin, and others, brought an action against Farm Bureau for their refusal to pay on an insurance claim. Arbie learned of-Elgin's action against Farm Bureau. On August 13, 1984, the sheriff, at Arbie's instruction, levied on any assets of judgment rendered in the insurance claim case. In 1986, the insurance claim case was settled. As part of the settlement, Farm Bureau agreed that a judgment be entered in the amount of $105,000 in favor of Sands and Elgin, Inc. No judgment was ever entered in favor of James Elgin individually. Arbie subsequently filed a petition against James Elgin, Elgin Inc., Sands, Sands Inc., E & S Farms, and Farm Bureau alleging fraud and misrepresentation and seeking actual, general and punitive damages. ' The court found the defendants jointly and severally liable for actual damages and punitive damages. The trial court held that even though there was not strict compliance with rule 260, Arbie nevertheless had a valid lien on any judgment allocated to Elgin. All five defendants appealed. OPINION HOLDS: There was, never a judgment, or any part thereof, awarded to James Elgin. A judgment which has never existed cannot be property. Thus, it cannot be levied upon. .We hold that a judgment may not be levied upon until it has ' been entered. Had Arbie levied upon Elgin's cause of action, that cause of action could have been sold at sheriff's sale. However, Arbie levied on a nonexistent judgment; it did not levy on Elgin's cause of action. As a result no lien was created. t 1172 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-1358. COOPER v. IOWA BOARD OF PAROLE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Jones County, August F. Honsell, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Neuman, and Snell, JJ. Per curiam. - (2 pages $.80) -In 19r86 Kevin Cooper was convicted of first-degree robbery and was sentenced to a prison term of not to exceed twenty-five years. After he arrived in prison the board of parole notified Cooper that, under the terms of former Iowa Code section 906.5 (1983), he would not be eligible .for parole until he had served twelve and one'-half years (half of his maximum indeterminate sentence) because he had previously been convicted of a forcible felony. Cooper challenged, the application of former Iowa Code section 906.5 as to him, raising the identical claim asserted by the appellant in Wharton v. Iowa Board of Parole , ___ N.W.2 d ___ (Iowa 1990 ). OPINION HOLDS: We rejected Wharton's claim. What we said in Wharton controls this case and requires us to reject the identical claim now asserted by Cooper. No. 89-1973. FEE v. EMPLOYMENT APPEAL BOARD. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Wapello County, Robert Bates, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Harris, J. (5 pages $2.00) Petitioner Judy K. Fee was discharged from her employment with Boom-Co . The employment appeal board, by a vote of two to one, denied her unemployment benefits on July 18, 1989. Boom-Co., apparently confusing the dissent with the majority opinion, filed an application for rehearing on August 9, 1989. Judy received notice of the hearing on Boom-Co.'s application for rehearing. By statute, when the application was not acted upon within twenty days, it was deemed denied by operation of law. Judy filed a petition for judicial review on September 25, 1989. The district -court ruled that the petition was not timely because it was not filed within thirty days after the July 18, 1989, decision. Judy appealed. OPINION HOLDS: Iowa Code section 17A.16(2) states that \"any party, \" riot merely an aggrieved party, may apply for rehearing. Under this statute Judy received ^notice informing her when the application would be deemed denied. Section 17A.19(3) provides that \"a party\" has thirty days to petition for judicial review after the application for rehearing is denied. We hold Judy was entitled to compute her filing requirements on the basis of Boom-Co. 's application for rehearing. Judy's filing was timely and the district court should have entertained her petition for judicial review. IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1173 No. 89-1335. WHARTON v. IOWA BOARD OF PAROLE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Jones County, August F. Honsell, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Harris, J. (4 pages $1.60) In 1984 Wharton was sentenced to two indeterminate sentences of not to exceed twenty-five years for first-degree robbery, to be served consecutively. The sentencing court did not mention any minimum sentence. However, the parole board later informed Wharton that because of a previous forcible felony conviction, he would not be eligible for parole until he had served half his maximum sentence. In so doing, the parole board relied on a restriction on parole found in former Iowa Code section 906.5. Subsequently, in 1988, the legislature moved the restriction on parole from Iowa Code section 906.5 to Iowa Code section 902.11 (1989); the move was accomplished by the simultaneous repeal of the former section and reenactment of the new one. Wharton contends the repeal of the provision in section 906.5, under which he was sentenced, effectively withdraws the impediment to his eligibility for parole. He argues that the 1988 legislation was silent, both as to any continuing effect of the old statute, or retrospective application of the one that supplanted it. OPINION HOLDS: I. The district court correctly rejected Wharton's contention. According to a fundamental canon of statutory construction the simultaneous repeal and reenactment of all or a part of a legislative act leaves unaffected all rights, interests, and liabilities arising under the earlier provision. There is no interruption in the statute's operation. II. Wharton's constitutional challenges to former section 906.5 lack merit. We have previously rejected the claim that former section 906.5 unconstitutionally transferred a judicial function to the executive branch of government. Wharton's due process and equal protection claims also fail. No. 89-619. BRITT-TECH CORP. v. AMERICAN MAGNETICS CORP. On review from the Iowa Court of Appeals. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Cerro Gordo County, Gilbert K. Bovard, Judge. DECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT AFFIRMED AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Harris, J. Special concurrence by Carter, J. (6 pages $2.40) Plaintiff manufacturer, Britt-Tech Corporation, brought this action for both contribution and indemnity after settling a wrongful death action. Summary judgment was entered in favor of the defendants, American Magnetics Corporation, which supplied component parts to the 1174 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-619. BRITT-TECH CORP. v. AMERICAN MAGNETICS CORP . (continued). manufacturer, and River City Development Company, a dealer which sold the item to the consumer. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both American Magnetics and River City upon a finding that Britt-Tech did not comply with Iowa Code section 668.6 (1985 ). We transferred the case to the court of appeals, which affirmed the partial summary judgment in favor of defendant River City but reversed the partial summary judgment in favor of defendant American Magnetics. The case is before us on further review. OPINION HOLDS: I. Although Britt-Tech contends otherwise it is clear that Iowa Code chapter 668 (1989) is applicable to its contribution claims. II. The trial court held that the release executed between Britt-Tech and the Hardy estate did not satisfy the specificity requirements found in section 668.7. We agree, and affirm the trial court in sustaining the motions for summary judgment against Britt-Tech's claims for contribution. The case must be remanded for further proceedings on Britt-Tech's claims for indemnification. CONCURRENCE ASSERTS: I believe that in applying Iowa Code- section 668.7 (1989) the identity of released parties may be shown by parol evidence. I also believe that liability may be \"extinguished\" for purposes of section 668.5(2) without any release if all conceivable damages have been paid in full. In the present case, however, any discharge of the party from whom contribution is sought was untimely under section 668.6(3). No. 89-1453. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP. v. HARTWIG. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Keokuk County, Phillip R. Collett, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Neuman, J. (7 pages $2.80) The' Hartwigs gave the bank two mortgages and a deed of trust on farmland owned by them. The mortgages and deed of trust each provide that, in the event of default, a receiver shall be appointed to take possession of the property and collect the \"rents and profits accruing therefrom.\" Following default by the Hartwigs in 1987, the bank obtained a partial, summary judgment on the notes and foreclosure of the mortgages and deed of trust. The property was eventually purchased at sheriff's, sale by the FDIC. Before foreclosure, and later while the property was in receivership, the Hartwigs enrolled a portion of the mortgaged farmland in the Conservation Reserve Program. In this program, the government contractually agrees to pay the farmer annual \"rental payment [s] ... to compensate IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1175 No. 89-1453. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP . v. HARTWIG (continued) . such participant for placing eligible cropland in the CRP.\" In July 1989, the receiver sought direction from the district court concerning distribution of two CRP payments due in October 1989 . The district court ruled that the FDIC was entitled to the proceeds less sums expended by the Hartwigs to prepare the land for participation in the program based on the mortgage. It is from this ruling that , the Hartwigs have appealed. OPINION HOLDS: We find that' CRP payments constitute \"rent\" within the meaning of the \"rents and profits\" clause of a mortgage. Therefore, the district court correctly ruled that the FDIC was entitled to the CRP payments . No. 90-1132. COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS v. HILL. On review of the report of the Grievance Commission. LAWYER REPRIMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Neuman, J. (5 pages $2.00) The complaint stems from allegations that attorney Ralph William Hill (1) counseled an individual who was represented by another attorney, (2) taped telephone conversations without the knowledge of the other party to the conversation, and (3) allowed an appeal to be dismissed by .default while misleading his client with regard to its status. OPINION HOLDS: We concern ourselves with only the third charge because the Grievance Commission found insufficient evidence to sustain the others and the Committee on Professional Ethics has not appealed the decision. Under the circumstances of this case we are persuaded that a public reprimand is appropriate. In February 1989, this court disciplined Hill with a three-month suspension for sexual impropriety with a client. When he applied to this court for reinstatement, the matter was held in abeyance because the committee had not concluded its investigation of the presen't case. Seven months later the committee had still failed to conclude its work and, following inquiry, we were convinced that Hill presented no danger to the public. We reinstated him notwithstanding the pending matter. In essence, Hill has already suffered a seven-month penalty for his inaction on the Propp appeal and the two other matters which were ultimately resolved in' his favor. We deem this a sufficient sanction to protect the public and deter Hill from neglect in the future. 1176 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-1086. HAWKEYE BANK AND TRUST v. BAUGH. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Appanoose County, James D. Jenkins, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Neuman, J. (11 pages $4.40) In April 1988, Hawkeye Bank and Trust brought an action to set aside alleged fraudulent conveyances of farmland between Terry B. Baugh and Baugh Family Farms, Inc. Russell Baugh, the son of Terry Baugh and president of Baugh Family Farms, Inc., filed an answer on behalf of the corporation. Russell Baugh, however, is not an attorney. On the morning of trial, the bank complained about Russell's representation of the corporation. The district court agreed and refused to permit Russell to represent the corporation. The court then rejected Russell's motion for a brief continuance to secure counsel. The court then proceeded to hear the plaintiff's evidence--without response by the corporation \u2014and entered judgment for the full relief requested. This appeal followed. OPINION HOLDS: I. We adopt the general rule that a corporation - may not represent itself through non-lawyer employees, officers, or shareholders. No basis for departure from the general rule can be seen in the case before us. II. We are persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Baugh, a brief continuance to secure counsel for the corporation. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No. 89-1823. STATE v. ALEXANDER. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Boone County, M.D. Seiser, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Carter, Lavorato, Neuman, and Snell, JJ. Opinion by Neuman, J. (5 pages $2.00) Alexander was charged with willful injury. Although^ potential defenses of justification or self-defense were implicated, Alexander eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of going armed with a dangerous weapon and was convicted. Alexander subsequently learned of a witness whose testimony would allegedly support a theory of justification or self-defense. He moved for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The district court denied the motion without a hearing, ruling that a motion for new trial cannot be urged following a plea of guilty. Alexander appeals from this ruling. OPINION HOLDS: The question is whether \"new trial\" may be sought only by defendants . who have already been to trial, or whether the remedy is also available to defendants who plead guilty and later seek to set aside their plea and IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1177 No. 89-1823. STATE v. ALEXANDER (continued). proceed to trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The rules qoverninq the question are, regrettably, less than clear. However, we are confident that the legislature did not intend to give admittedly guilty persons the unfettered right to recant their admission and proceed to trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence or any other ground not intrinsic to the plea. Notions of newly discovered evidence simply have no bearing on a knowing and voluntary admission of guilt. We affirm the district court's refusal to hear Alexander's motion for a new trial . No. 89-1465. PRINCIPAL CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY V. NORWOOD . Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Jasper County, Richard Morr, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Carter, Lavorato, Neuman, arid Snell, JJ. Opinion by Neuman, J. (8 pages $3.20) The insured persons challenge a district court decision favoring the insurer in a declaratory judgment action concerning subrogation proceeds and the deductability of attorney fees under Iowa Code section 668.5(3) and (4) (1989). OPINION HOLDS: Iowa Code chapter 668 (1989) authorizes an insured to retain a reasonable attorney fee out of subrogation proceeds claimed by an insurer when the recovery stems from settlement with, rather than verdict or judgment against, a third-party tortfeasor. The subrogee's responsibility under section 668.5(3) to pay a pro rata share of legal and administrative expenses incurred in obtaining a judgment or verdict against a third-party tortfeasor applies equally to settlement recoveries \"to the extent that the settlement was reasonable.\" See Iowa Code \u00a7 668.5(4). No dispute over the reasonableness of the settlement exists in the case before us. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of judgment for the defendants in accordance with this opinion. 1178 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-750. INTERSTATE POWER COMPANY V. IOWA STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Anthony M. Critelli and Arthur A. Gamble, Judges. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J.,. and Lavorato, Neuman, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Lavorato, J. (12 pages $4.80) Interstate Power Company filed a request with the Iowa State Commerce Commission (now the Iowa Utilities Board) to increase its electric rates. One issue Interstate did not specifically litigate was the proper method for calculating deferred federal income taxes which result from Inter\u00ad state's use of the accelerated depreciation method before the board. While Interstate's petition for judicial review was pending, the IRS issued revenue rulings to' two other utilities which changed the deferral rate for federal taxes. Interstate then filed an application for leave to present additional evidence to the board. The application was granted. On remand the board received evidence about the new IRS rulings. The district court ultimately ruled on the merits of the petition for judicial review. The OCA and the board appealed. OPINION HOLDS: I. Interstate urges a number of reasons why we should not reach the remand issue. We' find no merit in any of these reasons. II. Section 17A.19(7) expressly authorizes a remand when the court believes there is additional material evidence and good reasons why it was not presented to the agency. Here, the revenue rulings and the board'_s acquiescence were not available to the board in the original contested case proceeding and the evidence was clearly material.. III. We think section 17A.19(7) gives the district court discretion to allow the board to hear all material evidence, including later evidence, bearing on the.proper rate. IV. For all of these reasons, we think the district court properly exercised its discretion in remanding for. additional evidence . NO. 89-273. KENNY V. WHITTLE. On review from the Iowa Court of Appeals . Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Linn County, Van D. Zimmer, Judge. DECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Per Curiam. (6 pages $2.40) In this father and motion forpersonal injury action the plaintiffs--step- stepson--appeal from an order denying their new trial. They assert the district court IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1179 NO. 89-273. KENNY V. WHITTLE (continued). should have awarded them a new trial because (1) the verdict was contrary to the evidence and (2) the court abused its discretion when it permitted an expert to testify. The court of appeals in a two to one decision reversed on both grounds. We granted further review. OPINION HOLDS: I. Here the defendants admitted liability for their rear-end collision which resulted in the plain\u00ad tiffs' injuries. The proximate cause of those injuries was the sole issue in the- case. It appears clear to us from all of the uncontroverted evidence that the verdict bears no reasonable relationship to the loss suffered by the stepfather. So the verdict is contrary to the evidence. The district court in these circumstances should have granted the stepfather a new trial . The court abused its discretion when it refused to do so. The same reasoning applies as to the verdict for the stepson. The district court should have granted the stepson a new trial. Its failure to do so was likewise an abuse of discretion. II. Because the defendant conceded liability in the district court, we think that concession became the law of the case. In these circumstances we think, contrary to the court of appeals' conclusion, the issue of liability should not be submitted on remand. III. Over the plaintiffs' objections, the district court allowed the defendant to call the physician who took x-rays of the stepson after the second collision. This testimony came in as rebuttal. We think the district court properly exercised its discretion in allowing rebuttal testimony. NO. 89-1162. HARPER V. STATE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Lee County, D.B. Hendrickson, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Lavorato, J. (8 pages $3.20) A prison disciplinary committee found that inmate Harper had committed a Class I offense, disobeying a lawful order, by engaging in jiggering [moving objects between cells], a Class II offense. A Class I offense is considered more serious and carries stricter penalties than a Class II offense. Harper sought postconviction relief to challenge the disciplinary action.. The district court denied postconviction relief, and Harper has appealed. OPINION HOLDS: We find insufficient evidence that Harper's act of \"jiggering\" constituted the Class I offense of disobeying a lawful order. There is no evidence that any staff person or other person in_authority told Harper that jiggering was prohibited by the prison rules. Nor is there any evidence that once this was communicated to Harper, he 1180 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-1162. HARPER V. STATE (continued). engaged in any disobedience by continuing to \"jigger.\" In reaching our conclusion we do not ignore the prison authorities' broad discretion in prison disciplinary matters. But the district court's interpretation would give prison authorities unfettered discretion to charge a more serious offense when only a minor offense has been committed. Fairness and justice dictate against such a result. NO. 89-1482. COLE v. FIRST STATE BANK. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Butler County, Stephen P. Carroll, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Carter, Lavorato, Neuman, and Snell, JJ. Opinion by Lavorato, J. (17 pages $6.80) The Coles borrowed money from First State Bank of Greene. The loans were secured by a mortgage on the Coles' farm. When the Coles did not repay the loans, as they agreed to do, the bank filed a foreclosure action against them. In January 1987 the sheriff offered the property for sale to the highest bidder. The bank bid $80,000 for the property. It received a certificate of sheriff's sale on the same day. The bank immediately assigned the sheriff's certificate to the Steeres. The bank did not offer the Coles the opportunity to repurchase the property on the same terms and conditions. In July 1987 the Coles filed an application in the foreclosure action to determine the fair market value of the homestead. The court took no action on this application. The Coles did not redeem the property during the one-year redemption period. The sheriff then delivered a sheriff's deed covering the property to the Steeres. In January 1988 the Coles filed suit in equity against the bank and the Steeres. The district court ruled in favor of the defendants. The Coles appealed. OPINION HOLDS: We conclude that the Coles waived any 1 claim that they had a right to a fair market valuation of their home\u00ad stead and a separate right to redeem it pursuant to Iowa Code section 654.16. The district court correctly sus\u00ad tained the rule 105 motion, and motion for judgment on the pleadings on this issue.. We also conclude that the right of first refusal in section 524.910(2) does not apply to a transaction in which a state bank assigns its sheriff's certificate of , sale before the period of redemption expires. The court correctly sustained the bank's motion for judgment on- the pleadings as to this issue and properly dismissed it. Finally, we find that the Coles failed to establish by clear, satisfactory,' and convincing evidence the alleged oral agreement by the bank to sell back six acres of farmland to the Coles for $10,000. The district court properly dismissed this claim. IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1181 NO. 89-995. FIRST NATIONAL BANK IN SIOUX CITY. V. WATTS. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Woodbury County, Dewie J. Gaul, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Carter, Lavorato, Neuman, and Snell, JJ. Opinion by Lavorato, J. (15 pages $6.00) Jerome Watts purchased a car and insured it- with Farm and City Insurance Company. He financed the car through . the car dealer, who assigned the contract and debt to First National Bank of Sioux City. Watts later allowed the Farm and City policy to lapse for nonpayment of renewal premiums. After the policy had lapsed, the car was destroyed in a collision. First National Bank, as lien\u00ad holder, later demanded payment from Farm and City of the amount owed it by Watts. The-bank relied on the policy's \"loss payable clause,\" providing that the interest of the lienholder shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the car's owner. The district court held that Farm and City had to pay the bank's demand, and Farm and City has appealed. OPINION HOLDS: I. The district court erred by concluding that Watts' failure to pay the renewal premium was an \"act or neglect of the owner\" within the meaning of the loss payable clause. The language : \"act or neglect of the owner\" in a loss payable clause refers to breach of policy conditions by the owner. The loss payable clause operates as an independent contract between the insurer and the loss payee lienholder, so the owner cannot defeat the loss payee lienholder's interest by breaching a condition of the policy. But there is no condition or provision in the policy that required Watts to renew it. So Watts breached no condition or provision of the policy when he failed to pay the renewal premium. The loss payable clause did not protect the bank against Watts' failure to renew the policy. II. The policy ended by expiration rather than cancellation. Farm and City would have been required, to give notice of cancellation but was not required to give notice of expiration. The policy clearly stated an expira\u00ad tion date. The bank had a copy of the declaration page and so was fully aware of it. The policy gave the lienholder no greater rights than it gave the insured with respect to notice of expiration. So Farm and City was not required to notify the bank that the policy would expire by lapse of the policy period. III. We reverse and remand with directions; the district court shall enter judgment in favor of Farm and City and shall dismiss the bank's petition with costs taxed to the bank. 1182 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-1559. IN RE ESTATE OF THIES. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Hardin County, Carl D. Baker, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Lavorato, J. (19 pages $7.60) In 1977 Franklin W. Thies owed Citizens State Bank money on .several promissory notes. Franklin arranged for a loan from the Farmers Home Administration to repay the notes and several other obligations. At the time, the bank requested that Franklin's mother, Taldine Thies, guarantee the notes until the FmHA loan came through. With the understanding that the guaranty would be destroyed or returned to her when the FmHA proceeds were received, Taldine signed the guaranty. ' The guaranty, by its terms, allowed Franklin to \"obtain credit, from time to time\" and specified \"(no limit)\" as to dollar amounts. The FmHA proceeds were eventually received. Franklin repaid the loans from those proceeds. Apparently, the guaranty was never removed from the bank files. Later, in 1984, 1985, and 1986, Franklin borrowed more money from the bank. Taldine died in April 1986, and the bank filed a claim in probate based on Taldine's guaranty. On July 31, 1986, the Iowa superintendent of banking determined that the bank was insolvent. The FDIC then accepted the appointment as receiver of the bank. An official of the FDIC executed an affidavit in which he stated that the FDIC purchased certain assets of the bank which included Franklin's promissory notes and Taldine's guaranty. In January 1988 the district court substituted the FDIC for the bank in the estate proceeding. The FDIC filed a motion for summary judgment based on 12 U.S.C. section 1823(e). The executor appealed. .OPINION HOLDS: We find that 12 U.S.C. section 1823(e) precludes the defense that the guaranty had been satisfied and was not an asset the FDIC purchased . from the bank, since the alleged understanding between Taldine and the bank failed to meet any one of the four requirements in section 182.3(e). IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1183 No. 89-1300. HOPE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH vs. IOWA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE AND FINANCE. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Linn County, Thomas M. Horan, Judge. AFFIRMED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Lavorato, Neuman, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Snell, J. (25 pages $10.00) In this administrative action, Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church challenged a use tax assessment on consumer items Hope purchased from church-affiliated suppliers for use either in worship services or for educational purposes. The agency upheld the use tax assessment, and on judicial review the district court upheld the agency's action. Hope has appealed. OPINION HOLDS: I. The use tax assessment does not burden the free exercise of religion in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The use tax is not a prior restraint on the exercise of religion or a precondition to the exercise of religion. The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that, to the extent the.imposition of a generally applicable tax merely decreases the amount of money a taxpayer has to \u00a7pend on its religious activities, any such burden is not constitutionally- significant. II. Hope did not argue below its claim that the' use tax assessment violated the establishment clause by fostering an excessive government entanglement with religion. We will not consider those arguments now. We note, however., that a similar use tax reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court was found to involve no excessive entanglement between government and religion. III. The use, tax assessment on Bibles, books, and other written materials does not have an unconstitutional chilling effect on the church's right to freedom of the press. The tax is a general tax not restricted to certain publications protected by the first amendment, and it is not tailored in such a way that it singles out and targets small groups of publications. IV. Hope is not entitled to any of the statutory use tax exemptions it claims. Hope claims it is entitled to an exemption under Iowa Code section 422.45(3) (1977) because the sellers of the merchandise . had used the entire sale proceeds for educational, religions or charitable purposes. However, Hope did not meet its burden to show that this exemption applies to the facts of this case. Hope also claims another exemption under section 422; 45(8) (1977) because the merchandise was used for educational purposes by a private Iowa nonprofit educational institution. However, Hope failed to establish that it is a private nonprofit educational institution. 1184 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-979. FERNANDEZ v. CURLEY. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Scott County, Edward B. deSilva, Jr., Judge. AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Carter, J. (10 pages $4.00) Fernandez, who recovered actual and punitive damages from defendant Curley as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile collision, appeals from an order denying his motion for new trial on the issue of punitive damages. He also challenges the order disbursing a portion of the punitive damages to the civil reparations fund pursuant to Iowa Code section 668A.l(2)(b) (1989). In disbursing the punitive damage award, the trial court directed that taxable court costs and plaintiff's reasonable attorney fees first be paid from the award and that plaintiff be paid twenty-five percent of the amount remaining after those costs and fees had been satisfied. The remaining amount of the punitive damage award was disbursed to the civil reparations fund. OPINION HOLDS: I. The first issue on appeal concerns whether the district court erred in refusing to permit evidence of defendant's 1984 OWI conviction as that conduct bore on plaintiff's right to recover punitive damages. The trial court was in a good position to gauge whether, in light of the substantial evidence of willful and wanton conduct in the act which injured plaintiff, evidence of a prior incident of compara\u00ad ble conduct should be permitted. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's evidentiary ruling. II. The other issue which we must consider is the method employed by the .trial court in disbursing the punitive damage award under Iowa Code section 668A.1(2)(b). We are persuaded that the fractional percentage to be paid plaintiff is tied to the amount of punitive or exemplary damages actually awarded rather than the amount remaining after payment of fees and costs. We agree with the district court that section 668A.l(2)(b) contemplates payment of the applicable costs and fees from the gross punitive damage award prior to distributing any portion thereof to the claimant or the civil reparations fund. The district court determined that the word \"fees\"., included plaintiff's reasonable attorney fees applicable to the recovery of the punitive damage award. The court deter\u00ad mined that this could be measured by a reasonable contin\u00ad gent fee agreement. We conclude that this interpretation comports with the.intent of the legislation. We disagree, however, with the district court's determination that the term \"costs\" as used in this litigation means taxable court costs. We believe that the applicable \"costs\" contemplated by this statute are the reasonable costs of litigation IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1185 NO. 89-979. FERNANDEZ v. CURLEY (continued). specifically attributable to the punitive damage claim which are not otherwise assessed against the defendant in the cost judgment entered pursuant to section 625.1. This includes, but is not limited to, the nontaxable portion of deposition costs, and those expert witness fees reasonably incurred but which exceed the limit provided in Iowa Code section 622.72. We affirm the judgment of the district court awarding actual and punitive damages. We reverse the district court's order disbursing punitive damages and remand the case to that court for a new section 668A.l(2)(b) allocation consistent with our interpretation of that statute. NO. 890-1303. STATE y. WATKINS. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Harry Perkins, Judge. AFFIRMED ON CONDITION AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Larson, J. (11 pages $4.40) The defendant appeals from his convictions and sen\u00ad tences for first-degree kidnapping and second-degree theft. OPINION HOLDS: I. Failure to raise a statutory objection to the jury panel does not amount to a waiver of a constitutional challenge. Watkins' failure to object to the composition of the jury panel . prior to the time it was sworn did not waive his constitutional arguments under the sixth amendment. II. A defendant challenging the composi\u00ad tion of a jury panel must first establish a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment's fair cross-section requirement. But the court here did not rule, one way or the other, on whether Watkins had presented a prima fa.cie case. It simply- denied Watkins 'request for a hearing. We hold that it was error for ' the court to deny Watkins an opportunity to make a prima facie showing of a denial of the sixth amendment's requirement that a jury panel represent a cross section of the community. III. We believe the appropriate remedy in this case is to affirm on condition and remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the sixth amendment issue. If Watkins establishes a prima facie case, the State must show a justifiable reason for the disproportionate representa \u00ad tion on the jury panel. If the trial court determines, upon presentation of the State's evidence, that the reasons are insufficient, or that they are merely pretextual,, a new trial should be granted. If the triaT court finds that the defendant has failed to establish a prima facie case, or that the State has justified a disproportionate representa \u00ad tion on the jury, the judgment should be affirmed. Watkins' right to appeal from the district court's rulings is preserved. 1186 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-346. HAMMER v. BRANSTAD . Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Ray A. Fenton, Judge. AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Harris, Schultz, Carter, v and Lavorato, JJ. Opinion by Carter, J. (19 pages $7.60) Plaintiffs Barbara Hammer and Janice Drury are nurses employed by the State of Iowa. The plaintiff Iowa Nurses' Association is a voluntary membership association formed as an Iowa nonprofit corporation for the support and benefit of' nurses generally. These plaintiffs challenge the validity of the Governor's June 4, 1985, executive order adjusting the salary upgrades made by the Department of Personnel in attempting to carry out the comparable worth mandates of 1984 Iowa Acts chapter 1314. The Governor and affected State agencies have appealed with permission from orders certifying the members of the plaintiff class and granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the liability issues. OPINION HOLDS: I. Where an interlocu \u00ad tory appeal is granted on a timely application to appeal from a potentially outcome-determinative interlocutory order, this court may, in its discretion, also permit an appeal from earlier orders which inhere therein. II. We agree with the defendants that the Iowa Nurses' Association does not have standing to litigate the monetary claim being made on behalf of the class. The claims of class members involve only recoupment of past monetary loss. That loss was not suffered by the Iowa Nurses' Association as such, and that entity therefore lacks standing to represent the class in seeking such recovery. III. If it is ultimately determined in the present litigation that plaintiffs Hammer and Drury have not sustained the type of injury for which they are seeking relief on behalf of the class, they may no longer continue as class representatives. If that does occur, a reasonable opportunity should be-given other class members to intervene as class representatives. IV. Defendants contend that, because \"merit step positions\" did not exist for employees in plaintiffs' category at the time Senate File 2359 was enacted, the language of section 3(2) requiring that merit steps be retained is inapplicable to these employees. We believe that the phrase \"merit step positions\" as utilized in section 3(2) of Senate File 2359 merely denotes the relative pay level of an employee within a pay grade. We believe it was the intent of the legisla\u00ad ture in enacting section 3 of Senate File 2359 that wherever \"noncontractual\" employees, such as these plain\u00ad tiffs were located in the pay matrix immediately prior to comparable worth adjustments this relative in-grade pay level was to be maintained in the newly assigned pay grade. V. Based on our interpretation of the issues presented, we' hold the district court did not err in IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1187 NO. 89-346. HAMMER v. BRANSTAD (continued). sustaining plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. We affirm that ruling. We modify the district court's order of November 17, 1988, by directing that the Iowa. Nurses' Association be dismissed from the case as a party plain\u00ad tiff. Otherwise, that order is also affirmed. NO. 349/89-1302. STATE v. WATKINS. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, George W. Bergeson, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Larson, J. (7 pages $2.80) After the jury had deliberated for over two hours in the robbery trial of Charles D. Watkins, the court amended the instructions by inserting an alternative means of committing the offense. Watkins was found guilty and appealed, claiming error in the trial court's giving of the supplemental instruction. OPINION HOLDS: Under the circumstances of this case, the court lacked authority to give these supplemental instructions where there was no request by the jury, the jury had teen deliberating for over two hours, and the amendments in- effect changed, rather than modified, the instructions. The district court has discretion to give supplemental instructions on its own motion in criminal cases as well as in civil cases. This is necessarily subject, however, to the caveat that it must not prejudice the defendant. Here, the supplemental instructions on the alternative means of committing these offenses prejudiced Watkins because they injected a critical matter into the case without an opportunity for Watkins to meet it. - 1188 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 NO. 89-744. KINER v. RELIANCE INSURANCE COMPANY. Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Story County, Newt Draheim, Judge. AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED ON APPEAL; AFFIRMED ON CROSS-APPEAL . Considered by Harris, P.j., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Opinion by Larson, J. (14 pages $5.60) Kiner sued Reliance Insurance Company, the workers' compensation carrier of his former employer, for bad-faith failure to pay workers' compensation benefits. He also asserted a claim for slander, alleging that Reliance had wrongfully stated he was addicted to drugs as one of its reasons for failing to pay benefits. A jury awarded Kiner $75,000 in actual damages and $550,000 in punitive damages on the bad-faith claim. On the slander claim, the jury awarded Kiner $75,000 actual and $150,000 punitive damages. However, on the bad-faith claim, the district court ordered a new trial on all issues, finding the $550,000 punitive damage award to be excessive. On the slander claim, the district court left in place the $150,000 punitive damage award but found the $75,000 actual damage award to be excessive; the court ordered a new trial on the slander claim unless Kiner would agree to a $25,000 remittitur of the actual damage award. * Both Kiner and Reliance have appealed from the district court's judgment. OPINION HOLDS: Bad-faith claim . I. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction of the bad-faith claim. The industrial commissioner's exclusive jurisdiction under chapter 85 is limited to matters surrounding a job-related injury and does not extend to subsequent dealings during which a tort may arise by reason of bad faith on the part of an employer's, insurer. II. The bad-faith claim was properly submitted to the jury. A reasonable fact finder could find that Reliance had failed to exercise an honest and informed judgment on Kiner's claim, and thus could conclude that its denial was not fairly debatable. III. The instructions correctly stated the elements of a bad-faith claim. We do not believe that \"reckless disre\u00ad gard\" of the lack of reasonable basis for denying a claim is a necessary element in a bad-faith claim. IV. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Reliance a new trial on the bad-faith claim, due to the size' of the punitive damage verdict. The court acted within its discretion in concluding that the $550,000 punitive damage award was flagrantly excessive and lacking in evidentiary support. Slander claim . V. Kiner's slander claim was not barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations. The jury could have found that a slanderous publication occurred within two years before the filing date of Kiner's petition. VI. Reliance defended against the slander claim by asserting a qualified privi\u00ad lege, arguing that the statements were made only to persons having an interest in the subject matter and to whom IAB 12/12/90 SUPREME COURT 1189 NO. 89-744. KINER v. RELIANCE INSURANCE COMPANY (continued). Reliance had a right or duty ' to communicate the state\u00ad ments. However, Reliance was not entitled to a dismissal of the slander claim due to this qualified privilege. The jury rejected the qualified privilege defense, and a contrary finding'is not compelled under the record. VII. Reliance failed to raise below its issue that the slander claim should not have been submitted because there was no publication to third parties. We therefore decline to consider this issue. VIII. The district court abused its discretion by ordering a new trial unless Kiner consented to a $25,000 remittitur in the actual damage award on the slander claim. IX. The damage instruction did not allow duplicate damages. Reliance's other complaint about the damage instruction was waived. NO. 348/90-887. COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND CONDUCT v. OLTROGGE. Appeal from the recommendations of the Grievance Commission LICENSE SUSPENDED. Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Schultz, Carter, and Neuman, JJ. Per curiam. (5 pages $2.00) The commission recommended that respondent's license to practice law in this state be suspended for not less than one year. The commission's recommendation was based on its finding that respondent had,failed to timely file state and federal income tax returns for several years and had made a series of false answers to Client Security and Attorney Disciplinary Commission questionnaires. OPINION HOLDS: We order that respondent M. Wayne Oltrogge's license to practice law in this state be suspended indefinitely with no possibility of reinstatement for one year. It is further ordered that the costs of this action be assessed against respondent. 1190 SUPREME COURT IAB 12/12/90 No. 89-1486. SCHULTZE vs. LANDMARK HOTEL CORPORATION . Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Theodore H. Miller, Judge. REVERSED AND REMANDED. Considered by McGiverin, C.J., and Schultz, Lavorato, Snell, and Andreasen, JJ. Opinion by Schultz, J. (12 pages $4.80) In this appeal- the issue is whether the statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions for wrongful death under Iowa Code section 614.1(9)( 1987 ) begins to run on discovery of the death or on discovery of the wrongful act that caused the death. The district court held that the limitation period commenced on the date the medical treatment factors relating to the wrongfulness of the death are known, or should have been known through the use of reasonable diligence. Defendants appealed. OPINION HOLDS: I. The language of section 614.1(9) communicates that malpractice actions for wrongful death must be brought within two years after the claimant knew of the death. To further extend the limitation period would be contrary to the plain language of the subsection and the legislature's intent -to restrict the length of time for commencing malpractice actions. . Additionally, it would create a discovery rule that supersedes a statutorily imposed discovery rule which is contrary to legislative intent. II. Plaintiff argues that the discovery rule should apply to section 614.1(9) because of the \"extreme hardship\"\" and \"strained and impractical result\" it works on survivors. Plaintiff's argument has no merit because no unjust unfairness exists in this case. All the information from which the cause of death could be ascertained was available to plaintiff at the time of his wife's death. III. In this case, the statute of limitations began to run on June 13, 1987, the date of plaintiff's wife's death. Since plaintiff did not file this wrongful death action against defendants until June 30, 1989, the two-year period expired on June 13, 1989. Thus, plaintiff's malpractice action against defendants is barred. IOWA ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Iowa State Printing: Division Grimes.
