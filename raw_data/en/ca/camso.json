Initially it wasbelieved that such children could safely receive the vaccine; Kamin et al in 1965 4reported the safe administration of measles vaccine to 22 children with egg allergy conrmedby food challenges. The concern was again raised in 1983 by Herman et al when they reported two children with allergy to egg white protein who had generalised urticaria, angio-oedema, andrespiratory with ovalbumin related anti- gens in the vaccine was demonstrated in both children. They also showed the presence of ovalbumin reacting pro-tein in the vaccine. They subsequently evaluated 24 children with egg allergy using skin prick testing with ovalbumin and measles vaccine. They found that children with severe reactions toegg were more likely to have a positive skin reaction ontesting with the vaccine, and those who had a positive skintest had IgE antibodies reacting to ovalbumin. Non-allergicchildren had negative skin tests. From this they recom-mended that patients with severe reactions to egg whiteshould be skin tested with dilute vaccine, rst by scratchtest and, if this is negative, by intradermal injection. If bothwere negative, the vaccine could be given as a single dose of 0.5 ml. If either were positive, they recommended that the vaccine be administered in slowly increasing increments of0.05 ml, every 15 to 20 minutes. The 1991 Red Book pub- lished by the American Academy of Pediatrics recom-mended a similar policy for children with severe reactionsto egg. However further evidence suggesting that children aller- gic to eggs were at no greater risk continued toaccumulate. 4A-DBy 1995, of 40 reported cases of anaphy- laxis to measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine given as a single dose, only two involved children with egg allergy (thesame two reported by Herman). 1 3 5-10A review of 17 stud- ies from 1963 to 1995 showed only (the same) two of 1227patients who were allergic to eggs and had been given thevaccine had developed any symptoms suggestive ofanaphylaxis 11; this included many children with convincing history of severe allergic reactions to egg. Children with orwithout egg allergy could have positive skin tests using thevaccine and still be safely immunised. 1 12-15Aicken et alcar- ried out skin prick testing on 410 children allergic to eggswith the vaccine and subsequently vaccinated them with astandard single dose. 12Five children had a positive skin prick test, none of whom developed a reaction followingvaccination. Four children had a minor reaction to the vac-cine, all of whom had negative skin tests. On the otherhand, Baxter found that a positive skin prick test with the vaccine might increase the chance of a systemic reaction. 16 They performed a skin prick test followed by an intrader- mal test in 150 children allergic to eggs. Of these, 145 hadnegative skin prick and intradermal tests, and were giventhe vaccine without any signicant immediate reactions. Ofthe ve with positive skin tests, four had negative intrader- mal tests and were vaccinated safely. The fth child devel-oped a 15 mm local reaction and a systemic reactionincluding urticaria, irritability, and hypotension within 10minutes of the intradermal test. Approximately half thepatients who had an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine(almost all of whom had no history of allergy to egg) whentested subsequently had positive skin tests. 1571 01 7This suggests that while it is not useful to skin prick test children with egg allergy and it would be impractical to skin pricktest all children, a positive skin test may to some extentpredict allergy to some component of the vaccine and may increase the risk of an allergic reaction. Based on such evidence, the 1997 Red Book did not rec- ommend skin testing in children allergic to eggs. 18The Department of Health's Green Book ,19while being generally reassuring, ends by saying that if there are any concerns, paediatric advice should be sought with a view to providingimmunisation under controlled conditions in hospital. Theproduct leaflet for MMR vaccine continues to prohibit vaccination of children who have history of anaphylactic,anaphylactoid or immediate reactions to eating eggs. Chil-dren with egg allergy are regularly referred for specialistadvice and day case admission into hospital for MMRimmunisation in our centre and, we believe, in mostothers\u2014a signicant use of time and resources. Kelso et alin 1993 rst suggested that some anaphylac- tic reactions to MMR may be the result of an allergic reac-tion to gelatin. 10Hydrolysed gelatin, obtained from animal collagen, is used as a stabiliser in various vaccines including MMR, varicella, and diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertus-sis (DTaP). Much of the recent work on gelatin allergy hascome from Japan where there has been a recent increase in allergic reactions to MMR vaccine. 20From 1994 to 1997 there were 366 reported cases of allergy to MMR vaccine in Japan, and 34 of these were anaphylactic reactions; fromKey messages +Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but potentially fatal complication after any vaccination +It is di Ycult to predict which children are likely to have a severe allergic reaction +Many of the allergic reactions that occur afteradministration of gelatin containing vaccines in Japanappear to be due to IgE mediated or cell mediatedimmune responses to gelatin +MMR vaccine is not advised in children with knownsevere systemic allergic reactions to gelatin orneomycin +Children allergic to eggs (including those who havehad anaphylactic reactions to egg) do not appear tobe at greater risk for anaphylaxis to MMR vaccinethan other children +All vaccination must be carried out in settings withequipment to deal with anaphylaxis and by personneltrained in its recognition and management. Assum-ing these criteria are met, vaccinations do not have totake place in the presence of a doctor or on medicalpremisesArch Dis Child 2000; 82:93-97 931989 to 1993 there were no reports of anaphylactic reactions to the vaccine. Before 1993, the immunisationschedule in Japan consisted of a trivalent MMR vaccinefollowed by a series of DTaP vaccines. From 1994onwards, this was changed to a series of DTaP followed by MMR vaccines given separately not all containsgelatin. Among the subjects with adverse reactions, almostall (98%) had received the gelatin containing DTaP beforethe MMR. Nakayama et alused this data to postulate that prior injection with gelatin containing DTaP had sensitisedthe children to subsequent reactions to MMR vaccine. 20 There is good immunological evidence suggesting that both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reac- tions to vaccines containing gelatin result from gelatinallergy. 21-23Sakaguchi et alfound that 24 of 26 patients with immediate reactions to MMR vaccine had IgE antibody togelatin. 24In contrast, this antibody was not found in any of 26 age and sex matched controls who had not reacted tothe vaccine. Kumagai et alshowed that while patients with non-immediate reactions did not show IgE antibody togelatin, many of them did show a cell mediated immune response to gelatin. 25Administering gelatin to a sensitised individual by injection would pose the greatest risk for anaphylaxis.21Because gelatin used as a vaccine stabiliser may be of porcine origin whereas gelatin ingested in foodmay be of bovine origin, the absence of history of allergy tofoods containing gelatin does not eliminate the possibilityof a gelatin mediated reaction to vaccine. 26Skin testing with the MMR vaccine of people with a history of systemicanaphylactic reactions following gelatin ingestion may beuseful to identify those at risk for similar reactions to thevaccine; however, protocols for such testing or desensitisa- tion have not been published. 26 27 The only gelatin containing vaccine in use in UK is the MMR vaccine*. Drug analysis prints (DAPs) produced by the Committee on Safety of Medicines/Medicines ControlAgency (CSM/MCA) list all spontaneously reported reac-tions on the adverse drug reactions online information tracking database (ADROIT). The DAP for MMR vaccinestates that eight cases of angio-oedema and 55 cases ofanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions have been receivedby the CSM/MCA in the period July 1963 to July 1999. Nofatalities have been reported associated with allergicreactions. While this cannot be used to estimate theincidence of allergic reactions to the vaccine, there is norecent increase in the number of cases reported. Thus,unlike in Japan, allergy to the MMR vaccine does not seemto be an increasing problem in the UK. MMR vaccine contains about 25 \u00b5g of neomycin sulfate. Contact hypersensitivity and systemic allergic reactions toneomycin are well known. 28Kwittken et al reported the case o fa7y e a ro l db v eloped anaphylactoid reac- tion after being given a 0.05 ml dose of the vaccine subcu- taneously as part of a desensitisation protocol.29The child had a convincing history of contact hypersensitivity (butnot systemic reaction) to neomycin in the past; however, nospecic tests for neomycin sensitivity were done. Ellimanand Dhanraj suggested that contact sensitivity to neomycin was not a contraindication to MMR vaccine. 30They reported the case of a 3 year old girl who had developed swelling and erythema to ear drops containing neomycinand had subsequently been given the MMR vaccine as a0.5 ml single intramuscular dose with no adverse e Vects. However, there is general agreement that children whohave had anaphylactic reactions to topical or systemic administration of neomycin should not be vaccinated. 26 While prevaccination screening should include a question about allergy to the vaccine, gelatin or neomycin, there willremain a small risk of severe allergic reaction in any child.Children with egg allergy do not appear to be at a greaterrisk than the general population. In conclusion, anaphylaxis is a rare but potentially life threatening allergic complication of vaccination that must be anticipated in any vaccine recipient. All personnelinvolved in vaccinating children must be fully aware of thispossibility and trained in its emergency management. Mostsevere reactions occur within a few minutes after the injec-tion and it is extremely unlikely that a child who appearscompletely well 30 minutes after the vaccination will sub-sequently develop a severe reaction. Ideally children shouldbe observed in a place equipped to deal with an anaphylac- tic reaction for at least this time period following vaccina- tion. Any reports of reactions must be fully documented.Severe or unusual reactions must be reported to the CSMby the \"yellow card system\"; and if possible investigated byIgE RAST and/or skin tests to determine which compo-nent of the vaccine was responsible for the allergy.

Public health Sustainable development, human induced global climate change, and the health of children In this short article we introduce the concept of sustainable development and its signicance to child health usingclimate change as an example. Environmental issues, in thelong term, are as important to children's health as smoking,accidents, and poor parenting are in the short term, yet have hitherto had little publicity or discussion within pae-diatric circles. What is happening to children's health in the world? In the developed world cardiovascular disease, diabetes, can-cer, and dental disease are all on the increase, while in thedeveloping world malnutrition, infectious disease, andinjuries are still rife. At present, inequalities of health andwealth\u2014both within and between nations\u2014appear to beincreasing, 1with an adverse impact on children's health. The Ottawa charter for health promotion states that the fundamental conditions for health are peace, shelter, edu-cation, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainableresources, social justice, and equity. 2The evidence for the connections among the environment, the economy, andsocial change are compelling and any change within oneinevitably a Vects the others. Climate change For the rst time in history, the economic activity of thehuman population has become so vast that it is beginningto change the gaseous composition of the lower and middleatmospheres. This is now called human induced global cli-mate change (HIGCC), which in turn will have asignicant impact on a future generation of children. Thereseems no doubt that climate change is a genuinephenomenon. 3The main cause of climate change is the greenhouse e Vect, which is related to the massive increase in use of fossil fuels with consequent liberation of CO2into the atmosphere. Before man started burning oil and coal and gas, the atmosphere contained about 280 parts CO2 per million\u2014now the gure is about 360 ppm. Methaneconcentrations are now more than double what they werein the pre-industrial age. Nine of the 10 hottest years onrecord have occurred since 1993. 4Global average surface temperatures have increased by 0.3-0.6 \u00b0C since the late 19th century.5This is a statistically signicant trend, which, if it continues, will lead to a rise in temperaturebetween 3-5 \u00b0C by the year 2100; this is now accepted by most of the international scientic community, which has concluded that an anthropogenic influence on the globalclimate is discernible. 6This increase contrasts with a global temperature increase since the last ice age (10 000 years ago) of about 5 \u00b0C.5Human beings have further interfered with the equilibrium by destroying large areas ofvegetation, mainly forest, which acts as a carbon sink bytrapping carbon dioxide in plant carbohydrates. 7 EFFECT OF CLIMATE ON HUMAN HEALTH Extremes of temperature a Vect people directly, leading to excess mortality in both hot and cold spells. Eventually theindirect e Vects of greater warmth: increased vector borne disease\u2014estimates of 60% of the world population beingexposed to malaria by the latter half of this century 8\u2014 increased natural disasters,9rising sea level10(and popula- tion displacement), and increased pollution, will have a farlarger impact on health than the direct e Vects. FOOD PRODUCTION AND NUTRITION Worldwide, total production of food is likely to remainconstant but the production of food is likely to favour thehigher latitudes with developing countries around theequator su Vering most. Many communities that rely on traditional agriculture may lack the resources and adapt- ability to switch to alternative crops and production meth-ods. One study has forecast the additional number of hun-gry people attributable to climate change by the year 2060to be between 40 and 300 million. 11Children would be the group most severely a Vected by food shortages. SEA LEVEL A projected increase of 0.2-1.0 m by 2100 is the current best estimate of sea level change.10This is two or three times greater than the change in the last century. Over halfthe world's population lives within 60 km of the sea. Deltaareas are most likely to be a Vected many of which are densely populated. At today's population level an increase of 0.5 m would approximately double the number of peo-ple who su Ver flooding annually\u2014currently around 46 million. The rise in sea level would be compounded byLeading articles 95 "}
