You decided to listen to the unrequested advice, the pleading and the imploring. The white flag has been raised, and the day has come to report for duty. Your mission should you choose not to fight it? Five days under lockdown in the detoxification ward of a psychiatric care facility. As you pull anxiously into the parking lot, you're not sure what to expect. Maybe you try to sneak the last few sips out of that road soda you brought along for the ride. Just one last taste to calm the nerves. Maybe you nervously inhale two last cigarettes back to back. Your close friend or romantic love interest signs you in and gives you one last hug goodbye. \"You can make it through this,\" they say. \"You're going to be just fine,\" they say. \"I can't wait to see you on the other side.\" But you can see the pained look on their face. They can't hide what you can see in their eyes. You know that they're not really sure if you'll make it, and they know you're about to be in pain. Then the doors close, and you're alone with the nurse. Here we go. Intake First things first. You fill out all the medical and insurance paperwork or, if you're in a fancy establishment, they fill it out for you. Then they ask many questions about your consumption. What have you had? When was your last drink? How much do you usually have, per day, per week, per month? Any drugs? How much? How long ago? Don't lie. Lying will only hurt you, and they're going to test your blood and urine anyway so you wouldn't be fooling anyone. Next, they take your vitals. Pulse, blood pressure, temperature. After that, it's time to donate some urine and some blood for the tox screen. Then they usually bring in someone slightly mean to look through your personal belongings. Most of them are taken away during intake. \"Didn't you read the website?\" they ask. "}
