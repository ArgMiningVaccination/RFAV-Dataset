If you are further concerned with learning the truth behind the vaccine industry, the role of the pharmaceutical companies, and how to identify which doctors and procedures are beneficial to you and your family, I highly recommend, The Pharmaceutical Myth, by Gerald Roliz, CNC. In this book, the author accurately depicts the array of concerns and realities behind our current medical trends. These are some facts that everyone in Minnesota should be aware of with regards to the usefulness of vaccines found in The Pharmaceutical Myth: - Infants have no capacity to produce antibodies until after 12 months. What is the necessity of the total 19 recommended shots containing 24 total vaccines to infants at 2,4, and 6 months? Believe it or not, the answer to that is: Parent Training. - The FDA mandates that all pharmaceutical drugs' effects be scrutinized against a placebo. Vaccines have never been held to this same standard, NOT EVER. - It is not uncommon for seizures to occur after a Hepatitis B or DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis) vaccine. After this statement, the author lists 4 studies published on the effects observed in some children after receiving these vaccines. - Here is the list of toxic ingredients used in vaccinations: Aluminum, Thimerosal, Formaldehyde, Carbolic Acid, Acetone, Alum Interestingly, Antibiotics are also listed because of increasing populations who are exhibiting various allergies to neomycin, streptomycin and other antibiotics. In addition, microbes are becoming more immune to these via genetically transmitted tolerance. Listed at the end is \"Other\" as various chemicals are traceable such as sodium hydroxide, sorbitol, hydrolyzed gelatin, benzethonium chloride, methylparaben... Some of which are known to cause cancer. "}
