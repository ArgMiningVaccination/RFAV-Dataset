Just like clean eating makes you more conscious of the food choices you make (like reaching for whole grains instead of processed food for example), clean sleeping is about being conscious of certain lifestyle choices that contribute to better [quality sleep](https://www.healthdigest.com/1083570/what-does-it-mean-to-get-quality-sleep/). And Gwyneth Paltrow seems to swear by it. The Goop founder and actress might have called it \"clean sleeping\" but the advice she's given in her book \" [Goop Clean Beauty](https://www.amazon.com/Goop-Clean-Beauty-gwyneth-paltrow-ebook/dp/B01GGJJ6B2?tag=healthdigestcom-20),\" is some of the fundamental sleep hygiene habits sleep experts have been talking about for years \u2014 pay attention to the number of hours you spend sleeping, practice relaxing bedtime rituals, focus on ambiance, turn off technology, and avoid bedtime snacking. So while you might be tempted to throw out Paltrow's recommendations because of her somewhat eyebrow-raising products like the jade egg, which you're instructed to insert into your vagina, the clean sleeping trend isn't far from being good for you, say the experts. Paltrow wrote in [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4046444/The-biggest-health-trend-2017-Clean-sleeping-know-clean-eating-GWYNETH-PALTROW-shows-approach-boost-sleep.html), \"The lifestyle I lead is based not just on clean eating, but also on clean sleeping: at least seven or eight hours of good, quality sleep \u2014 and ideally even ten. Sleep plays such a powerful role in determining your appetite and energy levels that I believe it should be your first priority \u2014 even before you think about your diet.\" What is Gwyneth Paltrow's clean sleeping all about? According to Paltrow and other editors of Goop who shared their recommendations via Daily Mail, clean sleeping involves getting nine hours of sleep each night, practicing meditation techniques like yoga nidra before bedtime, maintaining a consistent 12-hour fasting window from the time you have dinner at 8.30 p.m. till your morning meal at 8.30 a.m. (no late night snacking), indulging in a foot-and-head massage to relieve tension before bedtime, and investing in a copper pillowcase. The \"Iron Man\" star also advocates for a technology-free bedroom, per [Hello](https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2017011635843/gwyneth-paltrow-sleep-routine-put-to-the-test-by-experts/). Most of what the actress is referring to are actually good sleep hygiene habits, according to an assistant professor of neurology and sleep medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Sabra Abbott (via [BETTER by TODAY](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-gwyneth-paltrow-s-clean-sleeping-should-you-be-doing-ncna795251)). Sleep experts have long documented the benefits of getting seven or more hours of sleep. We may think that our bodies just shut off when we close our eyes, but a lot of important functions like cognitive development, memory sorting, muscle repair, hormone control, and even metabolic and immune system regulation happen while we sleep, explains the [Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/what-happens-when-you-sleep). According to nutritionist and author, Dr. Marilyn Glenville (via Hello), paying attention to your diet could influence sleep quality too. \"Ensure you are eating little and often during the day to keep your blood sugar steady. This will ensure that the hormone cortisol will start to wind down when you go to bed, as it is supposed to do. Try and avoid large meals and too much hard-to-digest food for three to four hours before going to bed,\" she explained. Do you really need a copper pillowcase and yoga nidra? Some of what Gwyneth Paltrow suggests can be better left for those who are having sleep troubles, per clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine at Stanford University, Rafael Pelayo (via BETTER by TODAY). So perhaps, you don't have to worry about an extensive meditation ritual or sweet-smelling foot-and-head massage before you wind down for sleep (unless, of course, you find comfort and relaxation in them). If nighttime wakefulness is a consistent trend, you might also benefit from seeking out a sleep expert. As for the copper pillowcase, there is not much evidence to support its sleep benefits. But cotton, silk, and other lightweight and breathable materials have been recommended by dermatologists for those battling acne. And copper, according to New York City-based board-certified dermatologist Susan Bard, \"is naturally antimicrobial. In this case, the copper may help keep bacterial counts low, and users prone to acne have reported improvement with copper pillow use\" (via [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/pillowcase-benefits#copper-pillowcases)). Blue-light-emitting devices like your phones, TVs, and laptops could also be some of those [things you didn't realize were ruining your sleep](https://www.healthdigest.com/887165/things-you-didnt-realize-were-ruining-your-sleep/). So deciding to free your bedtime routine and space of such gadgets may not be the worst idea, according to the experts. Paltrow's clean sleeping might sound excessive to some but the heart of the message is about being mindful of night-time habits that promote better sleep. "}
