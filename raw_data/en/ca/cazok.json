A health coach helps you figure out what's keeping you from reaching your health goals. Your coach regularly checks in with you by email, phone calls or in-person meetings, usually over the course of at least three months. During those conversations, a health coach asks questions to get you thinking about how you can overcome challenges. \"The most common obstacle people face is their own thoughts about themselves and about change,\" Coates says. \"Through motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, health coaches help people work through some of their thoughts. People find out what's blocking them from following through with the changes they'd like to see.\" For example, say your doctor wants you to eat more fruits and vegetables. A health coach might start by asking questions like: - On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most, how important is it for you to make this change? - What feels reasonable for you? - What is blocking you or what challenges might you face in following through? - What's your home life like? - What plan can we put together so that you can follow through with getting more fruits and vegetables? Health coaching isn't about someone telling you what to do, emphasizes Coates. \"It's someone who's respecting your terms and your reasons for wanting \u2014 or not wanting \u2014 to change. A health coach shows up for you in whatever way you need.\" Benefits of Health Coaching Change is often difficult, even when it's something we really want. Sometimes it even feels downright impossible. The benefit of health coaching is having someone in your corner to help you through it, and research shows it works. [One study found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125027/) that people who went through three months of health coaching significantly improved: - Blood pressure. - Cholesterol. - Glucose (blood sugar). - Triglycerides (blood fat). - Body weight. - Cardiovascular fitness. A health coach can help when you feel like nothing you've done on your own has worked. Or give you a boost if you're feeling overwhelmed, discouraged or like you don't have enough time.
