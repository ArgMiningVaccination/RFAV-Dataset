At Castle Craig, our trained therapists use mindfulness in group therapy and during one-to-one sessions with patients. Mindfulness meditation can help to treat: It alleviates symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as hyperarousal and flashbacks and also helps to reduce physical pain. - Stress - Depression - Compulsive behaviours - Anxiety I am here for [Alcohol](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/rehab/alcohol-rehab) | [Drugs](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/rehab/drug-rehab) | [Other addiction](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/rehab/behavioural-rehab) Mindfulness is about focusing on the \"here and now\" and acknowledging and accepting each thought and feeling as it is. It helps patients recognise and detach themselves from negative feelings, rather than looking for a release via drink or drugs. A higher level of self-awareness can help the patient break the automatic and habitual cycle of addiction. Mindfulness has been proven to thicken the right pre-frontal cortex of the brain, the part most damaged by alcohol and drug abuse, and the area responsible for optimism, creativity, well-being, and rational thought. Free Addiction Assessment Mindfulness & Relapse Prevention Experiences of craving, strong emotions, and negative thoughts often act as powerful \"triggers\" for relapse into substance abuse. Mindfulness meditation helps the patient identify and manage their cravings and associated thought patterns in a non-judgemental manner. For example, a recovering patient who is feeling anxious about relapse can become aware of this anxiety, and come to accept it rather than trying to submerge it with drinks or drugs. This \"non-judgemental\" element also fosters a deep personal understanding where the individual is less vulnerable to blame, guilt and self-doubt. Whilst research in mindfulness meditation therapy is still in its infancy, early studies show promising results for its role in treating substance abuse. Mindfulness meditation is no panacea for all mental health problems, but it is a powerful therapy when used alongside other treatments. Download Our Brochure Relaxation Therapy Relaxation therapy helps patients to develop deep breathing rhythms, which can calm anxiety, minimise stress & tension, and increase lung capacity. It helps patients to let go of negative feelings that can prevent recovery and creates feelings of calm and well-being which help with [individual](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/therapy/specialist-therapies/individual-rehab) and [group therapy](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/therapy/group-therapy) sessions. Relaxation therapy is provided each week by one of our therapists. Patients lie on a mat on the floor. The session begins with deep breathing and light stretching and moves on to progressive muscle relaxation and meditation. How Can Castle Craig Help? How Do I Pay For Rehab? One concern we sometimes hear from people is how they will fund their rehab treatment. The cost of rehab varies depending on what kind of accommodation you choose. You can pay for treatment at Castle Craig privately, or through medical insurance, and some people receive funding through the NHS. How Long Is the Rehab Programme? Residential rehab treatment starts at four weeks and can go up to 12+ weeks. Research shows us that the longer you stay in rehab and are part of the residential therapy programme, the longer the likelihood of continued abstinence and stable recovery. Who Will I Speak to When I Call? When you call you will reach our Help Centre team who will give you all the information you need to help you decide whether to choose treatment at Castle Craig. Once you have decided that you would like to have a free screening assessment you will be put in touch with our admissions case managers who will guide you through the admissions process. What Happens at the End of My Treatment? Castle Craig thoroughly prepares patients before departure by creating a personalised continuing care plan which is formulated following discussions with the medical and therapeutic team. We offer an online [continuin](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/addiction-treatment/aftercare) [g care programme](https://www.castlecraig.co.uk/addiction-treatment/aftercare) which runs for 24 weeks after leaving treatment, in order to ensure a smooth transition back into your everyday life. Patients leaving treatment automatically join our Recovery Club where they can stay connected via our annual reunion, events, online workshops and recovery newsletters. "}
