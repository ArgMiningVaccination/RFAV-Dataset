I had no idea what to expect, but it was gentle and relaxing. My skin is definitely smoother, lifted, and my fine wrinkles are not as visible (my husband said the same). I look fresher and rejuvenated. I'm spreading the word! Thank you.\" - Jessica T. \"I had sagging jowls and eyelids. Also forehead wrinkles. It was making me look so old! These treatments have helped so much. I see the difference even first thing in the morning when I look at myself in the mirror. I say wow! I really see the difference! I love this. And I also sleep better and feel so good! Better mood.\" - Guadalupe R. \"Okay, it is about time I provide a review! I've been singing your praises, Jackie. As a working mom, I have not done the best job of caring for my skin and overall well-being. I'm tired and it has definitely been showing! I do care about what I put into my body and on my skin and I want to go as natural as I can. Let me just say I absolutely love cosmetic acupuncture now and how I look and feel! As you explained, it stimulates natural collagen production and helps the body heal holistically from the inside out. It's not just a surface treatment. I really do look radiant and I FEEL amazing after weeks of these sessions. My family and friends actually notice. It's like a reset. I'm reverse-aging! Yes! Thank you, thank you. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone and especially to all the hard-working mamas! It feels like a treat and it's so good for our whole being. Health is from within and reflects outwards!\" - Christina T. OFFICE HOURS Monday 9:00am - 6:00pm Tuesday 9:00am - 6:00pm - 6:00pm Saturday 9:00am - 1:00pm Sunday Closed "}
