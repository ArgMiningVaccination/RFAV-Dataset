Holistic medicine works differently because it addresses the connection between mind, body, and spirit. [Holistic medicine](https://www.cutlerintegrativemedicine.com/services/integrative-medicine/holistic-medicine/) strives for balance and overall wellness to help people enjoy a healthy life. Holistic medicine seeks to understand you as a whole, unique person with mental, emotional, and physical health needs. When any one of these areas becomes out of balance or stressed, you may experience this in all realms of your life.

Functional medicine focuses on the interrelated and intertwined functions of the body's organs and systems, seeing symptoms from one organ as part of a system out of balance. Holistic medicine often uses lifestyle changes, a personalized nutrition plan, and stress relief to help the whole person feel healthier. A holistic approach to medicine will look deeper than your physical symptoms. If you have not gotten the results you hoped for from conventional medicine, you are not alone.
