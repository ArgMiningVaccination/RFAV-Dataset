The Homeopathic principle states \"Let Like be cured by Like\"; which means that a substance that can bring up certain symptoms when taken in a healthy condition by a healthy person, has the potential to treat those very symptoms in a diseased person. It is considered as a Complementary system of medicine which focuses on stimulating and supporting the immune system to bring about cure and healing. The remedies have natural sources. They are prepared to be very safe and suitable for all ages, including infants, pregnant ladies and the elderly. A very special aspect of Ayurveda and Homeopathy is that every person is taken as a holistic entity - taking into account the totality of a person's Body and Psyche working as one single unit.
