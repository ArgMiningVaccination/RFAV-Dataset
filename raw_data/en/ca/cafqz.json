Autism Sorry the groups I usually post in have inactive people. I'm assuming most are inactive because of the long wait for responses. My son is suspected to be autistic and will he starting early education. I'm struggling to deal with this emotions. I've read up on dealing with emotions in a book and it just doesn't seem to fit the information I'm looking for. Does anyone know is any books for parents learning how to deal with autistic toddler emotions behaviour etc. [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Autism) Any emotion you feel is valid. It changes the course of parenting and adds layers to it. To set your mind at ease, there is not a lot of need to worry long term. Your child is still the child you know and love and you will see growth. Kids with autism are entirely capable of living fulfilling and enriching lives. There are so many services available that will help your child thrive. Take the time you need to process it. It's a diagnosis and that takes time to come to terms with. But rest assured your child will be ok, no matter their place on the spectrum. Advocate for your child, love your child and take care of your self in the process. Reach out to a local behavior agency and take advantage of any and all services available to you. Are you asking for books on how to deal with your toddler's emotions or your own? both me and my baby's. My son is extremely stubborn, so I'm always having to be repetitive to the point where I feel frustrating. He lacks listening skills, so it's hard to teach him things, which is one his flags a pathologist observed. He's normally in his own little world, almost as if he's deaf which was a concern at one point but when I got his hearing checked he was cleared of that. So Id like to educate myself on how I can help my son improve his behaviour and listening skills, and how I can help manage my own emotions when needing to be repetitive with teaching. He's been repetitively stomping and jumping literally throughout the day. There's not one hour he doesn't do that, and we'd get complaints from neighbours living below our apartment. There is an autism group on this app if you haven't tried there yet. My 3.5 year old son is autistic and non speaking so it is frequently a challenge to know exactly how he is feeling and what his needs are. Occupational therapy has helped so much. It's helped us know what his sensory needs are and how we can help him when emotions are high. His OT recommended \"the out of sync child\" but I haven't read it yet. I'll definitely join that group. And thank you very much I'll see what exactly the book is about. Behavior is communication. meltdowns can be very chaotic for parents, caregivers and sibling, but however bad it feels for outsiders, it feels 1000 times worse for the autistic person. Allow, facilitate, and encourage. stimming. it's necessary for autistic nervous system. joining in can also be enjoyable for some people. A lot of people think (and say) that autistic peolple \"aren't all there\" or assume that if an autistic child doesn't speak they can't understand. This is often not the case. never force or let anyone force eye contact it can be so painful for some autistic people. I always encourage people to seek alternative therapies to ABA. and to avoid anything that comes from autism speaks, or is puzzle piece themed. I am autistic and so is my son. I understand this isn't exactly what you're asking for but these are just things I wished more people knew and understood about autism. Your insight is actually very helpful, I greatly appreciate it. I'm a first time parent, so everything is new to me and I'm still learning and seeking more information for myself to learn. My son will be starting early education with kids like him, but I won't be there to learn about what he's being taught. I don't really have guidance about this stuff accept from my doctor. But wow the eye contact thing makes sense, bc a lot of ppl believe that my son simply doesn't like them, but he genuinely just doesn't like socializing. He doesn't like when anyone wants to talk to him or play with him. He always walks away as if he can't hear. Or if someone tries to force conversation or play time with him he'd have an emotional burst, or would even physically push or hit ppl to get away from him. I was worried about someone hurting him but a pathologist had said that if no one respects his boundaries he sets for himself, then he'd learn these responses himself through like an instinct fight or flight response. You're welcome. have you ever heard the term parallel play? it's kids playing adjacent to eachother, they might have the same items or they could be doing completely different activities, but it's in close proximity to eachother. it's common in young chidlren but it's also a really common way that autistc kids, and adults socialize with others. My partner and I have always done this. he'll be gaming in the same room I'm drawing, or watching something. I do it with my son too he'll be playing with blocks or something so I grab blocks it another toy and play next to him. it's not the same as two people cooperatively playing in the same way, but it is a way we engage with eachother. I think your son might enjoy this type of play too. It is also common for autistic people to get flagged for hearing problems. I though I was hard of hearing for most of my life before learning I am autistic. It's processing what I have heard that can be a challenge for me. The book Unmasking Autism is a book writen by an autistic person and its been highly recommended to me. I have read, or heard some of it though audiobook reading but I haven't read all of it. what I have read, is really good. I think the authors name is Devon Price. I have a toddler (just turned 2 in July) who hasn't been formally diagnosed yesterday , but who I believe is on the spectrum. He is such a blessing in our lives and I love him exactly how he is, but I've gone through so many emotions about it, because it's hard not to think about life being harder for him than my other kids and what type of challenges he will be presented with as he grows, etc. I just want to say I resonate with you and I'm following this post to read the advice given. Ok, I hope you can find useful information as well. You should book an appointment for your son to see a speech and language pathologist or a child psychologist they can help your referral to be assessed for autism. If you're asking on how to deal with his emotions, I used to remind myself \"they are not trying to give you a hard time, they are going through a hard time\". It comes down to a communication issue, where the child either unable to relay their emotions or doesn't even understand their emotions, so they try to communicate through meltdowns. Idk how old your son is or if he's verbal but speech therapy can help but I didn't see a drastic improvement til we started ABA at age 5. It's been 3 months and my child has learned more in this time then the previous 2 years in school. that's a good way to think, I'll definitely keep that in mind. I do allow my son to feel out his emotions & explain what I recognize about his feelings to him. But he lacks communication & listening skills which is one of his flags a pathologist had said. So it's tough to communicate with him & for him to communicate with me. He can only communicate the word \"mom\" when he needs me during a meltdown. We live in an apartment & he's been having repetitive behaviour of stomping & jumping, it's so loud that we've received a complaint from ppl downstairs saying the stomping & jumping knocked down pictures, which I don't really believe, lol. I've been trying my best to teach my son not to do so but I wind up feeling frustrated with how repetitive I have to be with the same issue happening throughout every day. So that's why I'm seeking help as to what I could possibly do to help my son better understand? Although I'm getting the sense from others that bc he's autistic nothing I can do will help... and that I just need to let him do his thing but I don't want him to think he has no boundaries when it comes to courtesy & respect. Idk I definitely need a big house if he's gonna be walking around like an elephant and jumping like a kangaroo everyday, lol. This is my son exactly. He's really getting to the age where he should be able to communicate with me, but he can't and I feel awful when I just don't understand what he needs. He's currently still nursing and sometimes that's the only way to calm him down enough that I can get through to him. Jumping is one of his stims though, probably his favorite one. He jumps up and down constantly and has been doing so since he was around a year old. The other big one used to be having other people clap for him. That one was hard, because if he was in a mood it was a meltdown if you stopped clapping and I couldn't just sit there for hours and clap for his. But I finally said no more clapping and every time he would try I would redirect to something else and he finally let it go. One thing I have noticed with him though is that his diet makes a huge difference. We try to eat really well in general, but my while my older kids can tolerate some junk food now and then, he really can't because his behavior will be 100 times worse. It really affects him in a big way. When he's eating well he's the sweetest, happiest guy with all his little quirks. So he has expressive and receptive speech delays. My daughter was the same and honestly I don't think she started having receptive speech u til around 4. I could ask her to do something and she just did not understand enough to follow the prompt. We did alot of hand over hand and that helped but until your child develops in that area, you'll just have to wait til he develops in his speech. But ABA seriously helped with alot. My daughter will have a meltdown and I ask \"what do you want\" and she will answer \"I want ____ \" which is whatever is causing the meltdown and its been amazing! Join autism support groups on Facebook The explosive child really helped me as a parent. This is where I first learned my child was not giving me a hard time, he was having a hard time. Keep in mind that even though your child may not \"listen\" he's hearing your tone and seeing your body language. Keep yourself calm and you may be able to assist him co-regulating. I think it's really important to be flexible and adjust your style to your sons needs. If your son is not taking direction verbally, could you try a picture chart or visually show him what to do? You are going to have to sit down and really think about what's important *to* him and *for* him. If he has no desire to play with others at this time, could he play near others? I would not force eye contact or speaking to others if it makes him uncomfortable. My son's autism was diagnosed later and first thought to be ODD and ADHD. He is extremely demand avoidant and wants things his own way. We tried many different styles and found the strictest ones were the absolute worst for him. The best approach is more collaborative with him and I have found that valuing connection over compliance is key for our family. Everyone is so different though, you just have to be patient in the journey because other kids might do better with a rigid routine. There are tons of different therapies out there and lots of differences with therapists. If something feels off or not right for your child, speak up and find one that will work. Do lots of research about ABA, especially the first hand accounts of people who have been through it. Never feel pressure to try to stop stimming or self regulating behaviors. He is doing them for a reason. For the meltdowns, is it due to an unmet need? During transitions? Too bright? Too loud? Do his own clothes or the surface where he is sitting bother him? Would he do well with a crash mat if the neighbors are complaining? Have you found any calming techniques that work- like bear hugs, soft lighting, lava lamps, music? OT can help so much in this area. There is so much sensory equipment out there for help calming. I wish you luck in your journey! The autism board here is mostly full of posts about parents so fearful that their child has autism. There's some good groups on Facebook if you're looking to connect with other parents. I thoroughly enjoy my child, just as he is. I always keep in mind, what does he want for his life and when working with therapists I think about what he wants to achieve while planning goals. The best thing you can do is make sure he understands he is loved and accepted just like he is, and advocate for others to treat him accordingly. - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [ToddlerWhat Is Autism Spectrum Disorder?](//www.whattoexpect.com/family/the-autism-spectrum-disorder) [ToddlerWhat Are the Early Signs of Autism in Toddlers and Babies?](//www.whattoexpect.com/family/early-warning-signs-of-autism) [ToddlerSensory Processing Issues in Children](//www.whattoexpect.com/developmental-delays-in-children/sensory-processing-disorder-in-children.aspx) [ToddlerDoes My Toddler Have Need to Know](//www.whattoexpect.com/child-vaccinations/treating-side-effects.aspx) Stay-at-Home MomsHappy tears.
