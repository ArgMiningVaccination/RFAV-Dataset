It was developed as a tool to encourage common understanding among caregivers, teachers, families, and health care professionals about inf ectious diseases and to aid with efforts for reducing illnesses, injuries and other health problems in childcare settings. This guide explains the health history of immunizations, ways to prevent and control the spread of communicable diseases, symptoms of common inf ections seen in childcare settings, how inf ections are spread, when to seek medical care, inclusion/exclusion criteria, fact sheets, and sample letters to give to parent s. The information in this guide is based on the latest recommendations addressing health and safety in childcare settings from the following organizations: American Academy of Pediatrics American Public Health Association US Department of Health and Huma n Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Should you have concerns regarding the contents of this manual, please dir ect your HHeeaalltthhyy Delaware's early care providers, teachers, families and health professionals are committed to keeping all children healthy. As families enter the workforce, they must rely on childcare centers to provide a safe, healthy and caring environment for their child. T hese children are very susceptible to contagious diseases because they have not been exposed to many inf ections (e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi) and have no resistance to them, or have not received recommended immunizations. Therefore, children are acquiring inf ections at an earlier age. A variety of inf ections ha ve been documented in children attending childcare, sometimes with spread to caregivers and to others at home. Infants and toddlers have high hand to mouth activity. They play and eat close together. Their hygiene habits and immune systems are not well developed. In addition, wherever there are children in diapers, the spread of diarrheal diseases m ay readily occur as the re sult of poor or inadequate hand washing, diaper changing and environmental sanitation me asures. In general, sending home (excluding) mildly ill children is not an eff ective way to control the spread of most germs. Individuals who are not ill or never become ill can spread many inf ections. All of these factors make inf ections in childcare s ettings common and fast spreading. This manual contains disease fact sheets specifically meant for childcare settings. It explains ways to recognize and minimize the spread of infectious diseases. These fact sheets may be distributed to parents and staff; fact sheets will help staff determine when children should be sent home or readmitted to your facili ty. Childcare Manual the health history and medical emer gency information for every child in your care. When a child enrolls in your childcare facility, you should find out: Contact information for parents with names , addresses , work, home and cell phone numbers. Two secondary contacts if parents cannot be reached (with same contact information as above) . The c hild's regular health care provider with name, address , and phone numbers. The hospita l that the child's family uses with name, address, and phone number s. The date of the child's last physical examination. Any child who has not had a well baby or well child examination recently (within the past 6 months) should be examined within 30 days of entering your childcare facility. Any special health problems or m edical conditions that a child may have and procedures to follow to manage with these conditions (e.g. allergies , asthma, diabetes, seizures, sickle cell disease) . These conditions can cause sudden attacks that may require immediate action. You should kno w: What happens to the child during a crisis related to the condition . How to prevent a crisis How to help manage a crisis Whether you need training in a particular emergency procedure . The child's current immunization status. You s hould assure that all children admitted to your facility are up to date on their vaccinations. The S tate of Delaware requires you to have written proof of each child's vaccinations. Children attending childcare especially need all of the recommended vaccin ations to prot ect them selves, the other children, the childcare provider, and their families. Several diseases that can cause serious problems for children and adults can be prevented by vaccinat ion. These diseases are chicken pox, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae certain types of meningitis, hepatitis A and B, influenza, measles, mumps, pneumococcal disease, polio, rubella (German measles or 3 -day measles), tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis). Many of these diseases are becoming less common because most people have been vaccinated against them. However, cases still occur and children in childcare are at increased risk for many of these diseases because of the many hours they spend in close contact with other children. State law requires that all ch ildren undergo lead screening at 1 year of age. Medicaid children must also be screened again at 2 years of age. Children who are not up to date on their vaccinations should be taken out of childcare (excluded) until they have begun the series of shots needed . Each child in your care should have an Immunization certificate on file at the facility . Each child shall also have a current health appraisal on file signed by a licensed healthcare provider. This health appraisal should include a description of any disability or impairment that may aff ect adaptation to childcare.

As a childcare provider, you will be exposed to inf ectious diseases more frequently than will someone who has less contact with children. To prot ect yourself and the children in your care, you need to know what immunizations you received as a child and whether you had certain childhood diseases. If you are not sure, your health care provider can test your blood to determine if you are immune to some of these diseases and can vaccinate you against those to which you are not immune. Childcare providers shall also have a health appraisals signed by a licensed healthcare provider on file at the facility . These shall include a health history, physical examination, immunization status, vision/hearing screening, TB screening (see below), and assessment of any health related limitations or communicable diseases that may impair the caregiver's ability to perform specific job duties. Tuberculosis Screening Persons who are beginning work as childcare prov iders should have a TB skin test (Mantoux method using tuberculin purified protein derivative [ PPD ]) to check for inf ection with the TB germ, unless there is documentation of a p ositive test result in the past or of active TB that has been previously treat ed. The first time they are tested, persons who cannot document any previous TB skin test results should have a two -step test. (That is, if the first test result is negative, the skin test is repeated within one month.) Persons who have negative results fr om their skin tests when they start childcare work should have their skin tests repeated every 2 years while the results are still negative. Recommended Immunization Schedule for Childcare Providers IMMUNIZATION HOW OFTEN Influenza Annually, between Se ptember & November for all providers Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Providers born before 1957 can be considered immune to measles and mumps. Others are immune if they have a history of measles or mumps . Providers are considered immune to rubella if they h ave received at least one does of rubella vaccine on or after their first birthday. A blood test indicating immunity to rubella or one dose of rubella vaccine is required. Tetanus, Diphtheria & Pertussis Childcare providers should have a record of receivi ng a series of 3 doses of Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis containing vaccine (usually given in childhood) and a booster of tetanus given within the past 10 years. Those who have not received the Tdap vaccine (available only since 2005) should receive a s ingle dose. Polio Childcare providers, especially those working with children who are not toilet -trained, should have a record of a primary series of 3 doses (usually given in childhood) and a supplemental fourth dose given at least 6 months after the thi rd dose of the primary series. Hepatitis A CDC recommends Hepatitis A vaccine for childcare providers. Chickenpox CDC recommends Chickenpox vaccine for all childcare providers who have not had Chickenpox disease. Providers who have had the disease (confi rmed by a healthcare provider) are considered immune. Hepatitis B Childcare providers who may have co ntact with blood or body fluids or who work with developmentally disabled or aggressive children should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B with one series of 3 doses of vaccine. Childcare Manual 10 Childcare Manual 11 Things You Need to Know about Immunizations 1. \"Why should my child be immunized?\" Children need immunizations (shots) to protect them from dangerous childhood diseases. These diseases have serious complications and can even kill children. 2. \"What diseases do vaccines prevent?\" Measles Mumps Polio Rubella Rotavirus Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Diphtheria Tetanus Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib disease) Hepatitis A Hepatitis Papillomavirus (HPV) Meningococcal meningitis Varicella (chickenpox) Influenza shots does my child need?\" The following vaccinations are recommended by age two : 1 dose of measles, mumps & rubella vaccine (MMR) 3-4 doses of Hib vaccine (depending on brand used) 3 doses of polio vaccine 4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus & pertussis vaccine (DTaP) 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine 2-3 doses of rotavirus vaccine (depending on brand used) 1 dose of varicella (chickenpox) vaccine 4 doses of pneumococcal vaccine 2-3 doses of influenza vaccine (6 months and older) (number of doses depends on child's birthday). One annual vaccination against influenza. Children receiving influenza vaccination for the fi rst time should receive 2 vaccinations during the first year. 4. \"Are the vaccines safe?\" Serious reactions to vaccines are extremely rare, but do occur. However, the risks of serious disease from not vaccinating are far greater than the risks of serious reaction to the vaccination. Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) are available at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html Childcare Manual 12 5. \"What do I do if my child has a serious reaction?\" If yo u think your child is exp eriencing a serious reaction to a vaccine, call your healthcare provider or seek immediate medic al attention . Your healthcare provider should file a Vaccine Adverse Event Report (VAER) form . You may also contact the National Vaccin e Injury Compensation Program at1 -800-338-2382 for additional information. 6. \"Why can't I wait until school to have my child immunized?\" Children under five are especially susceptible to disease because their immune systems have not built up the necessar y defenses to fight infection. By immunizing on time (by age 2), you can protect your child from disease and also protect others at school or daycare. 7. \"Why is a vaccination health record important?\" A vaccination health r ecord helps you and your healthcare provider keep your child 's immunizations on schedule. A record should be started at birth when your child receive s his/her first vaccination and updated each time your child receives the next scheduled vaccination. This information will help you if you move to a new area or change health care providers, or when your child is enrolled in daycare or starts school. Remember to bring this record with you every time your child has a hea lthcare visit. 8. \"Where can I get free vaccines?\" A federal program cal led Vaccines for Children provides free vaccines to eligible children, including those without health insurance coverage, all those who are enrolled in Medicaid, American Indians and Alaskan Natives and those whose health insurance does not cover vaccines. 9. \"Where can I get more information?\" You can call the Delaware Public Health Immunization Program at 1 -800-282-8672 or the CDC Information Contact Center at 1-800-232-4636 (800- CDC -INFO) . Further information regarding vaccines and immunizations can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ Childcare Manual 13 CChhaapptteerr 33 IInnffeeccttiioonn OOvveerrvviieeww In a childcare setting, close personal contact and inadequate hygiene of young children provide a good opportunity for the spread of germs. \" Germ \" is the common term for a large variety of microorganisms (an organism too small to be seen without a micro scope) that can grow in or on people. Infection is the term used to describe a situation in which the germ causes disease. Germs include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and through direct contact with an infected area of someone's body or contact with contaminated hands or any substance or surface that is contaminated with infectious material (e.g. saliva, wound drainage , stool from diapers ). Many objects can absorb, retain, and transpor t germs. In childcare settings the surfaces of floors, activity and food tables, diaper changing tables, doorknobs, restrooms, toys, and fabric objects can have many germs on them if they are not properly cleaned and sanitize d. Direct head to head contact, sharing hats or hairbrushes, or storing articles of clothing in close proximity can result in transmission of head lice . Skin -to-skin or skin -to-bed linen contact can spre ad impetigo and scabies. Close proximity to respiratory secre tions can spread a SSpprreeaadd bbyy tthhee FFeeccaall--OOrraall RRoouuttee Children in diapers present a high risk for the spread of gastrointestinal infections through contamination of hands or surfaces with fecal matter (stool) . Germs c an spread by the fecal -oral route if the infected person does not wash hands after changi ng a diaper, using the restroom or before food preparation or when people eat food contaminated with disease- causing germs from fecal matter . Germs that spread via the fecal -oral route include campylobacter, cryptosporidium , E. Coli O157, giardia, A bbyy tthhee RReessppiirraattoorryy RRoouuttee Airborne droplets that have germs from the respiratory tract can spread by when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or when a person touches surfaces that have secretions from an infected person's nose, eye s, mouth or throat. The most common surfaces that spread airborne droplets are hands. Teaching child ren to cover their mouth s and nose s with a tissue or the inside of their elbow when they cough or sneeze helps to limit the spread of these germs. It is best to use a disposable tissue to cover a cough or sneeze then wash hands before touching anything el se. In childcare settings, sometime s this is not always possible. Hand sanitizers should be readily available for use when immediate washing with soap and water is not possible. Hand sanitizers should only be used with close adult supervision. IInnffeeccttiioonn SSpprreeaadd tthhrroouugghh BBlloooodd,, UUrriinnee,, aanndd SSaalliivvaa Contact with blood and body fluids of another person usually requires more intimate exposure than typically occurs in childcare settings. Some infections are spread through contact with contaminated blood through a cut that lets germs into the body. Following standard precautions to remove blood from the environment safely prevents transmission of bloodborne germs. Because Childcare Manual 14 it is impossible to know who might have a bloodborne disease, routine use of standard precau tions (wearing disposable gloves prior to contact with blood or bloodied material) protects everyone against the spread of HIV and Hepatitis . Infected children can possibly transmit theses infections through biting if there is blood mixed with their saliv a (e.g. bleeding gums). Saliva and urine often contain viruses long after a child has recovered from an illness. Good hand washing and standard precautions will help prevent the spread of these viruses. Childcare Manual 15 CChhaapptteerr 44 IInnffeeccttiioonn CCoonnttrrooll MMeeaassuurreess SSaanniittaattiioonn aanndd DDiissiinnffeeccttiioonn Keeping the childcare environment clean and orderly is very important for hea lth, safety, and the emotional well -being of both children and their providers. Thorough cleaning is one of the most important steps in reducing the number of germs and the spread of disease. Surfaces most likely contaminated are those children are routi nely in contact with . These include toys that children put in their mouths, crib rails, food preparation areas, and diaper- changing areas. Routine cleaning with soap and water is the most useful method for removing germs from surfaces in the childcare s etting. Good mechanical cleaning (scrubbing with soap and water) physically reduces the numbers of germs from the surface, just as handwashing reduces the numbers of germs from the hands. Removing germs in the childcare setting is especially important for soiled surfaces, which cannot be treated with chemical disinf ectants, such as some upholstery fabrics. However, some items and surfaces should be disinf ected after cleaning with soap and rinsing with clear water. Items that can be washed in a dishwasher or hot cycle of a washing machine do not have to be disinf ected because these machines use water that is hot enough for a long enough period of time to kill most germs. The disinf ection process uses chemicals that are stronger than soap and water. Disinf ection usually requires soaking or drenching the item for several minutes to give the chemical time to kill the remaining germs. Commercial products that meet the Environmental Prot ection Agency's (EPA's) standards for \"hospital grade\" g ermicides (solutions that kill germs) may be used for this purpose. A homemade solution of household bleach and water is another alternative . Bleach is cheap and easy to get. B leach solution kills most germs and is safe if handled properly. Recipe for: Bleach Disinf ecting Solution Weaker Bleach Disinf ecting Solution (For use in bathrooms, diapering areas, etc.) (For use on toys, eating utensils, etc.) 1/4 cup bleach/1 gallon cool water 1- tablespoon bleach /1gallon cool water OR 1-tablespoon bleach/1 quart cool water Note : Never mix bleach with anything but fres h tap water. Other chemicals may react with bleach, creating and releasing a toxic gas . Add the bleach to the water. A solution of bleach and water loses its s trength very quickly and easily . Therefore, bleach solution should be mixed fresh each day to make sure it is eff ective. Any leftover solution should be discarded at the end of the day. Label all spray bottles of bleach to prevent accidents. Keep the bleach solution you mix each day in a cool place out of dir ect sunlight and out of the reach of children. Childcare Manual 16 WWaasshhiinngg aanndd DDiissiinnffeeccttiinngg BBaatthhrroooommss aanndd ootthheerr SSuurrffaacceess Bathroom surfaces such as faucets, handles, and toilet seats should be washed and disinf ected several times a day and also whenever obviously soiled. The bleach and water solution or chlorine- containing scouring powders or other commercial bathroom surface cleaners/disinf ectants can be used in these areas. Surfaces that infants and young toddlers are likely to touc h or mouth should be washed with soap and water and disinf ected at least once daily and also whenever visibly soiled. After the surface has been drenched or soaked with the disinf ectant for at least 10 minu tes, surfaces likely to be mouthed should be thoroughly wiped with a fresh towel moistened with tap water. Be sure not to use a toxic cleaner on surfaces likely to be mouthed. WWaasshhiinngg aanndd DDiissiinnffeeccttiinngg DDiiaappeerr CChhaannggiinngg AArreeaass Diaper changing areas should: Not be located in food preparation areas. Not be used for temporary placement of food or utensils. Be conveniently located and washable. Be positioned to allow caregivers the ability to m aintain constant sight and proper supervision of children. Diaper ch anging tables should: Be moisture -proof, nonabsorbent, smooth surfaces that do not trap soil. Be easy to clean and disinfect. Have a raised edge to prevent a child from falling off. Be next to a sink with running water. Be at a convenient height for child care providers. Be out of reach of children. Diaper changing areas should be cleaned and disinf ected after each diaper change as follows: Clean the surface with soap and water and rinse with clear water. Dry the surface with a paper towel. Thoroughly w et the surface with the recommended bleach solution. Air dry ; do not wipe. WWaasshhiinngg PPoottttyy CChhaaiirrss aanndd TTooiilleettss Potty chairs are difficult to keep clean and out of reach of children. Small size flushable toilets or modified toilet seats and step aids are preferable. If potty chairs are used for toilet training, you should use potty chairs only in the bathroom area and out of reach of toilets or other potty chairs. After each use of a potty chair, you should: Immediately empty the contents into a toilet, being careful not to splash or touch the water in the toilet. Rinse the potty with water from a sink used only for custodial cleaning. Do not rinse the potty in a sink used for washing hands or a sink used for food preparation Dump the rinse water into t he toilet. Wash and disinfect the potty chair. Wash and disinfect the sink and all exposed surfaces. Wash your hands thoroughly.

You may empty solid stool into the toilet being careful not to splash or touch toilet water with your hands. Put the soiled clothes in a plastic bag and seal the bag to await pick up by the child's parent or guardian at the end of the day. Alw ays wash your hands after handling soiled clothing. Explain to parents that washing or rinsing soiled diapers an d clothing increases the risk of exposure to germs that cause disease. Although receiving soiled clothes is not pleasant, remind parents that this policy prot ects the health of all children and providers. Each item of sleep equipment, including cribs, cots, mattresses, blankets, sheets, etc., should be cleaned and sanitized before being ass igned to a specific child. B edding items should be labeled with that child's name and should only be used by that child. C hildren should not share bed linens . Infants' linens should be cleaned and sanitized daily, and crib mattresses should be cleaned and sanitized weekly and when soiled or wet. Linens from bed s of older children should be laundered at least weekly and whenever soiled. However, if a child inadvertently uses another child's bedding, you should change the linen and mattress cover before allowing the assigned child to use it again. WWaasshhiinngg aanndd DDiissiinnffeeccttiinngg TTooyyss Whenever possible, infants and toddlers should not share toys. Consistent use of t oys that ch ildren (particularly infants and toddlers) put in their mouths should be washed and disinf ected between uses by individual children. Toys for infants and toddlers should be chosen with this in mind. If you cannot wash a toy, it probably is not appropriat e for an infant or toddler. Children in diapers should only have washable toys. Each group of children should have its own toys. Toys should not be shared with other groups. When an infant or toddler finishes playing with a toy, you should retrieve it fr om the play area and put it in a bin reserved for dirty toys. This bin should be out of reach of the children. Toys can be washed later, at a more convenient time ; then transferred to a bin for clean toys and safely reused by other children. To wash an d disinf ect a hard plastic toy: Scrub the toy with warm, soapy water. Use a brush to reach into the crevices. Rinse the toy in clean water. Immerse the toy in a mild bleach solution and allow it to soak in the solution for 10 -20 minutes. Remove th e toy from the bleach solution, rinse well and allow to air dry Hard plastic toys that are washed in a dishwasher, or cloth toys washed in the hot water cycle of a washing machine, do not need to be additionally disinf ected. Childcare Manual 18 Stuffed toys used by only a single child should be cleaned in a washing machine every week or more frequently if heavily soiled. Toys and equipment used by older children and not put into their mouths should be cleaned at least wee kly and when visibly soiled. A soap and water wash followed by clear water rinsing and air-drying should be adequate. No disinf ection is required. Do not use wading pools, especially for children in diapers. Water play tables can spread germs. To prevent this: Disinf ect the table with bleach solution before filling it with water. Disinf ect all toys to be used in the table with bleach solution. Avoid using sponge toys. They can trap bacteria and are difficult to clean. Have all children wash their hands before and after playing in the water table. Do not allow children with open sores or wounds to play in the water table. Carefully supervise the children to make sure they do not drink the water. CClleeaanniinngg uupp BBooddyy FFlluuiiddss Spills of body fluids, including blood, feces, vomit, urine, nasal and eye discharges, and saliva should be cleaned up immediately. Wear disposable gloves and b e careful not to get any of the fluid you are cleaning in your eyes , nose, mouth, or any open so re. Clean and disinfect any surfaces on which body fluids have been spilled. Wash hands thoroughly after cleaning up any body fluids.

Some activities in particular expose children and providers to germs or allow the opportunity to spread them. You can stop the spread of germs by washing your hands and teaching children in your care good hand washing practices. WWhheenn HHaannddss sshhoouulldd bbee wwaasshheedd:: CChhiillddrreenn:: Upon arrival at the childcare facility Immediately before and after eating After using the toilet or having their dia pers changed Before using water tables After playing on the playground After handling pets, pet cages, or other pet objects Whenever hands are visibly dirty Before going home PPrroovviiddeerrss:: Upon arrival to the childcare facility Immediately before handling food, preparing bottles, or feeding children After using the toilet, assisting a child using the toilet, or changing diapers After contact with any body fluids (e.g. nasal drainage, vomit, saliva, feces) After handling pets, pet cages, or other pet objects Whenever hands are visibly dirty or after cleaning up a child, bathroom items or toys After removing gloves used for any purpose * Before giving or applying medication or ointment to a child or self Before going home (* If gloves are used, hands should be washed immediately after gloves ar e removed . Use of gloves alone will not prevent contamination of hands or spread of germs and should not be considered a substitute for hand washing. Properly dispose of gloves out of reach of children.) Rubbing hands t ogether under running water is the most important part of washing away infectious germs. Pre -moistened wipes and waterless hand sanitizers should not be used as a substitute for washing hands with so ap and running water. Wipes should only be used to remove residue, such as food , off a baby's face or feces from a baby's bottom during diaper changing. Keep hand sanitizers out of reach of children. When running water is unavailable, such as during an outing, wipes or waterless hand sanitizers may be used as a temporary measure until hands can be washed under running water. A chil dcare provider may use a wipe to clean hands while diapering a child who cannot be left alone on a changing table that is not within reach of running water. However, hands should be washed as soon as diapering is completed and child is removed from the changing table. Water basins should not be used as an alternative to running water. If forced to use a water basin as a temporary measure, clean and disinf ect the basin between each use. Outbreaks have been linked with sharing wash water and washbasins. Childcare Manual 20 HHooww ttoo WWaasshh HHaannddss Always use warm, runn ing water and liquid soap. Antibacterial soaps may be used, but are not required. Pre- moistened cleansing wipes do not eff ectively clean hands and should not take the place of handwashing. Wet the hands and apply a small amount of liquid soap to hands. Rub hands together vigorously until a soapy lather appears and continue for at least 15 seconds. Be sure to scrub between fingers, under fingerna ils, and around the tops and palms of the hands. Rinse hands under warm running water. Leave the water running while drying hands. Dry hands with a c lean, disposable towel, being careful to avoid touching the faucet handles or towel holder with clean h ands. Turn the faucet off using the disposable towel as a barrier between your hands and the faucet handle. Discard the used towel in a trash can lined with a fluid -resistant (plastic) bag. Trashcans with foot-pedal operated lids are preferable. Cons ider using hand lotion to prevent chapping of hands. If using lotions, use liquids or tubes that can be squirted so that the hands do not have dir ect contact with container spout. Direct contact with the spout could contaminate the lotion inside the container. When assisting a child with handwashing, either hold t he child or have the child stand on a safety step at a height at which the child's hands can hang freely under the running water. Assist the child in performing all of the above steps and then wash your own hands. Childcare Manual 21 Childcare Manual 22 DDiiaappeerr CChhaannggiinngg SStteeppss Two different diaper- changing methods may be used to minimize the risk of transmitting inf ection from one child to another or to a provider. One method involves the use of gloves and the other does not. The method you select should be used consistently in your childcare setting. Whichever method you choose, you should never wash or rinse diapers or clothes soiled with fecal material in the childcare setting. Because of the risk of splashing, a nd gross contamination of hands, sinks, and bathroom surfaces, rinsing increases the risk that you, other providers, and the children would be exposed to germs that cause inf ection. All soiled clothing should be bagged and sent home with the child without rinsing. (You may dump solid feces into a toilet.) You should educate parents about the importance of this procedure to prevent any misunderstandings . The following procedure notes additional steps to be included when using gloves. Gloves are not requir ed, but some people prefer to use gloves to prevent fecal material from getting under their nails. Childcare providers should keep their fingernails short, groomed, and clean. Using a soft nailbrush to clean under the nails during handwashing will remove s oil under the nails. Recommended procedure for diapering a child : Get Organized - Always keep the diaper changing station stocked with all necessary supplies. o Disposable changing pads to cover changing surface o Fresh diapers o Disposable b aby wipes or pr e-moistened towele ttes o Child's personal, labeled ointment (if provided by parents) o Plastic bag s for soiled clothing o Disposable gloves (if used, put on before touching soiled clothing or diapers and remove before touching clean diapers or surfaces) o Trash d isposal bag Place a disposable changing pad on the diapering table where you will place the child's bottom. Diapering surfaces should be smooth, non- absorbent, and easy to clean. Do not use areas that come in close contact with childre n during play, such as furniture or the floor. If using gloves, put them on now. Lay the child on the changing pad and lift the legs with one hand and place a clean diaper under the bottom with the other . Make sure you have the picture of the new diaper in front and the side with the tabs underneath. Unfasten the soiled diaper and wipe the baby's bottom with the front (inner side) of it as you remove it . (While you don't have to wipe with the old diaper before taking it off, doing so can often remove a significant amount of s tool before you reach for the first baby wipe.) If the diaper isn't overwhelmingly soiled, leaving it folded over on itself but still under the baby's bottom can help prevent the still dirty bottom from getting the new diaper soiled before you have had the chance to clean the baby and also serve to absorb any new urine or stool that may present itself during the uncovered stage of the diaper change. Wipe the baby's bottom and surrounding dirty areas with a disposable baby wipe then remove the soiled diaper along with the soiled wipes. Snugly secure the new diaper (Make sure the front of the diaper is centered between the legs and pulled up to at least the same level in the back that it is in the front ---usually around the level of the belly button; check to see that the tabs are evenly secured in the front so there aren't any gaps around the hips and, finally, to prevent leakage, make sure the fringe around the legs isn't tucked into the diaper's elastic edges.) Childcare Manual 23 Place soiled diapers , wipes and disposable cha nging pad in a covered, lined trash receptacle out of reach of children . Place any soiled clothing, without rinsing, in a plastic bag to give to parents. If you are wearing gloves , remove and dispose of them in the same trash receptacle. Wash your hands and the child's hands. NOTE: The diaper changing station should be next to a sink with running water so that you can wash your hands without leaving the child unattended. However, if a sink is not wit hin reach of the changing station, do not leave the child unattended on the changing station to go to a sink; wipe your hands with a pre-moistened towelette and return the child to a safe area . Never leave a child alone unattended on the changing station . Disinfect the diapering surface immediately after you finish diapering the child. Wash your hands with soap under running water. Childcare Manual 24 FFoooodd SSaaffeettyy aanndd SSaanniittaattiioonn Food safety and sanitation are important asp ects of providing healthy food for children. Improper food preparation, handling, or storage can quickly result in food being contaminated with germs that may lead to illness or diarrheal diseases if the contaminated food is eaten. Cleaning products and foods should always be stored in different locations, out of reach of children. To wash, rinse, and disinf ect dishes by hand : Fill one sink compartment or dishpan with hot tap water and a dishwashing de tergent. Fill the second compartment or dishpan with hot tap water. Fill the third compartment or dishpan with hot tap water and 1 -1/2 tablespoons of liquid chlorine bleach for each gallon of water. Scrape dishes, utensils, and dispose of excess food. Immerse scraped dish or utensil in first sink compartment or dishpan and wash thoroughly. Rinse dish or utensil in second dishpan of clear water. Immerse dish or utensil in third dishpan of chlorinated water for at least 1 minute. Place dish or utensil in rack to air dry. Dishwashers are approved to use for cleaning and sanitation of dishes and utensils. Note: Food preparation and dishwashing sinks should only be used for these activities and should never be used for routine hand washing or d iaper changing activities. Understanding and following a few basic principles can help prevent food spoilage and transmission of inf ections. To prevent foodborne inf ections: Keep food at safe serving and storage temperatures at all times to prevent spoiling and the risk of transmitting disease. Food should be kept at 40F or colder or at 140F or warmer. The range between 40F and 140F is considered the \"danger zone\" when bacteria grow most easily. Leftovers should be refrigerated immediately and should not be left to cool at room temperature. Frozen foods should be thawed in the refrigerator only. Use only approved food preparation equipment. Check childcare licensing regulat ions if in question about equipment. Only use cutting boards that can be disinfected (made of nonporous materials such as glass, Formica, or plastic) and use separate boards for ready -to-eat foods (including foods to be eaten raw) and for foods which are t o be cooked, such as meats. Childcare Manual 25 Use proper handwashing techniques. Proper hand washing is important for everyone in a childcare setting, but is especially necessary for food handlers to prevent the spread of infections or food contamination . In large childcar e setting s, food handlers should not change diapers and should avoid other types of contact that may contaminate their hands with potentially infectious body fluids . This may not be practical in a small childcare setting in which the provider must also pre pare the food. In this case, proper hand washing is essential. Do not prepare or serve food if you have diarrhea, unusually loose stools or other gastrointestinal symptoms of illness, inf ected skin lesions or open cuts. Small, uninf ected cuts may be covere d with nonporous, latex or nitrile gloves. Supervise meal and snack times to make sur e children do not share utensils or food Discard food that is dropped on the floor and remove leftovers from the eating area after each snack or meal. Clean, sanitize, and properly store food service equipment and supplies. Use only utensils and dishes that have been washed in a dishwasher or , if washed by hand, with sanitizers and disinf ectants approved for this use. Otherwise, use disposable, single- use articles that a re discarded after each use. Clean and sanitize t abletops after each use . Numerous institutional outbrea ks of gastrointestinal illness have been linked to consumption of home -prepared foods. Food brought into the childcare setting to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or other special occasions should be obtained from commercial sources approved and inspected by the local health authority. Each individual child's lunch brought from home should be clearly lab eled with the child's name, date, and type of food . It should be stored at an appropriate temperature until it is eaten. Food brought in from a child's home should not be fed to another child. Raw eggs can be contaminated with harmful bacteria . No foods containing raw eggs should be served, including hom emade ice cream made with raw eggs. Childcare Manual 26 BBrreeaasstt MMiillkk aanndd IInnffeeccttiioouuss DDiisseeaassee EExxppoossuurree If a child has been mistakenly f ed another child's bottle of expressed breast milk, the possible exposure to HIV or other infectious diseases should be treated the same as if an accidental exposure to other body fluids occurred. The child care provider should : Inform the mother wh o expressed the breast milk of the bottle switch, and ask: When the breast milk was expressed and how it was handled prior to being delivered to the facility Whether she has ever had an HIV tests and, if so, would she be willing to share the results with the parents of the child given the incorrect milk If she does not know whether she has ever been tested for HIV, would she be willing to contact her physician and find out if she has been tested If she has never been tested for HIV, would she be willing t o have one and share the results with the parents of the other child Inform the parents of the child who was given the wrong bottle: Their child was given another child's bottle of expressed breast milk The risk of transmission of HIV is very sm all (see discussion below) They should notify the ch ild's physician of the exposure and discuss with the physician the need for baseline HIV testing The parents should also be provided with information on when the milk was expressed and how the milk was h andled prior to its being given to the child . The r isk of HIV transmission from expressed breast milk consumed by another child is believed to be low because: In the United States, women who are HIV positive and are aware of th at fact are advised NOT to breast feed their infants. Chemicals present in breast milk act , together with time and cold temperatures, to destroy the HIV present in expressed breast milk. Transmission of HIV from a single breast milk exposure has never bee n documented Childcare Manual 27 PPrrooppeerr HHaannddlliinngg aanndd SSttoorraaggee ooff BBrreeaasstt MMiillkk By following safe preparation and storage techniques, nursing mothers and childcare providers o f breastfed infants can maintain the high quality of expressed breast milk and the health of the baby. Safe preparation and storage of expressed breast milk: Wash hands before handling breast milk Milk should be stored in clean containers such as screw cap bottles, hard plastic cups or heavy -duty bags that fit directly into feeding bottles. Avoid plastic storage bags as they can easily leak. All breast milk delivered to the childcare setting must be cle arly labeled with the child's name and date. Additionally, the date the milk was expressed should be included. Do not add milk or formula to already frozen milk. It is best not to mix the two. Do not save milk from a used bottle for use at another feeding. Safely thawing breast milk: Thaw frozen break milk by transferring it to the refrigerator for thawing or by swirling it in a bowl of warm water. Avoid using a microwave oven to thaw or heat bottle of breast milk Do not re- freeze breast milk once it has been thawed. Childcare Manual 28 AAnniimmaallss && PPeettss iinn tthhee CChhiillddccaarree SSeettttiinngg Many childcare providers who care for children in their homes have pets. Pets can be excellent companions for children and provide important opportunities for entertainment and learning . However , some guidelines for protecting the health and safety of the children should be followed. Delaware childcare licensing allows pets if there is proof of rabies vaccination from each dog or cat 6 -months or older. Animals must be free from disease an d must be cared for in a safe and sanitary manner. Rept iles (i.e., turtles, snakes, lizards) carry Salmonella germs and are not appropriate pets for childcare centers and should never be present in a childcare facility. Amphibians (i.e., frogs, toads, salama nders, newts) can also carry Salmonella germs . No child in a childcare facility should have direct contact with amphibians. Baby poultry (i.e., chicks, ducklings, goslings) are not appropriate pets for childcare centers and should never be present in a childcare facility. Farm animals are not appropriate pets for childcare centers and should never be present in a childcare facility. Ferrets - children in childcare facilities should not have direct contact with ferrets. Other animals not recommended in childcare settings: Inherently dangerous animals (i.e., lions, tigers, cougars, bears) Nonhuman primates (i.e., monkeys, apes) Mammals at high risk for transmitting rabies (i.e., bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes) Stray animals with unknown health and vaccinat ion history Venomous or toxin -producing spiders, insects, reptiles and amphibians. Pets that are generally allowed in childcare settings include, fish, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, domestic- bred rats, domestic- bred mice, rabbits, dogs, cats and some bi rds. However, the following guidelines should be observed: All children and staff should wash hands after contact with pets/animals, animal products or feed or animal environments . All contact with pets/animals must be strictly supervised. Designate specific areas for animal contact. Do not allow food in animal contact areas; do not allow pets/animals in areas where food and drink are prepared or consumed. Clean and disinfect all areas where pets/animals have been present. Children should not perform this task. Do not clean animal cages or enclosures in sinks or other areas used to prepare food or drink. All pet/animal waste should be disposed of immediately. Litter boxes should not be accessible to children. All pets, whether kept indoors or outdoors, should be in good health, show no evidence of disease, and be friendly toward children. Childcare Manual 29 Dogs, cats and ferrets should have d ocumented proof of rabies vaccination and certificate of veterinary inspection. All pets/animals should be kept clean and free of inte stinal parasites, fleas, ticks, mites and lice. Parents should be informed of the benefits and potential risks associated with pets/animals in childcare settings. Consult with parents to determine special considerations needed for children who are immunoco mpromised, have allergies or have asthma AAnniimmaall BBiitteess Any child bitten or scratched by a pet or animal is at risk for a bacterial infection. A child's parent should be notified and referred for medical evaluation no matter how minor the injury may appea r. The healthcare provider will want to assure the child has been adequately immunized against tetanus. The child may also require supplemental vaccination to prevent rabies. ALL bites from mammals are required to be promptly reported to the Delaware Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, 302 -744-1070 or 866 -972-9705 .

Childcare Manual 31 HHeeaalltthh RRiisskkss ffoorr PPrreeggnnaanntt CChhiillddccaarree PPrroovviiddeerrss Knowing your health history is especially important if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are providing childcare. Several childhood diseases can be harmful to the unborn child of a pregnant woman who may be exposed . Chickenpox or Shingles (Varicella Virus) Exposure to the Varicella virus during pregnancy may cause miscarriage, multiple birth def ects, and severe disease in newborns. Chickenpox can be a serious illness in adults. Most people (90% to 95% of adults) were exposed to chickenpox as children and are immune. For women who do not know if they had chickenpox as a child, a blood test can verify if they are immune. If they are not immune, a chickenpox vaccine is now available. Vaccination against chickenpox before y ou get pregnant may reduce the risk of passing the virus to your fetus should you become pregnant in the future and then are exposed to chickenpox. Because the vaccine may harm a fetus, the vaccine is not given to pregnant wo men. Your physician will assure you are not pregnant before giving you the vaccination and will advise you to avoid pregnancy for one month following each dose of vaccine. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Exposure to CMV during pregnancy may cause hearing loss, seizures, mental disability , deafn ess, and/or blindness in the newborn. In the United States, cytomegalovirus is a common inf ection passed from mother to child at birth. Providers who care for children less than 2 years of age are at increased risk of exposure to CMV. Most people , and 40% to 70% of women of childbearing age , have been exposed to CMV and are immune. There is no licensed vaccine against CMV. Fifth Disease (Parvovirus B19 or Slapped Cheek Disease) Exposure to fifth disease is usually not a problem for pregnant women and their babies. About 50% of pregnant women are immune to Parvovirus B19 so these women and their babies are usually protected from getting the virus and fifth disease. Pregnant women who are not immune usually do not have serious complica tions after they are exposed to others with fifth disease. They usually have only mild illness and their babies usually do not have any problems. However, sometimes a baby will develop severe anemia and the woman may have a miscarriage ---but this is uncomm on and occurs in less than 5% of all infected pregnant women. Pregnant women exposed to fifth disease are encouraged to discuss the matter with their healthcare provider. Rubella (German or 3 -day measles) Exposure to rubella during the first three months of pregnancy may cause fetal deafness, cataracts, heart damage, mental retardation, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Rubella can also be a severe illness in adults. Everyone who works in a childcare facility should have proof of immunity to rubella on file at t he facility. Childcare providers can be considered immune only if (a) they have had a blood test for rubella antibodies and the laboratory report shows antibodies or, (b) they have been vaccinated against rubella on or after their first birthday. Providers who are not immune should be vaccinated. Because it is not known whether the vaccine may harm a fetus, a woman should not be vaccinated if she is pregnant. After vaccination, a woman sho uld avoid getting pregnant for three months.

If ma naged correctly, permanent teeth can often be replanted. If tooth avulsion occurs in the childcare facility: Try to keep the individual calm and contact the parent for emergency dental treatment. If possible, find the tooth and pick it up by the crown (wh ite part). Avoid touching the root. If the root is dirty, wash it briefly (10 seconds) under cold running water and try to reposition it. The individual can bite on a handkerchief or similar material to hold it in position. If repositioning is not possible, place the tooth in a glass of milk or have the individual spit in a clean container and place the tooth in it. Do not store in water. o Adults can hold the tooth in their mouth, between the molars and the inside of the cheek. This should not be encouraged for young children due to the risk of swallowing the tooth.

It is one of the most common long -term diseases of children, but adults can have asthma too. Asthma causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing at night or in the early morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have as thma attacks only when something bothers (triggers) your lungs. In most cases, the cause of asthma is unknown. There is no known cure for asthma but medications are available to help control the symptoms. An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. The attack happens in the airways that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller. During an attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrin k. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs the airways even more. Attacks can also be triggered by expo sure to tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergens, pets, mold, smoke, infections (i.e. , influenza, colds), physical exercise, high humidity, foods, fragrances, stress and a host of others. As with any child having a chronic condition, the childcare provider and parents should discuss specific needs of the child and whether they can be suff iciently met by the provider. Asthma can be controlled by: Taking your medication exactly as prescribed Avoiding known attack triggers The childcare provider should be given clear instructions on how and when to administer all medication as well as the name and telephone number of the child's healthcare provider . The childcare provider should be provided with , and keep on file, an asthma action plan for each child with asthma. An asthma action plan lists emergency information, activities or conditions likely to trigger an asthma a ttack, current medications taken, medications to be administered by the childcare provider, and steps to be followed if the child has an attack. If a child with asthma has an attack : Stop the child's activity and, if known, remove whatever is causing allergic reaction or move the child to another location Calm the child; give prescribed rescue medication as ordered Contact the parents If the child does not improve quickly or experiences any difficulty breathing and the parent s are unav ailable, call 911. Record the asthma attack in the child's file. Describe the symptoms, how the child acted during the attack, what medicine was given, and what caused the attack, if known. Childcare Manual 39 Baby Bottle Tooth Decay and Oral Health in the Childcare Setting Although the responsibility for a child's oral health rests with parents, childcare providers play an important role in maintaining the oral health of children in childcare settings. Knowing a few basic oral health guidelines can greatly help a childcare provider's ability to do so. Although tooth decay is not as common as it used to be, it is still one of the most common diseases in children. Many children still get cavities. While fluoridated drinking water and fluoride- containing toothp aste have helped to improve the oral health of both children and adults, regular tooth brushing and a well -balanced diet are still very important to maintain good oral health. Primary, or baby, teeth commonly begin to come in or erupt in a baby's mouth at about 4 to 6 months of age and continue until all 20 have come in at about the age of 2- 1/2 years. This eruption of primary teeth, or teething, can cause sore and tender gums that appear red and puffy. To relieve the soreness, give the baby a cold teethin g ring or washcloth to chew on. Teething medicine is not recommended. Many primary teeth will not be replaced by permanent teeth for 10 to 12 years. Until that time, they need to be kept healthy to enable a child to chew food, speak, and have an attractiv e smile. Primary teeth are at risk for decay soon after they erupt. Tooth decay is caused by germs (bacteria) and sugars from food or liquids building up on a tooth. Over time, these bacteria dissolve the enamel, or outer layer, of the tooth. This damaged area is called a cavity. Regular brushing prevents the build -up of bacteria and sugars and the damage they cause. Baby bottle tooth decay (or nursing bottle mouth) is a leading dental problem for children under 3 years of age. Baby bottle tooth decay occu rs when a child's teeth are exposed to sugary liquids, such as formula, fruit juices, and other sweetened liquids for a continuous or extended period of time. The practice of putting a baby to bed with a bottle, which the baby can suck on for hours, is the major cause of this dental condition. The sugary liquid flows over the baby's upper front teeth and dissolves the enamel, causing decay that can lead to inf ection. The longer the practice continues, the greater the damage to the baby's teeth and mouth. Tr eatment is very expensive. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry has developed the following guidelines for preventing baby bottle tooth decay: Do not allow a child to fall asleep with a bottle containing milk, formula, fruit juices, or other sweet liquids. Never let a child walk with a bottle in her mouth. Comfort a child who wants a bottle between regular feedings or during naps with a bottle filled with cool water. Always make sure a child's pacifier is clean and never dip a pacifier in a sweet liquid. Introduce children to a cup as they approach 1 year of age. Children should stop drinking from a bottle soon after their first birthday. Notify the parent of any unusual red or swollen areas in a child's mouth or any dark spot on a child's tooth so that the parent can consult the child's dentist. Childcare Manual 40 Bacterial Meningitis in the Child care Setting Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The cause of this inflammation is inf ection with bacteria, viruses or other germs . Meningitis caused by a bacterial inf ection (sometimes called bacterial or spinal meningitis) is one of the most serious types, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage or even death. Bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by bacteria These bacteria are carried in the upper back part of the throat (called the nasopharynx) of an inf ected person and are spread either through the air (when the person coughs or sneezes organisms into the air) or by direct contact with secretions from the nasopharynx of the inf ected person. However, transmission usually occurs only after very close contact with the inf ected person. Symptoms of bacterial meningitis include: Sudden onset of fever Headache Neck pain or stiffness Vomiting (often without abdominal complaints) Irritability These symptoms may quickly progress to decreased level of consciousness (difficulty in being arouse d), convulsions (seizures) , and death . For this reason, if any child displays symptom s of possible meningitis, s/ he should receive immediate medical care . Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenza serotype b (Hib) can be prevented with the Hib vaccine, which is part of routine childhood immunizations. Therefore, this type of meningitis is very rare. Some cases of meningococcal meningitis can also be prevented by vaccine. However, this vaccine is not included with routine childhood immunizations and is r eserved for high risk groups and children with certain types of compromise to their immune systems . Children with bacterial meningitis are usually hospitalized. Providers are often told only that the child has meningitis and may not know the exact type. If a child or adult in your childcare, facility is diagnosed with bacterial meningitis: Contact Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1- 888-295-5156 to verify the type of meningitis involved. Epidemiology will follow -up and notify you of any special infection control measures for your facility and whether there are any exclusion/return recommendations. Childcare Manual 41 Biting Incidents Biting can be a common occurrence in the childcare or school setting. The risk of hepatiti s B virus (HBV) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission from a bite is extremely low for both the child who was bitten and the child who did the biting. The extremely low risk of transmission is related to the difficulty of transmitting the viru s by biting. In addition, all infants are now vaccinated against the HBV. Additionally, the prevalence of HBV carriers among preschool children (3 -5 year olds) is considered low. Policies and procedures should be in place before the incident occurs in order to ensure proper communication with the parents. When a biting occurs between two children, the following activities should be considered : Determine the significance of the bite (skin breakage, presence of open wound or puncture wound). Provide immediat e first aid to the bite wound. Inform parents of both children of the biting incident. If the bite was significant, encourage the parents to co nsult with their primary health care provider about any follow -up care . The names of the children should be kept c onfidential. However, in the event that relevant health/medical information is known for either child involved in the incident, parental consent to release information to the other parent must be obtained. Childcare policies should be written to address th ese situations. Reasons for consulting with the health care provider include : Human bites may cause local inf ection. The provider will need to confirm that the bitten child is current with tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (DPT) immunization. It is unlikely th at the bite will be the source of transmission for a communicable disease like HBV or HIV, therefore follow -up blood testing for the biting child or the child who was bitten is not usually recommended. However, each situation must be evaluated individually . Document the incident as established by policy. Parents and childcare providers should address the biting behaviors so measures can be taken to prevent further incidents. A child who is HBV or HIV positive and who continues to bite should be assessed by a team of medical experts to determine whether the child can safely remain in the childcare or school setting. Childcare Manual 42 Campylobacter Infections in the Child care Setting Campylobacter infections are caused by a group of bacteria which are found in many different birds and mammals. Most people who become ill with campylobacteriosis get diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within two to five day s after exposure to the germ . The diarrhea may be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness typically lasts one week. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms. In persons with compromised immune systems, Campylobacter occasionally spreads to the bloodstream and causes a serious life- threatening infection. Persons often become inf ected when they eat or drink foods or liquids contaminated with feces of infected animals. Similar exposure to human feces, especially from diapered children, may promote transmission in childcare settings. Many people become inf ected from eating poorly cooked meats, especially poultry. Waterborne inf ections result from drinking water from contami nated wells, springs or streams. Although outbreaks of campylobacter diarrhea have been reported from childcare facilities, these are rare and childcare providers are more likely to encounter only occasional single cases . To prevent Campylobacter infections in your facility : Make sure that all meats, especially poultry, are cooked completely before serving. Take care to avoid contaminating foods that will no t be cooked with juice from raw meats and poultry. Practice good hygiene, especially careful hand washing after handling pets and cleaning their cages or pens. Isolate animals with diar rhea from children and take the animals to a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. However, these bacteria may also be present in feces of apparently healthy pets. Exclude child until 48 hours of eff ective therapy or until diarrhea resolves, whichever is shorter. Although Campylobacter may be present in the feces for a few weeks after diarrhea has ceased, transmission is believed less likely than during the diarrhea l phase . Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1- 888-295-5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Campylobacter . This infection is reportable . Childcare Manual 43 Chickenpox in the Child care Setting Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus. Most children in the United States experience chic kenpox before they are school- aged. A vaccine against chickenpox is available. Although chickenpox is not a serious disease for most children, those whose immune systems are impaired (i.e., newborns and persons who are on chemotherapy for cancer, have AIDS , or take steroids like cortisone or prednisone) may experience severe disease, or even death . Chickenpox can also cause severe health problems in pregnant women and their babies , including stillbirths or birth def ects, and can be spread to babies during c hildbirth. Occasionally chickenpox can cause serious, life -threatening , illnesses such as encephalitis or pneumonia, especially in adults. Chickenpox usually begins as an itchy rash of small red bumps on the scalp that spreads to the stomach or back befo re spreading to the face. However, this pattern can vary from person to person. Chickenpox is spread person -to-person when a non- immune person is exposed to respiratory secretions (i.e., those produced by coughing or sneezing ) or dir ectly from fluid from t he open pox lesions of an inf ected person. The disease is so contagious in its early stages that an exposed person who is not immune to the virus has a 70% to 80% chance of contracting the disease. An infected person may show no symptoms at the beginning o f the disease or may have mild symptoms that might be mistaken for a common cold After inf ection, the virus stays in the body for life. Although people cannot get chickenpox twice, this same virus causes \"shingles\" or herpes zoster. An adult with shingles can spread the virus to another adult or child who has not had chickenpox and the susceptible person can then develop chickenpox. However, persons who had chickenpox previously and are exposed outside childcare are unlikely to bring the inf ection to child care unless they become ill. If an adult or child develops chickenpox in the childcare setting: Temporarily exclude the sick child or adult from the center until all lesions have crusted or scabbed . Notify all staff members and parents that a case of ch ickenpox has occurred. Urge anyone who has an impaired immune system or who might be pregnant to con sult their healthcare provider . Contact the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 for further information and to report the case . If a case of shingles occurs in the childcare setting: The inf ected person should cover any lesions. If that is not possible, the person should be excluded from the childcare setting until the lesions crust over. Note: Children w ho have received the chickenpox vaccine may experience mild symptoms lasting a few days. However, the exclusion guidelines outlined above should still be enforced. Childcare Manual 44 Cold Sores in the Child care Setting Cold sores are usually caused by herpes sim plex virus type 1 . Children often become inf ected with this virus in early childhood and many have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include fever, runny nose, and painful lesions (fever blisters or cold sores) on the lips or in the mouth. The blisters or cold sores usually form scabs and heal within a few days. Cold sores are spread by dir ect contact with the lesions or saliva of an inf ected person. Spreading the virus within families is common. To prevent the spread of herpes simplex virus in the childcare setting: Make sure all children and adults in the facility use good handwashing practices. Do not allow children to share toys th at can be put in their mouths. The v irus may be present even though sore s are absent or not noticeable. After a child has mouthed a toy, remove it from the play area and put it in a bin for toys to be disinf ected at day's end. Only exclude a child with open blisters or mouth sores if the child is a biter, drools uncontrollably, or mouths toys that other chil dren may in turn put in their mouths. Do not kiss the child or allow the child to kiss others where dir ect contact with the sore may occur. Use gloves if applying medicated ointment to the sore. Childcare Manual 45 The Common Cold in the Child care Setting The common cold is caused by many different types of viruses . Usual symptoms can include sore throat , runny nose and watering eyes, sneezing, chills, and a general achiness. Colds may be spread when a well person breathes in germs that an inf ected person has coughed, sneezed, or breathed into the air or when a well person comes in dir ect contact with secretions from the n ose, mouth, or throat of an inf ected person. To prevent the spread of colds : Make sure that all childr en and adults use good handwashing practices. Clean and disinf ect all common surfaces and toys on a daily basis. (See s ection on \"Cleaning and Disinf ection\"). Make sure the childcare facility is well ventilated, either by opening windows or doors or by using a ventilation system to periodically exchange the air inside the childcare facility. Properly dispose of used tissues out of reach of small children. Teach children to cover coughs in the elbows and wipe noses using disposable tissues in a way that secretions are contained by the tissues and do not get on their hands. Children should be referred to see a healthcare provider if they have : Temperature higher than 100.4\u00b0 F Symptoms lasting more than 10 days Symptoms that are not relieved by over -the-counter medicines Excluding children with mild respiratory inf ections, including colds, is generally not recommended as long as the child can participate comfortably and does not require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of other children. Such exclusion is of little benefit since viruses are likely to be spread even before symptoms have appeared . Childcare Manual 46 Cryptosporidiosis in the Childcare Setting Cryptosporidiosis is an inf ectious diarrheal disease caused by the Cr yptosporidium parasite. Cryptosporidiosis is a common cause of diarrhea in children, especially those in childcare settings. Symptoms usually include watery diarrhea and cramping , but can also include nausea and vomiting, general ill feeling, and fever. Healthy people who contract cryptosporidiosis almost always get better without any specific treatment. Symptoms can come and go for up to 30 days, but usually subside in less. However, cryptosporidiosis can cause severe illness in persons with compromised im mune systems, such as those with HIV inf ection or those taking immunosuppressive drugs. Cryptosporidiosis is spread through fecal -oral transmission by feces of an inf ected person or an object that has been contaminated with the inf ected person's feces. I nfection can also occur if someone ingests contaminated food or wate r. While this parasite can be spread in several different ways, water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common method of transmission. Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in ch ildcare settings are most common during late summer/early fall but may occur at any time. The spread is highest among children who are not toilet -trained, and higher among toddlers than infants, probably due to the toddlers' increased movement and interact ion with other children. For childcare providers, the risk is greatest for those who change diapers. Cryptosporidium is tougher to kill than most disease- causing organisms. The usual disinf ectants, including most commonly used bleach solutions, have litt le eff ect on the Cryptosporidium parasite. An application of a 3% concentration of hydrogen peroxide seems to be the best choice for disinf ection during an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the childcare setting. If an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurs in the childcare setting: Contact the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156. Cryptosporidiosis is reportable. Health officials may require negative stool cultures from the infected child before allowing return to the childcare setting. Exclude any child or adult with diarrhea until the diarrhea has ceased or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Make sure everyone in the childcare setting practices good handwashing tech nique. Wash your hands aft er using the toilet, after help ing a child use the toilet, after diapering a child and before preparing or serving food. Note: In larger facilities, when staffing permits, people who change diapers should not prepare or serve food. Have children wash thei r hands upon arrival at your childcare facility, after using the toilet, after having their diapers changed (adult 's should wash infant s or small child 's hands), and before eating snacks or meals. Disinf ect toys, bathrooms, and food preparation surfaces daily or when visibly soiled . Make sure children wear clothing over their diapers to reduce the opportunity for diarrheal leakage. Childcare Manual 47 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Child care Setting Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus with which most people eventually become inf ected. Children and staff in the childcare setting are especially likely to be inf ected. Children usually have no symptoms when they become inf ected with CMV. Occasionally, old er children in childcare develop an illness similar t o mononucleosis, with a fever, sore throat, enlarged liver, and general ill feeling . However, there is no reason to exclude a child with CMV from childcare. CMV is spread from person to person by direct contact with body fluids such as blood, urine, or saliva. Thus, it may be spread through intimate contact such as in diaper changing, kissing, feeding, bathing, and other activities where a healthy person is exposed to the urine or saliva of an infected person. CMV can also be passed from a mother to a child before birth. Congenital inf ection with CMV can cause hearing loss, mental retardation, and other birth def ects. Since the greatest risk of damage to a fetus occurs during a woman's first inf ection with CMV, women who have never been inf ected with CMV are at risk of delivering an infant with CMV disease if they become infected during pregnancy. Childcare providers who are , or may become pregnant should be carefully counseled about the potential risks to a developing fetus due to exposure to cytomegalov irus. Female childcare providers who expect to become pregnant should : Be tested for antibodies to CMV. If test shows no evidence of previous CMV inf ection, reduce contact with inf ected children by working, at least temporarily, with children age 2 y ears or older, among whom there is less virus circulation. Carefully wash hands with warm water and soap after each diaper change and contact with children's saliva. Avoid contact with children's saliva by not kissing children on the lips and by not pl acing children's hands, fingers, toys, and other saliva -laden obj ects in their own mouths. Note: Contact with children that does not involve exposure to saliva or urine poses no risk to a mother or childcare provider and should not be avoided out of fea r of potential infection with CMV. Childcare Manual 48 Diarrheal Diseases in the Child care Setting Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of different germs, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, children can sometimes have diarrhea without ha ving an inf ection, such as when diarrhea is caused by food allergies or from taking medicines such as antibiotics. A child should be considered to have diarrhea when the child's bowel movements are both more frequent than usual and more watery than usual. Children with diarrhea may have additional symptoms includin g nausea, vomiting, cramps , headache, or fever. Exclude any child or adult with diarrhea until the diarrhea has ceased or as directed by the Division of Public Health Diarrhea is spread from person to person when a person touches the stool of an inf ected person or an obj ect contaminated with the stool of an inf ected person and then ingests the germs, usually by touching the mouth with a contaminated hand. Diarrhe a can also be spread by contaminated food. Children in diapers and childcare providers who change their diapers have an increased risk of diarrheal diseases. To prevent diarrheal diseases from spreading in the childcare setting: Make sure that everyone in the childcare setting practices good handwashing technique. Wash your hands after using the toilet, help ing a child use the toilet, diapering a child and before preparing, serving, or eating food. Have children wash their hands upon arriv al at your childcare facility, after using the toilet, after having their diapers changed (adult s should wash infant s and small children's hands), and before eating snacks or meals. Disinf ect toys, bathrooms, and food preparation surfaces daily and when v isibly soiled . Use disposable paper towels for handwashing. Use disposable table liners on changing tables and disinf ect tables after each use. If possible, the person who prepares and/or serves food should not change diapers. If possible, diapered chi ldren should be cared for by different caregivers in a room separate from toilet -trained children. Use diapers with waterproof outer covers that can contain liquid stool or urine, or use plastic pants. Make sure children always wear clothes over diapers. Wear gloves according to center protocol. Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 if you learn that a child in your care has diarrhea due to Shigella , Campylobacter, Salmonella, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Hepatitis A, or Escherichia (E). coli . A healthcare provider should see any child with prolonged, severe diarrhea or diarrhea with fever, or a known exposure to someone with inf ectious diarrhea. Childcare Manual 49 Diphtheria in the Child care Setting Diphtheria is a disease caused by bacteria, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which invades the throat. Symptoms usually start like a common cold, characterized by a runny nose , which may become blood tinged, sore throat and tonsil litis but can progress and become life threatening . Fever is not usually high. Diphtheria is usually spread through the airborne route or by contact with saliva or nasal secretions of an inf ected person. Up -to-date vaccination with the DPT (diphtheria is the \"D\") vaccine can prevent this very serious, life -threatening disease. Because almost all children are vaccinated, diphtheria is now extremely rare in the United States. However, some children are not adequately vaccinated and cases still can occur. To prevent the spread in a childcare setting: Review immunization records of all children upon admission and periodically thereafter. Any child whose immunizations are incomplete or not up -to-date should be referr ed to the health department or the child's physician for proper immunization. Exclude an inf ected child as directed by the Division of Public Health. N egative culture s are required before the child can return. Upon notification by a parent or healthcare worker that a child who attends the childcare setting has been diagnosed with diphtheria, immediately contact the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 for instructions on preventive m easures to be taken . Childcare Manual 50 Earache and Ear Infection (Otitis Media) in the Child care Setting An earache or ear inf ection (otitis media) is usually a complication of an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold . Otitis media usually occurs in children under three years of age. Symptoms are caused by inflammation of the middle ear, often with fluid building up behind the eardrum. The child may cry persistently, tug at the ear, have a fever, and be irritable . Thes e symptoms may sometimes be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Otitis media is common in young children whether they attend childcare or are cared for at home. However, some children appear to be more susceptible to otitis media than other children . Otitis media is not contagious, but the upper respiratory illnesses that can lea d to otitis media are contagious . Upper respiratory inf ections are spread when one person is exposed to the respiratory secretions of an inf ected person, which have contaminated the air or an obj ect. Otitis media is often treated with antibiotics. Some doctors give children daily antibiotics to prevent otitis media in children who have had repeat cases. Some children with chronic inf ections may require an operation to insert a tube to drain the fluid from the ear. A child with an earache does not need to be excluded from the childcare setting unless the child is too ill to participate in normal activities or needs more car e than the provider can give without compromising the care given to the other children. To help prevent upper respiratory infections which may lead to otitis media: Teach children to cover their mouths with a tissue or their elbow when they cough and blow their noses with disposable tissues. Only use a tissue once and then immediately throw it away. Do not allow children to share toys that they put in their mouths. After a child has discarded a toy that was put in the mouth, pick it up and put it in a bin for dirty toys that is out of reach of the children. Wash and disinf ect these toys before allowing children to play with them again. Make sure all children and adults use good hand washing practices. Cross sect ion of the middle ear showing middle ear fluid Childcare Manual 51 E. coli O157:H7 inf ections in the Child care Setting Escherichia (E.) coli bacteria are found in the digestive tracts of most healthy humans and many animals. Usually, these inf ections are harmless and may even be beneficial. Not all E. coli are alike and, in a few cases, illness may result from inf ection with particular strains. One strain, E.coli O157:H7 causes one of the most serious digestive tract inf ections in the United States. Some persons inf ected with this strain may have very mild illness while others develop severe bloody diarrhea. In some instances, inf ection may result in a complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome in which there is breakdown of red blood cells and kidney failure . This complication can be life- threatening. Infections with E.coli O157:H7 are often the result of eating underc ooked meat (especially ground beef), fresh produce or drinking unpasteurize d milk or apple juice . Spread can also occur person to person due to inadequate handwashing. To prevent the spread of E. coli O157:H7 in your childcare facility: Practice good hygi ene and careful handwashing. Make sure meat, especially hamburger, served in childcare facilities are cooked until well done. Exclude infected individuals from childcare until two stool cultures (obtained at least 1 day apart) have tested negative for E. coli 0157:H7 or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Request that parents take any child with bloody diarrhea to a physician for evaluation. Notify th e Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888- 295-5156 of any child with bloody diarrhea known to be caused by E. coli 0157:H7. Childcare Manual 52 Fifth Disease in the Child care Setting Fifth disease, also called Erythema I nfect iosum or \"slapped cheek disease,\" is an infection caused by parvovirus B19. Outbreaks most often occur in winter and spring, but a person may become ill with fifth dis ease at any time of the year. Symptoms begin with a mild fever and complaints of tiredness . After a few days, the cheeks take on a flushed appearance that looks like the face has been slapped. There may also be a lacy rash on the trunk, arms, and legs. Not all infected persons develop a rash. It is more common in children than adults. A person usually gets sick within 4 to 14 days (sometimes up to 20 days) after getting infected with parvovirus B19. About 20% of children and adults who get infected with thi s virus will not have any symptoms. Most persons who get fifth disease are not very ill and recover without any serious consequences. However, children with sickle cell anemia, chronic anemia, or an impaired immune system may become seriously ill when infected with parvovirus B19 and may require medical care. If a pregnant woman becomes infected with parvovirus B19, the fetus may suffer damage, including the possibility of stillbirth. The woman herself may have no symptoms may have a mil d illness with rash or joint pains. Fifth disease is believed to be spread through direct contact or by breathing in respiratory secretions from an infected person. The period of infectiousness is before the onset of the rash. Once the rash appears, a person is no longer contagious. Therefore, a child who has been diagnosed with fifth disease need not be excluded from childcare. If an outbreak of fifth disease occurs in the childcare setting : Notify all parents. Pregnant women and par ents of children who have an impaired immune system, sickle cell anemia, or other blood disorders may want to consult their physicians. Make sure that all children and adults use good handwashing techniques. Childcare Manual 53 Foodborne Illnesses in the Child care Setting Food safety and s anitation are important aspects of providing healthy food for children. Improper food preparation, handling, or storage can quickly result in food being contaminated with germs that may lead to illness such as hepatitis A or diarrheal diseases if the conta minated food is eaten. Understanding and following a few basic principles can help prevent food spoilage and transmission of infections. To prevent foodborne infections: Keep food at safe serving and storage temperatures at all times to prevent spoiling and the risk of transmitting diseas e. Food should be kept at 40F or colder or at 140F or warmer. The range between 40F and 140F is considered the \"danger zone\" because within this range bacteria grow most easily. Leftovers, including hot foods such as soups or sauces, should be refriger ated immediately and should not be left to cool at room temperature. Using shallow pans or bowls will facilitate rapid cooling. Frozen foods should be thawed in the refrigerator, not on counter tops, or in the sink with cold water, not hot or warm water. Use only approved food preparation equipment, dishes, and utensils. Check childcare licensing regulations if in question about equipment. Only use cutting boards that can be disinfected (made of nonporous materials such as glass, Formica, or plastic), and use separate boards for ready -to-eat foods (including foods to be eaten raw) and for foods which are to be cooked, such as meats. Use proper handwashing techniques. Proper hand washing is im portant for everyone in a child care setting, but is especially nec essary for food handlers to prevent the spread of infections or contamination of the food. Do not handle food if you change diapers. In a large childcare setting, food handlers should not change diapers and should avoid other types of contact that may con taminate their hands with infectious secretions. This may not be practical in a small childcare setting in which the provider must also prepare the food. In this case, proper hand washing is essential. Do not prepare or serve food if you have diarrhea, unusually loose stools, or any other gastrointestinal symptoms of an illness, or if you have infected skin sores or injuries, or open cuts. Small, uninfected cuts may be covered with nonporous, latex gloves. Supervise meal and snack times to make sure children do not share plates, utensils, or food that is not individually wrapped. Eating utensils that are dropped on the floor should be washed with soap and water before using. Discard food dropped on the floor and remove leftovers from eating areas after ea ch snack or meal. Clean, sanitize, and properly store food service equipment and supplies. Use only utensils and dishes that have been washed in a dishwasher or, if washed by hand, with sanitizers and disinfectants approved for this use. Otherwise, use disposable, single- use articles that are discarded after each use. Clean and sanitize table tops on which food is served after each use . Only accept expressed breast milk that is fresh and properly labeled with the child's name. Expresse d breast milk to be used during the current shift should accompany the child that day. Do not store breast milk at the facility overnight. Send any unused expressed breast milk home with the child that day. NEVER feed a child breast milk unless it is label ed with that child's name. Childcare Manual 54 Except for an individual child's lunch, only accept food that is commercially prepared to be brought into the childcare setting. Numerous institutional outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, including infectious hepatitis, have been linked to consumption of home- prepared foods. Food brought into the childcare setting to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or other special occasions should be obtained from commercial sources approved a nd inspected by the Division of Public Health . Each individual child's lunch brought from home should be clearly labeled with the child's name, the date, and the type of food it is. It should be stored at an appropriate temperature until it is eaten. Food brought from a child's home should not be fed to another child. Raw eggs can be contaminated with Salmonella. No foods containing raw eggs should be served, including homemade ice cream made with raw eggs. Childcare Manual 55 Giardiasis in the Child care Setting Giardiasis is a diarrheal illness caused by a parasite, Giardia lamblia . Many children inf ected with Giardia have no symptoms. Other children may have foul -smelling, gr easy diarrhea, gas, cramps , fatigue, and weight loss. Giardia can easily be spread in the child's home and parents and siblings may become inf ected. Giardia is spread from person to person when a person touches the stool or an obj ect which has been contaminated by the stool of an inf ected person and the person then ingests the germs. Infection is often spread by not properly washing hands after bowel movements, af ter changing diapers, or before preparing foods. Giardia may also be transmitted through contaminated water, such as in water play tables. Outbreaks have also been linked to portable wading pools and contaminated water supplies. To pr event the spread of giardiasis in your childcare facility: Exclude any child or adult with acute diarrhea or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Make sure that all children and adults practice good handwashing technique. In a large childcare facility, the person preparing food should not change diapers. In a small childcare facility, the childcare provider should carefully wash hands after changing diapers and before handling foods. If possib le, keep diapered children separated from toilet -trained children. Wash and disinf ect toys that can be put in a child's mouth after each child's use and when visibly soiled . Make sure diapers have waterproof outer covers or use plastic pants. Children shoul d wear clothes over diapers. Do not use portable wading pools. Wash children's hands before they use water play tables. Note: Notify th e Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Giardia . This inf ection is reportable. Childcare Manual 56 Hand -Foot -and-Mouth Disease (Coxsackie A) in the Child care Setting Hand -foot-and-mouth disease is a common childhood illness caused by Coxsac kievirus A16. In many people, inf ection with the virus causes mild or no symptoms. In others, inf ection may result in painful blisters in the mouth, on the gums and tongue, on the palms and fingers of the hand, or on the soles of the feet. The fluid in the se blisters contains the virus, and symptoms may last for 7 to 10 days. The inf ection usually goes away without any serious complications. Hand -foot-and-mouth disease can be spread when the virus present in the blisters is passed to another person. The virus can be passed through saliva from blisters in the mouth, through the fluid from blisters on the hands and feet, or through the inf ected person's feces. Outbreaks in childcare facilities usually coincide with a n increased number of cases in the community. If an outbreak occurs in the childcare setting: Make sure that all children and adults use good handwashing technique. Do not exclude ill persons because exclusion may not prevent additional cases since the virus may be excreted for weeks after the symptoms have disappeared. In addition, some persons excreting the virus may have no symptoms. However, some benefit may be gained by excluding children who have blisters in their mouths and drool or who have weeping lesions on their hands. Childcare Manual 57 Head Lice in the Child care Setting Head lice are tiny ins ects that live primarily on the head and scalp. They should not be confused with body lice, which may be found in clothing and bedding as well as on the body, or crab lice that infest the pubic area. Head lice are found only on humans and should not be confused with fleas, which may be found on dogs, cats, and other pets. Infestation with head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment. Although small, adult head lice may be seen with the naked eye. Because lice move rapidly and only a few may be present, using a hand lens or magnifying glass may allow them to be seen more easily. Head lice suck blood, and the rash caused by their feeding activities may be more noticeable than the ins ects themselves. Head lice attach their eggs a t the base of a hair shaft. These eggs, or nits, appear as tiny white or dark ovals and are especially noticeable on the back of the neck and around the ears. Adult head lice cannot survive for more than 48 hours apart from the human host. Head lice are primarily spread through direct head -to-head contact, although sharing personal items such as hats, brushes, combs, and linens may play a role in their spread between children. Such contact can be common among children during plat at school, home, and elsewhere including sports activities, playgrounds, camps and slumber parties. Children with head lice should be treated with a medicated shampoo, rinse, or lotion developed specifically for head lice. These treatments are very powerful ins ecticides and may be toxic if not used as recommended. The need to remove nits or egg capsules is controversial. Those found more than 1/4 inch from the scalp probably have already hatched or are not going to hatch. Treatments containing permethrin (an insecticide) have a high residual activity and are usually eff ective in killing nits as well as adult lice. To prevent the spread of head lice when a case occurs in the childcare setting: Temporarily exclude the in fested child from the c hildcare setting until after effective treatment has been applied. To assure eff ective treatment, check previously treated children Childcare Manual 58 for any evidence of new inf ection daily for 10 days after treatment. Repeat treatment in 7 to 10 days may be necessary. Nits can be removed using a fine -toothed comb. A pet flea comb may work best. Some commercial products may make removing nits easier. Commercial preparations to remove nits should be used according to the manufactur er's recommendations to assure that the residual activity of the ins ecticide is not aff ected. On the same day, screen all children in the classroom or group and any siblings in other classrooms for adult lice or nits. Do not use the same comb on multiple children. This can spread the lice from one child to another. Children found to be infested should also be excluded and treated. Simultaneous treatment of all infested children is necessary to prevent spread back to previously treated children. Educate parents regarding the importance of following through with the same recommendations at home and notifying the facility if head lice have been found on any member of the household. Although head lice are not able to survive off humans for more than a few days, many persons recommend washing clothes (including hats and scarves) and bedding in very hot water, and vacuuming carpets and upholstered furniture in rooms used by person infested with these insects. Combs and hairbrushes may be soaked in hot (65 C) water for at least one hour. Childcare Manual 59 Hepatitis A in the Child care Setting Hepatitis A is an inf ection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). Young children often have no symptoms or very mild symptoms of disease. Adults and older children are more likely to have typical symptoms, which include fever, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and generally ill feeling (malaise). The skin and whites of the eyes take on a yellow color (jaundice). A person with no symptoms is still inf ectious to others. HAV is spread by the fecal -oral route. This means the disease is spread by putting something in the mouth that has been contaminated with the stool of an inf ected person. It can also be spread when a person eats food or drinks beverages that have been handled by a person inf ected with HAV. Outbreaks of HAV among childre n attending child care centers and persons employed at these centers have been recognized since the 1970s. Because inf ection amo ng children is usually mild or they show no symptoms, and people are inf ectious before they develop symptoms, outbreaks are often only recognized when adult contacts (usually parents) become ill. Poor hygienic practices among staff who change diapers and also prepare food contribute to the spread of hepatitis A. Children in diapers are likely to spread the diseases because of contact with contaminated feces. Outbreaks rarely occur in childcare settings serving only toilet -trained children. A vaccine is available to prevent HAV and is currently licensed for children older than one year of age. All children 12 -23 months of age should receive 2 doses of Hepatitis A vaccine, 6 months apart. When outbreaks occur in childcare settings, either vaccine or immuno globulin may be administered to children, providers, and families of childcare attendees to limit transmission of HAV. If a child or adult in your childcare facility is diagnosed with HAV : Excl ude the child or adult from the childcare setting until 1 week after onset of symptoms or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Immuno globulin, if administered within the first 2 weeks after exposure, can prevent the infection from spreading to other children and families. For individuals between 2 -40 years who are not immunocompromised, Hepatitis A vaccine, rather than immunoglobulin is recommended. Use good handwashing and hygiene practices. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed HAV . This infection is reportable. Childcare Manual 60 Hepatitis B in the Childc are Setting Hepati tis B is an inf ection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This virus is completely different from hepatitis A. Only about 10% of children who become inf ected with HBV show any symptoms. When children do have symptoms they may be s imilar to those for hepatitis A and include fatigue, loss of appetite, jaundice, dark urine, light stools, nausea, vomiting, and abdo minal pain. However, HBV is a much more After nts, 15% to 25% of 1 -4 year old children, and 5% to 10% of older children and adults. Premature death from cirrhosis or liver cancer occurs in 15% to 25% of persons with chronic inf ection. Persons who develop chronic HBV inf ection may remain infectious for the rest of their lives. HBV infection is most commonly spread : By inf ected mothers to newborn infants through blood exposure at birth. By sharing contaminated needles during intravenous drug abuse. Through sexual intercourse. Throug h exposure of cuts or mucous membranes to contaminated blood. HBV inf ection can also be transmitted if non -intact skin of an uninf ected person is exposed to infected blood or body fluids, such as through biting , if the skin is broken. However, this is rare. To reduce the spread of hepatitis B : Require parents to submit up -to-date immunization records when previous records expire. Do not allow children to share toothbrushes. Clean up blood spills immediately. Wear gloves when cleaning up blood spills. Wear gloves when changing a diaper soiled with bloody stools. Disinf ect any surfaces on which blood has been spilled, using freshly prepared bleach solution. If a childcare provider ha s open sores, cuts, or other abrasions on the hands, the provider should wear gloves when changing diapers or cleaning up blood spills. Observe children for aggressive behavior, such as biting. Note: Notify th e Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295-5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed HBV . This infection is reportable. Childcare Manual 61 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Inf ections in the Child care Setting When a person is first inf ected with HIV, he or she may have no symptoms or may become ill with a fever, night sweats, sore throat, general tiredness, swollen lymph glands, and a skin rash lasting for a few days to a few weeks. These early symptoms then go away by themselves. However, the virus stays in the body and causes increasing loss of immune function. The late stage of this infection is called acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A person who is inf ected becomes potentially inf ectious to ot hers for life. Early symptoms of HIV inf ection in children include failure to grow or gain weight, chronic diarrhea without a specific cause, enlarged liver and spleen, swollen lymph glands, chronic thrush (yeast inf ections) and Candi da (yeast) skin inf other bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic inf ections that healthy children do not usually get. However, many children are inf ected with HIV for many years before developing any symptoms. HIV is not easily transmitted. HIV is most commonly spread : By sharing contaminated nee dles for intravenous drug abuse Through sexual intercourse By an infected pregnant woman to her fetus By exposure to inf ected blood through a blood transfusion Less commonly, HIV may be spread : By inf ected mothers who breastfeed their infants. Occupationally to health care workers, primarily after being stuck with a needle containing HIV in inf ected blood. By exposure of open s kin or mucous membranes to HIV contaminated body fluids. (Although it is very rare, a few cases have been reported in which HIV was spread by contact with blood or other body fluids from an inf ected person.) There is no vaccine availa ble to protect against HIV infection . However, HIV is not likely to be spread from one child to another in a childcare setting, and no such case has ever been reported. The child's parents or guardians should inform the family home provider or center director when an HIV -positive child is admitted to childcare. Because of concern over stigmatization, the person aware of a child's HIV infection should be limited to those who need such knowledge to care for the children in the childcare setting. In situations where there is concern about the possibility of exposure of others to infected blood or other body fluids, a child who is infected with HIV should be evaluated by a team that includes the child's parents or guardians, the child's physician, public health personnel, and the proposed childcare provider to determine the most appropriate childcare setting. This evaluation should consider the behavior, neurologic development, and physical condition of the child and the exp ected type of interaction with others in the childcare setting. In each case, risks and benefits to both the inf ected child and to others in the childcare setting should be weighed. Children with HIV inf ection need to be closely monitored by their physicians because they a re more susceptible to severe manifestations of inf ectious illnesses than are other children. Children with HIV inf ection should receive appropriate childhood vaccinations following the immunization Childcare Manual 62 schedule. Parents of children with weakened immune syste ms, whether due to HIV infection or other causes, should be advised when certain infectious diseases, such as cryptosporidiosis and fifth disease, have occurred in the childcare setting. Such children may need to be removed from the childcare setting until the outbreak has subsided in order to protect them from infections that could have severe complications for them. If a childcare provider has a weakened immune system, he or she should discuss with his or her physician precautions to be taken to avoid becoming inf ected with the many inf ections that young children are likely to transmit. To reduce the risk of spread of HIV in the childcare setting, all childcare providers should routinely follow precautions necess ary to prevent the spread of any bloodborne infection (including hepatitis B): Make sure all children and adults use good handwashing practices. Make sure all adults use good diapering practices. Wear gloves when changing a diaper soiled with bloody stools. Wash skin on which breast milk has spilled with soap and water immediately. Do not allow children to share toothbrushes. Clean up blood spills immediately. Wear gloves when cleaning up blood and body fluid sills. Disinf ect any surfaces on which blood or body fluids have been spilled with freshly prepared bleach solution. If a childcare provider has open sores, cuts, or other abrasions on the hands, wear gloves when changing diapers or cleaning up blood spills. Cover open woun ds on children and adults. Childcare Manual 63 Impetigo in the Child care Setting Impetigo is a skin inf ection usually caused by one of two types of bacteria, group A Streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Impetigo appears as a blistery rash. When the blisters open, they produce a thick, golden -yellow d ischarge that dries, crusts, and adheres to the skin. Impetigo is spread from person to person through direct contact with the discharge from the lesions. This infection can rapidly spread among persons in close contact, such as child ren in a childcare facility. If a child in your facility has impetigo: Exclude the child from the center until 24 hours after treatment has begun and the rash is no longer draining . Infected areas should be wash ed with mild soap and running water. Wash the inf ected child's clothes, linens, and towels at least once a day and never share them with other children. Wear gloves while applying any antibiotic ointment that a physician may recommend, and wash your hand s afterwards. (Antibiotics taken by mouth may also be prescribed.) Make sure policies on cleaning and disinf ecting toys are followed. Childcare Manual 64 Infectious Mononucleosis in the Child care Setting The Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) causes inf ectious mononucle osis. EBV is believed to be present in saliva. Most young children inf ected with EBV show no symptoms, unlike older children and adults, who may have fever, fatigue, enlarged neck lymph nodes, and inflamed throat and tonsils. Infectious mononucleosis is spread from person to person through contact with the saliva of an infected person. The virus spreads more rapidly among children in closed or overcrowded conditions. Most adults have been exposed to EBV by the age of 18 years and are i mmune. If a person in your facility develops infectious mononucleosis : Exclude until symptomatically able to tolerate general activity or perform duties. Do not share eating or drinking u tensils. Make sure all children and adults follow good handwashing practices. Childcare Manual 65 Influenza in the Child care Setting Influenza (sometimes called \"the flu\") is a potentially serious viral disease that can make people of any age ill. Influenza can cause fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache, and muscle aches. The influenza virus is usually passed when an inf ected person coughs or sneezes and another person inhales droplets containing the virus. Although most people are ill for on ly a few days, some have much more serious illness and need to be hospitalized. Thousands of people die each year from influenza- related complications. Most influenza -related deaths are among the elderly. Routine annual influenza vacci nation is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older . Since the influenza virus changes frequentl y, yearly vaccination should begin September (or as soon as vaccine is available) and continue throughout the influenza season. Children in the following groups are at high risk for developing influenza -related complications: Children younger than 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old. Those who have chronic lung (including asthma) or heart disease. Those who r equire regular medical care for chronic metabolic (including diabetes mellitus), kidney, liver blood, neurodevelopmental or suppressed immune system diseases. Those on long -term aspirin therapy. Any child or staff person that develops a fever (100 F or higher under the arm, 101orally, or 102 rectal) with cough and/or sore throat should be sent home until 48 hours after resolution of symptoms . During an epidemic of influenza, you should : Closely observe all children for sympt oms and refer anyone developing symptoms to his or her physician. Make sure all children and adults follow good hand washing and hygiene practices, including use and proper disposal of paper tissues. In large facilities, follow appropriate group separati on practices. Closely observe all children for symptoms and refer anyone developing symptoms to his or her physician. Notify parents. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become a ware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Influenza. This is a Reportable condition . Childcare Manual 66 Injuries in the Child care Setting The risk of an injury happening is dir ectly related to the physical environment and children's behaviors . Injuries can be divided into two categories; unintentional and intentional. Unintentional injuries may result from choking, falls, burns , drowning, poisoning , cuts from sharp objects, exposure to environmental hazards such as chemicals, radon, or lead, animal bites, or other \"accidents.\" Intentional injuries are usually due to bites, fights, or abuse. Preventing Injuries You can prevent most injuries that occur in the childcare setting by: Supervising children carefully. Checking the childcare and pl ay areas for, and eliminating , hazards. Using safety equipment for children, such as car seats and seat belts, bicycle helmets, and padding, such as for the knees and elbows. Unders tanding stages of childhood development. Children learn by testing their abilities. They should be allowed to participate in activities appropriate for their development even though these activities may result in some minor injuries, such as scrapes and br uises. C hildren should be prevented from taking part in activities or using equipment that is beyond their abilities and that may result in major injuries such as broken bones. Teaching children how to use pla yground equipment safely . Preparing for Injuries Injuries require immediate action. You will need to assess the injury to determine what type of medical attention, if any, is required. Everyone working with children should have up -to-date training in first a id and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). At a minimum, one person with this training must be present at the childcare site at all times. Unintentional Injuries Children are often injured unintentionally during the normal course o f a day. Many of these injuries, such as scrapes and bruises, are minor and only need simple first aid. Other injuries can be serious and require medical attention beyond first aid. Call 911 if an injured child has any of the following conditions: severe neck or head injury choking severe bleeding shock chemicals in eyes, on skin, or ingested in the mouth near -drowning Childcare Manual 67 Intentional Injuries & Aggressive Behavior Children show aggression (hostile, injurious, or destructive behavior ) either verbally or physically . Verbal aggression by other children or adults, such as belittli ng, ridiculing, or taunting a child, can injure a child's self -esteem. Physical aggression, such as biting, hitting, scratching, and kicking may result in physical injuries. Parents have become greatly concerned about physical injuries that cause bleeding to their child, especially being bitten by another child, because they fear this may expose their child to a risk of inf ection from HIV, which causes AIDS, or hepatitis B virus, which can lead to liver damage. To deter aggressive behavior you should : Set clear limits for children's behavior. Explain those limits to children and their parents. Explain to a child showing aggressive behavior how the aggressive actions aff ect the victim. Redir ect a child's aggr essive behavior by, for example, engaging the child in a sport or activity that interests the child. Teach and reinforce coping skills. Encourage children to express feelings verbally, in a healthy way. Provide acceptable opportunities for children to release anger. Running outside, kicking balls, punching bags, and other physical play allows children to let off steam. Childcare Manual 68 Lyme Disease Lyme disease is NOT a contagious disease and is NOT transmitted from person to person. A child or caregiver in a daycare situation is not able to inf ect other persons. Therefore, there are no exclusion criteria for a child or careg iver that has Lyme disease. The following information may be helpful should you have any questions regarding this tick borne, bacterial disease. Lyme disease is a bacterial disease transmitted by ticks to humans and animals. It is the most common tick tran smitted disease in the United States. Most cases of Lyme disease occur between May and October. Spread Lyme disease is spread by the bite of an inf ected deer tick or western -blacklegged tick. Ticks search for host animals from the tips of grasses and shru bs and transfer to animals or persons that brush against the vegetation. Lyme disease is not transmitted from person to person and there is no evidence that it can be transmitted dir ectly from wild or domestic animals. Campers, hikers, outdoor workers and others who frequent wooded, brushy, or grassy places are commonly exposed to ticks. Symptoms Within days t o weeks following a tick bite, 7 0% of patients will have a red, slowly expanding, circular, \"bull's eye\" rash, accompanied by fatigue, fever, heada che, stiff neck, muscle aches, and joint pain. If untreated, weeks to months later, some patients may develop arthritis, including intermittent episodes of swelling and pain in the large joints; neurologic abnormalities, and rarely, cardiac problems. Trea tment and Prevention Early stage Lyme disease is treated with oral antibiotics. Late stage disease is treated with more aggressive intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Limiting exposure to ticks reduces the likelihood of infection. When outdoors, frequently check your clothing and skin to det ect ticks before they become attached. Apply tick repellents to your legs and clothing to prevent tick attachment. Tick populations may be eff ectively controlled with application of pesticides to vegetation along trails. Mowin g grass frequently in yards and outside fences also helps to reduce tick populations. Tick Removal Guidelines Grasp the tick with tweezers or forceps as close as possible to the attachment (skin) site, pull upward, and out with firm and steady pressure. I f tweezers are not available, use fingers shielded with tissue paper or rubber gloves. Do not handle with bare hands. Be careful not to squeeze, crush, or puncture the body of the tick, which may contain inf ectious fluids. After removing the tick, thorough ly disinf ect the bite site and wash your hands. Consult a physician if there is concern about incomplete tick removal. It is important that a tick be completely removed as soon as it is discovered. Childcare Manual 69 Measles in the Child care Setting Measles is caused by a virus . Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough, and sore and reddened eyes followed by a red -brown blotchy rash. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads down the body, and lasts three or more days. Most children wi th measles become quite ill and occasionally measles can lead to pneumonia or inflammation of the brain , blindness, permanent disability or death. Adults and very young children tend to have more severe illness. Measles is vaccine preven table. Measles vaccine is administered as part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine series to children beginning at 12 to 15 months and again at 4 to 6 years of age or 11 to 12 years of age. Measles is highly contagious and is spread easily from person to person through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes and a susceptible person inhales the organism. These particles may remain suspended in the air and persons have become inf ected simply by being in a room after an inf ected person has left. Thus, all children and any adult who did not have the disease as a child should be vaccinated. Adults born prior to 1957 are considered immune. Childcare providers born after 1956 should receive two doses of MMR vaccine, with at least one dose given after 1967 at age 12 months or older. If a case of measles occurs in your facility: Exclude the inf ected person from the facility until 5 days after the rash appears or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Notify parents. Any unimmunized children and adults should be immunized or excluded from the center until two weeks after the rash appears in the last case of measles in the facility. Closely observe all children to determine whether any additional cases may be developing. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Measles. This disease is reportable. Childcare Manual 70 Mumps in the Childc are Setting Mumps is caused by a virus . Although mumps does not usually cause serious long -term problems, the acute symptoms, such as severe swelling of the s alivary glands can be very uncomfortable. Adults are more likely to have serious complications if they become inf ected. Childcare providers should be aware that exposure to the virus in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of miscarriages . Mumps is spread from person to person through dir ect contact with saliva, secretions from the respiratory tract and urine of an inf ected person. Mumps is vaccine -preventable. Adults born before 1957 are considered immune. The mumps vaccine is administered as part of the MMR (measl es, mumps, and rubella) vaccine series to children beginning at 12 to 15 months and again at 4 to 6 years of age or 11 to 12 years of age. If a case of mumps occurs in your facility: Exclude the inf ected child from the facility until nine days after the swelling begins, or until the swelling subsides or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Notify parents. Make sure all children and adults fo llow good handwashing practices. In large facilities follow appropriate group separation practices. Review the immunization records of all children in the facility to assure they have received their first mumps vaccination. Those not adequately vaccinate d should be referred to their physicians. Closely observe all children for symptoms and refer anyone developing symptoms to his or her physician. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Mumps. This disease is immediately reportable. Childcare Manual 71 Pertussis (Whooping Cough) in the Child care Setti ng Pertussis (whooping cough) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . It is a very contagious infection of the respiratory tract. Whooping cough gets its name from the whooping sound the child makes when trying to draw a breath after a coughing spell. Not all children with whooping cough make this sound. Symptoms generally include those of a cold, such as runny nose and a cough that gradually worsens. Violent coughing spells frequently end with vomiting. Pertussis is spread from person to person through the air. A person wh o is not immune to pertussis becomes inf ected by inhaling air that has been contaminated with the respiratory secretions of an inf ected person who has coughed. Pertussis is vaccine preventable. Children in the United States are immunized with the pertuss is vaccine beginning at 2 months of age and again at 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and 4 to 6 years. All children attending a childcare facility should be up to date on vaccinations. All childcare providers should receive a one -time dose of Tdap vaccine to protect themselves and the children in their care from pertussis. If a child or adult in your facility is diagnosed with pertussis : Exclude the inf ected person from the facility until that person has been on antibiotics for at least 5 days and as directed by the Division of Public Health. Make sure that all children and staff observe careful handwashing technique. In lar ge facilities follow appropriate group separation. Require up -to-date immunization recor ds for all children in your care. Carefully monitor all children and staff for coughs. Anyone developing a persis tent cough should be referred to his or her healthcare provider. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Ep idemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Pertussis. This disease is immediately reportable. Childcare Manual 72 Pinkeye (Conjunctivitis) in the Childcare Setting Pinkeye, also called conjunctivitis, can be caused by bacterial or viral inf ections or by allergies . Bacterial and viral inf ections usually produce white or yellowish drainage that may cause the eyelids to stick shut in the morning. The discharge in allergic conjunctivitis is usually clear and watery. All types involve redness and burning or itching eyes. Pinkeye in childcare settings is most often due to bacterial or viral inf ections. Red and sore eyes may also be part of viral respiratory infections. The germs that cause conjunctivitis may be present in nasal secretions, as well as in the discharge from the eyes. Persons can become inf ected when their hands become contaminated with these materials and they rub their eyes. Eyes can also become inf ected when a person uses contaminated towels or eye makeup. If a child in your facility develops pinkeye : Contact the child's parents and ask them to h ave the child evaluated by a healthcare provider . Eye injuries and foreign bodies in the eye can cause similar symptoms. Monitor the other children for signs of developing pinkeye. Make sure all children and staf f use good handwashing practices and hygiene including proper use and disposal of paper tissues used for wiping nasal secretions. Eliminate any shared articles, such as towels. Use disposable paper towels. Disinf ect any articles that may have been contam inated. Exclude chil dren diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis until they have been treated with an antibiotic for at least 24 hours . Children with a watery discharge generally do not need to be excluded unless there have been other children in the grou p with similar symptoms, but should be monitored for signs of more serious illness, such as fever or rash. Childcare Manual 73 Pinworms in the Child care Setting Pinworms are tiny parasitic worms that live in the large intestine. The female worms lay their eggs around the anus at night. Symptoms include anal itching, sleeplessness, irritability, and anal irritation due to scratching. Pinworms may also be present without symptoms. Pinworms are common in school -aged children. Pinworms are spread when an uninf ected person touches the anal area of an inf ected person (i.e., during diaper changing) or sheets or other articles contaminated with pinworm eggs and then touches the mouth, transferring the eggs. An inf ected person can spread pin worms by scratching the anal area, then contaminating food or other obj ects, which are then eaten or touched by uninf ected persons. Pinworms can be spread as long as either worms or eggs are present. Eggs can survive up to two weeks away from a human host. To prevent the spread of pinworms : If you susp ect a child has pinworms, call the parents and ask them to have the child evaluated by a healthcare provider . Observe proper handwashing among children and adults , particularly before eating and after using the toilet. Clean and disinf ect bathroom surfaces. Vacuum carpeted areas. Machine wash bed linens and hand towels using hot water. Machine dry using a heat setting (not air fluff). The family should do the sa me at home. Require that the nails of all children in your care be kept short and discourage nail biting. Discourage children from scratching the anal area. Exclude a child with pinworms from the childcare facility until 24 hours after the child has rec eived the first treatment. The entire family may have to be treated to prevent re-infection. Childcare Manual 74 Pneumonia in the Childcare Setting Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs primarily caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Infect ion of the lungs often is secondary to an infection that starts in the nose and throat area and then spreads to the lungs. The infection can start in the lungs from an infection brought there by the blood. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia are coughing, ra pid, difficult breathing, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite and lethargy. The germ that causes the pneumonia can spread if the person is still infectious at the time the pneumonia develops. Most of the germs that cause pneumonia spread by direct or c lose contact with mouth and nose secretions and touching contaminated objects. If a child or adult in the childcare facility develops pneumonia: Make sure that procedures regarding handwashing, hygiene, disposal of tissues used to clean nasal secretions and cleaning and disinf ection of toys , tables and doorknobs are followed. All children should receive 4 doses of pneumococcal vaccine by 2 years of age. Additional pneumonia vaccine may be needed for those at high risk for complications. Influenza vacci ne may prevent pneumonia that sometimes occurs as a complication of influenza infection. Influenza vaccine should be given to all children greater than 6 months of age. Do not exclude ill children unless they are unable to participate comfortably in activities or require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of the other children in your care. Childcare Manual 75 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in the Child care Setting Respiratory syncytical virus causes inf ections of the upper respiratory tract (l ike a cold) and the lower respiratory tract (like pneumonia). It is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in infants and children under two years of age. Almost 100 % of children in childcare get RSV in the first year of their life, usually during outbreaks in the winter months. In most children, symptoms appear similar to a mild cold. About half of the inf ections result in lower respiratory tract inf ections and otitis media. An RSV inf ection can range from very mild t o life threatening or even fatal. Children with heart or lung disease and weak immune systems are at increased risk of developing severe inf ection and complications. RSV causes repeated symptomatic inf ections throughout life. RSV is s pread through direct contact with inf ectious secretions such as by breathing them in after an inf ected person has coughed or by touching a surface an inf ected person has contaminated by touching it or coughing on it. A young child with RSV may be inf ectious for 1 to 3 weeks after symptoms subside. The most eff ective preventive measure against the spread of RSV and other respiratory viral infections is careful and frequent handwashing. Once one child in a group is inf ected with RSV, spread to others is rapid. Frequently, a child is inf ectious before symptoms appear. If a child or adult in the childcare facility develops an illness caused by RSV infection : Make sure that procedures regarding handwashing, hygiene, di sposal of tissues used to clean nasal secretions, and cleaning and disinf ection of toys are followed. If multiple cases occur, cohorting or separating ill children from well/recovered children may help to reduce the spread of RSV. Do not exclude ill chi ldren unless they are unable to participate comfortably in activities or require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of the other children in your care. Childcare Manual 76 Ringworm in the Child care Setting Ringworm is a fungal infection of the scalp or skin. Symptoms include a rash that is often itchy and flaky. Ringworm on the scalp may leave a flaky patch of baldness. On other areas of the skin ringworm causes a reddish, ring -like rash that may itch or burn. The area may be dry and scaly or it may be moist or crusted. The same fungi that inf ect humans can also inf ect animals such as dogs and cats, and inf ections may be acquired from pets as well as from inf ected children. Ringworm is spr ead by dir ect contact with a person or animal inf ected with the fungus. It can also be spread indir ectly through contact with articles (i.e., combs, clothing) or surfaces that have been contaminated with the fungus. A child with ringworm is infectious as long as the fungus remains present in the skin lesion. The fungus is no longer present when the lesion starts to shrink. If you suspect that a child in your facility has ringworm : Notify the par ents and ask them to have the ch ild evaluated by a healthcare provider . Observe good handwashing technique among all children and adults. Prohibit sharing of personal items, such as hair care articles, towels, and clothing. Dry skin thoroughly after washing. Wash bathroom surfaces and toys daily and when visibly soiled . Vacuum carpeted areas and upholstered furniture. Pets with skin rashes should be evaluated by a veterinarian. If the pet's rash is caused by a fungus, children should not be exposed to the pet until the rash has been successfully treated. Exclude a child with ringworm until after treatment has begun. Childcare Manual 77 Roseola (Human Herpes virus 6) in the Childcare Setting Roseola (exanthem subitum) is caused by a virus called human herp es virus 6 (HHV -6) and, possibly, human herpesvirus 7 (HHV -7). It is most common in children 6 months to 24 months of age. Symptoms include a high fever that lasts for 3 to 5 days, runny nose, irritability, eyelid swelling, and tiredness. The high fever of ten ends abruptly and at about the same t ime a pinkish - red rash appears on the trunk and spreads over the body. The rash blanches (turn white) when you touch it and individual spots may have a lighter \"halo\" around them. In approximately 10% to 15% of yo ung children, t he fast -rising fever that comes with roseola can trigger febrile seizures (convulsions caused by high fevers. Signs of a febrile seizure include: Unconsciousness 2 to 3 minutes of jerking or twitching in the arms, legs or face Loss of bladder or bowel control Roseola is spread from person to person, but it is not known how. Roseola is not very contagious. Usually, roseola goes away without any treatment . A child with fever and rash should be excluded from chi ldcare until seen by a healthcare provider and fever and rash have resolved . Childcare Manual 78 Rotavirus Diarrhea in the Child care Setting Rotavirus is a type of virus that causes diarrhea, especially in young children. It is a common cause of diarrhea in the childcare setting. Rotavirus inf ection usually occurs during the winter months. Some children have no symptoms of rotavirus inf ection while others may have severe vomiting , watery diarrhea, and fever. In some instances, there may also be a cough or runny nose. Rotavirus diarrhea usually lasts from four to six days, but may last longer and cause intermittent diarrhea in children who have compromised immune systems. Rotavirus inf ections may be highly contagious. Children and adults can become inf ected by coming in dir ect contact with the viruses that are in the feces of an inf ected child and then passing those viruses to the mouth (fecal -oral trans mission). Often, another child or adult touches a surface that has been contaminated and then touches their own mouth. A child with rotavirus inf ection may be contagious before the onset of diarrhea and for a few days after the diarrhea has ended. Although there is no specific therapy for rotavirus diarrhea, the most eff ective therapy is to encourage ill children to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. To prevent the spread of rotavirus infection in your f acility: Make sure that everyone in the childcare setting practices good handwashing Wash your hands after using the toilet, helping a child use the toilet, diapering a child, and before preparing or serving food Have children was h their hands upon arrival at your childcare facility, after using the toilet, after having their diapers changed (adult s should wash infants or small child 's hands), and before eating snacks or meals Disinf ect toys, diaper changing surfaces, bathrooms, and food preparation surfaces daily and when visibly soiled Use disposable paper towels for handwashing Parents shou ld contact the child's healthcare provider if their child develops extensive, prolonged diarrhea Exclude any child or adult with diarrhea from the childcare setti ng until resolution of symptoms . Childcare Manual 79 Rubella (German Measles) in the Child care Setting Rubella, also called German measles or three -day measles, is a very contagious disease caused by the rubella virus. The virus causes fever, swollen lymph nodes behind the ears, and a r ash that starts on the face, spreads to the torso and then to the arms and legs. Rubella is no longer very common because most children are immunized beginning at 12 months of age. Rubella is not usually a serious disease in children, but can be very serious if a pregnant woman becomes infected. Inf ection with rubella in the first three months of pregnancy can cause serious injury to the fetus, resulting in heart damage, blindness, deafness, mental retardation, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Rubella is spread person -to-person by breathing in droplets of respiratory secretions exhaled by an infected person. It may also be spread when someone touches his or her nose or mouth after their hands have been in contact with inf ected secretions (such as saliva) from an inf ected person. A person can spread the disease from as many as five days before the rash appears to five to seven days after. Rubella is vaccine preventable. The rubella vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine series administered to children beginning at 12 months of age. All childcare providers should be immune to rubella. People are considered immune only if they have received at least one dose of Rubella vaccine on or after their first birthday or if they have laboratory evidence of rubella immunity. If a child or adult in the childcare facility develops rubella: Review all immunization records of the children in your care. Any children under 12 months who have not yet been vaccinated against rubella should be excluded until they have been immunized or until three weeks after the onset of rash in the last case. Refer any pregnant wom en who have been exposed to rubella to their healthcare provider . Follow good handwashing and hygiene procedures. Carefully observe other children, staff, or family members for symptoms. Exclude the inf ected child or adult until seven days after the onset of the rash or as directed by the Division of Public Health . Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Rubella. This disease is immediately reportable. Childcare Manual 80 Salmonella Infections in the Child care Setting The Salmonella group of bacteria is a common cause of diarrheal illness. These bacteria are often found in the digestive tr act of a variety of animals, as well as humans. Persons with S almonella infections often experience fever, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting, in addition to diarrhea. Symptoms may persist for two weeks or more but are usually gone within a week. Salmonella is present in the feces of ill and recently recovered persons and inf ections may be spread from person to person. However, outbreaks in childcare settings are rare and most persons are believed to have acquired their inf ections fro m contaminated food. Some foods, such as chicken, come from naturally inf ected sources while others , such as tomatoes and some vegetables , are contaminated during processing. Food handlers may also contaminate food if they are inf ected and do not practice good hand hygiene in preparing food. Ordinarily safe food s, such as baked goods, may become contaminated from juices of uncooked foods such as poultry. Although it has been known that S almonella may be present in cracked eggs for some time, it is only recently that salmonella has been found in uncooked whole eggs. Given sufficient moisture and temperatures between 40- 140C, small numbers of salmonella will quickly increase to the point where they can cause illness in a large numbers of persons. Some pets, especially turtles, lizards and birds, often carry Salmonella in their digestive tracts. While c hildcare providers are most likely to encounter this condition because of inf ection outside their facility, they need to be aware of good hand hygiene and food handling practices to prevent foodborne illness from occurring within their facility. Provider s may reduce the likelihood of S almonella infection by: Making sure that children and adults wash their hands after handling animals or cleaning their cages or pens. Because of the risk of S almonella infection, turtles, lizards, and other reptiles should not be kept as pets in childcare centers. Limiting snacks and treat s prepared outside the facility to those from commercial sources. Home -prepared snacks may be not only prepared under less than optimal circumstances but may be transported and stored un der conditions that will allow bacteria to grow. Avoid food containing raw eggs, including homemade ice cream made with raw eggs. Make sure that lunches brought from home are refrigerated when necessary. These include meals containing raw vegetables as w ell as those with meats. Dairy products and liquid formula should also be kept refrigerated in order to limit the growth of bacteria, including Salmonella. Exclude any child or adult with Salmonella infection until symptoms resolve, usually 5 - 7 days or as directed by the Delaware Division of Public Health . Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Salmonella. This is a reportable condition. Childcare Manual 81 Scabies in the Child care Setting Scabies is caused by a tiny mite, Sarcoptes scabiei , which burrows into the skin, causing a rash. The rash is usually found on the wrists, elbows, or between the fingers. In infants, the rash may appear on the head, neck, or body. Scabies is spread by skin -to-skin contact. Because mites can survive only briefly if not on the human body, you can only get scabies from dir ect contact with another person or by sharing an infected person's clothes. Over -the-counter ins ecticide lotion treatments are available for killing the mites. Young children suspect ed of havin g scabies should see a healthcare provider. If scabies is diagnosed in a child or adult in your facility: Notify any other adults or the parents of children who may have had dir ect contact with the infected person. Other providers and children and their families may have been inf ected and may need treatment. The rash may take 2 -6 weeks to develop in persons who have not had scabies previously. If a person has had scabies previously, it will take only days for the rash to develop. To treat scabies : Bathe thoroughly Follow complete dir ections on the package insert of the ins ecticide lotion, and apply the lotion from neck to toes for the designated length of time Bathe again and put on freshly laundered clothes Wash all clothes, bedding, and towels used by the inf ected person in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer Monitor the inf ected person by direct ly insp ecting the body. A second treatment may be needed a week later Exclude the person until 24 hours after treatment has been completed. Childcare Manual 82 Shigellosis in the Child care Setti ng Shigellosis is a diarrheal illness caused by the Shigella group of bacteria. Inf ection is spread by the fecal -oral route. Only a few bacteria are needed to cause an inf ection and, unlike many of the diarrheal agents in childcare s ettings, Shigella may spread through groups of children who are toilet trained as well as through groups of children who are in diapers. Depending on the inf ectious dose, inf ection with Shigella may be very mild or it may result in severe bloody diarrhea, fever, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. Numerous outbreak s have been reported from childcare settings. Children may spread inf ections acquired in childcare facilities to their parents and siblings and whole families may be ill within a matter of days. Deaths have been reported from this illness and it is one of the more serious inf ections providers are likely to encounter in the child care setting. If you suspect a case of shigellosis in your childcare facility: Prompt intervention may help prevent the spread of shigellosis to others. Contact the Division of Public Health , Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1 -888-295-5156 for assistance and adv ice Make sure all children and adults us e careful handwashing and that staff are practicing good diapering practices Make sure procedures for cleaning and disinf ecting toys are being followed; that toys are being cleaned and disinf ected between use by children who are likely to put them in thei r mouths, especially in groups where there have been ill children Notify parents of children in the involved classroom of the illness, ask that they have any child with diarrhea, vomiting or severe cramping evaluated by their healthcare provider, and that they inform you of diarrheal illness in your child and family. Explain to them the value of handwashing with soap and running water in stopping the spread of inf ection in the home. In the event of an outbreak, the Division of Public Health , Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology may recommend a more extensive notification of parents Under the direction of the Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, e xclude the ill child until 5 days of antibiotic therapy have been completed or stool cultures are negative. Other children with diarrhea should be cultured and excluded as well. In the absence of treatment with antibiotics, two negative cultures should be obtained before readmitting children. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infect ious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Shigellosis. This is a reportable condition. Childcare Manual 83 Strep Throat and Scarlet Fever in the Child care Setting Strep throat is caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria. Strep throat is more common in children than in adults. Strep throat is easily spread when an inf ected person coughs or sneezes contaminated droplets into the air and another person inhales them. A person can also be inf ected from touching these secretions and then touching their mouth or nose. Symptoms of strep throat inf ections may include severe sore throat, fever, headache, and swollen glands. If not treated, strep inf ections can l ead to scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, skin, bloodstream and ear inf ections, and pneumonia. A bright red, rough textured rash that spreads all over the child's body characterizes scarlet fever. Rheumatic fever is a serious disease that can damage the heart valves. If you suspect a case of strep throat in your childcare facility: Call the parents to pick up the child and have h er or him evaluated by their healthcare provider. Request that the parents inform you i f the child is diagnosed with strep so that you can carefully observe the other children for symptoms of sore throat and fever ; notify other parents to closely observe their children. Exclude a child diagnosed with strep throat unti l 24 hours after beginning antibiotic therapy. Childcare Manual 84 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in the Child care Setting SIDS is a term used to describe the sudden, unexplained death of an infant that remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation that includes a complete auto psy, an examination of the death scene, and a review of the clinical history. SIDS is the leading cause of death of children one month to one year of age . Most SIDS deaths happen when babies are between 2 months and 4 months of age. In the United States, 5,000- 6,000 infant deaths are attributed to SIDS each year. Many of these occur in the childcare setting. The cause of SIDS is unknown. SIDS is not contagious. SIDS is not caused by vomiting, choking, or minor illnesses such as colds or infections. Deaths due to vaccine reactions or child abuse are not classified as SIDS deaths. While we don't know what causes SIDS . SIDS affects boys more than girls. Most SIDS death occurs in the winter . The following fact ors have been linked to an increased risk of SIDS : Sleeping on the stomach Being around cigarette smoke while in the womb or after birth Sleeping in the same bed as their parents (co -sleeping) Soft bedding in the crib Multiple birth babi es Premature birth Having a brother or sister who had SIDS Mothers who smoke or use illicit drugs Being born to a teen mother Short time period between pregnancies Late or lack of prenatal care Living in poverty situations To decrease the risk of SIDS in the childcare setting: Place babies on their backs to sleep. This recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Back to Sleep Campaign applies to most babies. However, some babies should lie in a prone position, such as those with respiratory disease, symptomatic gastro- esophageal reflux, or certain upper airway malformations. If uncertain about a baby's best sleeping position, cons ult the baby's parents or request documentation from the child's healthcare provider. Do not smoke; provide a smoke -free environment f or babies in your care; encourage parents who smoke to quit. Childcare Manual 85 Recent research indicates that the risk of SIDS do ubles among babies exposed after birth to cigarette smoke and triples for those exposed both during pregnancy and after birth. Use firm, flat mattresses in safety -approved cribs for babies' sleep. Do not use soft sleeping surfaces and objects that trap gas in the babies' sleeping area. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued advisories for parents on the hazards to infants sleeping on beanbag cushions, sheepskins, foam pads, foam sofa cushions, synthetic -filled adult pillows, and foam pads covered with comforters. Avoid letting your baby overheat during sleep . Dress your baby in light sleep clothing and keep the room at a temperature that is comfortable for an adult. If a child in your care is not breathing and is unresponsive: Call 911. Begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Immediately notify the child's parents. If a child in your care dies, d o not disturb the scene of death. Contact your emergency childcare backup person to tend to the other children. Document the entire sequence of events. Prepare to talk with law enforcement officers, a coroner or medical examiner, and licensing and in surance agencies. Notify the parents of the other children in your care of the death. You may later need to provide additional information regarding the death. If the death of a child in y our care is attributed to SIDS, s eek support a nd SIDS information from the Division of Public Health, or from local, state, or national SIDS resources. For further information or support, contact the First Candle SIDS Alliance at 1 -800-221-7437. Childcare Manual 86 Tetanus in the Child care Setting Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is very rare in the United States due to the very high immunization rates of persons living here. Tetanus is completely preventable through vaccination. Children receive tetanus vaccine in combination with the pertussis and diphtheria vaccine. After childhood, adults need a booster inj ection every 10 years to assure they are protect ed. Tetanus is caused by inf ection with the bacteria Clostridium tetani . These bacteria are co mmon in the soil but are quickly killed by oxygen. Any wound or cut contaminated with the soil and not open to the air (such as a puncture wound or even a rose prick) will provide a suitable environment for the bacteria. Tetanus is usually acquired when a person who has not been immunized acquires such a wound by stepping on a dirty nail or being cut by a dirty tool. The bacteria inf ect the wound and produce a toxin that spreads through the blood. This toxin can cause severe muscle spasms, paralysis, and fr equently death. Anyone who has an open w ound injury should consult with their healthcare provider regarding the date of his or her last tetanus booster. A person, who has not had a booster within the past 10 years, should receive a booster dose of vaccine and/or other medications to prevent tetanus disease. For some wounds, a person may need a booster if more than five years have passed since the last dose. . Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 1-888-295- 5156 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed Tetanus. This is a reportable condition. Childcare Manual 87 Tuberculosis (TB) in the Child care Setting TB is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These germs can be spread from person to person. These germs can be spread through the air when a person with TB disease coughs or sneezes . Children, although they may be infectious, usually are not as likely as adults to transmit TB to other s. TB can be serious for anyone but is especiall y dangerous for children less than five years old and for those with weak immune systems, such as HIV infection or AIDS. You should know the difference between the two stages of TB: (1) TB infection is just having the TB germ in the body without being sick, and (2) active TB or TB disease is having the germ and also being sick, with the symptoms of active TB (see description of symptoms below). When a child has TB infection, it means that the child was infect ed by a person with active , infectious TB. Most persons who have TB infection do not know it because their germs are not active and they have no symptoms and do not feel sick . A person with only TB infection cannot spread TB to others and does not pose an immediate danger to the public . Parents should discuss and follow the recommendations of their child's healthcare provider. A TB- infected person can take 6 to 12 months of med icine to get rid of the TB germs and to prevent active TB. This preventive treatment is most important for TB -infected children younger than five years old, persons infected with the TB germ within the past two years, and TB -infected persons who have a wea k immune system because these persons are more likely to get active TB after infection. Persons with active TB have symptoms such as a cough that lasts for 3 weeks of longer, a cough that brings up blood, fever, night sweats, feeling very tired or not feeling hungry and losing a noticeable amount of weight. The treatment for active TB usually involves taking at least three different drugs for at least six months. In childcare settings, TB has been spread from adults or adolescents to children, although the spread of TB in such settings is rare. In family home childcare settings, TB disease has been passed from sick adults or adolescents who live in the home to children, even though the sick adults may not have been directly caring for the children . The spread of TB from child to child in a childcare setting has not been reported. Children who have active TB should not attend childcare until they have been evaluated by a healthcare provider and cleared . Usually, they ma y return to childcare as soon as they are feeling well and on medication, but the Division of Public Health, TB Program (1 -302-744-1050) will decide this in conjunction with their healthcare provider . Children with only a positive skin or TB blood test wh o are not sick (no symptoms) should not be kept out of childcare . Persons who are beginning work as a childcare provider should have a TB skin test or TB blood test, also called Interferon Gamma -Release Assay (IGRA) to check for infection with TB bacteri a. Note: Notify the Division of Public Health, TB Program at 1-302-744-1050 if you become aware that a child or adult in your facility has developed active TB disease . This is a reportable disease. Childcare IInnffeeccttiioonn ((UUTTII)) A Urinary Tract Inf ection (UTI), common ly known as a bladder infection, is caused by bacteria that attach to the inside lining tissue of the urinary system or tract. The urinary tract includes: Kidneys - which form the urine from liquid waste in the blood Ureters - tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder Bladder - which stores urine Urethra - where urine exits the body The most common urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria from feces on the skin that enter through the urethra to infect the bladd er, particularly in girls. Anything that irritates the opening of the urethra can make it easier for infection to occur. In girls, the urethra is much shorter than in boys, so infection from the outside into the bladder occurs more easily. Bathing in soapy water or a bubble bath can be irritating and predispose girls to getting urinary tract infections. Signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections include pain when urinating, increased frequency of urinating, fever, cloudy or reddish urine and loss of potty training after the child has had good control of urine for a period of time, especially when loss of control occurs in the daytime with little warning. If a child in the childcare facility develops a urinary tract infection : Have the child with symptoms of a urinary tract infection evaluated by a healthcare provider. Ignoring urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage, even if the symptoms seem to go away by themselves. Wipe the area around the genitalia from front to back, especially in girls, to avoid spreading fecal bacteria from the rectal into the urinary and vaginal area. Dilute the urine by having the child drink fluids frequently. Diluting the urine gives bacteria less food to grow and makes it easier for the body to fight the in fection. Do not exclude ill children unless they are unable to participate comfortably in activities or require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of the other children in your care. Childcare Manual 89 West Nile Virus and Children Children, including infants, are not at greater risk than other individuals for becoming infected with West Nile Virus. Anyone can become infected with the virus if bitten by an infected mosquito, but children need adult help in taking precautions against mosquito bites. Parents and caregivers should take the following precautions to help protect children from getting mosquito bites. From April to October, when mosquitoes are most active, take the following precautions : If outside during evening, nighttime and daw n hours when mosquitoes are most active and likely to bite, children and adults should wear protective clothing such as long pants, long -sleeved shirts, and socks If outside during evening, nighttime and dawn hours, consider the use of an insect repellant containing 10% or less DEET for children and no more than 30% DEET for adults USE DEET ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURER'S DIRECT IONS Do not use DEET on infants or pregnant women Do not allow young children to apply DEET themselves Do not apply DEET directly t o children; apply to your own hands and then put it on the child DEET is effective for approximately four hours. Avoid prolonged or exces sive use of DEET. Use sparingly to cover exposed skin and clothing Wash all treated skin and clothing after returning indoors Store DEET -containing products out of reach of children Most people, including children, who are b itten by mosquitoes carrying WNV, will experience no symptoms or very mild illnesses. Even though the chances are slight that your child could bec ome infected with WNV, parents or ca regivers should contact their healthcare provider immediately if a child develops s ymptoms such as high fever with confusion, muscle weakness, severe headache, stiff neck or if his or her eyes become sensitive to light. The mosquitoes that most commonly carry WNV are generally more active during evening, nighttime and dawn hours, so children who attend school during the daytime are at minimal risk for exposure. If children take a field trip to an area where there are weed s, tall grass, bushes or known high mosquito activity, or if the trip is at dusk, during the evening, nighttime or at dawn, students should be advised to wear long pants, long sleeves and socks to minimize the possibility of exposure to mosquitoes. Althoug h there is no specific treatment, medicati on, or cure for WNV , the symptoms and complications of the disease can be treated. Most people who get this illness recover fully . Serious illness is more common in the elderly and those with w eak immune systems . Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Weeds, tall grass, and bushes provide an outdoor home for the common house mosquito, which is most commonly associated with WNV. Mosquitoes can enter homes through unscreened windows or doors, or broken screen s. Make sure that doors and windows have tight -fitting screens. Repair or replace all screens in your home that have tears or holes Dispose of tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, tires or similar water -holding containers Make sure roof gutters dr ain properly. Clean clogged gutters in the spring and fall Clean and chlorinate sw imming pools and hot tubs. Drain water from pool covers Change the water i n birdbaths frequently Turn over plastic wading pools and wheelbarrows when not in use Elimina te any standing water that collects on your property Remind or help neighbors to eliminate breeding sites on their properties Childcare Manual 90 Yeast Inf ections (Thrush/Diaper Rash ) in the Child care Setting Yeast inf ections are caused by especially Candida albicans . These organisms are part of the germs normally found in various parts of the body and ordinarily do not cause any symptoms. Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use or excessive moisture, may upset the balanc e of microbes and allow an overgrowth of Candida . In most persons, these inf ections flare up and then heal. However, in newborns or persons with weak immune systems, this yeast can cause more serious or chronic inf ections. Many infant s acquire Candida infections from their mothers during birth. Many of those that escape this inf ection soon acquire Candida from close contacts with family members, relatives, and friends. These early exposures may result in an oral inf ection (thrush) that appears as creamy white, curd -like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth. In older persons, treatment with certain types of antibiotics or inhaled steroids may upset the balance of microbes in the mouth, allowing an overgrowth of Candida that will also result in thrush. Outbreaks of thrush in childcare settings may be the result of increased use of antibiotics rather than newly acquired Candida infections. Candida may also exacerbate diaper rash, as this yeast grows readily on damaged skin. The infected skin is usually fiery red with lesions that may have a raised red border. Children who suck their thumbs or other fingers may occasionally develop Candida around their fingernails. Oral thrush and Candida diaper rash are usually treated with the antibiotic , nystatin. A corticosteroid cream can be applied to highly inflamed skin lesions on the hands or diaper areas. For children with diaper rash, childcare providers should change the diaper frequently, gently clean the child's skin with water and a mild soap and pat dry. While cornstarch or baby powder may be recommended for mild diaper rash, it should not be used for children with inflamed skin. High absorbency disposable diapers may help keep the skin dry. P lastic pants that do not allow air to circulate over the diaper area should not be used, although the diapering system should be able to hold urine or liquid stool. Children with thrush and candida diaper rash need not be excluded fro m childcare as long they are able to participate comfortably. Childcare providers should follow good hygiene including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the inf ection to c hildren who are not already Manual 91 CChhaapptteerr 99 PPaarreenntt//GGuuaarrddiiaann AAlleerrtt SSaammppllee LLeetttteerrss Childcare Manual 92 Sample Letter on Campylobacter Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our center has Campylobacter . PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS 1. Watch your child and members of your family for diarrhea or stomach cramps. 2. If your child develops severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, or diarrhea with fever or vomiting, do not send him/her to the center. If you r child develops mild diarrhea, please call us to discuss whether he/she should attend the center. In either case, ask your health care provider to do a stool test for C ampylobacter . (He/she will probably also want to test any other family member who deve lops diarrhea.) If the test is positive, keep your child home until diarrhea or illness is over, and your child has received medication. 3. Please keep us informed about how your child is doing, and about any positive tests or prescribed medications. Wha t is Campylobacter ? Campylobacter is a very small (microscopic) bacterium that can inf ect the intestines and stools. People who catch it may or may not be sick or have diarrhea. Many people who catch it are only mildly ill. However, some people have se vere, bloody diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, and vomiting. The bacteria can continue to be passed in the stools for several weeks after the illness itself seems over. How do you catch Campylobacter ? Campylobacter germs live in the intestines and are passed out of the body in the stools. (Remember they are microscopic --you cannot see them). If people do not wash their hands well after going to the bathroom, changing diapers, or helping a child go to the bathroom, germs stay on their hands and the childr en's hands. The germs can then be spread to food and drink or to obj ects, and eventually, to other people's hands and mouths. The germs are then swallowed by the other person or child, multiply in their intestines, and cause an inf ection. How do you kno w you have Campylobacter ? Campylobacter can be diagnosed by a test called a \"stool culture\". It may take 72 hours or longer to grow the germ from the stool and identify it. What can you do to stop the spread of this germ? Be sure everyone washes their hands carefully after using the bathroom, changing diapers helping a child use the bathroom. Wash your hands before preparing or eating food. Babies and children need to have their hands washed too at these times. If someone in your family develops diar rhea, talk with your health care provider about getting a stool culture. This is critical for family or household members who handle or prepare food as a job. Medication is usually recommended for children and adults with campylobacter in their stools, a s it shortens the length of time the bacteria is passed out in the stools, although it does not shorten the duration of the diarrhea. Your health care provider will decide on the best medicine for you or your child. Childcare Manual 93 tienen diarrea o tengan Si la prueba es positiva, mantenga en casa heces.

Childcare Manual 94 Sample Letter on Chickenpox Dear Parent/Guardian: A child/staff member in our center has chickenpox Your child may have chickenpox. What is it? Chickenpox is a very contagious inf ection caused by a virus. It usually begins with a mild fever and an itchy rash. The rash starts as crops of small, red bumps, which become blistery, oozy, and then crust over. How is it spread? It is spread through exposure to infect ed fluids from the nose, throat, or s kin rash of someone with chickenpox. This can occur either by sharing breathing space or by dir ectly touching the infected fluids. Chickenpox is contagious from two days before the rash starts until all the rash is dried and crusted. After exposure, it ta kes ten days to three weeks before the rash appears. How is it treated? Chickenpox is generally not a serious disease and there is no specific treatment for it. The symptoms can be treated with plenty of fluids, rest, fever control, and anti -itching med icines and lotions. ASPIRIN (Salicylate) - containing products should not be used for fever control in children with chickenpox. This is because there is a possible association between the use of aspirin and a rare, but very serious disease, called Reye's syndrome (vomiting associated with liver problems and coma). What should you do ? 1. Watch your child for the next ten days to three weeks for the chickenpox rash. 2. If your child develops a suspicious rash, do not send him/her to the center. Your heal th care provider can diagnose chickenpox and give you anti -itching medicine or lotion for your child. 3. If your child develops chickenpox, s he/he can return to the center one week after the rash begins, or when all the blisters are dried up and crusted o ver. 4. If one of your children develops chickenpox, other people in the family who have not had it will probably get it too. Chickenpox is very easily spread. Childcare NI\u00d1OS CON VARICELA.

Your child may have conjunctivitis. PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS: 1. Watch your child and members of your family for \"pink eye\". 2. If your child develops pink eye, see your health care provider. Your child may need an eye medication. 3. DO NOT SEND YOUR CHILD TO THE DAYCARE CENTER until after the day you start giving the medicine. If your health care provider decides not to prescribe an eye medicine, he/she should give you a note to send into the Day Care Center with your child. In your doctor's note, he/she should explain the diagnosis of the child, and why no medicati on is needed. 4. Tell us at the Center if your child is being treated for \"pink eye\". What is Conjunctivitis? Conjunctivitis is an infect ion of the eyes, commonly known as \"pink eye\". It is most often caused by a virus (like colds) but can also be caus ed by bacteria. The white parts of the eyes become pink or red, the eyes may hurt, feel itchy or scratchy, and they may produce lots of tears and discharge. In the mornings, the discharge (which is pus) may make the eyelids stick together. (Some childre n and adults have allergies which can cause everything listed above except pus. ) Conjunctivitis is a mild illness. It is not dangerous. Doctors usually prescribe an antibiotic eye medication, just in case it is due to bacteria. How do you catch conjunc tivitis? The discharge from the eye (the pus) is infect ious. If children rub their eyes, they get it on their hands. They can then touch someone's eyes or hands or touch an obj ect (toy or table). If other children get discharge on their hands and then touch their own eyes, they can catch it. It can spread easily among small children who touch their eyes, and everything else, and who do not know how (or forget) to wash their hands. What can you do if your child has conjunctivitis? 1. Keep your child's eyes wiped free of discharge. Use paper tissues, and then throw them away promptly. 2. Always wash your hands after wiping your child's eyes. 3. Teach your child to wash his/her hands after wiping his/her eyes. 4. Ask your health care provider if your child needs to receive eye medicine. 5. Be sure to carefully wash anything that touches your child's eyes (such as washcloths, towels, toy binoculars, and toy cameras). Childcare Manual Modelo sobre 1.

PLEASE T AKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS 1. Watch your child and members of your family for diarrhea or stomach cramps. 2. If your child develops severe diarrhea, diarrhea with blood or mucous , fever, or vomiting, do not send him/her to the center. Take your child to your family physician and ask for a stool test for E. coli O157 - H7. The physician will probably want to also do this test on any other person in your family who comes down with diarrhea. If the test is positive, keep your child home until any serio us diarrhea or illness is over and your child has received proper treatment. 3. Please keep us informed about how your child is doing and about any positive tests or treatment. What is E coli O157- H7? E. coli O157- H7 is a very small (microscopic) bacter ium that can inf ect the intestines and stools. People who catch it may or may not be sick or have diarrhea. Of those who become ill, the illness may be mild or severe. Some people have fever, stomach pain, and bloody, mucous stools. The bacteria can co ntinue to be passed in the stools for several weeks after the illness itself seems over. How do you catch E coli O157- H7? E. coli O157- H7 germs live in the intestines and are passed out of the body in the stools. Remember, they are microscopic - you cann ot see them. If people do not wash their hands well after having a bowel movement, changing diapers, or helping a child go to the bathroom, the germs stay on their hands and the children's hands. The germs can then spread to food, drink or to obj ects and eventually to other people's hands and mouths. The germs are then swallowed by the other person, multiply in their intestines, and cause an inf ection. How do you know you have E. coli O157- H7? E. coli O157- H7 can be diagnosed by a test called a \"stool culture.\" It may take 72 hours to grow the germs from the stool and identify it. What can you do to stop the spread of this germ? Be sure everyone washes their hands carefully after using, the bathroom or also helping a baby or child with diapers or toilet ing and before preparing or eating food. Babies and children also need to have their hands washed at these times. If someone in your family develops diarrhea, talk with your health care provider about getting a stool test. This is critical for family or household members who handle or prepare food as a job. Your physician may or may not recommend medication.

Childcare Manual 100 Sample Letter on Fifth Disease A child in our center has Fifth Disease. Your child may have Fifth Disease. Wha t is Fifth Disease? Fifth disease is a benign rash illness of childhood sometimes called erythema infectious. A virus called Parvovirus B19 causes the disease. The illness begins with prodromal phase of mild fever with non -specific symptoms of headache, malaise and muscle aches. This lasts for only a few days before the eruption of the characteristic rash. The rash begins as a red, flushed appearance on the cheeks, giving a \"slapped cheek\" appearance. It then spreads to the trunk and the extremities as a bumpy red rash. As the rash appears the child usually begins to feel better. The virus can cause stillbirth and fetal hydrops in pregnant women experiencing a primary infection. Please consult your physician if you are pregnant and a child in the c hildcare facility has fifth disease. How does a person get Fifth Disease? The virus is contracted from infected individuals before they show symptoms. The virus is spread by close contact, presumably through respiratory secretions. The virus may also be spread on inanimate objects to susceptible children. How is Fifth Disease treated? There is no treatment for fifth disease. Tylenol may be given to reduce fever and muscle aches. Pregnant women should consult their physician for treatment advice. Exclusion and return. Children with fifth disease do not need to be excluded from day care, as they are unlikely to be infectious after the rash appears, and the clinical diagnosis is made.

Childcare Manual 102 Sample letter on Giardia Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our Day Care Center has Giardia . Your child may have Giardia . PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS: 1. Watch your child and members of yo ur family for diarrhea, stomach cramps, gas and nausea. 2. If your child develops diarrhea or diarrhea with fever or vomiting, do not send him/her to the center. Please ask your health care provider to do a stool test for Giardia. He/she will probably want to do this test on any other person in your family who comes down with diarrhea. If the test is positive keep your child home until any serious diarrhea or illness is over and your child has received medication. If the test is negative please keep your child home until the diarrhea stops. 3. Please keep us informed about how your child is doing and about any positive tests or treatment. What is Giardia ? Giardia is a very small (microscopic) parasite that can infect the intestines and stools. Peo ple who catch it may or may not be sick or have diarrhea. Of those who become ill, most are only mildly sick. However, some people have bad smelling diarrhea, gas, stomach cramps, lack of appetite and nausea. It may last a long time and cause weight los s. The infection, whether or not it causes symptoms, can come and go for months if not treated. How do you catch Giardia ? Giardia germs live in the intestines and are passed out of the body into the stools. Remember, they are microscopic, so you cannot see them. If people do not wash their hands well after going to the bathroom, changing diapers, or helping a child go to the bathroom, germs stay on their hands and on the children's hands. The germs can then spread to food or drink or to objects and, e ventually, to other people's hands and mouths. The germs are then swallowed by the other person or child, multiply in their intestines, and cause an infection. Obviously, it can spread easily among small children who normally get their hands into everyth ing and may not wash their hands well. How do you know you have it? Giardia can be diagnosed by a test called \"stool culture for ova and parasites\", in which the stool is examined under a microscope. However, because Giardia is passed in the stools off and on, several stools taken over several days may need to be examined. What can you do to stop the spread of this germ? Be sure everyone washes their hands carefully after using the bathroom, or helping a baby or child with diapers or toileting, and bef ore preparing or eating food. Babies and children need to have their hands washed too! If someone in your family develops diarrhea, talk to your health care provider about getting a stool test. This is critical for family or household members who handle or prepare food as a job. Medication is recommended for children and adults with Giardia in their stools, as it shortens both the length of the illness and the time the germ is found in the stool. Your health care provider will decide the best medicine for you or your child. Childcare Manual 103 TOME PRECAUCIONES: 1.

Childcare Manual 104 Sample letter on Hib Disease Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our d aycare center has a serious inf ectious illness caused by a bacterium named Haemophilus influenzae , type B. A short way of writing the name is Hib. Hib spreads from person -to-person by being in close contact. It is not at all related to the regular \"flu\". Your child has been in close contact (same classroom or shared activities) with this child/staff person. Your child has not been in close contact with the ill person. Hib can cause very serious illnesses such as meningitis (inf ection of the covering of the brain), pneumonia, arthritis, epiglottis (inf ection of the upper throat), blood infect ions, and skin inf ections, all of which need hospital treatment and intravenous antibiotics. Because these bacteria can spread from child to child in a center, and because it can cause serious illness, we want to make you aware of the fact that your child may have been exposed. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? 1. Call your health care provider and tell him or her that your child is at a center where another child has come down with an illness caused by Haemophilus influenzae , type B (Hib). Tell him or her whether your child has been in close contact and the c enter's policy on Hib. 2. Watch your child for signs of illness or a fever. If your child becomes ill, take him/her to your healthcare provider. Watch carefully for a month, but especially carefully in the next week.

The disease usually appears during the su mmer and fall months. It lasts six to ten days. What are the symptoms? Symptoms appear four to six days after exposure. They include a sore throat, runny nose, cough, sneezing, ulcers on the tongue, and blisters on the hands, feet or buttocks. A low -grade fever (100- 101\u00b0F) is common. How is Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease diagnosed? A doctor will diagnose the illness at the office visit. Laboratory tests are usually unnecessary. How is Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease treated? There is no specific trea tment. You may take a non - aspirin pain reliever. Mouth rinses and soothing drinks comfort persons with this disease. Keep blistered areas clean and dry. Are there any complications? Complications are rare, but meningitis (an inf ection of the brain's covering.), encephalitis (an infect ion of the brain) and other secondary infect ions can occur. How is Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease spread?

Childcare Manual 108 Sample Letter on Head Lice Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our center has head lice. PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS 1. Check your child's hair for eggs (nits). 2. If you suspect your child has head lice, see your health care provider for diagnosis and treatment. 3. Tell us if your child is diagnosed as having head lice. 4. If head lice are diagnosed, do not send your child to the center until he/she has been treated. What are head lice and how do you know if your child has them? Head lice are very small, light -brown ins ects (less than one -eighth inch long) which live only in people's hair, especially the back of the scalp, above the neck, and behind the ears. They do not jump or fly; they do not live on animals. They live by biting the scalp or skin and drinking blood. The bites cause intense itching. Lice are not dangerous, but they make a person very uncomfortable. Lice live for 20 to 30 days and lay about six eggs a day. These eggs, called nits, are very small, about the size of a fleck of dandruff, but shaped like teardrops or pears, are pearl gray in color, and are glued onto single strands of hair. Sometimes they can best be seen by looking at a few stran ds of hair at a time held in natural daylight. The nits are very hard to pull off the hair , not like dandruff which can be brushed easily. Usually, you will not see the lice , only the eggs. You will need to look carefully. Spend about ten minutes and s tart with the hair on the back of the head. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider to check your child's head. How does a person get head lice? Head lice are very easy to catch, for both children and adults. Having lice is not a sign of not being clean or having a dirty house. The lice can crawl from head to head or from a personal item like a hat or pillow to a head. The eggs or nits may be in combs, brushes, hats, scarves, etc., and they may be passed on and then hatched on the next perso n. Head lice spread only from person to person; you cannot catch them from grass, trees or animals. If your child does have head lice, your health care provider may want to treat everyone in your family. Regardless, you should check everyone's hair care fully. Anyone else with nits should definitely be treated. How do you get rid of head lice? There are several medicines, used as shampoos, available to treat head lice. Kwell Shampoo* and Proderm Lotion* are available by prescription only. Other produ cts such as RID*, REC Shampoo*, XXX*, A -200 Pyrinate* and NIX* are available over -the-counter. Your doctor will tell you which is best. All of these products must be used carefully, and all safety guidelines must be observed. It is especially important to consult a physician before treating (1) infants, (2) pregnant or nursing women, or (3) anyone with extensive cuts or scratches on the head or neck. Although all of these products kill lice, none will kill 100 percent of the nits. Nit removal may be time consuming and difficult due to their firm cementing onto the hair. A solution of vinegar and water may help to dissolve the \"cement\" and make removal easier. There are special, fine- tooth combs to aid in nit removal; a regular comb will not remove the m. A daily nit check for the next ten days is advisable; if you see new nits (less than one -fourth inch from the scalp) or newly hatched lice, it may be necessary to repeat the treatment. Childcare Manual 109 Too many treatments can be dangerous; follow your health care pr ovider's instructions. Clean all personal items, giving special attention to the following: Clothes -- especially coats, sweaters, hats, scarves, pajamas, robes, nightgowns. Bedding -- sheets, pillowcases, blankets, pillows. Toiletries and Towels -- combs, brushes, curlers, barrettes, etc. Furry or cloth toys -- especially those that have been near the child's head or in the child's bed. Ways to clean personal items: Choose one of the following methods for each item to be cleaned: Wash in hot water in wash ing machine, dry as usual. Put in HOT dryer for 20 minutes. Dry clean. Store in sealed plastic bags for 14 days (any eggs present will hatch, but the louse will die for lack of food, (i.e., blood. Any lice will also die). This method is especially good f or blankets, pillows, toys and clothing that are hard to wash. Boil combs, brushes, curlers, etc., for 10 minutes, or soak in 2% Lysol and water, or a bleach solution (1/4 cup bleach to 1- gallon water) for one hour. *Brand names are mentioned for identifi cation purposes only and are not an endorsement. Other similar products may also be used. Careful vacuuming of carpets, floors and furniture is all that is necessary for the rest of the house. Insecticide sprays are not recommended; they can be harmful to people and animals. When can my child go back to the Center? Your child may go back as soon as the shampoo has been given, you have removed as many nits as possible f rom your child's hair, and you have cleaned or stored personal items. Keep checking your child's hair for new nits for at least two weeks. Childcare Manual 110 Carta sobre PRECAUCIONES 1. Revise el cabello de su ni\u00f1o s por huevos (liendres). 2.

Childcare Manual 112 Sample Letter on Hepatitis A Dear Parent or Guardian: A child or staff member in our center has been diagnosed with a vi ral inf ection called Hepatitis A and your child may have been exposed. What is Hepatitis A ? Hepatitis A is an inf ection of the liver caused by a virus. It can cause tiredness, fever, lack of appetite, nausea, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whi tes of the eyes, with darkening of the urine). The illness usually lasts one to two weeks. Young children do not usually become jaundiced. However, they may have a \"flu-like\" illness or nothing at all. How do you get Hepatitis A ? The virus lives in th e intestines and is passed out of the body in the stools. The virus is microscopic --you cannot see it. If people do not wash their hands well after toileting a child or themselves, or wash the child's hands, the virus can be spread to other people, food, drink, or other things. The germs can then be swallowed by another person, multiply in the intestines, and cause illness two to eight weeks later. If a person is exposed (swallowed some germs), the illness may be prevented by a shot of immune globulin. How is Hepatitis A diagnosed? Hepatitis A is diagnosed by a blood test. What can you do? 1. Be sure everyone in your household washes their hands after going to the toilet, helping a child go to the toilet, or changing a diaper. They must wash the chi ldren's hands too. This is the most important thing to do! Hands should also be washed before touching food, eating, or feeding. 2. Your child or your household may need a shot of immune globulin. The immune globulin is available free of charge from th e Division of Public Health. Other people in your household need the shot as well. See your health care provider. 3. If anyone in your household develops signs of Hepatitis A, ask your health care prov ider to do a blood test and report if it is positive.

Check your child's skin for an impetigo rash. 2. Take your child to your health care provider if you suspect your child has an impetigo rash so that medicine may be prescribed. 3. Tell us if your child was treated for impetigo. 4. If your child has impetigo, he/she may return after taking medicine for 24 hours . What is Impetigo? Impetigo is a skin inf ection common in young children. It is mostly seen on the face and around the mouth, but can occur any p lace on the skin. What does Impetigo look like? The skin is red and may be oozing. There may be small bumps clustered together or larger red areas. These areas may have honey -colored crusts or blisters. It spreads quickly. It is often itchy. Childr en may scratch the crusts off and cause a little bleeding. What causes Impetigo? Impetigo is caused by common skin germs, like strep and staph . These germs usually only cause infect ion when the skin is injured (scraped, cut, scratched, etc.). It can s pread easily among small children who touch everything and, is therefore, very common among this age group. How is Impetigo diagnosed and treated? Your health care provider can tell you if your child has impetigo. Usually it is treated with some combin ation of a special soap, antibiotic ointment, and an oral antibiotic. The most important thing is to keep the impetigo rash clean and dry. You may want to cover it lightly so the ooze and crusts cannot be spread to other people. Anybody who does touch t he rash should wash his/her hands very well . Childcare 1. la piel de ni\u00f1o s por una erupci\u00f3n de imp\u00e9tigo. 2.

Childcare Manual 116 Sample letter on Men ingococcal Illness Dear Parent or Guardian: A child or staff member in our d aycare center has a serious inf ectious illness caused by bacteria named Neisseria meningitidis . These bacteria can spread among children who are in close contact. There is a medicine called Rifampin, which can be taken to reduce the risk of inf ection in people in close contact with the ill person. Your child has been in close contact (same classroom or shared activities) with this child/staff person. Your child has not been in close contact with the ill person. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? 1. Call your doctor or nurse practitioner and tell them your child is at a center where another child/staff person has come down with a meningococcal illness. Tell them whether your child has been in close contact with the ill person. 2. If your child has had close contact, get a prescription of rifampin for your child unless there is a medical reason not to. Rifampin can help eliminate the germ from someone who has been exposed. If your child has had close contact, he/she should not come back to the d aycare center until rifampin has been started. 3. For the next three weeks, watch your child for signs of illness or a fever. If your child becomes ill, take him/her to a doctor immediately, whether or not Rifampin was given, because medicine is not always 100% effect ive. N. meningitidis usually causes meningitis, an inf ection of the coverings of the brain, which is often fatal if not treated with antibiotics. The center will be v ery watchful over the next three weeks and will inform you if anyone else becomes ill.

Watch your child for pinworms. 2. If you think your child may have pinworms, call your healthcare provider to find out how to test for them. 3. If your child does have pinworms, please tell us at the center. What are pinworms? Pinworms are small, white, thread -like worms that live in the large intestine and only inf ect people.

It does not cause teeth grinding, or bedwetting as some people mistakenly believe. It is not a dangerous disease, just a very irritating one. Who can get pinworms? Anyone can. If a child gets them, other family members can catch them. How do you catch pinworms? When ch ildren scratch their bottoms, the eggs get on their hand and under their fingernails. The children may then touch someone else's mouth, food, or a toy or table. Someone else may get the eggs on his or her hands and eventually swallow it. The egg hatches inside the body. It is very easy to spread pinworms around and to catch them repeatedly. If you think your child has pinworms, have your family physician examine your child.

If the test is positive, your child or your entire family may be treated for pinworms. What do you do about pinworms? The doctor or nurse will ask you to place sticky tape on your child's bottom first thing in the morning and then look at the tape under the microscope.

Childcare Manual 122 Sample Le tter on Salmonella Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our center has Salmonella . PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS 1. Watch your child and members of your family for diarrhea or stomach cramps. 2. If your child develops severe diarrhea or diarrhea with fever or vomiting, do not send him/her to the center. If your child develops mild diarrhea, please call us to discuss whether he/she should come to the center. In either case, ask your health care provider to do a stool test for Salmonella . He/she will probably want to do this test on any other pers on in your family who develops diarrhea. If the test is positive, keep your child home until any serious diarrhea or illness is over. 3. Please keep us informed about how your child is doing and about any positive tests. What is Salmonella ? Salmonella is a very small (microscopic) bacterium that can inf ect the intestines and stools. People who catch it and become ill may have only mild diarrhea, or may have severe diarrhea, painful sto mach cramps, and fever. After swallowing the germs, people usually become sick within six to 72 hours. The diarrhea usually goes away on its own in two to five days. However, the germ can continue to be passed in the stools for several weeks, even after all signs of illness have disappeared. How do you get Salmonella ? Salmonella germs live in the intestines and are passed out of the body into the stools. (Remember, they are microscopic - you cannot see them.) If people do not wash their hands well af ter going to the bathroom, changing diapers, or helping a child go to the bathroom, germs stay on their hands and the children's hands. The germs can then be spread to food or drink or to obj ects, and eventually to other people's hands and mouths. The ge rms are then swallowed by the other person or child, multiply in their intestines, and cause an inf ection. Obviously, Salmonella can spread among small children who normally get their hands into everything and may not wash their hands well. How do you kn ow you have Salmonella ? Salmonella can be diagnosed by a test called a \"stool culture.\" It may take 72 hours to grow the germ from the stool and identify it. What can you do to stop the spread of this germ? Be sure everyone washes their hands carefully a fter using the bathroom or helping a baby or child with diapers or toileting, and before preparing or eating food. Babies and children also need to have their hands washed at these times. If someone in your family develops diarrhea, talk with your health care provider about getting a stool test. This is critical for family or household members who handle or prepare food as a job. Medication is not usually recommended for this inf ection, as it does not shorten the illness. Medication can actually lengthe n the amount of time the germ is found in the stools. REMEMBER: The most important prevention is hand washing after going to the bathroom yourself, and washing your hands as well as your child's hands after changing diapers or helping them in the bathroom and before touching food.

Childcare Manual 124 Sample letter on Scabies Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our center has sc abies. Your child may have scabies. PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS: 1. Watch for signs of an itchy rash (usually in lines) over the next two to six weeks. 2. If a rash develops , see your health care provider. 3. Tell us at the center that your child has scabies. What is scabies? Scabies is a common skin rash caused by microscopic animals called mites, which are found only on people. The mite digs under the skin and lays eggs, which then hatch. The new mites dig more paths and lay more eggs. The rash appears as red bumps and short wavy lines in the skin (where the mites have dug). It is especially common between fingers and toes, and at the wrist and ankle, but can occur anywhere. The rash itches intensely. Scabies is not dangerous, but it is very annoying. Who can get scabies? Anyone can. How do you get scabies? You catch it from another person, who has it, or from clothes or bedding used by a person with scabies. The mites cannot jump or fly, but they can crawl. They can li ve for three days off the body. If my child has scabies, what should I do? 1. See your health care provider to get medicine to treat the scabies. 2. Wash in hot water all clothes, hats, sheets, pillowcases, blankets, towels, etc. that your child has use d. Dry on the hottest setting in the dryer. 3. If there are things that you do not want to wash (pillows, blankets, toys, stuffed animals), put them in tightly closed plastic bags for four days. 4. Thoroughly vacuum all carpets and upholstered furniture . Pesticide sprays are not recommended; they can be harmful to people and animals. When can my child go back to the day care center if he/she has scabies? The day after receiving treatment. Sometimes your doctor may want to treat the entire family bec ause scabies can spread so easily. REMEMBER: Scabies is annoying, but not dangerous.

Childcare Manual 126 Sample Letter on Shigella Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in our center has Shigella . PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS 1. Watch your child and members of your family for diarrhea or st omach cramps. 2. If your child develops severe diarrhea, diarrhea with blood or mucous , fever, or vomiting, do not send him/her to the center. If your child develops mild diarrhea, please call us to discuss whether he/she should attend the center. In either case, ask your health care provider to do a stool test for Shigella . He/she will probably want to also do this test on any other person in your family who comes down with diarrhea. If the test is positive, keep your child home until any serious d iarrhea or illness is over, and your child has received medication. 3. Please keep us informed about how your child is doing and about any positive tests or treatment. What is Shigella ? Shigella is a very small (microscopic) bacterium that can inf ect the intestines and stools. People who catch it may or may not be sick or have diarrhea. Of those who become ill, most are only mildly ill. However, some people have fever, stomach pain, and bloody, mucous stools. The bacteria can continue to be passed in the stools for several weeks after the illness itself seems over. How do you get Shigella ? Shigella germs live in the intestines and are passed out of the body in the stools. Remember, they are microscopic - you cannot see them. If people do not wash their hands well after doing to the bathroom, changing diapers, or helping a child go to the bathroom, germs stay on their hands and the children's hands. The germs can then spread to food or drink or to obj ects and eventually to other people's hands and m ouths. The germs are then swallowed by the other person, multiply in their intestines, and cause an inf ection. How do you know you have Shigella ? Shigella can be diagnosed by a test called a \"stool culture.\" It may take 72 hours to grow the germs from th e stool and identify it. What can you do to stop the spread of this germ? Be sure everyone washes their hands carefully after, using the bathroom or helping a baby or child with diapers or toileting and before preparing or eating food. Babies and childre n need to have their hands washed, too, at these times. If someone in your family develops diarrhea, talk with your health care provider about getting, a stool test. This is critical for family or household members who handle or prepare food as a job. Medication is recommended for children and adults with Shigella in their stools, as it shortens the length of the illness and the amount of time the germ is found in the stools. Your health care provider will decide on the best medicine for you or your chil d. REMEMBER: The most important prevention is hand washing after doing, to the bathroom yourself, and washing your hands as well as your child's hands after changing diapers or helping them in the bathroom. ADDITIONAL NOTES: 1. Encourage treatment of p ersons with positive Shigella culture. 2. If more than one unrelated Shigella case occurs in one daycare center, additional screening of asymptomatic children is necessary. 3. Cultures should not be taken until 48 hours after cessation of antibiotics. Childcare Manual su ni\u00f1o tiene diarrea prueba es positiva, mantenga es en heces.

Childcare Manual 128 Sample letter on Strep Throat Dear Parent or Guardian: A child in the d aycare center has strep throat. Your child may have strep throat. PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS: 1. Watch your child for signs of a sore throat and other signs of strep (headache, fever, stomachache, swollen and tender neck glands). 2. If your child develops a sore throat and any of these other signs, please see your health care provider. Tell your doctor or nurse practitioner that another child in the Center has strep and ask to have your child tested for strep throat. What is strep throat? Strep throat is a sore throat caused by the streptococcus bacteria. Mos t sore throats, however, are caused by viruses and are not treated with antibiotics. The strep germs are passed around through nose and mouth secretions. How do I find out if my child has strep throat? If your child has a sore throat and other signs of strep, your health care provider will do a throat culture or a rapid test. In one to two days you will have the results of the culture. If strep is found, your child will receive treatment. Why is it important that my child receive treatment? There are three reasons: 1. If not treated, or not treated long enough, your child may continue to spread the infect ion to other members of your family or to other children in the Center. Treatment reduces spread. 2. Rarely, some children with this illness later develop rheumatic fever (abnormalities of the heart valves and inflammation of the joints); treatment with antibiotics can usually prevent this. 3. Treatment will also prevent other rare, but possibly dangerous, complications. Who gets strep throat? Anyone can. It is very common in pre -school and school -aged children. When can my child return to the Day care Center? After taking medicine for 24 hours. How can you prevent the spread of strep? 1. Wash your hands and your child's hands after wiping nos es and before eating or preparing food. 2. Dishes should be washed carefully in hot soapy water or a dishwasher. 3. Children should not share cups, spoons, etc. 4. Toys that are put in the mouth should not be shared. Sharing of food should be discouraged.

However, this information is provided to address any questions that may arise. Some infectious agents have the potential to be used in acts of bioterr orism. Children may be particularly vulnerable to a bioterrorist attack because, compared with adults; they have a more rapid respiratory rate, increased skin absorption, a higher ratio of skin surface area to weight, and less fluid reserve. Accurate and rapid diagnosis may be more difficult in children because of their inability to describe symptoms. The symptoms of illnesses caused by bioterrorism agents are similar to symptoms of many infectious diseases. Therefore, it will be hard to know when a bioterrorist attack has occurred. If a number of children become ill at the s ame time, notify the Delaware Division of Public Health , Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology immediately past, practicing fire drills and having a basic plan to evacuate your program or family childcare home seemed adequate preparation for an emergency. Especially in relation to recent world events, we are becoming increasingly awar e of the need for more in -depth emergency planning. If a natural or man- made disaster occurred, your level of preparation could mean the difference between remaining as safe as possible to increasing the likelihood of being affected by the danger at hand. We encourage each program director and family childcare provider to develop written emergency plans describing procedures for handling both natural and man- made disasters such as fire, flood, earthquake, extreme weather conditions, power failure or utility disruptions, chemical or toxic spills, bomb threats, and terror attacks. Your plans should include procedures for the following : Training staff or helpers about disaster preparedness Assigning staff or helpers specific responsibilities during a disast er Accounting for all children, staff or helpers Having a relocation process, when appropriate Remaining at the facility or \"sheltering -in-place,\" when appropriate Having necessary emergency supplies, food and water Contacting appropriate emergency respons e activities Contacting the parents/guardians of the children Your plan should be individualized to the particular needs of the children, staff, or helpers in your facility or family childcar e home. Since remaining safe in any emergenc y is your goal, it is to everyone's advantage to be as prepared as possible. Please take time to think through how you would respond to various types of emergencies and begin to write your facilities emergency plans. Share your plans with parents and guardians of the child ren in your care to let them know you are doing all you can to keep their children safe and sound.
