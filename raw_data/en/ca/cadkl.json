It started in 1987 as the Center for Research in Electro- Optics and Lasers (CREOL) and became a College in 2004, the first such college in the US. The College is home to the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE), the Townes Laser Institute , and the Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (iFAST). During the last 29 years, CREOL has graduated 283 PhD and 387 MS students. World-renowned for their scholarly contributions to fundamental and applied optics and photonics, the faculty have published 30 books and more than 2,100 journal papers with close to 48,000 citations. The college has been an exciting place for students to have an outstanding educational experience and to engage in research in a broad spectrum of programs covering materials, devices, and systems, using technologies including lasers, optical fibers, optoelectronics and integrated photonics, nonlinear and quantum optics, and imaging, sensing and display. These technologies have applications in manufacturing, communication and information, biology and medicine, energy and lighting, and homeland security and defense. Advanced topics such as nanophotonics, attosecond optics, plasmonics, and biophotonics are embraced as areas of strength and future growth. We are well positioned to take advantage of the revolution that is taking place in several fields enabled by optics and photonics. CREOL was initially founded to promote growth in optics and related fields here in central Florida and has maintained this tradition over the years. We provide the well-trained workforce that keeps the industry growing and we partner with the Florida Photonics Cluster to coordinate this industry's efforts and needs. We also receive strong support from the Florida High Tech Corridor Council and Enterprise Florida . The CREOL Industrial Affiliates Program has attracted more than 170 industrial members since its founding. The faculty have produced close to 280 patents, and spun off 26 photonics-based companies involving a wide variety of technologies. Four companies are incubated within the CREOL facilities. Highlights of 2015 include the addition of five new junior faculty members. Dr. Shuo (Sean) Pang, who received his PhD from California Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral fellow at Duke University, started in January 2015 and is pursuing research in optical imaging and microscopy. Drs. Kyle Renshaw and Ryan Gelfand joined the college in Fall 2015. Renshaw, who received his PhD from the University of Michigan and had an appointment with Northrop Grumman, is active in organic photovoltaics and optical sensor arrays. Gelfand's research area is nanophotonic biosensing. He received his PhD from Northwestern University and was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Victoria. Joining the college in Spring 2016 are Drs. Kye Young Han and Luca Argenti. An expert in fluorescence nanoscopy, label-free single-molecule and live-cell RNA imaging, Han received his PhD from Seoul National University and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Argenti, who received his PhD from Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, Italy, and was a faculty member with the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, is active in theoretical attosecond science. These five appointments are envisioned to fill important needs in applied optics and image science, and to strengthen our programs in integrated photonics, nanophotonics, biophotonics, and attosecond optics. Another key highlight is the award of our first BS degree in Photonic Science and Engineering. This new undergraduate program, which began in Fall 2013, continues to grow. In 2015, 13 courses and 5 labs were offered. Current enrollment is approximately 100. In AY 2014. 2015,121 graduate students were enrolled, and 18 PhD degrees and 17 MS degrees were awarded. Graduate students continue to receive national scholarships, fellowships, travel grants, and best papers or poster awards. The CREOL faculty continue to receive prestigious national and international awards and honors. Aristide Dogariu received the 2015 SPIE Stokes Award in recognition of his work on the polarization properties of light-matter interaction. Guifang Li was elected Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, and Martin Richardson was elected Fellow of AAAS. Peter Delfyett was elected Fellow of SPIE and Fellow of the National Society of Black Physicists. He was also elected Vice-Chair of the APS Division of Laser Science. Mercedeh Khajavikhan received an NSF CAREER award. At the university level, Sasan Fathpour received the UCF Reach for the Stars Award and Ayman Abouraddy received the UCF Research Incentive Award. The researc h conducted by the CREOL faculty, students, and scientists was disseminated nationally and internationally in 5 book chapters, 171 journal papers, 169 conference papers and presentations, and 22 invited lectures. This year, 14 papers were published in Nature journals, and one in Optica. Research and educational programs were funded by contracts and grants totaling approxim ately $14.7M in FY 2015. Our tradition of innovation has also continued. In 2015, the faculty were inventors or co- inventors of 15 issued patents. Our partnership with industry continues to be strong. Approximately $2.1M were received from industry or from federal grants flow through industrial partners, a connection that gives our students experience and a leg up on industry positions after they graduate. Several companies donated equipment for our laboratories. The 2015 Industrial Affiliates Day events were attended by 240 guests and 25 exhibitors, the students presented 39 post ers, and four short courses were offered. CREOL maintains an ongoing relation with its alumni and holds regular alumni reunions at key conferences. Achievements of our successful alumni are highlighted in newsletters and on the CREOL website. This year's recipient of the Professional Achievement award is Frank Effenberger, Ph.D.'95, Vice President and Fellow at Futurewei Technologies, and a world expert in the field of fiber access networks. The CREOL Association of Optics Students (CAOS) has maintained its strong involvement in outreach and professional development. This year, a new undergraduate student organization, the Society of Optics Students (SOS) joined CAOS. Another highlight of 2015 is the Florida Science Olympiad, which was held at UCF in March and in which CREOL was an important participant. The year 2015 was very special for the worldwide optics and photonics community since it was the International Year of Light. A number of special public events were organized, including public lectures at the 2015 Industrial Affiliates Symposium, STEM teachers workshop, Optics Day, and a photo contest. This annual report provides an overview of the education, research, and partnership activities of the faculty, staff, and students in 2015. Key data are also compared to previous years to show progress and identify trends. Academic data are reported for the academic year AY2015 (Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Summer 2015). Fiscal data, grants, and patents are reported for the fiscal year FY2015 (July 2014-June 2015). Publications are reported for the 2015 calendar year.

At the end of the Fall 2015 semester, enrollment in the program was nearly 100 students. Half of these students are in pending status, still needing to complete calculus and physics courses prior to declaring the major. This is an increase from 67 students at this time last year. In Spring 2015, Andrew Kirk became the program's first graduate, followed by Sean Diamond in Fall 2015. Both accepted job offers prior to graduation. The PSE degree is offered as a joint program between the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) and the College of Optics and Photonics (COP), making it the only B.S. in the state of Florida in this area and only one of a few in the nation. The program is designed to fill the growing need for photonics engineers. Florida is home to about 270 photonics-based companies with an annual need of 270 photonics engineers. Nationally, there is a need to fill 1600 open positions. On a recent sampling of job postings, annual salaries begin at $50,000 to $70,000. Students who complete the program will be prepared for immediate employment or can pursue an advanced degree in Optics and Photonics. The U.S. Department of Labor is forecasting a need for approximately 33,000 new photonics engineers by 2024. Students who enroll in this program are required to complete 128 credit hours of instruction with 28 credit hours from coursework in electrical engineering and 40 credit hours in optics and photonics. Coursework includes classes such as Electrical Networks, Electronics, Laser Engineering, Fiber Optic Communication, Biophotonics, and Imaging and Displays. An undergraduate curriculum committee comprised of faculty and administrative staff within the college meets on a bi-weekly basis to evaluate coursework and plan for eventual ABET accreditation. Accreditation is not awarded until after the first cohort of students graduate in 2015. A second joint committee with CECS meets twice a year to ensure successful collaboration and program progress. Also meeting two times per year is the Advisory Board who advises the program on various needs that will prepare students for the workforce. In 2015, we added the final set of electives to the slate of courses offered; Optics and Photonics design was taught by Dr. Sean Pang in the spring. Dr. Aristide Dogariu taught Biophotonics in the fall. Recruitment continues through various organizations. In 2015, presentations were made to local state colleges and high schools. COP also promotes the program at Wekiva High School, which has a photonics magnet program with nearly 100 students. Promotional materials and presentations have been made available for teachers to raise awareness of the program with targeted campaigns to schools where there has historically been a significant number of students majoring in engineering. Promotional materials were also distributed at the Florida Association of Science Teachers conference held in Tallahassee in late October. 2. Academic Programs 2.1 Undergraduate Program Scholarship Funds The following scholarship funds have been established in support of students in the BS-PSE program: UCF Research Foundation Photonics in college\" students CREOL Scholarship: $50K endowment with a current value of $10K Karl H. Guenther Endowed Scholarship: $10K endowment Northrop Grumman: provides $4.5K annual to BS-PSE students Academic Programs25History of MS Enrollment since 2005Enrollment in the PhD program in AY 2014-2015 is similar to the last four years. The average prior to 2011 was higher, but was reduced in that year due to a combination of a downturn in funding which resulted in a small student intake in 2011, and a decrease in the time to graduation that was initiated in 2010/2011. Funding and enrollment has increased in the past two years and we expect this will translate to an increase in PhD enrollment in future years. The MS enrollment continues to experience a growth trend, with 29 students in AY 2014-2015. This is a result of an effort to increase the number of self-funded MS students. The average enrollment from 2005 to 2011 was 15 students, and the average between 2011 to 2014 is 32 students. A combined total of 31 new students (21 Ph.D. and 10 MS) enrolled in AY 2014-15. Graduate Recruitment and Enrollment 2.2 Graduate Programs The College has a strong focus on education at the MS and PhD levels through both coursework and research. Our graduates are highly educated and well prepared for the modern-day work force and consequently they are highly sought after in both the private sector and in top research universities. We also contribute to the undergraduate teaching mission of the university by teaching optics and photonics courses for undergraduates in other programs. Course and Program Development After significant changes to the MS program in 2013-14, there were no major changes made to our graduate programs in 2014-15. Three new courses were introduced. These were OSE 6416 Organic Photonics, OSE 6447 Attosecond Optics, and OSE 6474 Optical Communications Systems. The title of OSE 6445 was changed to Fundamentals of Ultrafast Optics from High Speed Photonics. New matriculants and scholarships for FY 2014-15 (Fall 14 - Summer 15).

The average quantitative and verbal scores have increased slightly over the last five years. Overall, we received 303 pre-applications and 188 full applications to the graduate programs for the Fall 2015 Term. The average number of pre-applications and full graduate applications received for the last five years is 342 and 202, respectively. This indicates a slight decline in the applications, particularly from international students. Our admission rate for female students grew last year, from and average of 10% per year over the last five years to 13% in AY 2014-2015_________________ * In these charts the year 14-15 accounts for Summer 14, Fall 14, and Spring 15.History of PhD five years, ETS modified the GRE exam extensively, making it difficult to analyze the Quantitative scores. Using the Percentile Ranking rather than the exam scores provided a comparative analysis that yielded the analytic information needed. The mean of 87.3% for AY 2014-2015 is higher than the five year average of 83.6% Percentile Ranking for the Quantitative Scores. The 87.3% is the highest Mean Percentile Ranking achieved over the last five years. Overall, we received 431 pre-applications and 219 full applications to the graduate programs for the AY 2014-2015. The pre-application is a preselecting tool run through our own web site that allows us to make contact with applicants early and to help advise international students as to whether to apply officially, which is an expensive undertaking for many international students Degrees Granted As shown in the chart below, the 18 PhD degrees awarded were similar to the recent average. A total of 192 PhD degrees, including optics PhDs and other PhD degrees supervised by CREOL faculty, were awarded during the 10 year period from 2004 to 2015, With the recent hiring of new faculty and growth in admissions, we anticipate the rate of PhD awards to increase in future years. The number of MS degrees awarded in academic year 2014-2015 (17) is roughly similar to previous years. The total number of degrees awarded during the 10 year period from 2004 to 2015 is 210 and the average is 19 per year. With the increase in incoming MS students, this number is expected to increase. MS degrees awarded to students leaving with an MS degree (Terminal MS) and students continuing on to the PhD degree (En-route to PhD).PhD degrees awarded to students in the Optics & Photonics program and students in other UCF programs with College of Optics & Photonics advisors. _________________ * In these charts the year 14-15 accounts for Summer 14, Fall 14, and Spring 15.

They vigorously pursue collaborative work with researchers at other academic institutions worldwide and joint research projects with industry and government laboratories. In addition to CREOL ( Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers ), which is the primary research arm of the college, three centers are also active: FPCE, TLI, and iFAST. Townes Laser Institute (TLI) The Townes Laser Institute was established in 2007 in the presence of and in honor of Charles Townes, inventor of the concept of the laser, and a 1964 Nobel Laureate for Physics. Established for the development of next-generation lasers and their uses in medicine, advanced manufacturing and defense applications, the Institute was funded by a $4.5M grant from the State of Florida, together with matching funds from UCF for 5 faculty positions and $3M for start-ups and infrastructure. Since its founding, the Townes Laser Institute has grown to a faculty of 14 and has developed major capabilities in optical fibers, attoscience, and new laser materials. It has made significant investments in optical fiber pulling facilities, pre-form fabrication, glass science, and processing. It is currently building up a comprehensive capability in transparent ceramic laser materials. Future areas of investment include mid-infrared sources and materials, medical laser technology, laser-bioengineering, advanced laser-based manufacturing, and new defense-related laser technologies including long-distance laser light propagation through the atmosphere. The Townes Laser Institute is directed by Prof. Peter Delfyett.Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) The FPCE was established with a $10 million grant from the State of Florida to create a new center of excellence within The College of Optics and Photonics at the University of Central Florida. The program began in 2003 with three primary goals: Advance excellence in research and graduate education to serve existing and emerging industry clusters in the state (photonics, optics, lasers), leverage state resources via partnerships with industry and government, and work in partnership with local, state and regional economic development organizations to attract, retain and grow knowledge-based, wealth producing industries to Florida. The focus of the FPCE research and education work has been on the technologies of nanophotonics, biophotonics, advanced imaging and 3D displays, and ultra-high bandwidth communications, all of which are forecast to experience rapid market growth. The grant has been used for developing the research infrastructure (new faculty, new facilities, new equipment), funding competitive R&D Partnership Projects at Florida universities in partnership with Florida industry, and pursuing commercialization and outreach with the help of the FPCE Industrial Advisory Board, the UCF Technology Incubator, and the Florida Photonics Cluster. 3.2 Areas of Research Five major photonics technologies are pursued in the college: lasers, optical fibers, optoelectronics and integrated photonics, nonlinear and quantum optics, and imaging, sensing and display. Research in each of these technologies covers materials, devices, and systems, and has broad applications in industry, communication, and information technology, biology and medicine, energy and lighting, aerospace, and homeland security and defense. Design of optical systems, which has been the core of optical engineering, remains a principal component of the optics discipline, and advanced topics such as nanophotonics, biophotonics, attosecond optics, and exotic optical materials and metamaterials, are being embraced as areas of strength and future growth. The college is well positioned to be a part of the revolution taking place in the areas enabled by optics and photonics. The following list describes some of the details of each research area and the applications pursued. A list of the faculty active in each of these areas and their specializations is available at http:// www.creol.ucf.edu/Research/ResearchArea.aspx The Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (iFAST) The Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (iFAST), directed by Prof. Zenghu Chang, was established in 2013. At the present time, iFAST has 6 research groups dedicated to research, education, and outreach of attosecond physics and optics. The mission is to provide unique opportunities for faculty, scientists, and students from College of Science and CREOL to closely collaborate in attosecond science research and to create and disseminate new knowledge in attosecond physics by conducting, presenting, and publishing cutting- edge fundamental and applied research, developing next generation attosecond lasers for technology transfer, and creating jobs in the State of Florida and the nation. An $8 million DARPA PULSE and a $7.5 million MURI are awarded to Chang and his collaborators to develop high energy and ultrashort attosecond light sources.3.1 Research Centers Research3.

Fluorescence is probably the most important optical readout mode because of its high sensitivity and specificity, compared with absorbance and reflectance. Whereas the remarkable breakthroughs based on fluorescence contrast, including the recent Nobel Prizes in green fluorescence protein and super-resolution microscopy, are only a couple of decades old, the fundamental optical design and data collection in the optical microscope have undergone very little change in the last 400 years. In the age of post genomics, the fundamental way we approach biological questions has been changed: more questions can and are necessary to be answered by massive data sets. In the quest of acquiring images with bigger field-of-view at a faster recording rate, microscope lenses with more complex design and sensors with higher readout speed have been developed. These approaches, reaching the performance bottleneck, make the system cost orders of magnitude higher than the common setups. The two recent research projects in Sean Pang's Optical Imaging System Lab have demonstrated alternative approaches by combining the signal reconstruction techniques with unique systems design to improve the performance in microscopic imaging at a fraction of the cost. In the first project, Pang's group have demonstrated a microscopy configuration achieving 200 frames per second with a consumer grade imager whose frame rates is 40 Hz, shown in the figure. The \"UCF\" logo was translated at speed of 2 mm/sec. Each letter of the logo has a dimension roughly 50 microns. If low-frame rate camera were used to capture the scene, we would record a blurred image with the fine features lost due to the motion. To restore the high- frame rate from low-frame rate measurement, structured illumination was employed as a coding mechanism in the prototype. Similar to super-resolution microscopy, where structured illumination has been employed to introduce a spatial frequency shift, the temporally coded multiplexing illumination channels the high temporal frequency components into low frame rate detection. The cost of such a system is essentially the same as a conventional epi-fluorescence microscope, and the setup requires minimal modification. Many fundamental biological processes, especially neural activities, which have a time scale of several millisecond, and could previously be imaged only by use of an EMCCD camera, can now be recorded by use of a conventional sensor. In addition, the imaging methodology can work with any cameras, including EMCCD or sCMOS. With the top- of-the-line sensor, the frame rate could reach 100 mega frame per second, boosting the throughput in microfluidic analysis and opening new imaging possibilities. Another effort in redesigning the microscope aims to increase its field-of-view (FOV). Due to limits imposed by optical aberrations, common microscope objectives (20\u00d7) have an FOV less than 1 mm. To scale up the FOV, additional lens elements are necessary, leading to a lower transmission objective with higher design and material cost. Pang's group came up with a compact microscopic imaging system utilizing the Talbot effect to project a grid of excitation light spots focused onto the sample which is placed on a CMOS sensor chip (see Figure 2). The fluorescence emission associated with each focal spot is collected by the sensor chip and are used to form a sparsely sampled fluorescence image. By scanning the Talbot focal spot grid across the sample and collecting a sequence of local images, a high-resolution fluorescence image can be reconstructed. In contrast to a conventional microscope, the collection efficiency, resolution, and FOV of the system are not tied to each other for this technique. As a result, the FOV of the system is directly scalable. A resolution of 1.2 m was demonstrated in a prototype, and the collection efficiency is equivalent to that of a conventional microscope objective with a 0.70 N.A. The FOV is 100 times greater than a 20\u00d7/0.40 NA conventional microscope objective. As the cellphone industry drove the cost of a CMOS sensor down to ~$2 apiece, a lensless microscope will bring the system's cost to less than $100. Due to its large FOV, high collection efficiency, compactness, and its potential for integration with other on-chip devices, FTM is suitable for diverse applications, such as point-of-care diagnostics, large-scale screening, and long-term automated imaging.

Most simplistically, ultrashort pulse laser filamentation describes the situation in which nonlinear self-focusing is sufficient to overpower linear diffraction and induces a collapse of the beam profile. At some point during the collapse, additional nonlinear processes counteract the initial self-focusing to form a region over which the beam propagates with a spike in the beam profile at a fixed intensity and fixed diameter. The process of filamentation is associated with ionization of the air and supercontinuum generation, which provide insight into the process of filamentation and are useful in a variety of applications, but which also take energy from the filament such that the beam expands after some propagation distance. This process depends upon the linear/nonlinear optical properties of the propagation medium and the beam distribution with respect to polarization, space, spectrum, and time. Whereas the illustration depicts the formation of a single filament with a peak intensity of ~7x1013 W/ cm2 from a laser with 3-10 GW peak power and ~50 fs pulse duration at 800 nm center wavelength, the complexity of the situation increases as the initial peak power is scaled up. Effectively the processes that balance Kerr lensing and clamp the maximum intensity of the filament cause the beam to form multiple filaments. Given the interplay between the properties of the laser and the propagation medium, the formation of multiple filaments is extremely sensitive and flexible experiments are critical for generating the data necessary to improve existing theory and modeling. It is highly desirable to be able to engineer array structures based upon filaments in air, as shown in the photo. While the short scale plasma array shown here corresponds to high numerical aperture focusing and therefore is not filamentation, it provides an illustration of the potential hyperbolic metamaterials that could be generated in air, as was noted in a Nature Communications article in 2013 with colleagues from University of Buffalo.Nonlinear phenomena are fundamental to laser optics and photonics throughout a wide range of fields. However, these are generally neglected or intentionally avoided when considering free-space propagation of laser beams over >10 m. Ordinarily, air is considered a linear propagation medium although this is not true for sufficiently high laser intensities. Focusing laser beams to extremely high laser intensities is common in many fields such as inertial confinement fusion, coherent and incoherent X-ray/EUV generation, and to a lessor degree laser materials processing; however, in such cases the free-space propagation to the target is assumed or engineered to be linear often by operating at low pressure to reduce absorption, dispersion and/or nonlinear effects in air. The ability to project laser beams with high intensity controllably over long range is highly desirable for emerging applications, most notably remote sensing. As part of various research efforts at CREOL have shown, the control of long-range propagation of high intensity laser pulses fundamentally requires understanding of both linear and nonlinear phenomena. Although not unique to ultrashort laser pulses, the interplay of nonlinear and linear propagation is fundamental to ultrashort pulse laser filamentation in air. CREOL is central to filamentation research in the US, from studying the fundamental physics to developing \"real world\" applications. With Array of plasmas induced from a single femtosecond laser beamOptical Multi-Filament Engineering From controlled super-continuum generation to novel RF waveguides 2015 Research highlights Matthieu Baudelet Martin Richardson Lawrence Shah Self-focusing Filamentation White light Energy ReservoirFilament funding from multiple agencies (most notably ARO, AFOSR, and JTO) as part of collaborative research with groups within UCF as well as several other universities, the Laser and Plasma Laboratory is in the process of major facility improvements to support several initiatives in long-range filament projection and engineering. A laser development team lead by Lawrence Shah has recently completed \"shake-down\" experiments of the multi-terawatt laser facility (MTFL) and filamentation test ranges. The laser itself is a homemade Ti:sapphire system producing 230 mJ pulses with < 50 fs pulse duration at 10 Hz. During the design and construction of this system, several features have been incorporated to optimize long-term stability and thereby minimize noise in filamentation data. In particular, numerous methods are in place to maximize beam quality by mitigating intensity modulation, aberration and spatial chirp as these have significant impact on filamentation. For propagation experiments, we use two ranges. A 10-m in-lab range provides us with the ability to characterize the beam and the resultant \"secondary effects\" in detail under controlled conditions along the propagation length. Since certain filamentation conditions cannot be achieved within a 10-m range, a supplementary 50-m range has been developed utilizing a building service chase. Although the propagation environment is not as controlled as the in-lab range, this facility is critical to demonstrate the design of multiple filaments and the creation of specific profile structures along the propagation axis. With the addition of DURIP funding, the team is completing the construction of Chamber for Laser Propagation Through Aerosol Medium (CLaPTAM) to broaden their studies to include the interactions of laser filaments with clouds and they are in the midst of construction of a novel Mobile Ultrafast High Energy Laser Facility (MUHELF) that will enable km-range propagation of ultrashort pulse filaments at the Townes Innovative Science and Technology Experimental Facility (TISTEF). 41Ultra-Broadband Frequency Combs Span the Mid-Infrared Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) have long been recognized as a versatile means of producing optical output in important spectral regions unreachable by laser sources. The mid-IR (> 2.5 \u00b5m) is one such region, rich in spectroscopic information but underpopulated by convenient laser lines. In a typical OPO, a laser pumps a suitable optical material having second-order nonlinear susceptibility. When combined with an appropriate resonator for optical feedback, the OPO splits a photon into two photons (signal and idler) with longer wavelengths. The oscillation wavelength is tuned by adjusting the parameters of the resonator or nonlinear material. With their broad tunability OPOs are extensively for mid- IR spectroscopy. Quantum- cascade lasers (QCLs) now offer a tantalizing alternative to OPOs, although with somewhat smaller tuning range. It is challenging however, for both OPOs and QCLs, to be tuned in a precise and continuous fashion, preserving narrow- linewidth single-longitudinal-mode operation for precision spectroscopic measurements. Fourier Transform (FT) spectroscopy is a nice mathematical trick that helps evade this limitation. As originally proposed by Michelson more than a century years ago, one can perform high-resolution spectroscopy even with a broadband source. To retrieve the whole optical spectrum one just needs to interfere an optical beam with its time- delayed replica and then take a Fourier transform of the detector signal versus time delay dependence. The gold rush for creating broadband mid-IR frequency combs - laser sources with the output consisting of manifold of equally spaced phase locked spectral lines - began a decade ago. A number of techniques were used that include mode-locked lasers, optical rectification, difference-frequency generation, OPOs, whispering gallery microresonators, and QCLs. Doubly resonant OPOs operating at degeneracy, pioneered by the group of Konstantin Vodopyanov, are a special class of synchronously pumped OPOs that combine low pump threshold with an exceptionally broad oscillation bandwidth. These devices can produce a broadband frequency comb centered at twice the pump wavelength. Most importantly, they inherit the coherence properties of the pump laser. Vodopyanov and his team have demonstrated broadband mid-IR combs in a number of degenerate (subharmonic) OPO systems niobate orientation-patterned gallium arsenide (OP-GaAs) crystals as the nonlinear optical material. These were combined with a variety of pump sources including erbium- fiber (1.56 m) thulium-fiber (2 m), Cr:ZnSe (2.45 m) and Cr:ZnS (2.35 \u00b5m) mode- locked lasers. With the thulium-fiber pump, a world-record mid-IR frequency comb spectral span of 2.6 to 7.5 \u00b5m was achieved in 2015. Such frequency comb is especially suitable for massively parallel, simultaneously broadband and high-resolution spectroscopy, based on the Fourier transform principle. The most attractive approach is dual-comb (or multi-heterodyne) spectroscopy, when two phase-locked frequency combs having a small offset in the comb spacing are combined and used for interrogating molecular spectral signatures. Operating in the middle of the spectroscopically important \"fingerprint\" region, where OH, CH, CO, and NH bonds show their strongest vibrational signatures has allowed sensitive (down to part-per- billion concentration) real-time (~1 sec) and massively parallel (about a million spectral points) trace gases measurements through their effect on the OPO spectrum. Also, there is an on-going research in Vodopyanov's lab (DARPA SCOUT program) - on creating a chip-scale broadband mid-IR comb for the real- time and real-world molecular sensing. 2015 Research highlightsLeft: Broadband subharmonic GaAs OPO system pumped by a mode-locked Tm-fiber laser produces a frequency comb spanning 2.6-7.5 \u00b5m.

Konstantin Vodopyanov Mid-infrared subharmonic optical parametric oscillators (OPO) produce frequency comb light with one-and-half-octave-wide instantaneous band and superior temporal coherence, suitable for real-time trace molecular detection. World-record mid-IR frequency comb with 2.6-7.5 \u00b5m spectral span 42 Achromatic Phase Elements Over the last decades phase masks have found numerous applications including imaging, encryption, beam shaping, and mode conversion. There are two typical methods of making such masks. The first one controls the local geometrical path length by generating a contoured surface while the second method changes the local refractive index in the bulk of a photosensitive medium such as lithium niobate or photosensitive glass. Both methods can be employed to generate phase masks with almost any profile. However, because the phase shift is induced by changing the local optical path length these phase masks are inherently limited to use at a specific wavelength, which limits the range of potential applications. To extend this range achromatic phase masks have been previously produced utilizing complex fabrication approaches. Leonid Glebov and his group recently developed a new holographic element that can be utilized as achromatic phase plate. It is generated by encoding stepped or grey level phase mask profiles into transmitting volume Bragg grating (TBG) and is named \"holographic phase mask\" (HPM). It was shown that HPMs can produce identical to a standard phase plate diffracted phase profiles over a wide range of wavelengths as long as the Bragg condition of the volume grating is satisfied. The HPM also utilizes the diffraction characteristics of a TBG, which can diffract up to 100% of a beam into a single order, and can diffract over a broad range of wavelengths by changing the angle of incidence (with the diffraction efficiency depending on the wavelength and strength of the grating). The high angular selectivity of a TBG also allows for several TBGs to be multiplexed into the same element with little to no cross-talk between gratings; each grating is accessed by altering the beam's angle of incidence onto the element. It is important to note that a Bragg grating is the simplest volume hologram, which, unlike more complex holograms, can diffract narrow wavelength band incoming at a given angle, without distorting the beam profile. By encoding phase levels which cover a macroscopic area, the HPM acts locally as a standard TBG with a given phase shift. Thus the HPM will diffract in the same manner as a standard TBG except at the relatively small number of phase discontinuities, and the diffracted beam's phase profile will match the encoded phase level profile regardless of incident wavelength. The HPM therefore acts as a spectrally addressable phase mask.To simplify fabrication and to provide a clear demonstration of the phenomenon binary phase profiles were used to create HPM, but the approach is fully applicable for multi-level phase masks as well. To show the unique properties, a four-sector binary phase mask was chosen as an example. The expected far field intensity profile for a beam passing through the center of a four-sector regular binary phase mask consists of a four-lobed clover pattern. As shown in the figure, for three very different Bragg wavelengths (632.8 nm, 975 nm, and 1064 nm), the diffracted beam profiles exhibited the predicted four-lobed pattern. This clearly confirms that the binary phase profile is being preserved in the diffracted order for an extremely broad range of wavelengths. True achromatization of HPMs can be achieved with the concept of pairing the Bragg grating with two surface gratings According to the well-known grating dispersion equation a surface grating with a given period (SG) will diffract normally incident light an angle () in different orders as a function of wavelength (). Simultaneously, from coupled wave theory, a VBG will diffract light highly efficient at the Bragg condition. In order for the diffraction angles to match and therefore the surface and volume gratings to work together the condition comes to: Therefore, if the surface grating period is double the period of the volume Bragg grating, then any first order diffraction by normally incident light will be at the corresponding Achromatization by Combined Volume Bragg Gratings & Surface Diffraction Gratings Bragg condition of the volume Bragg grating and that will hold for any wavelength. If an identical surface grating is added in a mirror orientation to the transmitting volume Bragg grating like shown in the figure, the dispersion will be completely canceled and the outgoing beam will be re-collimated. Applying this concept to the holographic phase mask alleviated the need for angle tuning so the Bragg condition can be met, making it a fully achromatic phase element. The experiments conducted with such system demonstrated highly efficient mode conversion from a Gaussian to a TEM11 mode for a range of more than 300 nm without the need for any angular adjustments. Prof. Glebov's group continues to implement VBGs in many high- and low-power laser and photonics applications. 2015 Research highlights(a) Simulated far field profile of a beam after passing through an ideal four-sector binary mask and the diffracted beam from a four-sector HPM at (b) 632.8 1064 nm.

Intense research efforts on optical nanocomposites are being motivated by the fascinating prospect that these materials can assume the optical properties of the inorganic phase and yet be processed with the shape versatility, low-cost and ease of polymeric materials. In the area of radiation sensing for example, the United States Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been tasked to screen every cargo container crossing domestic borders for illicit radioactive material. This is accomplished by using gamma-ray spectrometers capable of discriminating regulated special nuclear materials from non-threatening radioisotopes. To this end, scintillation detector systems, specifically thallium-doped sodium iodide (Tl:NaI) single crystals, are by far the most popular due to their reasonable performance and cost. In recent years, however, the demand for scintillator materials with improved light- yield, timing and energy resolution resulted in a wealth of new materials with attractive properties. Remarkable single-crystals, such as Ce:LaBr3 and Eu:SrI2, with light outputs and energy resolution surpassing those of Tl:NaI, have been discovered but, the difficulty of their growth and size-scalability are currently limiting their commercialization. Transparent ceramic scintillators, in which CREOL's Optical Ceramics Laboratory led by Dr. Romain Gaume is actively engaged in, offer valuable alternatives to this scalability issue. Yet, in a serendipitous research twist, Gaume's group developed an innovative method to fabricate monolithic transparent hybrid nanocomposites with very high particle loading and high refractive index mismatch tolerance between the inorganic and organic constituents. By providing adequate radiation stopping power, such high-loading fraction composites would yet provide another means to scale-up the size of scintillation detectors. Hybrid scintillator composites consist of nano- to micro-scale luminescent phosphors dispersed in liquid monomers that are cured into near net-shape bulk size scintillators. This fabrication strategy uses inexpensive organic matrices and does not require the growth of large crystals. The dispersion of particles in an organic host however is of paramount importance to obtain composites of high optical quality. Nano-scale powders tend to agglomerate into clusters, and the refractive index mismatch between the powders and the organic phase leads to light scattering even when the refractive indices of the inorganic and organic phases are closely matched. The new concept proposed by the CREOL team takes advantage of two complementary techniques: (i) the production of high- quality ceramic powder-compacts (so called \"green-bodies\") used and being developed for the fabrication of transparent ceramics and (ii) a polymer impregnation technique. Ceramic green-bodies, made by consolidation of unagglomerated particles, form an open network of interconnected porosity suitable for liquid monomer impregnation. The characteristic of the so-called ceramic open-porosity determines the inorganic loading of the composite once infiltrated by the monomer and the size of the polymer inclusions which form after in-situ polymerization. Thus, the inorganic volume fraction of the nanocomposites can be varied through the use of different green-body forming techniques. This new approach was demonstrated on acrylate-based nanocomposites containing over 60 vol% (i.e. 84 wt%) CaF2 nanoparticles. Because of its versatility, the technique could be advantageously used om other applications including optical sensing, low-power lasers, Christiansen filters, information storage and even beyond the realm of optical materials.

CREOL Christodoulides Winston Schoenfeld623.8 Affiliated Research Centers The University of Central Florida has several nationally and internationally recognized research institutes in addition to the three at CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics that are devoted to research and development. Advanced Materials Processing and Analysis Center The Advanced Materials Processing and Analysis Center (AMPAC) is an interdisciplinary research and education center for materials science and engineering, one of two major UCF research centers that comprise the Center of Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology. Our two university-wide multi-user facilities \u2014 the Materials Characterization Facility (MCF) and the Advanced Microfabrication Facility (AMF) - are available to all researchers at UCF and from outside companies, government labs, and universities, enabling them to perform cutting- edge research, and to train and educate students and other personnel in the use of state-of-the-art equipment. AMPAC's vision is to make UCF an international leader in materials science and engineering research and education by excelling in the development, processing and characterization of advanced materials to achieve prominence in targeted research areas; providing leadership to the UCF Materials Science and Engineering research and education program; and enhancing economic growth and promoting industrial development through effective partnerships with industry NanoScience Technology Center In 2004 the Nanoscience Technology Center (NSTC) was formed with formed with a $4M grant from the state of Florida when leaders recognized the potential of nanotechnology as its applications in medicine, materials, computing and electronics began entering the mainstream. Since that time, NSTC has consolidated UCF researchers across multiple disciplines and hired many more to better respond to nanoscience funding opportunities and to develop the technologies demanded by the industries of the future. In 2007 the NSTC officially opened a 20,000- square-foot renovated research facility in the Central Florida Research Park. A total of 19 faculty, 7 staff and more than hundred graduate students, postdocs, researchers at the center are creating tools to treat neurological diseases; materials that can advance solar and fuel cell technology; and longer batteries that can make ever- smaller electrical devices a reality. Current research areas include Green Energy, In Vitro Test Systems, Functional Nanomaterials, Computer/ Mathematical Simulations, Quantum Dynamics, Nano-Bio-Imaging, NanoElectronics & NanoPhysics, and Integrated Device Development. Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences The Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences is an integral part of the UCF College of Medicine, making the college a research-intensive medical school where cutting edge medical research spans the entire spectrum from laboratory bench to bedside of the patients, providing a great environment of training physicians and biomedical researchers.
