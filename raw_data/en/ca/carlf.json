Another guy walks by, holding what look like large leftover bags from a restaurant. Guy With Bags: [stops and offers the bags] would you like something to eat?

Saturday, January 26, 2008 An Unusual Recruiting Pitch Women in their sophomore or junior year of college who are thinking about doing research and going to graduate school should read this article (via Andrew Sullivan). Living the life of the mind is very rewarding, and, apparently, the chances of dating male models are not bad either. (If the author could get some mileage out of being an undergrad at Harvard, just imagine what it can do for you to be a grad student at Berkeley!) Thursday, January 24, 2008 Finally! After a hiatus of almost four year, the graduate computational complexity course returns to Berkeley. To get started, I proved Cook's non-deterministic hierarchy theorem, a 1970s result with a beautifully clever proof, which I first learned from Sanjeev Arora. (And that is not very well known.) Though the full result is more general, say we want to prove that there is a language in NP that cannot be solved by non-deterministic Turing machines in time $o(n^3)$. (If one does not want to talk about non-deterministic Turing machines, the same proof will apply to other quantitative restrictions on NP, such as bounding the length of the witness and the running time of the verification.) In the deterministic case, where we want to find a language in P not solvable in time $o(n^3)$, it's very simple. We define the language $L$ that contains all pairs $(\\langle T\\rangle,x)$ where: (i) $T$ is a Turing machine, (ii) $x$ is a binary string, (iii) $T$ rejects the input $(\\langle T\\rangle,x)$ within $|(\\langle T\\rangle,x)|^3$ steps, where $|z|$ denotes the length of a string $z$. It's easy to see that $L$ is in P, and it is also easy to see that if a machine $M$ could decide this problem in time $\\leq n^3$ on all sufficiently large inputs, then the behavior of $M$ on input $\\langle M\\rangle,x$, for every $x$ long enough, leads to a contradiction. We could try the same with NP, and define $L$ to contain pairs $(\\langle T\\rangle,x)$ such that $T$ is a non-deterministic Turing machine that has no accepting path of length $\\leq |\\langle T\\rangle,x|^3$ on input $(\\langle T\\rangle,x)$. It would be easy to see that $L$ cannot be solved non-deterministically in time $o(n^3)$, but it's hopeless to prove that $L$ is in NP, because in order to solve $L$ we need to decide whether a given non-deterministic Turing machine rejects, which is, in general, a coNP-complete problem. Here is Cook's argument. Define the function $f(k)$ as follows: $f(1):=2$, $f(k):= 2^{(1+f(k-1))^3}$. Hence, $f(k)$ is a tower of exponentials of height $k$. Now define the language $L$ as follows. $L$ contains all pairs $\\langleT \\rangle,0^t$ T\\rangle$ is a non-deterministic $0^t$ is a sequence of $t$ zeroes such that one of the following conditions is satisfied There is a $k$ such that $f(k)=t$, and $T$ has no accepting computation input $\\langle T\\rangle,0^{1+f(k-1)}$ of running time $\\leq (1+(f(k-1))^3$; $t$ is not of the form $f(k)$ for any $k$, and $T$ has an accepting computation on input $\\langle T\\rangle,0^{1+t}$ of running time $\\leq (t+1)^3$. Now let's see that $L$ is in NP. When we are given an input $\\langle T\\rangle,0^t$ we can first check if there is a $k$ such that $f(k)=t$. If there is, we can compute $t':=f(k-1)$ and deterministically simulate all computations of $T$ on inputs $\\langle T\\rangle,0^{t'}$ up to running time $t'^3$. This takes time $2^{O(t'^3)}$ which is polynomial in $t$. Otherwise, we non-deterministically simulate $T$ on input $\\langle T\\rangle,0^{t+1}$ for up to $(t+1)^3$ steps. (And reject after time-out.) In either case, we are correctly deciding the language. Finally, suppose that $L$ could be decided by a non-deterministic Turing machine $M$ running in time $o(n^3)$. In particular, for all sufficiently large $t$, the machine runs in time $\\leq t^3$ on input $\\langle M\\rangle,0^t$. Choose $k$ to be sufficiently large so that for every $t$ in the interval $1+f(k-1),...,f(k)$ the above property is true. Now we can see that $M$ accepts $(\\langle M\\rangle,0^{f(k-1)+1})$ if and only if $M$ accepts $(\\langle M\\rangle,0^{f(k-1)+2})$ if and only if ... if and only if $M$ accepts $(\\langle M\\rangle,0^{f(k)})$ if and only if $M$ rejects $(\\langle M\\rangle,0^{f(k-1)+1})$, and we have our contradiction.

Mmmh, roast piglets are very delicious indeed! I'm guessing the ban on pigs could be an act of deference to those whose religion forbids the consumption of pork.

The British Rubber Manufacturer Association strongly recommends NOT to drive with tires older than 6 years. Ford Motor has asked the federal government to implement ban on tires older than 6 years. But the tire industry lobby in the U.S. has been strong and does not recognize this 6-year term.

Filed under Bulgaria, in English, politics Standard daily reports today: 100 . brief: The news is that a taxicab driver at Sunny beach (a Black sea resort) has forced his client to pay him Leva 100 (Euro 50) for a ride which should have been no more than a few euro. The driver has agreed to take two Dutch men from the Kuban hotel to their own hotel, and then to a disco for Euro 7. When they arrived at the disco, though, the taxi driver asked for Leva 96 - which was shown on the taximeter*. The Dutch refused, and left Leva 20. Driver locked the doors from the inside, and pulled out a knife, touching the body of one of the tourists. Scared, the latter paid the required amount of money. The police has started an investigation after the tourist complained. My comment: This is a clear example of what I've been writing in the last months - it is not the government that is responsible for everything. It is each of us, Bulgarians, who should be taking care of our own country. Why would the taxi driver want to cheat the Dutch? Just because they might have been drunk? Or because he probably believed that they are not as smart as himself? Or because he is desperate from his life, but instead of trying to work as a normal cab driver, he prefers to show what a big hero he is, and with a knife... But this driver is not alone; the taxi drivers in all cities have formed an informal mafia-style coordination, when they want to protest, they just get on their cars, and go and block the main streets of the city. Few years ago they've blocked the whole building of the Parliament. There are a number of cases, where they would get together, and beat their customers, if they have tried to defend their rights. Of course, there are customers, who are jerks, but by using brutal force, knives, gas-sprays, etc., one does not solve problems, but rather creates more problems. _____ [Comments (3)] [link] Wednesday, July 23, 2008 by Veni Markovski @ 23:57.

Filed under US, in English Read more... Have you ever heard about it? If you live in New York City, and have used a cab (taxi) here, you've seen their name on the back of the window that separates the driver from the passengers (yes, like in the movies). Last month I tried to send them a letter via their web site, congratulating a particular driver who took me from the airport to the city. I tried to find a place to express my good feelings, but - no... None. Check it out: only three different options for online contact: File a Complaint, File a Lost Property Report, and Apply for a TLC license. Well, I went to \"file a complaint\", but instead wrote my positive feedback. To my astonishment, two weeks later I got a letter (yes, on paper), signed by the commissioner Matthew W. Daus, saying among other things: \"I am pleased to report to you that your commendation joins the many that we receive on a daily basis attesting to the superior customer service offered by the NYC taxicab drivers. It would be my great pleasure to consider your exemplary driver for appropriate honors at the next scheduled NYC TLC Driver Recognition Ceremony.\" I wrote them back on paper, and got a response today by email, with more feedback. What impresses me most, is that they are really taking into account the positive feedback. Now, I know for sure they take seriously the complaints, but then, who can say they've always been perfect in their performance, and request the same from the poor taxicab drivers in one of the biggest cities in the world? I prefer to save the complaints, but when someone is performing well, to send positive feedback. The taxicab driver who took me from the airport in June was a woman, with the cleanest, tidiest, best maintained taxi I've seen. She totally deserved the credit. P.S. I still hope that their web site will add a line for positive feedback. Enough with the complaints, give the other customers some chance, too :) [Comments (2)] [link] Saturday, July 19, 2008 by Veni Markovski @ 15:51. Filed under Bulgaria, microsoft, , , ? , ? ( )? ? ?

I read this joke a long time back, when I was tutoring an undergraduate class, in this book. A group of theorists was discussing some open problems, that could be trivial (but nobody could see the triviality) to solve, and the joke was mentioned.

A: It's basically a rather grand name for planning and organising web sites. Before a web site is built someone has to architect what it's going to do and vaguely what it will look like. This is the job of an information architect. The job has some similarities with a real architect, but not many. This is my blog on information architecture and design. The user experience of a toilet on South West Trains July 24th, 2008 Here are the 10 most recent entries: Whitney Hess's recent post about the user experience of a staircase reminded me that user experience design is everywhere and affects us everyday.

Not because I don't like them or find them useful, but because they make even the simplest tasks like texting and emailing really slow to load and I've been having serious keyboard slowdown. When opening my texts, I wait 20 seconds for my texts to be visible; i wait up to 30 seconds sometimes for the keyboard to catch up to my fingers. I never had these problems before. I also found the apps themselves are kinda crappy and often take forever to load, if they'd even load at all. To keep my word, below is a critique of all the apps I talked about in my previous post. Here is my official MonkeyButt list for iAppssm (title graciously suggested by THE Paisano, *hat tip.*) Typepad: I cannot get into blogging from my mobile phone. A few months back Typepad launched improved mobile blogging features and although this app is a great addition, I don't like blogging from my phone. I am too slow typing on my iPhone and I am unable to edit and add images/multimedia to the post with the ease that I can when blogging from my laptop. AIM: Didn't work at all. Could not even get it to load, at all. This was the first app I deleted, so moving on.... MoPhoto: To be honest, I never even opened this app. Flickr makes posting photos from my phone to my Flickr account incredibly easy. I email photos from my phone using my designated Flickr email. I never even gave this app a chance. SunCompass: I wanted this to work so bad. I use Hopstop a lot for getting around NYC and the directions always say \"go north\" or \"head south,\" and I never have any clue which way to turn. To my disappointment, this app did not work for me. It took way too long for the app to figure out which way is which. Jamd: As much as I wanted to use this to keep up with pop culture/celebrity news, it seems I just don't care enough about the world of glamour to use it. Bank of America: I like this app a lot, but I've always been able to easily access my account on the BOA website via my iPhone browser. I removed it because my iPhone is so slow now with these apps, so if I don't need it or love it, it's gone. New York Times: Who am I kidding, I don't read news on the go, on my iPhone, ever. The only time I want to read news on phone- is on the Subway, which is impossible because no phone service underground. (So, while in transit, I read fiction bestsellers instead.) Google: This app loads but then freezes and does not allow me to enter any text for at least 90 seconds. I can't wait that long. I am actually thinking I might try to keep this one, I do like using it better than the iPhone Safari browser. Jott: Jott is a great organization and voice-to-text service, that I never fully got into. Thought I'd give it another whirl, but I quickly realized it was redundant as I am using a great task/note organization service at work already. July 25, 2008 iPhone 2.0 Software Update and Applications I finally took the time to update my iPhone with the new 2.0 software. The new searching and storing features included in the update are fantastic and were much needed. I can now search my contacts in a search box, instead of having to scroll through my contacts alphabetically; delete multiple emails at once, instead of having to select, load and delete each email individually; and easily organize emails into folders. Other new features like the scientific calculator and language dictionary I could care less about, but I still wish it had the ability to cut, copy and paste. Oh well, maybe next time. The new applications I've synced to my iPhone are AWESOME. I can't get enough of them and I can't stop searching for new ones on the iTunes store everyday. Here is a sample of what I've downloaded so far. I'll post a follow up with a review of the applications once I get time to really use them all. What do you think of the apps? Are there any that you think I should try that are not pictured here? July 22, 2008 Facebook New Profile Design I am not sure how I feel about the new look and feel of Facebook. I am a HUGE fan of tabbed browsing, as anyone I work with can attest to the endless number of tabs I have open at any given moment, but I liked how the old Facebook profile lived on one page. It may be technically better, but it will definitely take some time to get used to. Living in New York City I never thought I would move to NYC in my lifetime. Too big, too noisy, too dirty, too much of... well... everything. However, to my astonishment, I have found too much of everything is just enough for me. I have made this crazy city my home, and now I can't imagine living anywhere else (at least for a while.) In the process of moving here I discovered Roosevelt Island, a 2-mile long, 800-foot wide strip of land, between Manhattan and Queens. After checking out an apartment building on R.I., The Octagon, I was sold. Living here can be a hassle at times, but I enjoy the separation from the city, the East River currents, the giant barges and tugboats, the extravagant yachts, and the extending, glimmering shoreline of Manhattan. I think of how it compares to Boston, where I lived for 6 years up until January, and it makes my old Boston life seem like it was routine and static. There is an endless/countless/limitless assortment of things to do and people to meet in NYC. In Boston, it was always the same old thing; in New York, even if I do the same thing everyday, new things discover me. I am learning so much about myself, culture and society from living here. My personal growth in the last 7 months has been something to write home to mom about. New York City is feeding my imagination; inspiration is around every corner here. **I took this photo from my backyard, on a small boardwalk that extends into the East River across from E 46th St. It shows the shoreline moving along towards Downtown and Brooklyn. The bridge, in the far distance, is the Queensboro Bridge. July 10, 2008 National Grid Floe My colleague Yianni showed me this wildly interactive website by the National Grid called Floe. This is launched at the heals of news that Polar Bears are now an endangered species. Oh NO! Save the Polar Bear! The Floe site from National Grid does a great job at using the case of the Polar Bear to teach consumers about easy, everyday energy efficient habits that make a big difference for the environment. The website is phenomenal being both highly engaging and educative. I would suggest checking it out... you might learn a thing or two about what you can do to save the earth (and yourself) from global warming. June 25, 2008 Twitter Rumors I follow close to 3,000 people on Twitter and am witness to all types of crazy conversations, shared thoughts and heated debates. People find answers, love, new jobs and invaluable advice on Twitter. At the same time - hundreds of rumors are started, secrets are told, and news stories are leaked everyday on Twitter, making it the place to find and debate the best gossip around. I was sucked into a twitter rumor today. It was tweeted and I contemplated it, questioned it with my followers and searched Google to find the truth. After my investigation, I am pleased to Announce to the World that Jared Fogel, Subway's legendary spokesman, is not, in fact, dead. I was so sad this morning when I was unsure, but now I am sure -- Jared is still alive not only in our hearts, but also on this earth. Hooray! I would love to know, how many rumors are started, debated and killed on Twitter daily. The birth and lifecycle of twumors (twitterrumors) is fast paced, and well nutured by all of us who participate. There are pages of twitter search results from today alone, with people announcing, denouncing and debating Jared's death. I am also quite interested to know who is behind jaredremembered.com. Subway and its agencies? Some random dude in San Diego? Apparently, the rumor was debated as early as August of last year. And where are Jared's fans and supporters defending his life? Long live Jared! In any case, hat tip to the mastermind(s) - you got me.

That Orac has chosen his pseudonym based on a rather cranky and arrogant computer shaped like a clear box of blinking lights from an old British SF show whose special effects were renowned for their early 1980's BBC/Doctor Who-style low budget look, but whose stories nonetheless resulted in some of the best, most innovative science fiction for television ever produced, should tell you nearly all that you need to know about Orac.

In essence, I cannot post, and comments, although saved, do not show up. Until the techies get this problem fixed, I'm posting here at the old blog.] Monday, February 20, 2006 David Irving on trial Well, that was fast. The trial took less than a day. David Irving, as expected, pleaded guilty. As expected, he was found guilty of Holocaust denial. What was not expected was the severity of the sentence: VIENNA, Feb. 20 (AP) \u2014 The British historian David Irving on Monday pleaded guilty to denying the Holocaust and was sentenced to three years in prison. He conceded that he was wrong when he said there were no Nazi gas chambers at the Auschwitz death camp. Mr. Irving, handcuffed and wearing a navy blue suit, arrived in court carrying a copy of one of his books, \"Hitler's War,\" which challenges the extent of the Holocaust. \"I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz,\" he told the court before his sentencing, at which he faced up to 10 years in prison. \"In no way did I deny the killings of millions of people by the Nazis,\" testified Mr. Irving, who has written nearly 30 books. He also expressed sorrow \"for all the innocent people who died during the Second World War.\" Mr. Irving's lawyer, Elmar Kresbach, immediately announced that he would appeal the sentence. \"I consider the verdict a little too stringent,\" he said. \"I would say it's a bit of a message trial.\" Mr. Irving appeared shocked as the sentence was read. Moments later, an elderly man who identified himself as a family friend called out, \"Stay strong, David! Stay strong!\" The man was escorted from the courtroom.I have to say, I was shocked myself when I read of it. Three years in prison for nothing more than offensive speech? Is this what we've come to? I understand all the arguments that Holocaust denial has a different resonance in Germany and Austria than it does in the U.S. I understand that the history of the Third Reich and the Holocaust leads to a particular sensitivity in these countries that we don't share, that Holocaust denial is feared as a vehicle for the resurgence of Nazi-ism and fascism. I can even understand how, in the early postwar period, such laws may have been essential to protect the their fledgling democracies. But there comes a time to take the training wheels off. It's been over 60 years since the end of World War II, well over two full generations. How much longer do they need these laws? Will they proscribe free speech in this way forever? The bottom line is that, not only are laws against Holocaust denial an offense against free speech, but they don't work. They suppress nothing. David Irving got more publicity in Austria than he had gotten in six years. Before, he was fading into well-deserved obscurity. Now he's a martyr for the far right. His writings and those of many other Holocaust deniers are easily accessible on the web, yes, even in Austria. Suppressing it only confirms the claims of the Holocaust deniers that the government is \"afraid\" of their message. For an example of how properly to deal with Holocaust deniers, one has only to look to Northwestern University in Evanston. There, one of the granddaddies of Holocaust denial in the U.S., Arthur R. Butz, is a tenured Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Northwestern who in 1976 wrote a book called The Hoax of the 20th Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry. Since then, he has used his tenured position to give stature to his denial, all the while being very careful not to give the administration of Northwestern a reason (such as preaching Holocaust denial in his engineering class) to try to get rid of him. Not much had been heard from ol' Butzy recently, until he started defending the President of Iran for his Holocaust denial, going so far, after repeating a bunch of canards about the long-debunked Leuchter Report, to say in an editorial in the student newspaper: That brings us to President Ahmadinejad of Iran. For many years I ignored revisionism coming from Islamic countries, because I found it inept. With Ahmadinejad, I found something else; his statements were formidable in their perspicacity. My original statement on him has to be read to make the specifics clear. He understands the intellectual terror in the West. However, the best surprise came after I wrote my endorsement. British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a routine pompous suggestion to Ahmadinejad: Visit the camps and see for yourself. Ahmadinejad replied: Good idea, I'll bring a scientific team. He knows about the forensic issues too.Given how inept Butz's denial is, one has to wonder how truly poorly argued the Holocaust denial coming out of the Middle East must be for even Butz to turn his nose up at it. But I digress. Deborah Lipstadt responded with a strong article slapping down Butz and pointing out that the editors of the student newspaper had been so open minded that their brains fell out. Also appropriate is a reaction by the very students of Northwestern called the Never Again campaign: The Never Again Campaign is an organization started by students at Northwestern University in February of 2006. The campaign aims to increase Holocaust education, promote global tolerance, and stop genocides that are occurring today around the world. The Never Again Campaign will bring speakers, host workshops, and offer resources to spread awareness about these issues on the Northwestern campus. Similarly, we hope to convince other universities to adopt our goals. Recently, Northwestern engineering Professor, Arthur Butz, denied the Holocaust and congratulated the President of Iran on becoming the first modern head of state to deny the Holocaust. In response, students and faculty have come together to express their outrage and disappointment that a Northwestern professor made such an offensive and historically inaccurate declaration.Their goal? To get Northwestern, as a private institution, to stop letting Butz use its public website to spread his lies, because doing so associates the name of the University with his denial, and to take actions to repudiate his Holocaust denial and to marginalize him, given the black eye he's given the institution. As I said yesterday, freedom of speech is easy to value and honor when the speech isn't offensive. It becomes much more difficult to do when it is something as despicable and hateful as Holocaust denial. Indeed, defending free speech often means defending scum like Irving and Butz. However, it is not necessary to throw Butz, or any other Holocaust denier in jail to combat their lies. The way to combat his lies, or those of David Irving, or any other Holocaust denier is for opposing voices to make their displeasure known and to shine the light of truth on their lies. [NOTE: This is being posted here because my new blog is currently having technical difficulties that prevent my posting on it. Once the technical problems have been fixed (hopefully tomorrow), I will repost this over there. I wondered if this blog would have any further use, and unfortunately I found out sooner than I expected that it would.] Sunday, February 19, 2006 Locked out of ScienceBlogs Well, today's the day. After all the waiting, it's finally here. David Irving is going to stand trial for Holocaust denial in Austria today. Those of you who have read my old blog a while know what a despicable human being I consider David Irving to be. He's clearly an anti-Semite, most famously having said that \"more women died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz\" and being known for repeating anti-Semitic doggerel. He's spent decades in essence falsifying history, denying that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz, that the the Nazis had a plan to systematically exterminate European Jewry. And, his pretentions otherwise notwithstanding, he is no champion of free speech. Indeed, when the historian Deborah Lipstadt referred to him as a Holocaust denier in a book, he waited until her book was released in Britain, which has the most plaintiff-friendly libel laws in Europe or the U.S., and then sued her there in 2000. He lost and was humiliated. The final judgment found that Irving was indeed a Holocaust denier. I do have to admit to feeling a fair amount of schadenfreude when Irving was arrested in Austria last November. Irving knew damned well that there was a warrant for his arrest for denying the Holocaust in a speech he gave in 1989. He even worried about it on his own website and took precautions before he left, such as leaving behind 60 signed blank checks and bringing eight shirts, even though he was only supposed to be in Austria for two days. He knew what he was doing and what risk he was taking. Still, as an advocate of free speech, I found (and still find) the entire affair very troubling. Yes, Irving's views are odious. Yes, he has spent decades promoting Holocaust denial. Yes, in recent years he has associated with some really scary people on the far right. Yes, in the three speeches he gave in Austria, he told an audience in Leoben that Kristallnacht was carried out by \"unknowns\" dressed up as members of the SA; that Anne Frank could not have written her diary herself because the Biro wasn't invented until 1949; and that Hitler never gave an order to exterminate the Jews. He cited research by the discredited Fred Leuchter claiming that the Auschwitz gas chambers couldn't have been used to gas Jews because he couldn't find cyanide residues in the bricks. Yes, he asserted that \"Auschwitz is a legend, just like the Turin Shroud\" and that \"the existence of witnesses proves that there was no mass extermination,\" among numerous other statements clearly denying the Holocaust. Even so. Upholding freedom of speech is not difficult in cases of views that are mainstream or that don't offend. Upholding freedom of speech is difficult in case like David Irving. The bottom line, as far as I'm concerned, is that Irving should not be in prison. Imprisoning him achieves nothing other than raising his stature and letting him plausibly don the mantle of free speech martyr. All it does is lead him to make such ludicrious \"recantations\" that he now believes there were gas chambers at Auschwitz: His conversion, according to Irving, came in 1992 after his discovery of two documents - a discovery he kept to himself until recently. One was a radio message sent to Adolf Eichmann in 1943, reporting that during the previous 12 months more than a million people had died in Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec concentration camps.Odd that he never mentioned this before, even though he supposedly discovered it 13 years ago and especially since, as recently as 2005, he was still denying that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz. No one can see his sudden \"conversion\" as anything other than a transparent attempt to obtain leniency. If he is imprisoned for a harsh sentence (and the penalty for Holocaust denial in Austria can be as long as 20 years), he becomes a martyr. If he is released with time served, he will likely return to Britain and renounce his recantation. By arresting him and vowing to try him, Austria has placed itself in a no-win situation. Of course, not all see it this way. Indeed, in The New Statesman was published an impassioned defense of jailing Irving and keeping him there, written by Roger Boyes. Too bad it's full of logical fallacies and poor reasoning typical of the arguments for suppressing free speech: Even so, a courtroom is as close as most Holocaust deniers come to heaven. A captive audience, those chilly metallic blondes from CNN, the right to rant. Judging by his website, Irving is relishing his moment in the spotlight: even a lost court case represents a triumph of publicity for his malign deceptions on Hitler and his crimes. Hitler used his stint in jail to write Mein Kampf; for Irving, too, imprisonment is a kind of state-financed sabbatical. Advocates of the absolute right to free speech say that Irving's obvious enthusiasm for courtroom confrontation is a powerful argument for letting him go. Take away the courtroom and you take away his theatrical props. Ignore him, and the netherworld of Irving and the unsavoury club of Holocaust deniers withers away, killed by our oppressive tolerance. He may be - no, he is - hopelessly and deliberately wrong but he has the right to proclaim his crazy views, just as we have the right to plug our ears with cotton wool.Geez, talk about the fallacy of the excluded middle (a.k.a. the false dilemma)! We either have to jail Irving or ignore him? Are there no other options, such as, for example, speaking out against his lies and countering his lies and distortions with facts? And so what if Irving is \"relishing the spotlight\"? There wouldn't be any spotlight for Irving to relish if Austria hadn't arrested Irving in the first place. There wouldn't be a media circus with 50 television crews and the need for riot police to prevent protests by neo-Nazis. The rest of the piece appears to consist of an argument that we must respect the \"word\" (whatever that means) and that the interests of Irving and other Holocaust deniers are are \"merging with those of the anti-Semitic ideologists of Arab nationalism and Iranian theocratic rule.\" Boyes expresses concern that, \"if Irving walks free from the Wien-Josefstadt Prison next week he will soon be packing his suitcase for the Holocaust conference in Tehran.\" So what if Irving heads for Iran? That's not an argument to put him in jail for his speech, nor is it an argument to revoke the passport of the vile neo-Nazi Horst Mahler to prevent him from traveling to Iran, something Boyes refers to as \"wise.\" The anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial of the Arab nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist regimes of the Middle East would still exist and be just as virulent without David Irving and his fellow deniers. It's not as though Irving would gain respectability by going to Iran's conference to question the authenticity of the Holocaust or that he in his disgrace after the Lipstadt trial could lend respectability to this farce of a conference. Nonetheless Boyes concludes: We are not making Irving into a martyr by jailing him. We (or the Austrians on our behalf) are making the world a little bit safer - and defining the limits of tolerance.I propose a counterexample. I'd ask Boyes a question, given that he points out that the Irving case should reveal the \"limits of tolerance.\" Who gets to decide what the \"limits of tolerance\" are for free speech? Let's take an example from the good old U.S.A.: the rabid far right winger Ann Coulter. She provides red meat rhetoric for extremists. Indeed, she uses eliminationist rhetoric, as David Neiwert (of Orcinus) has pointed out time and time again. She made an infamous statement after 9/11 in which she said about Muslim countries that we should \"invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity,\" not worrying about how many civilians we kill in the process. She most recently gave a major speech where she referred to Muslims as \"ragheads\" who need to \"face consequences\" if they \"talk tough\" and joked about killing Bill Clinton. Her speech was so foul that even Michelle Malkin (who, as you may recall, is best known for writing a book defending the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II) felt obligated to offer up a rather tepid criticism of Coulter (while dismissing her remarks as Ann just \"going for a cheap laugh\"). Should Ann Coulter, as vile as much of what she says is, be thrown in jail for \"hate speech\"? My guess is that Boyes would probably say \"yes.\" I say no. Our freedom depends on free speech, and one price for that freedom is tolerating offensive speech from people we don't like, no matter how much our dislike of them, what they say, and what they stand for might tempt us just to throw them in jail. If anyone sees this... Monday, February 13, 2006 Orac is dead! Long live Orac My new ScienceBlogs blog is screwed up. Movable Type won't let me publish or rebuild the blog. It lets me get into the control panel and even lets me see my posts and your comments, but despite their showing up as \"published,\" they do not show up on the blog. Attempts to rebuild the blog time out, as do any attempts to republish the posts and comments in question. Consequently I can't post, and your comments aren't showing up. I'm starting to miss Blogger. I'll post another announcement when things are working again. Friday, February 10, 2006 My second to last post Well, it's finally come. Today is the day to say goodbye. No, not goodbye to you, my readers, but goodbye to Blogspot and this Blogger blog. In a way, this is a bit bittersweet, but then over the weekend an altie comment spammer unleashed the worst spam attack Respectful Insolence has ever weathered, necessitating my deleting a whole slew of comment spam. It's time to go. So, everyone, please set your bookmarks to my new location: http://scienceblogs.com/insolence Also, I've registered the domain respectfulinsolence.net. Presently, it's set to redirect traffic to this blog. Later today, I will reset it to redirect to my new location. There is a link to my new RSS feed on the new blog. Please update your bookmarks. To bloggers out there who are kind enough to have me on their blogroll, I'd really appreciate it if you would update your blogroll link to the new URL above. This blog will remain as an archive site for my old posts and as a place to put the occasional post that doesn't fit in with my new blog. Orac (from Blogspot) is dead! Long live Orac at ScienceBlogs! This will be my second to last post here at the present blog. As announced before, on Monday this blog will be moving over to ScienceBlogs. It's been an eventful 14 months here, but it's time to shake things up. Not all change is bad, and I think this change will be good in at least a couple of ways. First, it will bring the insolence to a potentially much bigger audience, and, second, it will hopefully inspire me to sharpen my science writing. The Skeptics' Circle is fast approaching In any case, as my last post here, the new URL will be announced on Monday, and I hope you'll join me (not to mention update all your bookmarks and, if you're a blogger or have linked to me on a website, your blogroll). The old blog will remain for the forseeable future as an archive site. Time flies. Not only is my move to ScienceBlogs imminent, but the next Skeptics' Circle is fast approaching. It's scheduled to be posted on Thursday, February 16 at Unused and Probably Unusable. The deadline is 8 PM EST on February 15, and the call for submissions is here. Let's make this one in honor of the Amazing Randi, who is presently recovering from heart surgery. Thursday, February 09, 2006 Meeting short take #6: Terra Sigillata comments on the recent saw palmetto trial so I don't have to Normally, this would be a topic that I'd take on full tilt. Fortunately, Abel Pharmboy explains the recent trial showing no benefit from saw palmetto in prostate hypertrophy. He also brings up a complaint that I've made about the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, mainly, its lack of scientific rigor and the poor quality of the grants it funds: Anyone associated with drug discovery and development whether in academia or industry will tell you how extreme the guidelines are for chemical composition and purity of any drug product intended for clinical trials. Yet, NCCAM continues to fund expensive clinical trials of botanical therapies even when the chemicals purported to be responsible for biological activity(ies) are unknown. In the rush to show clinical utility, this funding agency has taken shortcuts on the basic science studies necessary to precede any clinical trial, perhaps hoping that one day they will get a positive result. Instead, they are racking up a series of high-profile failures that cast a broad shadow across all natural products research and creating public relations challenges for otherwise well-meaning herbal education and trade groups. Only now has NCCAM revealed that they probably should fund investigations of basic science, mechanisms of action, and, be-still-my-heart, phase I pharmacokinetic trials. Since its inception in 1992 as the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, NCCAM has been a lightning rod for criticism of how the scientific method has been abandoned in favor of trying to show that ideological therapies work. Basic scientists in pharmacognosy and natural products chemistry were enthusiastic initially that a new funding source would be available to support their work. However, NCCAM was charged with reviewing all types of alternative therapies, from the more legitimate realm of herbal medicine to the implausible, homeopathy, for example. Review panels were stocked with individuals who had never held an NIH grant, much less with experience reviewing grant applications. An unusually high percentage of dietary supplement industry and trade group panelists infiltrated the peer-review system. In 2002, Quackwatch.com reported that just ten individual investigators held more than 20% of the NCCAM budget. I'd encourage Dr. Sampson to conduct another assessment today.Read the whole thing.

Frankly I'm disgusted that the media in this country, given how much attention they give to political prisoners in other countries, refuses to cover this story. 80 Days in prison without a trial for trespassing? Thats positively tyrannical. Please read on, and do what you can to wish Lauren a merry christmas. She hasn't seen her kids in 80 days, and won't be allowed to by the state of Connecticut: Lauren Canario's now been imprisoned 80 days without a trial for her fight against eminent domain. She's been nominated for Freedom Fighter of the Year on Strike the Root. If you have a moment, please vote: http://www.strike-the-root.com/ Also, she'll be spending her birthday (Dec. 23rd) and Christmas imprisoned. It takes over a week, I believe, to get anything to her her there. If you could spare a moment, please send her a card or letter. I don't believe she can receive any packages.

Kat Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom. - Albert Einstein Wednesday, December 06, 2006 SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE MEMBER DENOUNCES \"NO-SWIPE\" CREDIT CARDS \"It's About Time,\" says CASPIAN A member of the Senate Banking Committee denounced RFID \"no-swipe\" credit cards at a press conference Sunday. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) said contracts for the cards should have warning boxes disclosing \"the known weaknesses of the technology.\" He cautioned cardholders about their vulnerability to identity thieves, commenting you \"may as well put your credit card information on a big sign on your back.\" \"No-swipe\" or \"contactless\" credit cards contain RFID microchips that communicate account information silently and invisibly by radio waves. These microchips have earned the nickname \"spychips\" because the information they contain can be read without an individual's knowledge or consent. While Congress is just waking up to the dangers of RFID technology, privacy and civil liberties organizations like CASPIAN have been sounding the alarm for years. \"It's about time for Capitol Hill to recognize the dangers of RFID,\" said Dr. Katherine Albrecht, Founder and Director of CASPIAN (Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering). \"Perhaps now members of Congress will listen to their concerned constituents and work to pass long overdue bipartisan RFID labeling legislation not only for credit cards, but other RFID-tagged consumer items as well.\" CASPIAN has had model RFID labeling legislation titled \"The RFID Right to Know Act\" available to federal lawmakers since 2003. (See http://www.spychips.com/right-to-know-bill.html.) The legislation was authored by by Zoe Davidson of the Boston University Legislative Clinic. While CASPIAN supports free-market solutions to the problems of privacy invading technologies like RFID, the group believes consumer notice is needed so the free market can work. \"We believe consumers have a right to know when the things they wear, carry, and interact with contain tracking devices--especially credit cards that can leak sensitive personal information,\" said Liz McIntyre, CASPIAN's communications director. McIntyre, a former federal bank examiner, points out that vulnerable \"swipeless\" technology not only poses a threat to customers, but to the financial institutions that have issued millions of contactless cards, as well. \"What excuse will organizations like JP Morgan Chase make if consumers are harmed financially because they have their personal information siphoned by identity thieves? These issuers stand to lose millions of dollars.\" CASPIAN demanded a recall of RFID credit cards last month after the New York Times reported that a team of security researchers found that virtually every one of the \"no-swipe\" credit cards it tested was vulnerable to unauthorized charges and put consumers at risk for identity theft. Researchers demonstrated how thieves could secretly skim information from the cards, right through purses, backpacks and wallets. The data included the cardholder's name, credit card number, expiration date and other information that could be used to make unauthorized purchases. Albrecht and McIntyre are offering to testify before Congress about their extensive research into the dangers posed by RFID, and to send a copy of their book \"Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Purchase and Watch Your Every Move\" (Penguin/Plume Oct. 2006) to interested federal legislators. ========================================= TO LEARN MORE \"NY Sen. Schumer warns of no-swipe cards\" http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8LPMID00.htm New York Times article about \"no-swipe\" credit http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/business/23card.html Security researcher's detailed report on \"no-swipe\" cards: http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/20061023_CARD/fc2007-submission.pdf Friday, November 17, 2006 Greetings from The Land of Snow Crash Hello folks, we've been off the blog for a few weeks now, though we've been working hard. As you may have read, I've gotten into the virtual world of Second Life, which offers some fantastic opportunities, not only for experiments in liberty, but economic opportunities as well. Following our interview with Thor Columbia of Meta Bank, I became business partners in SL with a new libertarian from Michigan, Tavi Tuck, who has also joined the Free State Project and become one of its First 1000 (Thor Columbia has also become one of the First 1000 since the election, he's now convinced even a thousand activists can take over a state like NH. Gee, now I just need one more person to refer me when they join and I win a Golden Porcupine Award!). Tavi and I formed the SL firm of Brautigan & Tuck, and we bought half a sim of land, which we've been very hard at work developing over the past month. It is now nearing completion. The development, in Magritte region, is mostly themed on sites and enterprises from the novel Snow Crash. The primary location is of course The Black Sun, the famous club of characters Hiro Protagonist and Da5id Meier. Also included is Ng Security Systems, Cosa Nostra Pizza, Snooze n Cruise, and even the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates. A couple who bought land from us to build a castle have a historic marker denoting it as \"Da5id Meier's House\". We also have some corporate deals in the offing. One is with Stone Brewery of San Diego, a microbrewery known for its \"Arrogant Bastard Ale\", Ruination IPA, and other similarly named offerings. We've built a brewery in SL that sells kegs to other bars, kegs which sell beer bottles that are animated and have lives of 45 minutes, which cost 1 linden each. This is a first in SL, and spells the beginning of a true consumer economy there. We plan on using this temporary technology for other ventures, like the pizzaria. We are now planning to purchase two whole sims in late December, to develop more themes from the novel like The Raft, including a working aircraft carrier, as well as themes from The Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon. As an editor of Stephenson's now defunct Quicksilver Metaweb wiki, I've obtained the archives of that wiki and plan on making it available within and without SL to help preserve that knowledge base, a sort of \"Stephensonian Institution\". All of this activity has been accomplished free of both taxation, and government regulation. We've built a well planned community, that is also attractive and fun to be in, policed by a private protection agency as described by David Friedman's \"The Machinery of Freedom\", that is neither chaotic or lawless. So far, this experiment has disproven the claims of critics of anarcho-capitalism. We have not been free of difficulties, though. Our simulation has been attacked several times, by both individual jerks out to cause trouble in person, wearing \"sock puppet\" avatars that were fresh-baked, as well as a SL-wide hacker attack that was, according to LL and our estate company management, focused on our sim. We have survived all challenges, and are dealing with such attacks through Ng Security, and the help of others in SL. We have also gotten publicity, in a few individuals blogs, but also recently in SLNN.com, one of the main SL related media outlets, where we were featured in a large series on the impact of Snow Crash upon SL. Our promotion of Meta Bank has also had benefits. They first set up an ATM within our sim, though there were often problems with the SL servers crashing them from cache errors (possibly malicious activity). The Bank just got their own banking server independent of the SL system, and crashes have stopped. They also just opened their second branch in our sim, next to the pizzaria. Meta Bank is also going to be changing its name, as its management found out that there is a real life Meta Bank in South Dakota, which has a poor reputation. We'll report on that name change as it happens. Wednesday, October 18, 2006 PRA Release: Seventy-Five Organizations and Policy Leaders Call for Eminent Domain Reform in Senate WASHINGTON \u2014 Today, a letter signed by seventy-five organizations and policy leaders from across the country was sent to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) requesting that the Senate advance legislation upon return in November to limit the ability of states and localities to abuse eminent domain. The letter can be viewed here. Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) introduced S. 3873, the \"Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2006\" as the Senate means to address the Kelo v. City of New London, CT court case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2005. As the companion legislation to the bipartisan H.R. 4128 passed in the House last November, S. 3873 similarly seeks to curb eminent domain abuse by withholding federal economic development funds from states and localities that engage in these abusive practices. Since passage, H.R. 4128 has mired in the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA). The American public continues to fervently oppose this type of government takings. In the last year, over thirty state legislatures heeded the call and enacted legislation aimed at curbing the abuse of eminent domain for private use. Ballot measures will be voted on by residents in more than ten states on Election Day, with Louisiana voters already passing a measure last month. And one national survey after another demonstrates a minimum of eighty-five percent of public support in reforming eminent domain abuse to protect homes, businesses and churches from government's grasp. \"With politicians constantly entranced by polling data and grassroots activism, it remains shocking that the Senate has remained relatively silent on the issue,\" said Scott A. LaGanga, executive director of PRA. \"With over a year of waiting, property owners are frustrated with the lack of initiative by our Senators in Congress to protect Americans from government's ability to snap up a family's home or church today to make a mansion tomorrow. Action to correct this injustice must be taken during the lame duck session.\" As stated in the letter, \"Committed to correcting the United States Supreme Court's misjudgment in the Kelo v. City of New London, everyday citizens have voiced their support for Congressional action to limit private lands from being seized for private economic development by the government.\" The following organizations signed the letter to Majority Leader Frist (letter can be viewed at Property Rights Alliance website): 60+ Association, Alabama Farmers Federation, Alliance for Worker Freedom, American Association of Small Property Owners, American Conservative Union, American Family Business Institute, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Land Rights Association, American Policy Center, Americans for Limited Government, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Prosperity-New Jersey, Americans for Tax Reform, Americans for the Preservation of Liberty, American Shareholders Association, Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, California Alliance to Protect Private Property Rights, Castle Coalition, Center for Individual Freedom, Citizens for Limited Taxation, Citizens for Property Rights-Vermont, Coalition for Property Rights-Florida, Commonwealth Foundation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Eagle Forum, Ethan Allen Institute, FreedomWorks, Frontiers of Freedom, GOP Blogger.com, Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, Illinois Policy Institute, Independence Institute, Iowa Wednesday Group, James Madison Institute, League of Private Property Voters, Liberty Coalition, Maryland Taxpayers Alliance, Media Freedom Project, Mississippi Center for Public Policy, Missouri Citizens for Property Rights, Missouri First, Montana Policy Institute, National Grange, National Taxpayers Union, Nevada Policy Research Institute, North Carolina Property Rights Coalition, Ohio Taxpayers Association and OTA Foundation, Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, Pacific Research Institute, Paragon Foundation, Inc., Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, Pennsylvania Landowners' Association, Pius Pagan Publishing, Property Rights Alliance, Property Rights Alliance: Hawaii, PROTEX, Reason Foundation, Republican Liberty Caucus, Rightmarch, Rio Grande Foundation, Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, Small Business Entrepreneurship Council, Small Business Hawaii (SBH), South Carolina Landowners Association, South Carolina Policy Council, Tennessee Center for Policy Research, The Rutherford Institute, The Taxpayers League of Minnesota, Virginia Institute for Public Policy. (In addition, four other policy analysts signed this letter). Demonstrate Your Support For The Liberty Dollar Received the following release from NORFED this evening. NORFED is now going on the lobbying offensive in Washington, and is looking for support from the rising groundswell of grassroots people who have expressed their approval of NORFEDs defense against the legally unsupportable attacks by the US Mint on the Liberty Dollar. It has become clear that the core of the Mint's claims in its attacks is that the Liberty Dollar is claimed to be being passed as \"US current money\", which it is not and never has been. It would be an insult to the Liberty Dollar to compare it with the debased debauchery that is what passes for \"money\" by the fiat dictates of a government that has become unhinged from its Constitutional moorings and, as we have seen with this weeks suspension of the sacred right of habeus corpus, is drifting rapidly into the shoals of tyranny and the rocks of fascism. Time To Step Up And Demonstrate Real Support For Real Money - The Liberty DollarBreaking News...We are hearing from our efforts to leverage Congressional Inquiry that the US Mint has received much more response from the public than anticipated following their web posted warning on September 14, 2006 . It's time to really let them know how much you value the Liberty Dollar by calling or faxing the US Mint! To make a call use (202) 354-7227, for sending a fax use (202) 756-6200. After reading this special News Alert please call or fax the US Mint and in a very positive way ask if the statements listed below are NOT true. Do not be nasty or attacking; this gets us nowhere. Always be respectful. Also, please distribute this widely to everyone on your mailing list. On With Other News... Over the last six weeks we have heard a lot of support for the mission, goals and cause of the Liberty Dollar and precious metal backed private currency...Reporters, Editors, Talk Show Hosts, Calls and e-mails from listeners and readers who had never before heard of the Liberty Dollar are committing to \"fight the good fight\" for the right to choose their method of payment for goods and services. Liberty Dollar Merchants, Associates and Regional Currency Offices, taken aback from a malicious media assault, have been gnawing on what it all means and how to move forward. It's time to regroup, shake off the debris of fear and exchange your Federal Reserve Notes for the Liberty Dollar. This is the support we need now. Circulating (as in bartering), Accumulating or Collecting: The three most effective ways to do good, have fun and protect your purchasing power. If any of the following statements were illegal or a federal crime, would there not have already been arrests? Liberty Dollars are exchanged, given out, presented and accepted hundreds of times a day throughout the country...lots of opportunities to make an example out of someone. But once you wade through the citations and legalese of the US Mint's warning(s), it becomes very clear: THE LIBERTY DOLLAR CANNOT BE PASSED AS \"CURRENT MONEY\" OR GOVERNMENT MONEY. NO ONE SHOULD ACCEPT THE LIBERTY DOLLAR THINKING IT IS GOVERNMENT MONEY. This, of course, would contradict the goal of the Liberty Dollar! Merchants CANNOT be prosecuted for accepting the Liberty Dollar KNOWING that it is private currency! Merchants CANNOT be prosecuted for giving out the Liberty Dollar in change if the customer KNOWS it is private currency! Users CANNOT be prosecuted for presenting the Liberty Dollar to a Merchant when the Merchant KNOWS it is private currency! Regional Currency Offices, or anyone else, CANNOT be prosecuted for exchanging Liberty Dollars for Federal Reserve Notes when the customer KNOWS it is private currency! NO ONE CAN BE PROSECUTED FOR HAVING POSSESSION OF THE LIBERTY DOLLAR! If any of these statements were false, then having or using any of the hundreds of local or community currencies such as the Ithaca Hour, Disney Dollar, Berkshares, Barter Bucks, etc., would be a crime. On September 14, just five weeks ago, our website, Liberty Dollar.org, received ten times its normal traffic. Online orders surged for the introductory special, supporter kits and educational materials as well as lots of small orders from new individuals wanting to know just who this Liberty Dollar outfit is. The wave of curiosity has died down and so has the normal volume that the Liberty Dollar has experienced over the last 12-18 months. I believe the current lull is retrenchment from those stinging from the national media assault as well as caution on the part of the newly introduced that are concerned over legal repercussions. Consider the above statements regarding the legality of the Liberty Dollar. These are the conclusions of NORFED and its Counsel. Exchange your Federal Reserve Notes for Gold and Silver Libertys and Certificates now. Circulate (barter), Accumulate and Collect...It's the right thing to do. Is the US Dollar tanking?

Monday, October 16, 2006 Russo Speaks: Freedom 2 Fascism Pirated, Releasing Directors Cut & PP View Versions From: AARON RUSSO [mailto:aaronrusso@msn.com] Sent: Monday, October 16, 2006 6:21 PM To: XXX@XXX.com Subject: please spread thru internet Please advise everybody that the copy [of AMERICA: FROM FREEDOM TO FASCISM] on poodlecrap (see below) is an incomplete, pirated version that does not contain all the necessary information. It is also of poor quality and certainly not approved by me. This week i will be posting the final directors cut of the film on my Website www.freedomtofascism.com . It will be offered on the highest quality resolution on the Internet on a pay per view format for $5. It will also be offered for sale on DVD for $19.95. Lastly it will be posted on Google for free on a lower quality resolution as compared to the pay per view version on my Website. Please advise everybody to see the complete directors cut of the film so the entire truth of what is happening to our country will be understood. Thank you, \"one people one movement freedom for all\" Aaron Russo AARON Saturday, October 14, 2006 End The Experiment With Government Human beings have been experimenting with various forms of social control since pre-history. Extrapolating the basic family unit to tribal, community, province, national, and now global levels to varying degrees of success or failure over the centuries, the social side of the human animal has, like his drive to bring the forces of nature under control, sought to bring his fellow human beings under control for his own security and/or personal gain. But now these two drives are in conflict. Since the beginning of the atomic age, when man first harnessed the natural power of the atom, scientists and ethicists have warned the political class about the proliferation of nuclear power as a destabilizing influence on peaceful governments and international relations. Non-proliferation treaties were actively negotiated and enforced behind the scenes of the superpower conflict of the Cold War. The US enabled Britain, France, Israel, Japan, and others of its friendly postwar allies to develop peaceful nuclear power, and some even developed nuclear weapons. All have responsibly kept those weapons in their deepest reserves of self-defense only in the case of invasion or first strike upon their own nations. The peaceful development of nuclear energy has had successes, with Japan and France gaining a majority of their energy from this source, and other countries, which enjoy domestic coal or other energy sources, less so. The Soviets were similarly interested in keeping the nuclear genie in the bottle, but at the same time enabled China to join the nuclear club, along with a host of Warsaw Pact nations gaining peaceful nuclear energy. With the split up of the USSR, a number of former Soviet republics took control of nuclear weapons stored in their territory, though most surrendered them to Russia in the interests of stability and non-proliferation. However China has pursued a much more fast and loose policy with regard to non-proliferation. It enabled Pakistan and North Korea to attain nuclear weapons capability, and as we've seen, those nations have proliferated the technology to such rogue nations as Iran, Libya, Iraq, among others. While Libya has stepped back from the brink in order to rejoin the community of nations and avoid an expected, if not planned, US attack, others have not been so responsible. North Korea, given a pass by former Presidents Carter and Clinton in the 1990's to continue its nuclear programs for 8 years without international oversight, possibly the greatest treason against US national security since Benedict Arnolds betrayal, used that time to build its fuel processing capabilities and perfect its nuclear weapons manufacturing capacity. As we saw this past week, North Korea has detonated at least one small nuclear weapon, though reports are that it had much lower than expected yield. NK has also tested a new ICBM capable of reaching most of the US several times, so far with failures, but building a reliable ICBM is technically easier and cheaper than building nuclear weapons, so it is only a matter of time before North Korea has the ability to strike the US. NK has resisted all international attempts to entice it to surrender its weapons program, demonstrating the utter failure of the UN system to perform its core function of ensuring world peace. Iran has likewise resisted efforts by the west and the UN to bring its nuclear ambitions and programs back under international oversight and compliance. The mullahocracy is currently enriching weapons grade uranium, and is expanding its processing capabilities, apparently deep in bunker protected facilities, as if expecting international military action against it for its sins. The CIA expects Iran to test its first weapon within 5 years. While President Ahmedinejad of Iran insists his nations ambitions are peaceful, he refuses to explain what peaceful purpose there is to weapons grade nuclear fuel, and refuses to apologize for or disavow his statments proposing to wipe the nation of Israel \"off the map\". Indeed, he contiues to make such statements, and is also contributing to the insurgencies in Iraq with training, shelter, and weapons, as well as arming Hezbollah with thousands of rockets. As all this is happening, the international community, and most national governments, abjectly refuse to exercise their prerogatives of power to secure the world against these two rogue nations. Even in the US, Democrats would rather talk about surrendering Iraq to the Islamofascists than to talk about their own failings in North Korea, or propose solutions to Iran. At the same time, the Bush administration is castrated with a Secretary of State who would rather negotiate than do anything else (what else is new), and a Secretary of Defense who should be telling stories he can't remember to his great-grandkids beside the fireplace. What is the point of having a slightly tyrannical government as the primary superpower if it isn't going to do its job of securing the nation? What is the point of a United Nations that is anything but united? The foreign policy experts are calling for more international treaties to bring nonproliferation \"under control\". The problem is that we have plenty of nonproliferation treaties already that haven't done anything. Like the failure that is gun control, nuclear non-proliferation treaties are a joke: they only disarm the law abiding, criminal states, like street thugs, do not obey gun control or nuclear control laws or treaties if their intent is criminal activity. Victim disarmament is the proper label for nuclear nonproliferation treaties, just as they are the proper label for gun control laws. It is thus rather evident that attempts to legislate against the development of technologies are inherently faulty and incapable of being enforced upon parties determined to flout them. Instead, we should be looking at the root factors that enable the construction of nuclear weapons if we as a race want to put the nuclear weapons genie back in the bottle. The primary root factor is government. To date, not a single private corporation has ever built a nuclear weapon, even though many parts for such are build by private firms under government contract, and personnel with the requisite skills tend to wind up in private industry. To date, not a single private individual has ever built a nuclear weapon. The degree of resources required to produce enough weapons grade nuclear material is rather staggering, even in this day and age. It remains in the billions of dollars. Building nuclear weapons requires the assets of a national government, and the legal power to enforce secrecy upon its citizens. It requires access to natural resources capable of being exploited outside the channels of international commerce (for instance, Iraqi attempts to purchase Nigerian yellowcake signalled its ambitions in the 1990's, a fact that even Dan Wilson has admitted to be fact in recent months). It requires a defense infrastructure capable of defending a geographic territory against conventional attack by parties interested in stopping it from attaining its ambitions. No corporation on earth has these capabilities, even though many corporations peacefully operate nuclear power plants. No corporation has exhibited a desire to attain these capabilities. No individual has a hope of attaining these capabilities, James Bondian fantasies notwithstanding. The assertion by luddites like Bill Joy that future technologies, like nanotechnology, will enable cheap nuclear fuel processing, but this is based on a poor understanding of the science of nanotechnology. It is highly likely that nanotech devices capable of sorting isotopes atom by atom simply will not be robust enough to withstand the molecular damage done by nuclear radiation. As fuel concentrations rise, so does radiation levels, causing greater nanite die-off. There is a natural ceiling of purification possible with molecular nanotechnology. Modern isotope processing requires batches of liquid chemical compounds of heavy isotopes processed through centrifuges. This is a rough method that does not depend on placing radiation sensitive integrated chips and nano-mechanical assemblies in close proximity to nuclear decay reactions. For this reason, the nanotech shibboleth is shredded as an excuse for technology controls. No, the real \"problem technology\" in the nuclear proliferation problem is the technology of government. It is a blunt instrument that runs roughshod over individual liberties strictly for the purpose of amassing and weilding power and wealth outside the free market system. If we are to start banning technologies, lets start with this one. Friday, October 13, 2006 IntLib Interviews President of Meta Bank in SL Today, we are sitting down in the virtual reality of Second Life with Thor Columbia, President of Meta Bank, which exists entirely within the SL universe. Meta Bank is an interesting example of the sorts of enterprises that are developing entirely \"in world\", and eventually will become concerns capable of being a \"real life\" living for those engaged in such ventures. From his perspective as President of Meta Bank, Thor has a unique perspective and view of the SL economy, how it began and is developing, and where it is headed. Given the many libertarian aspects of SL, we sought out this interview to gain a look into this perspective for the benefit of our readers. For the reader, there will be references to various Second Life specific terms or acronym. SL refers to Second Life, RL refers to your \"real life\". A Linden Dollar is the form of currency in Second Life, and currently exchanges for US Federal Reserve Notes at about 275 Lindens per $1 FRN. [9:31] Thor Columbia: Welcome having me [9:32] Thor Columbia: I'm glad to hear some one is covering more about the banking system here in SL. [9:32] IntLib: Its something of interest to people in the libertarian community. [9:32] Thor Columbia: Speaking of which I am an active member of the Maryland Libertarian Party. I'm the current Chair of the Howard County Libertarian Party in Maryland [9:34] IntLib: Ah, excellent. So you campaigned for Mr. Zeese? [9:35] Thor Columbia: I know him well and he is a great guy, but I have been spending most of my time trying to get a local judge elected, David Titman in Howard County, who just got 30% in the primary. The way the judges' races work in Maryland is that the Libertarian Party is able to nominate him to the final election day, but he also runs in the primaries against the Democrat and Republican. [9:37] IntLib: Then that is a good result. Nice way it works down there. [9:37] Thor Columbia: If we got over 50% of the vote on primary day he would have knocked off one of the competitors but the way it worked out he will be in a 3 way race [9:37] IntLib: Well, 30% of 3 is a damn good result [9:38] Thor Columbia: He is running a very good campaign, lots of poll workers, takes NO donations from lawyers as he sees it as a conflict of interest for a judge [9:39] Thor Columbia: I have been following the Free State Project since day 1. I love the Porcupine you have as your group mascot. [9:41] IntLib: Does Meta Bank and the other banks in SL operate as full reserve or fractional reserve systems within the SL economy? When you take in x Lindens in deposits, do you lend out x Lindens, or are you able to lend out a multiple of your deposits based on a reserve ratio? [9:42] Thor Columbia: We loan out a percentage of our total lindens that come in the form of deposits, normally 70%. Also unlike some of the other banks we keep the lindens we get in deposits with in the SL economy. By that I mean, we take in SL dollars and loan to businesses and people in SL. Some of the other banks (Ginko for instance) takes SL dollars and uses them in RL businesses. [9:45] IntLib: Ah, so they are able to extract dollars from the system. Is there any record of a balance of payments between the SL and RL economies? [9:46] Thor Columbia: Not really, as you may know there is a market for the SL dollars in which they are freely bought and sold. As it is more dollars come in then go out, however a bank taking money out of the economy and draining the capital base does not seem productive to me. That is why I started Meta Bank, because I wanted to create a capital base that would grow in-world businesses. [9:48] IntLib: Excellent. Sounds like I chose the right banker. Perhaps you can explain what the typical lending terms are and how they differ from what people are used to in RL? [9:48] Thor Columbia: They are very similar to the terms in RL, first you pick a plot of land you would like to buy, then you come to us and apply for a loan. If you meet the basic criteria, then we purchase the land for you. You make weekly payments to the bank for a period of 60 to 90 days, depending on the size of the loan, and when the payments are complete we deed full ownership over to you. The payments are pre-calculated to include the amount of the interest in this case (0.25%) per day. If you fail to make several of the payments in a row we will first give reminders, however if no payments are made we sell the land to recoup the bank's loss. [9:55] IntLib: What percent of your customers default on loans? [9:56] Thor Columbia: It seems to be relatively low, we have a good filtering system on the front end, the applicant must meet certain criteria, such as age of character, in order to show they are a long term member of the SL community. [9:58] IntLib: Ah, that brings up a good question: lots of new players looking for First Land, and get business ideas in SL, what period of time must a new character be in SL to qualify? In walks Extrems Brock, who works at time scripter here at Meta Bank. [10:00] IntLib: I Columbia: excellent [10:00] Thor Columbia: Well to your question, as a general rule loan officers want the customer to be at least 30 days old, as a rule if someone has been active in world for that long they are likely to stick around. [10:03] IntLib: That sounds reasonable. Another question I had was to employment. It seems to me that there are very limited options for employment in SL: generally the camping chairs and dancing, and the adult industry, if someone wants to move beyond that, they seem to need specific skills in demand, like design or scripting, etc. I myself am trying to find work in SL as a writer. How does the lack of employment opportunities impact the economy and your lending? [10:06] Thor Columbia: There is a lack of structural employment for the people in-world, however I think that as the companies grow and the economy grows more and more structured jobs will come, however the current system is very freedom oriented, instead of trying to meet the job requirements some one else sets there are thousands and thousands of people creating there own original content and being their own boss. I would compare it closest to a digital ebay; many people sell and buy on ebay. However there is always a lack of tiered employment, though since SL is more like a 3D internet than anything else I expect there will be many job opportunities in the future. Already many fortune 500 companies are moving into SL, and when RL companies realize the incredible potential of SL for making money a couple years from now, I expect to see a gold rush for talented workers in SL, similar to gold rush on programmers during the later 90s. [10:12] IntLib: That sounds promising. As a long time freelancer myself, in various IT disciplines, I found that in the regular internet, many or most companies are reticent to employ someone strictly on a telecommuting basis. How do you think that that will differ with people working in SL, and will companies realize the difference? [10:13] Thor Columbia: Well with SL it's all tele-commuting, in fact if you take \"Electric Sheep\" a successful SL company as an example, the members of the company are in different nations around the world, all working together in real time in SL. In fact as the price of oil continues to rise year after year I would not be surprised if we see more and more companies tele commuting entire divisions via SL. [10:16] IntLib: Good point. Your reference to \"Electric Sheep\" is interesting, given its based on a cyberpunk novels name. [10:16] Thor Columbia: Yeah, I once heard SL described very accurately as \"The Matrix\" without the scary machines. [10:19] IntLib: Do you find that most people you lend to keep up their payments by injection of dollars, or through employment and business in world? [10:21] Thor Columbia: I find that most people get there money through jobs, however there is a large contingent of the population that are shoppers and just spend spend spend. They figure it is only 10 to 20 RL dollars for shopping, however that goes a long way in SL. I myself input money from RL on a regular basis. [10:23] IntLib: Do you offer any sort of \"credit card\" services beyond lending for tangible (as much as they can be) assets? [10:24] Thor Columbia: We are working toward that goal of having a full selection of lending services: land lending, credit card and everything in between. [10:25] IntLib: I myself made a promise to myself that outside of my blogs' AdSense money, I'd not put any money into SL, to see if this can truly be treated as a viable second economy by someone starting out fresh. Do you see that sort of thing happening, and are people able to work their way up the socioeconomic ladder with that kind of a standard, not subsidizing themselves with dollars? [10:26] Thor Columbia: Yes I do, the guys at Electric Sheep are making a very good wage off of just their skills; they input no money originally, and I have seen many examples of this. Over 2000 people have SL as their full time RL job: creating content, scripts and everything. [10:28] IntLib: Wow, that is impressive. [10:29] Thor Columbia: Yes, this place is a libertarian dream, no limits; you can rise as far as you can imagine. The people that just shop will continue to shop, and some people just play for fun, however if you are entrepreneurial in any way you can accomplish incredible things. [10:30] IntLib: I figured that there were essentially two classes of folk here, the tourists and those who try to live in world as much as possible [10:31] Thor Columbia: This place is the great social equalizer, no one knows your name, race, age, social class, you are judged solely on your abilities, talent and attitude. [10:31] IntLib: Do you have any discloseable data on the growth of the Meta Banks assets to date? [10:32] Thor Columbia: No I would not want to have the other banks aware of our size. However I will tell you we are growing at a double-digit monthly rate. The largest bank in SL is Ginko Financial, but we intend with a better business system to surpass them with in a year. [10:34] IntLib: That sounds like you've got your work cut out. What, btw, is the asset size of Ginko? [10:35] Thor Columbia: Unknown, they don't disclose, however I know enough to say they have upwards of 10's of thousands of USD, however with out any transparence, it may well be in the 100's of thousands of USD. Your guess is as good as mine, however a good guidepost is the number of ATM's they have. [10:36] IntLib: Okay, so they likely expect so much business from any given ATM eh? [10:37] Thor Columbia: yes, and I know they have several hundred ATM's with in SL. We are rapidly expanding our own ATM base but we have a long way to go to surpass the Ginko. [10:38] IntLib: I've talked with some other libertarians who are interested in establishing some sort of a gold backed system of finance here in SL. What do you think of such proposals, and are they really necessary? [10:40] Thor Columbia: I like the idea of creating a system backed with something real, our current fiat systems seems unsustainable to me, however I don't think anything here will surpass the linden dollar in use, and I like the fact that it is not a pegged currency and instead a free market currency. If you wanted a backed currency I would need it to be traded on an open market. [10:42] IntLib: Okay, um well, from my involvement in Blogshares and using their B$ currency, I had wondered at the possibility of establishing some sort of currency exchange between the two systems. Would that be viable here? [10:43] Thor Columbia: btw, do you know where I can get one of those International Libertarian t-shirts? [10:43] IntLib: Oh yeah, I'll give you a copy, made it myself. [10:43] Thor Columbia: Excellent. Off topic, but \"International Columbia accepted your inventory offer. [10:44] IntLib: Ah, well, it started originally as a tiff between myself and L Neil Smith, over his anti-war sentiments and my anti-isolationist ones, but I am applying IntLib to becoming a blog that reports on stories and issues of libertarian concern that happen anywhere in the world. [10:48] Thor Columbia: Excellent, I am disappointed when some one wants the libertarian ideal for their own country but is not willing to support the fight for human freedom elsewhere. Any way, back to your question, and thanks for the shirt. [10:50] IntLib: No problem [10:51] Thor Columbia: It would be interesting to see a completely digital economy using a currency supported by a gold or other metal standard. [10:52] IntLib: How about exchanges with other virtual currencies, like Blogshares B$? [10:53] Thor Columbia: I don't know how the logistics would work but it would be interesting to try. [10:54] IntLib: Okay. Is there anything that you'd like to communicate with the general public or the libertarian community about your experiences or Meta Bank? [10:55] Thor Columbia: Yes. People live within the limits they place on them self's. I believe we should all strive to higher goals for freedom and self improvement, in the world of business I think we would all do very well to forget the structured higher education model of employment. While it takes more energy to judge a person on ability and not a piece of paper, you will find much greater reward in the end. [10:59] Thor Columbia: Are you still involved with the FSP? Please pass on that the Howard County Libertarian Party fully supports the goals of the Free State Project. After the election we intend to help in any way we can to create the light on the hill that this county needs in the form of the Free State Project. [11:02] IntLib: That is great to hear. We're still working towards our ultimate membership goals, but have also launched a group called The First 1000, of a thousand people who have pledged to move within a year. So far, we've got over 430 in state, though we started with about 250 who were already residents. [11:03] Thor Columbia: In fact I hope to have a house in New Hampshire with in a couple years, however I am not dependent on the [membership] threshold as I am coming to join the FSP one way or another. I think we need some more people involved, however I think the greatest need is more in the way of money for the Libertarian cause, and that is what I am working toward here and in several RL companies. I own a number of companies including a biodiesel company. We are building a 4 million gallon operation here in Maryland. However I would like to make New Hampshire the RL head quarters of Meta Bank as it grows. [11:14] IntLib: Another question I had about SL economics is, that in RL, for example, settlement and development began with agriculture and hunting, then light industry and heavy industry. Why do you think that no attempt has been made to enable those sorts of resource utilization economics in SL to build wealth and infrastructure? [11:15] Thor Columbia: In SL there are truly only two commodities, other than the skills of people which is a natural commodity, those two commodities are land and primitives. Labor, land and prims. We are rapidly refining these to create original content and workable structures. It's amazing to see the evolution of it all. [11:18] IntLib: Okay, a question I had about the limitations of primitives for given lots, why isn't there a mechanism for people to buy more primitives for their land, or is there? [11:19] Thor Columbia: well currently if you run over you just buy more land and use the primitives on either that land or your old land [11:19] IntLib: Sure, but doesn't that generate a lot of open land, which is generally useless in a virtual system like this? [11:22] Thor Columbia: Understood, however that works out well as it gives open space next to another very developed structure. It all depends on how much detail you want on a property, most places do not need so many prims [11:23] Extrems Brock: Oh yeah Thor, we need more primitives again. [11:23] Thor Columbia: However it would be nice if they sold prims without the land, it would make it simpler. [11:24] IntLib: Yeah, I guess my question philosophically is, outside of creating open space between structures as you say, is that its nice to have a sort of environmental sentiment (as it seems to me), but without trees and animals living in the space, what is the point? [11:25] Thor Columbia: Esthetics I suppose, however it is more basic then that, each square can only support so many prims I think is the deal, some thing they need to upgrade. NOTE: Each area of ~65,000 sq meters, called a 'region' or 'sim' is supported in the Linden Labs Network by a single server. Too may prims in one region overloads the server and causes what is called \"lag\", or a slowing of the sim. This also tends to occur when there are lots of people in a single sim at one time, particularly people who are implementing their own personal primitives. In order to minimize lag, LL restricts the number of prims per square meter that land owners can build. [11:26] IntLib: Okay, um being new, I'm not totally clear on its definition, so perhaps you can explain what exactly a \"primitive\" is? I understand they are objects. (Thor conjures a wood textured cube on the conference room table) [11:27] Thor Columbia: That is a prim [11:27] Extremes Brock: A primitive is a physical basic 3D shape. Each primitive uses server resources. [11:27] Thor Columbia: It is a box or cube or a 3D shape in which you can change and mold into anything and everything you see, the chair your sitting in, the wall, everything in the room is made of many prims, colored and changes and made to look like other objects. [11:28] IntLib: Okay, I understand that, but for instance, is one of these chairs one primitive, or multiple primitives? [11:28] Extrems Brock: Multiple, you can only make complex shapes with multiple primitives. [11:28] IntLib: So a more complex object eats up more primitives. [11:29] Thor Columbia: You got it. Each lot of land gets a certain number of prims, and if you go beyond that you must buy more. [11:29] Extrems Brock: 3 per 16m, 117 65,536m = one region [11:30] IntLib: Okay, understood. I've been shopping land, btw, so I have a basic understanding of the prim limits on each parcel. Would you say that there is a significant market in people buying land and developing sub parcels for resale, or is that market oversupplied? Can the land barons buy a parcel and tap off some of its prims for themselves, then resell the land with fewer prims? [11:32] Extrems Brock: This can be done on a private estate (I think). [11:33] Thor Columbia: Yes there is money in land resale, however it has to be done on a very very large scale to be economical. [11:34] IntLib: Do the apartment building developers do very well? [11:34] Thor Columbia: They do all right, the big money is in developing plots for RL companies that are willing to pay huge sums for custom jobs. [11:36] IntLib: Ah, interesting. Some friends of mine own Uvvy Island, and are developing a sort of corporate center there, and I've seen similar setups elsewhere, but they seemed under occupied, in fact, a LOT of SL seems under occupied. What is your take on that? [11:37] Thor Columbia: Well that will change over time, and get more dense over time, at first a player may get land and then not do anything with it. The land gets abandoned and people start using it more and more for more productive things [11:38] IntLib: Oh, another question about First Land. Is that something a new user is expected to buy outright, or do they finance it? [11:39] Thor Columbia: They normally buy out right since it is less then two USD [11:39] Thor Columbia: Intlibber, it's been a pleasure but I have to log off for an hour or so. [11:40] IntLib: Sure no problem, I was just going to thank you for your time. [11:40] Thor Columbia: I'll contact you later. It's great to hear what the FSP doing. [11:41] IntLib: Its good to hear there are more folks in SL from the movement. Feel free to stop by the Gimme Liberty Bar any time, we often meet there to listen to Free Talk Live, which is a syndicated and podcasted radio show by Free Staters. [11:41] Thor Columbia: Great I'll see you there... bye.

Today's post is about reading The Philharmonic Gets Dressed and going to the mechanical musical instruments exhibit at Morris Museum. October 13, 2007 Speaking of the Moomins... Posted by The Modesto Kid on October 13, 2007 The second volume of collected Moomin comic strips is coming out this month! You can pre-order it from Amazon. The first volume was a lot of fun. Tags: October 6, 2007 3 Trials Posted by The Modesto Kid on October 6, 2007 I was reading Chapter 5 of Finn Family Moomintroll tonight and wondering about great trial scenes in children's books. The argument between the Hemulen (who is counsel for Thingumy and Bob) and Sniff (the prosecutor) is fantastically good, if brief. The whole thing is just one of the high points of the whole Moomin series. 2 other great courtroom scenes: the trial in The Magic Pudding, and (of course) the prosecution of the Knave of Hearts. Any other good ones? What is especially fun about the court of law in the context of kids' books? In the Moomintrial, I really like how sort of lovably pompous and at the same time sympathetic the Hemulen is when he's arguing that Thingumy and Bob deserve \"the Contents\" of their suitcase even if they belong to the Groke, because Thingumy and Bob believe the Contents to be the most beautiful thing in the world, while the Groke only thinks it is the most expensive thing. Tags: October 4, 2007 Envy Posted by redfox on October 4, 2007 alice courtroom magic pudding moomin Daniel Pinkwater loves John Holbo. I'm so jealous. (If that's really, truly Daniel Pinkwater commenting, then I am really, supremely mega-jealous.) September 30, 2007 Oddballs Posted by snarkout on September 30, 2007 The other day, I had the chance to introduce a friend of mine to When my sister Vicky and I were teenagers we talked a lot about hating people. Hating came easily to us. We would be walking down the street, notice a perfect stranger, and be suddenly struck by how much we hated that person. And at the dinner table we would go on and on about all the popular kids we hated at high school. Our father, who has a very logical mind, sometimes cautioned us about this. \"Don't waste your hate,\" he would say. \"Save it up for important things, like your family, or the President.\" We responded by quoting the famous line from Oddballs, William Sleator's collection of stories about growing up in the early Sixties. (The book is described as \"semi-autobiographical\" various places, but I take Sleator at his word when he asserts, that \"unlikely as it may seem\u2014I have told only one lie about my family in this book.\" Call it a memoir; it's at least twice as truthy as A Million Little Pieces.) The stories are about an ethnic childhood, and the ethnicity is \"weird\"; Sleator's parents were too young old to be hippies and too professional (his father was a professor; his mother was a research physician) to be beatniks, but they were full-on weird. Sleator's stories reflect the sensibilities of the man who would grow up to give me nightmares with House of Stairs and make me read and laugh and re-read with Interstellar Pig: Medea: \"Loathing is endless. Hate is a bottomless I pour and pour.\" Continue reading \"Oddballs\" \u00bb Tags: September 23, 2007 Complicated words Posted by The Modesto Kid on September 23, 2007 I am reading Pamuk's short essay \"When the Furniture is Talking, How Can You Sleep?\" this morning and thinking, wow \u2014 this would be excellent for reading to Sylvia. So I slip into my reading-aloud mode of scanning ahead and making minor edits in vocabulary and punctuation to make the piece more naturally fit my voice \u2014 though with this work there is very little for the editor to do, Pamuk (and his superlatively gifted translator Freely) is such a close fit for me. But I did catch one word that I thought my daughter would probably not understand, \"attendant\" as an adjective \u2014 well there were a couple of words that are probably not in her vocabulary, but all besides this one were in positions that seem to me easy to interpolate \u2014 and wondered what I would do with it if I were actually reading the essay to her. I might just skip over it, read \"the sense of responsibility\", which I think would be just about as meaningful as \"the attendant sense of responsibility\"; I might try to substitute another word but I don't think I could come up with one gracefully on the spur of the moment. I might try to restructure the clause but that probably would not come off well either. Or I might of course just read the sentence as it stood on the page. (Another strategy: when I was reading \"When R\u00fcya is Sad\" last night and hit the phrase \"lying on the divan\", I read it as \"lying on the divan (that means sofa), ...\" Today when I read past \"divan\" she asked to see where it said that, so I pointed it out to her, and she nodded.) Tags: September 20, 2007 Reading Pamuk to a child Posted by The Modesto Kid on September 20, 2007 Well... not Snow t'be sure. But I just got his new book of essays, Other Colors, and it contains at least 3 pieces that make excellent reading-out-loud material: \"I'm Not Going To School\", which is in the voice of his daughter R\u00fcya and lacks the funny ending of Silverstein's say \"at least\" because I just opened the book at random when I was with my daughter and happened on this trio. (Sylvia was into it enough that when I finished one piece she would ask to hear the next.) Update: On further reading, it seems like these pieces are among the short sketches he wrote for the humor magazine Ok\u00fcz, and that several of the others in this group would also be good for reading to kids. Tags: September 14, 2007 Rollin' Home Across the Foam Posted by The Modesto Kid on September 14, 2007 Update, the next day: Wow! Sylvia asked to hear these three pieces again today and the second reading was just wonderful! She's been thinking about them overnight and was asking questions, and making extrapolations and identifying R\u00fcya's thoughts and actions with her own... We spent more time talking about the essays than reading the text. (Cross-posted from READIN.) The whole book The Magic Pudding is a huge amount of fun; but the last chapter is a big improvement over the rest in terms of the author's confidence and command of his voice. The rhyming and doggerel are more clever and inventive. The characters grow to fill out their roles in a way that they don't, really, in the first three chapters. And the courtroom sequence is just hilarious. Tags: September 5, 2007 Reading Aloud Posted by The Modesto Kid on September 5, 2007 characterization doggerel magic pudding narrative voice I think it bears repeating (though I've said it many times before) just how much the quality of a good children's book is improved through reading it aloud. It brings out the rhythm of the language much more strongly than does the silent recitation you do when you're reading to yourself; and rhythm is, so I think, a key attribute of a good children's book. By way of example, after I read Redfox's post on Food, I ordered The Magic Pudding. It arrived a week or so ago and I enjoyed reading it over a couple of nights. Tonight I started reading it to Sylvia for bedtime stories, and wow \u2014 it is such a fun book! The poems hold together much better when chanted and the shanties when sung. My reaction to reading it aloud was much stronger than it had been to reading it to myself and it served as a good reminder that books like this are intended to be read aloud. One other note: I see several text-only editions of this book on Amazon, and it seems weird to me. The pictures are at least half the book! Tags: September 2, 2007 Parents in Kids' Books Posted by The Modesto Kid on September 2, 2007 bunyip bluegum magic pudding reading aloud rhythm Can we make some broad categories of how parents are represented in children's books? I was reading All-of-a-kind Family to Sylvia tonight and thinking, the portrayal of Mama is really nauseating \u2014 it's not enough for her to be wide awake instantly when she hears Sarah crying, the narrator has to say \"wide awake as she always was when she knew one of her children needed her\" (quoted inexactly from memory). And this type of portrayal is pretty common I think \u2014 I seem to remember the parents in the Little House books being painted at every turn as superlatively competent, and I'm sure there are many other similar titles I'm not thinking of right now. What are some other parental types? Danny Champion of the World came to mind right away. My memory of it is pretty unclear but I seem to remember Danny's father being very competent, yes, but in a pretty roguish way \u2014 is that an accurate memory? Moominmamma (who may be sui generis) is loving and motherly but quite unconcerned with always knowing what to do. Absent parents of course abound. What else? Are there any parents who are presented as actively incompetent, always messing things up, without being \"bad guys\"? Are there any parents who are presented as bad guys \u2014 talking about children's books here, not young adult where bad parents are a common trope.

CENTCOM CIA Defend America Defense Intelligence Dept. of Defense FBI - Terrorists FirstGov For the Record (DoD) Homeland Security Intelligence.gov Joint Forces Command NSA State Department The White House Today's Military Home | About | Gallery | Facebook | Twitter | Advertise | Submit News Tips U.S. Department of State Humanitarian Airlift to Georgia Underway I just received an interesting press release from Project HOPE: Project HOPE, an international health education and humanitarian assistance organization, today sent more than $400,000 of antibiotics to the people of Georgia through a U.S. Department of State airlift that will arrive in the Georgian capital city of Tbilisi later this week. Nearly 4,000 bottles of the antibiotic cefprozil, donated by Bristol-Myers Squibb, make up the Project HOPE shipment that will be added to other humanitarian aid supplies that the Department of State is gathering for the airlift. \"Adults and children, whether they are in the midst of the conflict or not, need antibiotics to fight off infections that may develop from wounds or unhealthy living conditions that arise from war,\" said Stuart Myers, Senior Vice President of Global Health at Project HOPE. \"Fortunately, HOPE and our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, were prepared to supply the antibiotics when the Department of State called.\" Project HOPE continues to monitor the situation in Georgia. HOPE officials are in contact with both U.S. and Georgian government officials to identify and address long-term health care needs of the Georgian people. Project HOPE, working in conjunction with the American Friends of Georgia, currently has a humanitarian assistance shipment of more than $1.4 million of medicines and medical supplies on the ground in Georgia. Unfortunately, the shipment arrived just as the conflict commenced and access to the supplies has been cut off. HOPE and the American Friends of Georgia are exploring ways to reach the shipment and may redirect the supplies to assist in conflict relief efforts. A C-17 was in the air this morning as President Bush announced the plan: The C-17 is from the 305th Air Mobility Wing at McGuire Air Force Base, N.J. \"The aircraft will be carrying medical supplies, shelters, bedding \u2014 those types of things,\" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. \"That will be the first flight in; there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long-term humanitarian capabilities.\" A military assessment team will arrive soon to assess the Georgian government's humanitarian needs. The 12-man team will act as a liaison among the U.S. Embassy in Georgia, the Georgian government, and U.S. European Command and other U.S. agencies. The team contains experts in a number of civil affairs fields, Pentagon officials said. Many have recent experience in Georgia and can help to determine what capabilities the United States has that the Georgians may need. \"We're looking at a broader range of assets and capabilities that we might bring to bear on the humanitarian need there,\" Whitman said. The amount and nature of the aid will grow as the assessment team delivers its reports, he said. Defense Department officials will look at assistance options are available,\" Whitman said. This ultimately could include ships delivering humanitarian goods to the nation. Aside from the humanitarian aspects, which are important, this effort also presents us with a chance to aggressively secure Georgian territory. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili certainly anticipates that effect even if Washington won't acknowledge the intent: \"You have heard the statement by the U.S. president that the United States is starting a military-humanitarian operation in Georgia,\" Saakashvili said in a television address. \"It means that Georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S. defence ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions. This is a very important statement for easing tension.\" Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said: \"We are not looking to, not do we need to, take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission.

I've just met with my national security team to discuss the crisis in Georgia. I've spoken with President Saakashvili of Georgia, and President Sarkozy of France this morning. The United States strongly supports France's efforts, as President of the European Union, to broker an agreement that will end this conflict. The United States of America stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia. We insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia be respected. Russia has stated that changing the government of Georgia is not its goal. The United States and the world expect Russia to honor that commitment. Russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease-fire. Unfortunately, we're receiving reports of Russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements. We're concerned about reports that Russian units have taken up positions on the east side of the city of Gori, which allows them to block the East-West Highway, divide the country, and threaten the capital of Tbilisi. We're concerned about reports that Russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of Poti, that Russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port, and that Russia is blowing up Georgian vessels. We're concerned about reports that Georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected. All forces, including Russian forces, have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack. With these concerns in mind, I have directed a series of steps to demonstrate our solidarity with the Georgian people and bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict. I'm sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to France, where she will confer with President Sarkozy. She will then travel to Tbilisi, where she will personally convey America's unwavering support for Georgia's democratic government. On this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free Georgia. I've also directed Secretary of Defense Bob Gates to begin a humanitarian mission to the people of Georgia, headed by the United States military. This mission will be vigorous and ongoing. A U.S. C-17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way. And in the days ahead we will use U.S. aircraft, as well as naval forces, to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies. We expect Russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance. We expect Russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport, including seaports, airports, roads, and airspace, remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit. We expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia. And we expect all Russian forces that entered Georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country. As I have made clear, Russia's ongoing action raise serious questions about its intentions in Georgia and the region. In recent years, Russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic, political, economic, and security structures of the 21st century. The United States has supported those efforts. Now Russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in Georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions. To begin to repair the damage to its relations with the United States, Europe, and other nations, and to begin restoring its place in the world, Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis. Thank you. Source: The White House Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

Chance, on the road with the Russian column, said it was moving slowly south from Gori. He said there were hundreds of men in personnel carriers. CNN has been told by Georgian officials that the convoy would turn off the road to Tbilisi toward an abandoned Georgian military base. The convoy was located well outside the mandated area for Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia. Georgia and Russia have accused each other of violating a cease-fire only 24 hours after it was agreed. An AFP report sounds raises serious doubts about Russia's intentions: Separatist fighters and Russian troops looted and set homes ablaze in Georgian territory on Wednesday amid fears over a fragile ceasefire that ended five days of bitter conflict. Despite a French-brokered truce agreed on Tuesday by the leaders of the two countries, Russia faced mounting criticism in the West. Russian armoured vehicles patrolled the flashpoint town of Gori and about 60 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles were seen on the road from Gori to the Georgian capital, 75 kilometers away. An AFP reporter saw Russian troops shouting: \"Tbilisi, Tbilisi\". Western powers have a mess on their hands as it is. If Russia completely ignores the six-point plan and takes Tbilisi the whole game changes.

She said his lack of experience was \"depressing.\" She's not alone. Joe Lieberman is calling out the inexperienced one as well: \"In my opinion, the choice could not be more clear: between one candidate, John McCain, who's had experience, been tested in war and tried in peace, another candidate who has not,'' Mr. Lieberman said. \"Between one candidate, John McCain, who has always put the country first, worked across party lines to get things done, and one candidate who has not. Between one candidate who's a talker, and the other candidate who's the leader America needs as our next president.\" Joe's just awesome but I'd add \"Between one candidate who comes to the aid of our allies, while the other candidate body surfs and eats snow cones.\" Others Blogging: Macsmind Something is developing in the Presidential election and it's something that only a few people are talking about. The fact that mainstream democrats may just jump ship to vote for McCain in sufficient enough numbers for a victory. Hot Air Lest you still doubt whether Liebs will in fact be in St. Paul despite the heavy-handed hints he's been dropping to reporters, the theme of the convention leaked out today right around the time he was accusing Obama of not putting the country first. The theme: \"Putting Country First.\" Oh, and his wife Hadassah coincidentally will be a guest at a breast cancer fundraiser organized in St. Paul by a Republican group on the first day of the convention. Riehl World View I can't wait to see the Lefty blogs fully respond to this. Or, is it so devastating their only hope is to pretend it wasn't said, ... or that their former VP nominee Lieberman is unimportant? One day I'm going to have to ask one of my more liberal commenters how it is they manage to get their fingers in their ears when their head is so far up their azz. Wake Up America Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. Despite Obama supporters howling at the moon over Lieberman's words, they are not a smear, a smear is a lie and it is totally truthful and appropriate to put out that McCain has been tried and true in his support for America, in his patriotism and in his efforts to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats..... Obama has not.

The plan stops short of specifically addressing the issue of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The points include Russian agreements to conclude all military operations, return Russian armed forces to the line preceding the beginning of operations and not use force again in Georgia. In return, Georgia would return its armed forces to their normal and permanent locations. Both sides would provide free access for humanitarian assistance; and international consideration of the issues of South Ossetia and Abkhazia would be undertaken. Russia on Tuesday said it has called a halt to its powerful military incursion into Georgia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the halt to fighting would enable South Ossetia and Abkhazia to decide whether they want to be part of Georgia, leaving open the possibility Georgia might lose one or both regions. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said \"all we need to do now is to stop suffering, stop the death of people,\" Sarkozy said. Stopping the fighting \"is the most important objective.\" It's important to note that this plan is simply a short-term solution. The Western alliance should be working overtime to develop a follow-on plan that firmly secures Georgian independence.

It's worth keeping an eye on anyway. H/T: Robert Stevens Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

But he did make it in front of the cameras the next day for a rally celebrating his vacation in Hawaii. He promised \"to go body surfing at some undisclosed location.\" During Obama's make-believe presidency, we've heard about bold action, about the courage to talk to dictators. When faced with a real \"3 a.m. moment,\" Obama \u2014 who boasts about 200 foreign policy advisors, broken into 10 subgroups \u2014 proclaims, \"I'm going to get some shave ice.\" Now, of course, this is a bit unfair in that Obama had planned his no doubt well-deserved vacation for a very long time. But presidential vacations are always well planned \u2014 and often interrupted. Snow Cones and body surfing - sounds like an awesome vacation. Meanwhile, John McCain steps up and leads: Republican White House hopeful John McCain Tuesday stepped up a fusillade against Russian \"aggression\" and declared that today, \"we are all Georgians.\" Addressing voters in Pennsylvania, McCain said he had spoken by telephone earlier with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who he said wanted to thank the American people for their support. \"I told him that I know I speak for every American when I say to him, today, we are all Georgians,\" said the Republican, a hardliner against Russia who wants the mighty nation expelled from the Group of Eight club. I've said it before but McCain is the only serious candidate in the race. Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

I'm sure that some will miss the F-16s but the MQ-9 offers many advantages: Strafing and \"intimidation\" (coming in low and fast) attacks have been very useful in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the Reaper is not going to put the F-16s out of business right away. But the 19 ton F-16 costs three times as much as a Reaper, and is much more expensive to operate. The F-16 uses over a hundred times more fuel, per hour in the air, and with the price of oil rapidly rising, that itself means a lot. Put simply, It's cheaper, more effective, and safer (for pilots) to use Reapers (or similar aircraft) for a lot of the ground support work. Fighters are still needed to keep the skies clear of enemy aircraft, although Reapers are better suited for the dangerous work of destroying enemy air defenses. But for fighting irregulars, the Reaper is king. ...The 4.7 ton Reaper has a wingspan of 66 feet and a payload of 1.5 tons. Reaper is considered a combat aircraft, because it can carry everything from the hundred pound Hellfire missile, to the 500 pound laser or GPS guided smart bomb. Reaper has a laser designator, as well as day and night (infrared) cameras. Reaper can stay in the air for over 14 hours and operate at up to 50,000 feet. It's sensors have excellent resolution, and are effective at high altitudes. It's been noted that most of what F-16s (and F-18s) are doing these days is dropping smart bombs, and using their targeting pods to do recon for the ground troops. Reaper does both of these jobs better and cheaper. Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

Hopes for a more liberal Russia under President Dmitry Medvedev will need to be reexamined. His justification for this invasion reads more like Brezhnev than Gorbachev. While no one wants a return to cold war-style confrontation, Russia's behavior poses a direct challenge to European and international order. What can the west do? First, Georgia deserves the west's solidarity and support. The west must get the fighting stopped and preserve Georgia's territorial integrity within its current international border. As soon as hostilities cease, there should be a major, coordinated transatlantic effort to help Tbilisi rebuild and recover. Second, we should not pretend that Russia is a neutral peacekeeper in conflicts on its borders. Russia is part of the problem, not the solution. For too long, Moscow has used existing international mandates to pursue neo-imperial policies. The west must disavow these mandates and insist on truly neutral international forces, under the UN, to monitor a future ceasefire and to mediate. Third, the west needs to counter Russian pressure on its neighbours, especially Ukraine - most likely the next target in Moscow's efforts to create a new sphere of hegemony. The US and the European Union must be clear that Ukraine and Georgia will not be condemned to some kind of grey zone. Finally, the US and the EU must make clear that this kind of aggression will affect relations and Russia's standing in the west. While western military intervention in Georgia is out of the question - and no one wants a 21st-century version of the cold war - Russia's actions cannot be ignored. Realpolitik and political realism don't always prevail but it's naive in the extreme to wish those forces away. This war, a wake up call for Western diplomats, should usher in an intense round of analysis and foreign policy adjustments which account for a Russia that operates with a realism that places it ethically somewhere between an apolitical crime syndicate and the Cold War era Soviet Union. To succeed we'll have to challenge this streak of exploitable Western naivete that we just can't seem to shake. Update: Ronald Asmus three weeks before the war: Many in the West are tempted to look the other way. This crisis is, after all, inconvenient. Georgian democracy is far from perfect, and Tbilisi has certainly made its own mistakes. Russia has a new president who we all hope can be more liberal and open to the West. The United States and its allies also need Moscow to be aligned with the West in the United Nations on issues from Iran to North Korea to Zimbabwe. This is an awkward time to take a tough stance. It would be only too easy to equivocate, blame all parties a little and call for more diplomacy. But this approach is making war in the Caucasus more likely, not less so. If the Rose Revolution fails, we will wait a generation or more for another chance for positive change. Critical principles, including sovereignty and territorial integrity, are at stake. Russia is seeking to redefine the rules of post-Cold War European security to its advantage. And as Georgia is considered a U.S. project, the prestige of the United States is on the line. The Rose Revolution was animated by American values. Tbilisi has pursued U.S.-style economic reforms, has soldiers in Iraq and wants to join NATO. The region is waiting to see whether and when Washington will step in. If the West doesn't try to stop Russia's overstepping, countries in the region \u2014 from Azerbaijan to Central Asian energy producers \u2014 will recalculate accordingly. Again, I think it's time for all involved to recalculate. Share This Post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

There's reason for concern at the moment: Georgian officials insisted that Russia has continued the bombings despite the pledge. And hours before the Russian order, Georgian officials said Russian jets targeted government offices and an outdoor market in the crossroads city of Gori, killing six. Russia, which denied the bombing, launched an offensive in the only part of Abkhazia still under Georgian control. Gori was all but deserted late Monday \u2014 most remaining residents and Georgian soldiers fled ahead of a feared Russian onslaught. The post office and university were still burning.

Essentially his entire early academic career took place at Princeton University, having completed his AB (1924) and his PhD (1927, under Oswald Veblen) there, and then serving as a professor of mathematics from 1929 until 1967. (After retiring from Princeton in 1967, he taught at UCLA as a professor of mathematics and philosophy until 1990.) Church's most significant mathematical contribution was the creation (with Stephen Kleene) of the -calculus, a formal system in the language of functions. Church is probably best remembered for Church's Thesis, the claim that every effectively computable function is in fact a function that is definable in his -calculus. Kurt G\u00f6del balked at this claim, and introduced the primitive recursive functions as a more natural alternative to model the notion of effective computability. Stephen Kleene, a student of Church, showed that in fact the functions definable in the -calculus exactly correspond to G\u00f6del's primitive recursive functions. By the late 1930s, another notion of computability had been put forward by Alan Turing, and it too had been shown to be equivalent to -definability. The sets of -definable functions, primitive recursive functions, and functions implementable as Turing Machines, are identical sets of functions. This agreement of three diverse approaches to formalizing the vague notion of \"effectively computable\" is viewed as strong evidence that all three approaches have in fact captured that concept. At its most general, Church's Thesis is the claim that effective computability is equivalent to these three formalizations. Given that \"effectively computable\" is unlikely to ever be formally defined, Church's Thesis remains an unproven (and unprovable) claim. Alas, Church's Thesis first appeared in 1936, and was not a part of Church's (doctoral) thesis of 1927 (Alternatives to Zermelo's Assumption, an attempt to create a logic in which the axiom of choice is false).

Tags: Carnival of Mathematics Six Degrees of Separation? August 8, 2008 by Posted in Carnival | No Comments \u00bb Photo of Kevin Bacon by SAGIindie (Creative Commons license) The notion of \"degrees of separation\" is once again in the news, thanks to Microsoft. The basic idea is that you start with someone, look at everyone they know (where \"know\" would have to be defined in some way), then look at everyone that those people know, and see what happens. Chain letters and pyramid schemes thrive on this sort of thing. The origin of \"six degrees of separation\" seems to date back to the 1929 short story \"Chains\" by Frigyes Karinthyin: One of us suggested performing the following experiment to prove that the population of the Earth is closer together now than they have ever been before. We should select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth\u2014anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual using nothing except the network of personal acquaintances. Musing #1: The 5th root of 1.5 billion is about 68.5. This suggests that each person would need at least 68 personal acquaintances if there was no overlap. But since many people share personal acquaintances, the actual number would have to be a lot higher. Musing #2: The notion of six degrees of separation was introduced in a work of fiction. Then there was this paper by Jeffrey Travers and Stanley Milgram in 1969 about an experiment by Milgram in which people in the USA got letters to someone they didn't know by sending the letters to people they did know, who would send it to people they knew, etc. The average number of people it passed through was 5.2 [so each letter was sent 6.2 times on average to get to the final person] leading to more emphasis on that whole SIX thing. Problem #1: Here the 6.2 was an average, not a maximum like in the short story above. This distinction is always sometimes pretty much always blurred when degrees of separation are talked about informally. Problem #2: The 6.2 was the average only of the letters that made it to their destination, and that was only 64 out of 296. In other words, this experiment suggests that two people in the US would be 6.2 steps on average away from each other if they're connected at all, but they probably aren't. Problem #3: The title \"Infinite Degrees of Separation\" isn't so catchy, and is a little depressing. Problem #4: This is the same Stanley Milgram who conducted the infamous Milgram Experiment in which volunteers gave supposed electric shocks to supposed volunteers in response to mistakes. Not that this has anything to do with the Small World theory, but it was a surprise to me that it was the same guy. Moving along, the degrees of separation results were repeated in the Small World Project through Columbia University and published here in 2003. As explained in the abstract: We report on a global social-search experiment in which more than 60,000 e-mail users attempted to reach one of 18 target persons in 13 countries by forwarding messages to acquaintances. This was worldwide, not just the USA, and with much bigger numbers, and yours truly actually participated in it. It led to some interesting results: Result #1: Of the completed chains, the median number of steps was 4.05, though the authors conjectured that overall the median number of steps is probably five to seven. This lead to headlines like \"Email experiment confirms six degrees of separation\". Result #2: The participants were not a random sample. From the article above: \"More than half of all participants resided in North America and were middle class, professional, college educated, and Christian\" In theory, I think only the starting and ending points would have to be random, but here the starting and ending people did need to have internet access and I'd question whether or not internet access is truly independent of social connectedness internationally. Result #3: The average is, once again, based only on completed chains. And out of the 24,163 chains, only 384 were finished. In other words, most people don't seem to be connected. Either that or we're just lazy \u2014 there's some evidence for that in the paper: if people couldn't think of a good person to pass the email along to, they didn't pass it along to anyone. Then in June 2006 Microsoft got in on the action. They looked at all the Instant Messenges that month and counted folk as connected if they exchanged at least one IM. The average degrees of separation was 6.6, which lead to recent headlines like, \"Everyone really is just six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon\" with the subheader, \"A study of Microsoft's instant messaging network supports the popular idea that everyone on the planet can be connected through fewer than seven links in a chain of contacts.\" Misconception #1: Once again, the six degrees, which was really more like seven, is an average and not a maximum. Microsoft did find that 78% of users could be connected in seven stages or less, but they also said that some pairs were separated by 29 degrees. Actually, what might be the most interesting bit to me is that the news articles I looked at (on Yahoo! News and The Washington Post) imply that everyone was connected in some way, which is very different from the results of the previous study. Misconception #2: I think it's a stretch to claim that Microsoft IM users are representative of everyone on the planet, and I'd be wary of claims like the headline above that extrapolate it to every single person. But despite the limitations of studies like this, if you limit yourself to certain subsets of people, you still can have some fun. For example: Related Website #1: The Oracle of Bacon. This site allows you to choose an actor and see that actor's \"Bacon Number\" (their degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon). For example, if you pick Christina Mastin, you find: Christina Mastin has a Bacon number of 2. Christina Mastin was in Dogfight (1991) with Brendan Fraser Brendan Fraser was in Air I Breathe, The (2007) with Kevin Bacon You can also choose the Advanced Setup to search for a path linking any two actors. Incidentally, the notion that all actors are connected to Kevin Bacon appeared around 1994, and last year Kevin Bacon started a charitable giving organization called SixDegrees.org, which is a nice thing even though Kevin himself claims on the site that the six degrees of separation is a maximum and not an average. (You might want to correct that, Kev. But still, kudos for the charity work.) Related Website #2: The Erd\u00f6s Number Project. This site studies collaboration among mathematicians, many of whom have co-authored a paper with someone who co-authored a paper with someone who co-authored a paper with Paul Erd\u00f6s. For example, Natalie Portman has an Erd\u00f6s number of 5: she published a psychology paper (as Natalie Hershlag) with Abigail A. Baird, who published a paper on Functional Connectivity with M.S. Gazzaniga, who published a paper on Acquired central dyschromatopsia with J.D. Victor, who published a combinatorics paper with J. Gillis, who published a paper on transfinite diameter with Paul Erd\u00f6s. Incidentally, Natalie currently has a Bacon number of 2 but this coming February she and Kevin are both appearing in the movie New York, I Love You, giving Natalie an Erd\u00f6s-Bacon Number of 6 (5+1). Related Website #3: The six degrees of celeb dating. This site is a game, so it gives you two people and you have to fill in the dating chain yourself. The site will, however, tell you if you're right and it gives you a limited number of celebrities to choose from: I was able to tell that Drew Barrymore dated Edward Norton who dated Salma Hayek in only about ten guesses. If that's too much work or if closed cycles interest you more than chains, you can see a twelve-step dating cycle starting and ending with Brad Pitt on cbs2chicago.

Happy Birthday Marvin! And wasn't it cool of NASA and friends to use Marvin in the patch for the Mars Exploration Rovers?) At any rate, this week's puzzle is particularly challenging. One person picks two whole numbers between 2 and 99, tells the sum to a second person and the product to a third person. The second person tells the third person they [Person #3] can't possibly know the original numbers, and the third person realizes that that is enough information to figure it out. With that revelation, the second person is able to figure it out. Your job is to find the numbers. Seriously, that's all the information that you get, though it's phrased perhaps a little more clearly at Blinkdagger. And at the moment I have little idea how to solve it, but I'm working on it. It did, however, remind me of one of my favorite problems that I occasionally given to non-majors in a \"distribution requirement\" math class. The problem involves a census taker who asks a parent the ages of the three children who live in the house. The ages (whole numbers) multiply to seventy-two, and add to the house number. The census-taker looks at the house number and says, \"That's not enough information.\" The parent agrees, and comments that the oldest child has a pet rabbit, and that's enough to solve the problem. Like I said, I love this problem, but my students are often a little overwhelmed when I assign it. This led to one of my favorite ever teaching exchanges, which went something like this: Student: Does it matter that it's a rabbit? Me: Not in particular. It could be a dog. Or a cow. The student thought for a while, then: Student: I got it! \"Rabbit\" in French is lapin, which has 5 letters. \"Dog\" in French is chien, which has 5 letters. And \"Cow\" in French is vache, which also has 5 letters. Am I on the right path? One the one hand, I loved the student's enthusiasm (which was not unusual for this student) and also the willingness to try new ways of thinking. And this student was no slouch mathematically, and was a joy to have in class. On the other hand, it really gave me insight into what word problems must seem like to a non-mathematician, if translating the words into a foreign language and then counting the letters seemed like a reasonable course of action. In problem solving, \"easy\", \"hard\", and \"obvious\" are in the eye of the beholder, not necessarily the eye of the author of the problem. [Which isn't me -- I've seen versions of this problem in several places.] And in good news, my student did go on to solve the problem correctly. Posted in Problems, Teaching | 1 Comment \u00bb Math Card Tricks: I Know the 5th Card August 4, 2008 by Batman and I were recently shown a card trick by a colleague and a former student. It was a two-person show, with the student playing the role of \"Assistant\" and our colleague playing the \"Mind Reader\". This is what we saw. The Mind Reader left the room, and the Assistant explained that she could communicate with the Mind Reader telepathically. We chose five cards (total) from a standard deck of 52, then showed them to the Assistant. Here are our cards: She picked one of the five (the 2), told us to remember it, hid it, then arranged the remaining four cards in a row, like so: The Assistant then told the Mind Reader to enter (why didn't she just \"think\" him back in?). The Mind Reader studied the cards and proudly proclaimed that the last card was the 2. Ta-da! How did they do it? Posted in Math Magic | No Comments \u00bb Mathematician of the Week: Th\u00e9odore Olivier August 3, 2008 by TwoPi Th\u00e9odore Olivier was born January 21, 1793, and died on August 5, 1853. He was a student of Gaspard Monge, and indeed Monge's influence seems apparent in Olivier's most famous work: his models of the intersections of three dimensional surfaces. Olivier used strings arranged on a metal framework to model each individual surface. As the surfaces move relative to one another, the strings allow one to study the curve where the two surfaces intersect. (Monge had constructed static models depicting such intersections; by changing materials Olivier had a pedagogic breakthrough.) Union College has a large collection of these models, and has created a web page devoted to their collection and its history. One of their computer science students [now alumnus], Mike Pinch, created software to simulate the models, and give the user the opportunity to manipulate the models. Union also has posted several .avi videos of this software in action.

One of their recent releases (from earlier this year) is a video all about one of our favorite polygons: the nonagon! Several other polygons make guest appearances as well. You can see the video below. The first minute or so is introduction, followed by the nonagon song, one about the letter O, and then a good-bye (5:32 total). Tags: nonagon, tmbg Countdown to the Olympics August 1, 2008 by Posted in Polygons, Video | 2 Comments \u00bb Nowadays we have fancy clocks that countdown to the Olympics, like this Beijing clock; posted under creative commons license by topgold or this Vancouver clock by Makaristos And these are nice and all, but they're not exactly portable. For that, you need to go back 2100 years. In 1901, spongedivers found an ancient shipwreck near southern Greece. It had all sorts of stuff with it, including a bronze clock that was somewhat beat up but, in its heyday, looked something like this: Olympic Digital Camera; creative commons copyright by Marsyas The clock was named the Antikythera Mechanism, in honor of the island Antikythera near where the ship sunk, and it got its very own website here. For a long time no one knew exactly how it worked or what it measured. But then in 2005 Britain sent a 3-dimensional (tomography) x-ray machine down to Athens, where the pieces of the Antikythera Mechanism are on display, and they found out a couple things. First, it used gears, well before the Swiss watchmakers. Second, it kept track of the Olympic games. That's particularly interesting because, with the games occurring every 4 years, a clock wasn't strictly necessary. But as the folk of Beijing and Vancouver know, that doesn't mean it's not special. The news articles that talk about this clock (e.g. here and here) also draw a connection to Archimedes. Different parts of Greece used different names for the months, and the names used on this clock were used in Syracuse, where Archimedes had lived 100 years earlier. (They were also used in other cities, but that's not part of this story.) So Alexander Jones (from the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University) said: We know Archimedes did mechanical astronomy here 100 years earlier and this could be from his home city, it could have been inspired by his work, or it could have been a local tradition that he started. That's a lot of \"could\"s. Nonetheless, whether or not Archimedes had anything to do with the clock or not, it's still a pretty neat object. Thanks to Pam for bringing my attention to this story! Tags: Antikythera Mechanism, clock, olympics Order of operations: does it really matter? July 31, 2008 by TwoPi Posted in Calendar | 1 Comment \u00bb George Orwell While surfing the webpages of a variety of newspapers this morning, I stumbled on the following.... On the staged-reality-tv show Big Brother (UK version), they gave the housemates a mathematical task: they had to compute three different sums, then use the three resulting answers as the combination to a safe. Implicit in the problem was that the three calculations should each result in a two-digit integer. Video posted to the Channel 4 website shows the contestants muttering, struggling, and having an extremely difficult time of it. And with good reason! Here are the three calculations they were given, as posted on the Channel 4 website: Sum#1: 3 x 17 - 24 + 78 x 9 \u00f7 5 - (13\u00b2) + (65 - 29) \u00f7 4 + (4\u00b2) - (7 x 3) + (3\u00b2) + 99 - (7\u00b2) - 49 Sum#2: 1396 x 2 \u00f7 4 \u2014 (12\u00b2) + 46 x 2 \u00f7 40 x (5\u00b2) - (7 x 99) x 3 - (11\u00b2) x 5 - 219 Sum#3: 100 - 33 x 5 + 665 \u00f7 (5\u00b2) x 17 - 248 x 3 \u00f7 (4\u00b2) + 52 \u00f7 7 + (273 - 217) From the look of things on the on-line video, I'm guessing that the contestants had no writing implements, and had to do all of this in their head. That makes this challenging enough, I suppose. Making matters worse is that none of the three sums is integer valued; they work out to 62/5, -4583/2, and 26189/70. Rather, these are their values if one computes using the usual order of operations, where exponents have precedence over other operations, where multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction, where calculations are performed left-to-right, and parentheses can be used to override this sequencing. (\"PEMDAS\" is a popular acronym with my students, standing for \"Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction\", and sometimes recalled using the mnemonic \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\") Apparently the folk who created this puzzle expected their contestants to work left-to-right, ignoring operator precedence, in the way that a $1 calculator might do. (Calculators that do pay heed to order of operation conventions are often marketed as \"scientific\" calculators.) For example, the first sum should go as follows: 3 x 17 - 24 + 78 x 9 \u00f7 5 - (13\u00b2) + (65 - 29) \u00f7 4 + (4\u00b2) - (7 x 3) + (3\u00b2) + 99 - (7\u00b2) - 49 = 3 x 17 - 24 + 78 x 9 \u00f7 5 - 169 + 36\u00f7 4 + 16 - 21 + 9 + 99 - 49 - 49 = 51 - 24 + 702/5 - 169 + 9 + 16 - 21 + 9 + 99 - 49 - 49 = 62/5 But I suspect the intended calculation was instead: 3\u00d717 = 51, 51-24 = 27, (7\u00b2) - 49 = 19 Similar (incorrect!) computations for sum #2 and sum #3 yield 31 and 75, respectively. Clearly it is important that we agree on our order of operations. But why do we prefer one over the other? Is this merely a cultural convention? One stock answer to this is to point to the algebra of polynomials: our conventions regarding operator precedence play a central role in how we interpret linear equations (e.g. what is the slope of the line ?), how we interpret polynomials (e.g. is a quadratic or a cubic polynomial?), and how we compute sums and products of polynomials. But this morning, having not yet had my first cup of coffee, I wonder: is it possible to change the rules of arithmetic, so that all operations have the same precedence (unless exceptions are forced by parentheses), and to develop a meaningful algebra based on similar principles? It seems to me that the answer is yes, and I wonder exactly what is lost by doing so, other than familiarity. Posted in Math Mistakes, Math in Pop Culture | 9 Comments \u00bb The Trouble with Units July 30, 2008 by There have already been a couple examples of what can go wrong when you mix up Metric and Imperial units on a Boeing 767 or a spacecraft to Mars. But it turns out that even nonstandard units can cause a little bit of trouble. By \"nonstandard units\", I mean units such as spork and by \"little bit of trouble\" I mean an accounting error of $66,500,000. That's a lot of cutlery. The error is related to the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Back in 2005, a large number of house supplies (pots, pans, toilet paper, etc.) were donated or purchased for people who had lost their homes. The items were stored in a warehouse in Louisiana, and then in Texas, and then...nothing. They sat there in Forth Worth, and FEMA paid about a million dollars a year to keep them stored. And not long ago FEMA decided to give them away rather than continue to pay that storage (plus the warehouse was apparently going to be torn down). At this point the story became quite public, and Louisiana said that HEY they still needed those, because three years later there are still people who are recovering, and why have all these things been collecting dust anyway? And FEMA said, Well we offered them to you and you didn't want them, so don't blame us. Etc. Etc. And during all this arguing, the reported value of the supplies was listed at $85 million. But now it turns out that it wasn't $85 million after all \u2014 it was more like $18.5 million. Because when they were counting things, they counted single items such as one spork the same as entire cases, as in one case of sporks. As the General Services Administration explained last week, \"The final adjustments reveal there was a significant overstatement in the total asset valuation.\" So on the one hand, this is good because that's $66.5 million dollars that wasn't wasted after all (indeed, it never existed). And on the other hand, the fact that there was such a large accounting error on top of the revelation that all this stuff was just sitting there doing nothing isn't really making anyone feel very good.

One of the facts that arose in the comments this morning was about the gas mileage of Cruise Ships. If you're worried about your 20 miles per gallon and envying a 40 mpg hybrid (even though it might not be as good a deal as it sounds initially), be glad that you're not taking the Queen Elizabeth 2 to work. The QE2 gets only 40-50 feet per gallon. The Queen Mary is even worse, getting 13 feet per gallon*. That's .0025 miles per gallon or, put another way, over 400 gallons per mile. And if you're talking gallons per mile instead of miles per gallon, you know these rising fuel prices are hitting you especially hard. *13 feet per gallon = 1 meter per liter, which is fun to say out loud.

Finck's most significant mathematical contribution appears to have been his analysis of the running time of the Euclidean Algorithm, which he published in 1841. One wonders if his own life experiences contributed to his interest in recursive algorithms. Upon graduating from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1817, he was admitted to the Artillery School. However, he wasn't satisfied with his studies there, and applied ( in March 1818 ) to transfer to the Royal Guard cavalry. Request denied. 4 months later, he applied to the cavalry again, this time saying that he would resign if his request was not honored. Request denied. So he resigned from Artillery School.... But by early 1819 he had second thoughts, and applied for reinstatement to the Artillery School. Request denied. At this point, he changed tactics, and began studying mathematics at the University of Strasbourg. He completed his doctoral dissertation (on movements of the terrestrial equator) in 1829. Ironically, by that time, he had been appointed as a mathematics instructor at the Artillery School of Strasbourg. I suppose Finck's life might provide a valuable lesson in the importance of sticking to your guns.

She would now have to weave her way carefully back to her department, making it look like just another trip for work matters. The sharp afternoon sunlight stung her eyes, reflecting off the tar covered roof of the building and made them water. Yet she couldn't resist looking at the pigeons in the alcove above the terrace door. Two male ones trying to woo a female. One of them won and the other flew away after the long battle, then, one false move, and Swooosh! Away flew the female, leaving the 'winner' alone on the ledge. One false move, she thought to herself. The building corridors felt cold and dark after the searing sunshine outside. Had it been a false move, or the perfect one? The one that won the heart and hand of the she-pigeon or the one that lost favor with her? The answers could wait for now. She would think later. For now all she had to do was act busy and important. And go back to her seat before people started missing her presence. -------------- \"Coffee?\" She jerked back to reality at the sound of her colleague's voice. \"Sure!\" she replied, picking up the cue. \"Where were you?\" He whispered on the way out. \"Boss was looking for you but I said you had gone to the legal department for the final agreement. OK?\" \"Thanks! Arrey yaar, it was unavoidable, got a sudden call and had to go away.\" Luckily the agreement is in place - all she needed to do was take a printout. Her colleague was amazing. \"Call? Didn't see you around. Where were you? I thought you had left office, so covered for you. Bata to deti yaar. By the way, did you hear...\" Relieved, she let the conversation wander. But she knew he will not forget the 'curious incidence of the hush-hush phone call' so soon. It would come up during dinner later. But for now, she would let things be. ------------ On the way back home she let her mind wander towards the conversation on the phone. To look for loopholes, mistakes. But somehow she found herself thinking about the roof. The searing heat of the sun coupled with the coolness of the November air. The Green trees in the vicinity which she had never noticed before. And the Huge, monstrous coolers and water heaters atop the roof - the pipes criss-crossing the way roof top - the pile of construction rubble in the corner. It was surprising how she had never gone there in her long tenure here. Would all this be there in Chennai? What would it be like over there? When will she have to move, if at all... Wait. She was jumping the gun. It was important that the person on the other end of the line found her suitable too. What had she said? She could not remember details of the conversation. This was ridiculous! The conversation had lasted a little less than an hour, a long time. Yet she could not remember a single sentence. She remembered it spanned a lot of topics, including the move to Chennai. Would she be alright with it? Would she be able to adjust? She would need to tell him (her colleague). Yet she was hesitant. He was a dear friend, but a colleague too. Infact, a colleague first and friend later. But another such call and he will not leave her alone - haunting her about her mysterious phone calls. Telling him was an important decision - after all it had major career implications for her. Not to mention location implications. How would he take it? She flipped open her cell phone and dialed his number. \"Hey. When do we meet for the dinner? And where? Lets go someplace quiet.\" \"Sure. What's wrong with you today? You seem rather pensive since afternoon. All morning you were jittery and glued to your comp. You OK? Want to postpone the dinner and rest tonight?\" \"Uh... no. I'm fine. Something's come up, so wanted to tell you about it.\" \"Okay...how does 9 pm sound? Ill pick you up. You choose the place.\" ------ \"So, madam what is this news? But first tell me, how are you feeling now?\" \"Oh, much better!\" :) Shall we order first? I'm starving. \"Yeah, I dint have much lunch either. Neither did you, or did you? Neha was mentioning...\" It was difficult to stick to one topic with him. He was vivacious and full of tidbits. But once he remembered something, he would not let go. She waited patiently through his useless small talk and gave him her usual piece of mind wherever required. The food was served. Delicious Parathas roasted with stuffed vegetables. That's when she told him. She knew he would not like it. How much, she didn't know. \"You will move away?! But you never mentioned it!\" \"um...yeah, it never came up. Was a little sudden.\" \"Sudden? How can a decision to move away be 'sudden'? How come you never told me or discussed with me?\" The Parathas were not as delicious suddenly. They were late for the movie, but it was a relief of sorts to part ways that night. ----- The days were difficult to pass. She could not determine how much importance to give her mundane everyday work anymore. He was a little upset initially but was surprisingly supportive. It was her decision he said. \"Just let me know when you need my help.\" He seemed almost aloof. Or was she imagining it? She didn't know whether it was because she had told him late, or because of the news itself. It did not seem to help if she told him that no one else knew. Not yet, anyway. But then, they had promised to go ahead together, helping each other. She still had not told him where she had answered the call. The roof was imprinted in her mind, and she did not want unwanted visitors there. He, however, was sure to tell others about the sanctum for phone calls. And then her chance of a private word and moment was destroyed. Instead she would tell him when it was confirmed that she was leaving. Often she would remember the private moment on the roof. The moment when she calmed her nerves after the long conversation, after the day-long wait for the call. And watched the pigeons. Had she said something wrong? Would the answer be a 'no' after so many days of trial? She herself was not too sure that she wanted to move to Chennai. But then everything else was right in place. It wouldn't be too bad, she told herself. In fact, the only problem really, would be people in this company. Her boss and of course, him. The phone call had been the final step. She checked her mails for updates. Checked her phone for messages. Called home. And waited, hopelessly. She toyed with the idea of sending a mail first. Of making the call herself. But she was not sure of her own answer. She gave up hope. They did not like her. It was wrong of her to harp on the moving to Chennai bit. Her false move. The pigeon had flown away. On the way to bed she decided to try one more time and opened her private mail. There it was - a new mail! Finally, some response! Breathlessly she waited for the page to open, willing it to open in milliseconds. Waiting to read the first two lines. Would it be positive? She wished it to be positive. \"Dear Ms..., We are pleased to...\" ------ \"Hi! Got the mail last night. I'm selected! And not for Chennai. I will be located in the Mumbai office itself, then if I'm ready to move...\" \"Wow! Wonderful news! I'm so happy for you. And that you are not going!\" \"Thanks! I can barely believe it, its great isn't it?\" \"Yeah. You don't have to worry about Chennai anymore. And now, you can at least give me lessons on Interviews. Dont back out this time. Like you did while applying here.\" \"I told you, it was an unexpected referral and I'm sorrry. But I can refer you here now!\" \"How is your guy taking it? Happy I hope!\" \"Of Course! He is delighted. More so because I stay here.\" \"And we can still meet often enough for our dinners.\" \"Yes. And listen.\" \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow, remind me to take you to the Roof. That's where I gave the interview. But don't look at the pigeons. One false move can spoil everything, but that one thought can make you very, very worried.\" Tuesday, February 26, 2008 Jodha Akbar - My opinionWatched Jodha Akbar... I would give it 3 stars...For starters, I must confess that I am a big fan of Ashutosh Gowarikar...I have loved Lagaan and Swades and the latter left a deep impact on my mind ever since I watched it...Yet, I will try to review this without much bias :) Jodha Akbar has its own positives like the direction, camera work, the grandeur look that its been given; the grand sets, jewellery, clothes, food, elephants... Most of all, the genuineness in Ashutosh's films is what appeals me. His films are usually very honest and render the message straight off; no pretensions, no hyped up stuff, no stereotypes. Some fantastic scenes like the one in which Akbar (Hrithik) fights with an elephant and brings it under his control - very Elegantly picturised; war scenes have been done very well - massive, as they ought to be; also the romance scenes between Akbar and Jodha - I have always loved the way Ashutosh portrays romance - both in Lagaan and Swades, romance between the hero and his girl is pure and beautiful; Ashu never pollutes such scenes and they never turn into vulgar-skin-showing-feeling-up-each-other types and that is exactly what I like about them. I particularly enjoyed the bhojan scene where Jodha cooks for Akbar, the scene in which she writes his name and asks him to read it, the king goes to the Agra Bazaar and finds out what problems his people face, the talwar fight sequence between Jodha and Akbar... The background score, Music and choreography are very satisfying; very apt to situations in the film. I simply loved Rehman's composition of Khwajaji; Azeem-o-shaan shehenshah was beautifully choreographed - very vibrant. In my opinion, Rehman is the only drastically versatile music composer we have today. He dives completely into the genre of the film and brings out some gems like these. What a contrast, in say, a Rang de Basanti and Jodhaa Akbar! Beauty! Having said all this, I felt that somewhere (this time) Ashutosh has digressed with the script. The movie turns out to be more about glorifying Akbar rather than being a love story. The entire thing about bringing out Akbar's greatness and humility overshadowed the main theme of the film - the love story. I also come to notice a major contradiction in Akbar's character. During the film, one gets a feeling that Akbar was very patriotic towards his sar-zameen, Hindustan. He says he cannot leave Hindustan at the mercy of any Tom, Dick and Harry and says more dialogues to that effect. This clearly shows how much he is in love with Hindustan and therefore is a patriot. But we must remember that he was also a ruler which means he was greedy for more and more land; he wanted to rule over entire Hindustan. The contradiction in the character comes herein - A patriot never wants to rule a nation, he just wants it to be free; which means Akbar is not patriotic (as shown in the film) but is just possessive of something he owns. So, for him, Hindustan is more of a trophy (that he won) than a land that he loves and can make sacrifices for it. Though, I don't know whether this part of Akbar's character was Ashutosh's imagination or Akbar was really like that. I also felt that Hrithik cant play a character role like that of Akbar. Maybe comparisons shouldn't be drawn but Prithviraj Kapoor as Akbar seems to have got etched in my mind. That look of pride in his face, the elegant king-like walk, the erect shoulders and the bitterly eyes speaking volumes; all this was certainly missing in Hrithik. He did his usual Dhoom 2 walk everywhere though I must say that his dialogue delivery has improved quite a bit. Anyway, all in all a good film. A period film after a long while and a good one at that. Must watch at least once. I will buy the DVD :) Cheers!! Tuesday, November 27, 2007 I will build a faith I will advocate a religion. Someday I will preach it, and I am sure there will be lots of takers. Some of the dictates will be as follows. - My religion will have God/Gods, however, who or how I shall think of when the time comes as per public likes/dislikes. Chances are that it could be my boyfriend or me :) Anyways, Gods will never be the same always. They will change with each each season. - Truth, of course, will be preferred. However, when unavoidable white lies are allowed. - You will be forced to think. There will be weekly gatherings where you will have to reach by solving a clue game before the religion will be propounded to you. - You will be forced to participate in weekly gatherings that consist of PJs ( phaltu jokes). All followers of this faith must bring along at least 5 such jokes and should be good listeners of the same. - Mailing, chatting and exchange of interesting articles on a weekly basis will be a must, discussions on some of them will be mandatory on the weekly gatherings. - Working will be permissible for not more than 3 days a week. The holidays will be decided later, they are the days which shall constitute discussions on the forums (refer #3 above) - There will be a festival every month lasting for at least 5 days where everyone is supposed to do one activity they enjoy/ need to do. It may include eating out, singing, boozing, sleeping, learning something, or even lazing at home and reading book(s). The festival shall not on any count coincide with the designated weekly holidays. - Music will be the standard medium of prayer. An hour is a compulsory daily dose for meditation; more is preferred. Type of music depends upon individual taste. Takes you closer to the Lord(s). Rock or Classical music, of course, will be preferred. - Everyone will have complimentary access to a library (physical and web-based) by virtue of being a believer of this religion. The basic dictate of the religion will be - - Happy living through peaceful oblivion (also practicing a certain colourful 3 letter word). - Reduction of ill vibes between people through reduction in bitching (except of course where unavoidable, and not more than once in a conversation.) - Doing, instead of cribbing - yeah it's a pain, but in this religion there has to be some work after all! One needs to work on one's cribs. Tuesday, November 06, 2007 Bruise At a length of 0.5 cm and a thickness of 0.1 cm, the bruise on the inner side of my neck is evolving in a more picturesque manner than expected. The bruise caused by I still don't know who, what, where, how. One fine morning, it just appeared. And I think I aggravated it further by scratching liberally with the moody finger of my left hand. Well, it initially had a little bump and within 30 minutes of coming into existence it had turned from a bright Tomato Red to a dark dark Red, almost Black rather symmetric bump on the side of my neck. For the first day the pain was enough to remind me of its existence. However, the next day onwards a chance glance through the object forming the specular reflection (the mirror) for my vision made me re-look, thinking it was a mole of sorts. After that the bump was a nice, firm irregularity on the side of my neck. Friends suggested pricking it so the clotted blood would have an outlet and the 'bruise' would go. But, I believed it would just become more pinched over time and then separate from my body like dead cells do. However, the bump subsided over time. Today the bump has almost subsided to skin level, and has become a beautiful Maroon-Red. A rather enchanting colour. Especially when held against sunlight. Now that it has become like any regular bruise, I expect it to go through the usual colour changes of Purple, Green-Yellow and Yellow then light Brown before vanishing. I find it rather entertaining to observe the colour changes of bruises. I think that comes from the fact that I bruise often, and the best bet is to enjoy them if you can't avoid them. Perhaps the life cycle of this bruise will be short considering it's on the inner side of my neck has a high blood flow. Let me see. It would have been fun if they were not so independent and performed small activities for you. Example, you tell the bruise 'Change!' and it changes colours. You tell 'Hide' and it vanishes for some time. You say, 'Shift' and you can move it to a different body part. Would have made them so much more interesting I think. However, now they seem to have a mind of their own, and decide where to appear on their personal whims. Sometime even hurt you, and definitely change colours when you are not looking. Well, at least they provide some entertainment. Monday, November 05, 2007 Predicting the Future It's been a slow kind of day - meaning I have work pending which I am not doing. Finally the long days and short nights of the past week are catching up. With a weekend of activity ahead with Diwali et al, I don't see much respite till Monday. So, as I sit on my seat with empty cups of Cappuccino beside me, I wonder - modern day people have become too mindless to think; they mostly just follow. Else, what once developed art form, now revered / ridiculed as forecasting tool has no new versions. What am I talking about? Tealeaf reading of course! Something so innovative, new and so darned weird, has no modern day equivalents! I mean, reading the dregs of tea is definitely a European thing. Yet Tea itself is such an old concoction in Asia (China to be precise). It went to Europe only more than a century ago. People were imaginative enough then, to have Tea and wonder about one's future depending upon the shape of the broken Tealeaves at the bottom of the cup. Why then, has today's wo/man left innovating? Why not something new about the way and shape of coffee rings left on the cup? What about the foam on the opposite wall of the empty cup? Wont someone please step up and analyse that and tell me my future? Considering so many coffee drinkers around the world are interested in the occult, how is it that they don't do a little bit of innovation and extrapolation to develop new techniques for today's beverage - coffee? With the Internet and the 'world being small' and all that, I am sure they will have enough takers, if not earn a few pennies in the bargain. Hmm...Perhaps this was left for me to create. I now know my true calling...my future (I read it from my 3 empty cups). It is to drink coffee and predict the future on the basis of the foam marks on the cup! Thus I shall foretell what the future holds for you. Only condition - it has to be Cappuccino with lots of foam. Tuesday, July 31, 2007 Jewels of Matrimony Come to me! The initial 10 readings are free. Was going through a friend's profile on Hindu matrimony. (she wanted some editing done by expert hands :-) I spent sometime in going through other profiles. As usual the site did not dissapoint. First things first. My friend would NEVER pose in front of a bright-Red background, in a neon shirt with her mobile in hand and have the starting words of her write-up as \"Myself Naina...\". - One guy went on and on about his brother while he was the intended candidate. Apparently his brother was well-settled and the \"good catch\" in the family. Sadly enough he'd already been caught. Toh kya fayda hua? - One chap wronte (AND I QUOTE), \" i have one mother, one father, one brother, one sister. My brother is married and my bhabhi is good-looking girl from good family and has one cute child.\" Obviously the prize catch!! It makes for interesting reading although I have to wonder how many of them come away happy at the end of the day. Is it wrong to recognise and settle for traits and situations in life which are similar to your own? Why piggyback on someone more upwardly mobile when you can have the satisfaction of doing it on your own steam. -\"....my niece likes to live a nice, simple, hygenic life\". And WE don't? \"Travelling also suits me during holidays.\" The rest of the days I'm an agoraphobic. \"My daughter is convented\". Eeeeks! that sounds awful. \"I am in this position because of my bro & parents. Thanks you all. Good luck bro\" Ahem..are we at the Oscars? The best of the lot so far? An ad that was pointed out to me in the matrimonial section of the Sunday paper a while back. - \"wanted beautiful girl It's bitchy, I know, to write this way, but one has to read the kind of expectations those same people have.

The topic of today's installment is probably the single most important idea in Westergaardian tonal theory: the concept of a line. This material comes from Chapter 3 (probably the most important chapter) of ITT. Lines, in Westergaardian theory, are the things that notes live in. This, you will observe, is the most salient and probably the most important way in which Westergaardian theory contrasts with harmonic theory. In harmonic theory (or, if you prefer, the \"harmony-and-voice-leading\" model), the things that notes live in are chords. More on this below. A line is a chain of consecutive notes that we think of as being connected in a special way. From ITT, p. 29: Take the notes If we consider the lines to be we are in effect saying that there is a special sense in which the first E and F are connected, or the C and the D, that is not true of the first E and the D, nor of the C and the F. If, on the other hand, we consider the lines to be we are saying that the E and the D or the C and the F are connected in this special way and that the C and the D or the E and the F are not. Usually, we have reason to consider only some of the possible ways of analyzing a given set of notes into lines. We may, however, wish to consider different parsings of the same notes for different purposes. Lines, in fact, can be of a number of different types. As Westergaard says (ITT, p. 289): There are different kinds of reasons for understanding one note as connected another and, hence, there are different kinds of lines. Where a series of notes is played by a single instrument or sung by one voice, we speak of an instrumental or vocal line, for example, the clarinet line or the tenor line. When a series of notes maintains the same registral [i.e. pitch-space order] relations to the other notes present, we speak of a registral line, for example the top line or the middle line. [Footnote concerning the ambiguity of terms like \"alto line\" omitted.] Finally, when a series of notes forms a [time-]span and pitch structure that gives us a way of understanding other notes in terms of that structure, we speak of a structural line. These categories, incidentally, are not disjoint. In fact, since a line itself is a way of understanding notes, we could even regard the category of structural lines as encompassing all other types, including the first two mentioned above. Not only are these categories not disjoint, but lines of the various types are frequently involved in complex dependence relationships. For example, we understand instrumental lines such as (from Beethoven, Symphony No. 8 ) in terms of the \"pseudo-structural lines\" which, in turn, we understand in terms of the \"real\" structural lines (The question of how we understand the lines in this way will of course have to await future posts.) Contrast with harmonic theory Westergaardian theory makes virtually no a priori assumptions about musical texture (i.e. how many lines, of what types, are unfolding at once during a composition). All that Westergaard says is: [W]e can conceive of a piece of music as being made up of two or more such lines unfolding simultaneously. (ITT, p. 29.) (One point that, unfortunately, is not emphasized in ITT, but which I think needs stressing, is this: lines, like the notes of which they are made, are associated with time-spans. Thus, some lines may have longer durations than others; there is no a priori assumption that the texture should somehow remain constant. Some lines may extend through an entire composition; but a line could also theoretically consist of a single note.) Furthermore, lines do not have to be of a particular type (e.g. structural, as opposed to instrumental) in order for Westergaardian theory to apply to them; you may (and, ultimately, must) begin a Westergaardian analysis of an orchestral passage, for instance, by looking directly at the individual instrumental lines \u2014 lines to which Westergaardian theory already applies in its full official formality. This should be contrasted with traditional \"harmony-and-voice-leading\" theory, which operates in the setting of a four-part texture, into which all other textures must (by some voodoo magic that is never quite specified) be transformed. As noted above, however, the most important difference between Westergaardian theory and harmonic theory is the mere fact that Westergaardian theory views music as being composed of lines in the first place. Harmonic theory, on the other hand, views music as being composed of chords \u2014 simultaneities consisting of three or more notes. Although harmonic theorists acknowledge the existence of linear structures in music, for them the chord, not the line, is the fundamental note-generating entity; lines are then the epiphenomenal byproducts of chord progressions. The Westergaardian theorist views the situation is exactly the opposite way: lines are where notes are generated, and chords are the result of more than one line unfolding at the same time. This may be illustrated visually as follows: In neither model is it a question of \"slighting\" one dimension or the other; both vertical and horizontal are present in both theories. The question is, rather, which dimension comes first; that is, to which dimension do notes themselves belong? The distinction is readily apparent in the way that compositional exercises are conceived. In the harmony/voice-leading model, the task is to construct a progression of chords, taking care that the horizontal connections between notes obey certain rules (e.g. retention of common tones, no parallel 5ths, etc.). In the Westergaardian model, the task is to construct a complex of simultaneous lines, taking care that the vertical coincidences between notes obey certain rules (e.g. in first species intervals must be consonant; no parallel 5ths, etc.). In both models, one dimension is where \"creation\" occurs, and the other imposes constraints; the two models differ as to which is which. In harmonic theory, the function of a note is defined by whether it is the \"root\", \"third\", or \"fifth\" of \"the chord\". In Westergaardian theory, the function of a note is defined by the linear operation used to produce it (passing tone, neighbor, etc.- as will be discussed in a future post). (Thus we see, for example, that a question that one often confronts in a harmony exercise, namely which component of the chord to \"double\", makes no sense from the standpoint of Westergaardian theory. \"Doubling\", as we shall see, is an operation that applies to lines, and not to notes. The latter do not exist independently of lines! Each and every one of them must be generated from within some line by some linear operation. Hence the collection of pitches (and thus also pitch-classes) that are sounding at a given moment is not determined except by the combination of linear operations that are being applied at that moment. The question is always \"What operation?\"; never \"What note?\"!) ( Warning: polemical passage follows.) I don't work as a professional music theorist, so I don't have to be diplomatic about the fact that only one of these models is correct. The fact is that harmonic theory just has things totally backwards, and it's high time this was acknowledged. It's no use trying to weasel out of reality in postmodern fashion with some nonsense about how all models have something to offer. For this would be nothing less than to deny the possibility of ever making mistakes in music theory \u2014 which in turn would be to deny the possibility that such a thing as musical knowledge can ever be attained. But as the acquisition of musical knowledge is after all the fundamental aim of music theory, we must expect that sometimes we will just need to say \"Oops\" and move on. (Just as the student composer or writer must learn that not everything he or she comes up with in the course of composition needs to be preserved in the final product.) Rameau's theory of the fundamental bass was simply a mistake \u2014 arguably an understandable one, given the historical circumstances, but a mistake nonetheless. Had Rameau never lived, no one need ever have thought up the idea of \"root progressions\", and musical history would have been none the worse for it. Rameau's theory was in fact controversial in its own time \u2014 two noted opponents having been J.S and C.P.E. Bach \u2014 so why should it not be in ours, when its flaws are, if anything, even more manifest than they were in the eighteenth century? (Harmonic theory is unfortunately so deeply ingrained that it is frustratingly difficult even to get people to understand that we are talking about a comparison between two alternative models of musical structure, as opposed to simply disregarding one aspect of the traditional model. It's as if it never occurred to them that harmony-and-voice-leading theory might have any competitors. Witness for example this comment of Scott Spiegelberg from last year's discussion: What you are doing is focusing solely on voice-leading, ignoring harmony completely, so you are like Rameau in ignoring one important aspect of music. Now, I don't want to claim that this would still represent Spiegelberg's view after all the subsequent discussion; but it is at any rate a common type of reaction.) As I have previously indicated, the Rameauvian directive to parse music into chords rather than into lines is what is responsible for the Myth of Atonality \u2014 the idea that diatonic scale degrees are not relevant to certain twentieth-century music such as that of the Second Viennese School. The Myth arose because theorists could not locate any of the familiar \"chords\" in the music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, and thus concluded \u2014 by a complete and total non sequitur \u2014 that this music must be based on principles of organization radically different from those of earlier music. Had earlier theorists been clever enough to invent Westergaardian theory, we could have been spared the whole \"atonality\" business, along with all the accompanying theoretical, compositional, and even philosophical hand-wringing. ( End polemic.) To summarize: Westergaardian theory is not \"harmony-and-voice-leading without the harmony part\". It is Westergaardian theory \u2014 an alternative model of music that stands in opposition to the \"harmony-and-voice-leading\" model. The two models make conflicting claims about the structure of music. One of them tells us to conceive of a passage as a horizontal juxtaposition of vertical pitch-class sets called chords; the other tells us to conceive of the same passage as a vertical juxtaposition of horizontal chains of notes called lines. (Schenkerian theory, by the way, is the result of Heinrich Schenker's gradual realization \u2014 over the span of three decades, and never quite carried to completion \u2014 that the first model is incorrect, and that a model of the second type is needed. Westergaardian theory, however, is already a model of the correct type, right from the outset.) 1 Comment | Westergaardian theory, anti-harmony, music | Permalink J.S. Bach: Air from Orchestral Suite No. 3, mm.1-2 May 31, 2008 Posted by James Cook Recall that in a previous post I challenged readers to analyze the first two measures of the Air from Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major (a piece, incidentally, that might be better referred to as \"Air Off The G-String\" than by its usual nickname). The time has come to reveal the answer. In the Pachelbel analysis, we started from the underlying basic structure and showed how the passage was constructed via the Westergaardian operations. This time, for the sake of variety, we'll proceed in the reverse direction, starting from the passage itself and \"undoing\" the operations until the basic structure is revealed. Our passage is the following: 12. Call this Stage 12. The first thing we'll undo are the explicit arpeggiations in the first violin and continuo lines: 11. Actually, I did a bit more than that, as you can see. I skipped a stage in which the first violin part looks like: How did I know that D was the span pitch of the second half of beat 2 rather than C#? That is, why did the first violin part not reduce to: Is it because G#-E-B (or even G#-E-B-D) is a Certified Chord, whereas G#-E-B-C# isn't? Fat chance! As an exercise in eliminating harmony, see if you can explain the real reason. (I'll likely explain it in a future post, but probably only after we've formally developed more Westergaardian theory. Hint: It has nothing to do with Certified Chords.) Eliminating the borrowed G and B from the first violin, we obtain stage 10: 10. What an odd interpretation of beat 2! Instead of hearing a passing motion from E to C, I am interpreting the E as a borrowing from the viola line: 9. (Note also the elimination of the A borrowed from the second violin line.) Why on Earth is this interpretation to be preferred to the seemingly simpler one? The answer is that the seemingly simpler one isn't in fact so simple. Notice that the D in the second violin line is left hanging (ITT, p. 30), and therefore not displaced, after beat 1. If the D in the first violin line were to be interpreted as a passing tone, that would leave us without a D among the sounding span pitches of beat 2. However, we know from the C# of beat 3, as well as from the fact that D was left hanging in the second violin, that D must be a span pitch for some span that includes beat 2 (deeper levels will make this clearer; see below). We would therefore be compelled to regard the second violins' D as being temporarily displaced during beat 2; that is, it must move by step to some note borrowed from another line. (The only alternative would be to regard it as (entirely) undisplaced during beat 2, but this is made difficult because of the simultaneous E: since in this scenario we're not considering D as a local span pitch of beat 2, we're left with understanding an implicit dissonance, which is quite problematic indeed.) Since E is a span pitch of beat 2 and C# is not, we must therefore hear the D-line as moving up to a borrowed E during beat 2. But why should we go through the trouble of understanding such a conceptually difficult situation as the D-line effectively \"merging\" temporarily into the F#-E line? Given the stated step motion D-C# in the first violin, isn't it easier to regard that D as a span pitch over the span of beat 2? Stage 8 shows transferred pitches (ITT, sec. 7.7) reassigned to their rightful homes: 8. This stage represents the transition from instrumental lines to structural lines; I have symbolized this by switching from the alto clef to the treble clef in the third line. Next the transferred pitches are reassigned to their rightful registers: 7. The suspension in the top line is removed: 6. Rearticulations in the bottom three lines: 5. Rearticulation of a suspension in the second and third lines; chromatic step motion in bass: 4. Suspensions eliminated: 3. Neighbor note removed: 2. Finally, then, we have the basic structure of the phrase: 1.

Straus]: What was the nature of your early work with Salzer? [Carl Schachter]: I studied counterpoint with him. He didn't like to talk about harmony as a discipline in itself, but we did all kinds of melody and bass settings and things of that sort, both written and at the keyboard. I had two years of analysis class with Salzer; I also studied music history with him. He was a very comprehensively educated musician, and so he taught everything other than subjects like orchestration or dictation or sight-singing. My basic musical training was with him. Could that be because \"harmony\" is not in fact a legitimate \"discipline in itself\"? (Note, by the way, how this undermines Scott Spiegelberg's claim that his take on Schenker is the same as Salzer's, since Spiegelberg very clearly does like to talk about harmony as a discipline in itself.) 3 Comments | anti-harmony, music | Permalink Principles of Westergaardian Theory: Notes May 26, 2008 Posted by James Cook Over the past week, I have been hard at work on a couple of rather involved music-analytical posts, as well as various of the Mathematics Lectures. It occurred to me, however, that I might take a bit of time out to begin the promised systematic exposition of Westergaardian theory. For one thing, it would be nice to have something online to refer to when writing up analyses; but, to be honest, the proximate reason I decided to start this now was that there are some things I would really like to get off my proverbial chest, and the appropriate place to do so will be in the second post of this series, which will be about the concept of lines. First, we have to talk about notes. This material comes from chapter 2 of ITT, though my discussion of pitch differs in some minor respects from Westergaard's. (For the moment, I'm skipping chapter 1, which deals with meta-issues, because 1) I'm in a hurry to get to chapter 3 and 2) there will be plenty of opportunity to talk about meta-issues as they come up.) *** The most basic element of musical structure is the note. A note is defined to be a unit of sound that we think of as having a particular pitch a particular onset time a particular duration In addition, we may also think of a note as having a particular loudness a particular timbre The first three attributes are mandatory: they are necessary to determine the syntactic value of a particular note. By contrast, the latter two attributes are in a sense optional: their function is to clarify or reinforce the syntactic value of a note. I assume that readers are familiar with musical fundamentals, and so I won't bother to go into too much detail here about how each of these dimensions is conceived; a quick run-through will have to suffice. If anything needs clarification, feel free to ask in the comments. Note that Westergaard gives a characteristically thorough exposition in chapter 2 of ITT. That exposition is far superior to the one given here, as will be obvious to anyone who reads both. Pitch The space of pitches is divided into semitones. A semitone is the interval from the pitch of one key on a piano to the pitch of an immediately adjacent key. The size of a semitone is such that the interval of twelve semitones corresponds to a doubling of the frequency (recall that pitch perception is logarithmic with respect to frequency, so that pitch intervals correspond to frequency ratios). Such an interval is called an octave. For some purposes we shall consider pitches an octave apart to be equivalent; the equivalence classes so obtained are called pitch-classes. We name pitch-classes by numbers 0,1,2,...10,11 (0 being the class of the pitch of the \"middle C\" key on a piano, 1 being the class of the next higher key, and so on), or by letters in a manner that will be discussed below (\"middle C\" being indeed an instance of this nomenclature). We conceive of pitches not only as elements of the semitonally-divided pitch space, but also as elements of special subsets of this space called \"diatonic collections\". Consider the pitches of the seven white keys on a piano starting from middle C and continuing upward (to the right); call this collection of pitches S. We define a diatonic collection to be a transposition of S by some number of semitones. (Thus S itself is an example of a diatonic collection.) By abuse of language, we also use the term \"diatonic collection\" to refer to the set of pitch- classes corresponding to the pitches of some diatonic collection. This furnishes an alternative nomenclature for pitch-classes, defined as follows. For historical reasons, the pitch-class 9 is called A. The elements of the diatonic collection {9,11,0,2,4,5,7} are then called respectively A,B,C,D,E,F,G. Arbitrary pitch-classes, in turn, are named as if they were conceived of as transpositions of an element of this collection. Thus pitch-class 1 may be called (upward transposition of C by one semitone), (downward transposition of D by one semitone), (conventionally written ; upward transposition of B by two semitones), (downward transposition of E by three semitones; or indeed , downward transposition of by two semitones), etc. This system is convenient because we do indeed conceive of pitches in terms of some diatonic collection (though the particular collection is determined by context, and is not always {A,B,C,D,E,F,G}). We also use diatonic collections (in the strict sense, as a collection of pitches, rather than pitch classes) to conceive of intervals between pitches. The interval from a pitch to itself (such as from middle C to middle C) is called a unison (or prime). An interval between adjacent members of a diatonic collection is called a second (or step). Other intervals are named according to the number of seconds from which they are built up: Two seconds: third Three seconds: fourth etc. A second may be either a semitone ( half-step, or minor second) or 2 semitones ( whole-step, or major second). Likewise, other intervals come in different varieties, depending on how many of the seconds used to construct them are major and how many are major. (Any pattern may be used provided that it fits into a diatonic collection; thus a third may be built out of two major seconds, or out of a major second and a minor second, but not two minor seconds.) The intervals of a unison, an octave (seven diatonic steps), a fourth of the type consisting of two major seconds and a minor second (as from a particular member of pitch-class C to the first member of F above), and a fifth of the type consisting of three major seconds and a minor second (as from C to G) are called perfect intervals. An interval obtained from a perfect interval by raising the higher pitch (or lowering the lower pitch) by a semitone is said to be augmented; thus the interval from a (particular member of the pitch-class) C to the first (member of) F# above is an augmented fourth. Likewise, an interval obtained from a perfect interval by lowering the higher pitch (or raising the lower pitch) is said to be diminished: thus the interval from C to Gb is a diminished fifth. (Note that Gb and F# both refer to pitch-class 6, so that both an augmented fourth and a diminished fifth refer to an interval of six semitones; such pairs of pitches or intervals are said to be enharmonically equivalent.) Other intervals (thirds, sixths, and sevenths) come in two types, as the reader can easily verify. The larger type of each is called major, and the smaller type minor. Expanding a major interval by a semitone yields (again) an augmented interval; contracting a minor interval by a semitone likewise yields a diminished interval. (Thus C to A# is an augmented sixth; C to Ebb is a diminished third.) Time From ITT, sec. 2.2: We conceive of time in tonal music in terms of systems of equally spaced reference points...We call the reference points beats. If a note begins at a reference point we say it is \"on the beat\"; if note, we say it is before or after the beat or simply \"off the beat\". We call primary reference points downbeats. Secondary reference points are sometimes called upbeats, but properly speaking upbeat is reserved for that secondary reference point immediately preceding the next downbeat. We call the span between consecutive primary reference points a measure. We say that a note that begins on the downbeat and lasts until the next downbeat \"lasts a measure\". We call the segments formed by the secondary reference points beats*. If a note begins on one beat and lasts to the next beat we say it \"lasts a beat\". We call the way the secondary reference points divide the spans between primary reference points the meter. One secondary beat dividing each measure into two equal parts is called duple meter; two secondary beats dividing each meaure into three equal parts is called triple meter. We call the rate at which beats occur the tempo. A rate of around 85 beats per minute (time from one beat to the next is about seconds) is usually considered a moderate tempo; most tempos fall between twice and half that rate. *An unfortunate double use of the same term to mean both a point in time and a period of time between two points. Loudness We conceive of loudness as measured by a scale whose only structure is that of a totally ordered set: (For further discussion, see ITT, sec. 2.3.)

Well, you certainly have put your finger on it when you write: Forgive my generalizations, but it seems to me that the compositional approach stems from a time when composition and theory were basically the same thing, hence, this approach is favored by an earlier generation of pedagogues. Yes, indeed! The whole distinction on which your post is premised, namely that which is alleged to exist between \"compositional\" and \"analytical\" approaches to music, exists only because, once upon a time, \"theory\" (or \"analysis\") stopped yielding insight into composition! And instead of saying \"Oops, we must have gotten our theory wrong\" and fixing the problem, which would have been the proper thing to do, people instead decided that they were involved in a new distinct field of study called \"analytical theory\". That way, they didn't have to discard the erroneous ideas to which they had become attached; they could simply relabel their occupation and move down the hall. Sadly, people do this kind of thing all the time, and not just in music. The modern concept of religion is another example. Once upon a time, people believed that supernatural agents such as gods were needed to explain the natural world; then along comes science, and what do people do? Instead of simply biting the bullet and admitting that the whole God theory was just plain wrong, they invent the concept of non-overlapping magisteria and assign new purposes to religion (\"it gives us morality\" or \"provides meaning and purpose\", etc.). Like the religious, music theorists are also adept in the art of post-hoc (re)justification. Thus, when harmonic theory (which holds that music is constructed out of \"progressions\" of \"chords\" built on \"roots\") was finally and utterly disproved by 20th century music, theorists continued to teach it anyway, on the (newly invented) grounds that studying old music is a sort of \"separate magisterium\" from learning how to make new music. Which brings us back to your post. If different musical repertories are all separate magisteria, then a student with a particular interest in only some of them may legitimately wonder why he/she should bother studying the others. The answer is that they aren't separate magisteria; and in fact it isn't a question of repertory at all. Different repertories do not have different theories of music, just like different planets do not have different theories of physics. The reason musical study should begin with strict species counterpoint has nothing to do with any special virtue possessed by music of the sixteenth century; in fact it has nothing to do with the sixteenth century at all! (Despite generations of misunderstanding.) The actual justification is to be found in section 4.0 of Westergaard (\"What Species Counterpoint Is And What It's For): it is that species counterpoint is simpler than actual music. Even more to the point, it is a way to approach the study of music systematically. One concept at a time, in logical order. It has nothing, repeat nothing, to do with a particular \"style\" of music! I read your post as advocating, or leaning towards advocating, a kind of eclecticism in music pedagogy: let's bring in a lot of different complex things to throw at the students. In fact, let's even throw different complex things at different students, in different years! But this is antithetical to what is needed. What is needed is, first of all, logical, systematic training in (and not eclectic exposure to) the actual practice of creating music; and secondly, a sufficiently unified conception and metalanguage so that people with immediate interests in different musics or aspects of music can speak to each other and have some understanding of why they are in the same department. 2 Comments | music | Permalink IMSLP coming back May 1, 2008 Posted by James Cook Apparently, the Wikigods have decided to resurrect IMSLP. And all I had to do was say the word! (Via Musical Perceptions.) 1 Comment | Uncategorized | Permalink Pachelbel's Canon April 23, 2008 Posted by James Cook As you might expect, the demise of the IMSLP has put something of a damper on my grandiose plans of analyzing musical works on this blog. Today, however, we're in luck, as Wikipedia provides all the source material I'll need for this post. The context for this is a question, of sorts, posed by a commenter named \"funkhauser\" (the reason I say \"of sorts\" will hopefully become clear): It seems to me that a surprisingly large number of progressions of 8 chords found in say, your favorite piece, have a IV chord as the \"middle\" chord (i.e., if each chord lasts a quarter note and we are in 4/4 time then the IV chord is the first chord of the second measure). Two familiar examples are Pachel[bel]'s Canon and the beginning of Bach's Air on the G string. The chord progressions are, roughly: I - V - vi - iii - IV - I - IV - V I - iii - vi - vi7 - IV - V7/V - V - V7 (...)However, I can't think of an 8-chord progression I've heard in which the V chord is the middle chord...Imagine putting the V in the place of the IV in Pachelbel's Canon or Bach's Air. It would completely change the feel of the piece (and arguably, it would ruin it). (...)What I'm wondering is: In Westergaard's theory can we derive the important difference in function between IV and V? And can we derive the fact that the IV should occupy stronger beats and larger time spans than V? Tisk tisk. It's obvious that the questioner has not yet managed to throw off the Rameauvian shackles, and is still laboring under the impression that musical passages are constructed by juxtaposing \"chords\" in time. Well, funkhauser, you've come to the right place \u2014 disabusing innocent souls of this mistaken notion has become one of my missions in life. The best way to start, I think, is to take a look at these passages and see what's actually going on. Here's how to construct the opening of Pachelbel's canon: 1. The underlying basic structure is the usual descent (with the on its way to , of course): 2. These structural lines will be realized as three textural lines, with span pitches assigned as follows: (When I say \"assigned\" I technically mean borrowed, of course.) 3. The top two lines will both descend from the upper note to the lower: 4. The A is delayed by a lower neighbor, in familiar fashion: 5. We connect the F# to the A and the D to the F# by step motion. In fact, we'd like to have continuous quarter notes in these two voices, so on beat 3 of m.2 we'll also elaborate the C# by a lower neighbor passing tone in the top voice (producing functional parallelism alignment with the bass) and borrow a G from the bass for the middle voice: 6. Actually, we'd like to have quarter notes in all three voices, so we elaborate the bass by means of borrowing : (The A and the F# are of course borrowed from the span pitches of stage 2 above.) 7. Now, since this is supposed to be a canon, we'll present the voices one by one. 8. Finally, this is how the texture is actually realized, in terms of which instruments play what. Now, having analyzed the passage, let's see if we can address funkhauser's question. The first thing to note is that nowhere in the above derivation sequence is there any mention of \"chords\" at all. As a matter of fact, I didn't even bother to check whether the progression claimed by funkhauser I - V - vi - iii - IV - I - IV - V is \"accurate\" or not \u2014 so that as I'm typing this, I literally don't know what the \"chords\" of this passage are! I It's important to emphasize this, because I just got through analyzing the passage in precise detail, attributing a specific function to every single note, and I have the passage itself, as well as my analysis of it, firmly entrenched in memory. Indeed, I can't mentally replay the passage without instantly and simultaneously reconstructing my analysis. And yet \u2014 and yet \u2014 when it comes to selecting the appropriate Roman numeral for each of these quarter-note simultaneities, I am \u2014 at least at this immediate moment \u2014 about as clueless as a typical freshman theory student. (Though I do already know the first one will be I and the last one V.) Having made that point, let me now pause to reflect on what the chords are...Okay, yes, funkhauser has got it \"right\"; though I suppose there is an ambiguity about beat 3 of m.1, since there are only two distinct pitch-classes in that simultaneity. Come to think of it, the same is true of both \"IV\" chords in m.2. Oh, and it's also true of the very first chord! (Notice how very different this type of thought is from the instinctive, intuitive reasoning that I used to construct the above analysis. Actually, \"instinctive, intuitive\" is not the correct description; what I meant to say was specifically musical. Whereas what I am doing here, in verifying funkhauser's chord progression, is the totally abstract (if trivial) mathematical problem of verifying that two finite sets are equal to each other.) Funkhauser asks about the difference in function of the IV and V chords. What I would like to point out is that there is no \"IV chord\" at all! The simultaneity on beat 1 of m.2 is just the coincidence of two passing tones, and that on beat 3 is just the coincidence of two neighbors a passing tone and a neighbor. To pick out these chords as fundamental objects in their own right (and as the same fundamental object, no less!), is to carve up musical reality in the wrong way, like putting dolphins in the same category as fish. Strictly speaking, then, the answer to funkhauser's question is \"mu\" \u2014 i.e., \"your question depends on incorrect assumptions\". The \"chords\" of harmonic theory are simply not legitimate music-theoretical entities, any more than Earth, Air, Water, and Fire are chemical elements. Yes, these four things do exist, but they don't play anything like the theoretical role that people once attributed to them. In fact, today we understand that not only are they not fundamental, but they're not even the same kind of thing: \"Earth\" is a planet, \"air\" is a state of matter (gas), \"water\" is a chemical compound (H2O), and \"fire\" is a process (combustion). So it is with \"IV\", \"V\", and all the rest. Yes, there are collections of notes in musical compositions to which you could give these labels, but to do so is to presuppose the wrong theory of music. Like Aristotelian chemistry, harmonic theory may not seem obviously wrong until you've had considerable experience with the alternative. This explains why I invariably get reactions like \"But...but...of course harmonic theory is correct (or useful) \u2014 look how ubiquitous progressions like I-IV-V-I are!\" Yes, and the \"Four Elements\" are also ubiquitous in the natural world. For the moment, I will leave it as an exercise to come up with the correct analysis (or at least an analysis of the correct type) of the first two measures of the Air from Bach's Third Orchestral Suite. Here's a big hint: 6 Comments | anti-harmony, music | Permalink The joy of \"pathology\" April 12, 2008 Posted by James Cook Recently I had a conversation with a mathematician who had worked on the theory of Banach spaces early in his career, but had since left that particular subject. He explained that he had become disillusioned by the fact that \"all the natural conjectures turned out to be false\"; indeed, Banach spaces can have some \"strange\" properties, such as having uncomplemented subspaces, lacking a basis, admitting operators with no invariant subspaces, or admitting almost no operators at all. (Actually, in fact, they can even be unexpectedly well-behaved!) The last straw for this fellow, apparently, had been the Gowers-Maurey space (for which Gowers won the Fields Medal) , which has a whole bunch of \"weird\" properties. Disparaging language is used with disturbing frequency by mathematicians to describe mathematical concepts. Examples are labeled \"pathological\"; objects are described as \"badly behaved\"; functions are called \"nasty\"; problems are said to be \"ill-posed\". In a library once I encountered a book whose title actually was Differentiable Functions On Bad Domains \u2014 where \"Bad\" here is not the name of a mathematician, but the ordinary English word meaning the opposite of \"good\". You might think this is nothing but picturesque language \u2014 like calling a certain group \"the Monster\" \u2014 except that there are plenty of mathematicians who actually seem to think the way the labels suggest they do. The ex-Banach-spacer I mentioned above is only one example; spend some time among mathematicians and you will find many more. Indeed, such aversion to the unexpected has a distinguished historical pedigree, I am sorry to say. Who can forget the dismay with which Weierstrass's construction of a nondifferentiable continuous function was greeted? And even now there are still some people who are pissed off about Cantor's discoveries, and who would sooner overthrow the standard axioms of mathematics than confront the \"paradoxes\" of the infinite. Even Hilbert, who had the good sense to regard infinitary mathematics as paradisal rather than paradoxical, nevertheless reacted with anger (!) to G\u00f6del's results on the limits of formalization, according to Constance Reid. One is reminded of the discoverer of the irrationality of , who, you will recall, was allegedly thrown overboard by his Pythagorean comrades. I have never sympathized with this way of thinking. As far as I am concerned, unexpected \"pathological\" phenomena are a large part of what makes mathematics interesting in the first place. Indeed, this accords with the attitudes of other kinds of scientists with regard to their own fields. You generally don't find physicists crying in agony about the discovery of black holes, or biologists resenting the existence of extremophiles. Why, then, do so many mathematicians insist on doing the equivalent? 6 Comments | mathematics | Permalink A \"human\" mistake March 20, 2008 Posted by James Cook Mysteriously (but fortunately), this particular error has now been corrected.

Conley Road, by contrast, is 3.4 miles (and a $15 taxi ride) away from the campus. This is exactly the kind of mistake that you would expect a human to make, but that a computer should definitely not make. After all, you can easily imagine a human rolling their eyes at such a \"pedantic\" distinction as that between \"road\" and \"avenue\", or assuming that no town would give two different streets the \"same\" name. (At least, I can easily imagine this, having tried to explain to calculus students that the domain of the function is not all of despite the equation .) A computer, however, is supposed to be ruthlessly precise \u2014 which is why you will (almost) never be given a break when typing web addresses, no matter how \"close\" you come to typing the correct character sequence. So does this costly error indicate some sort of progress in the field of artificial intelligence, or should I just be ticked off that somebody at Google deliberately programmed the human \"not-caring-about-the-distinction-between-'X road'-and- 'X avenue' \" bug into their software? Oh, and the wireless internet at La Quinta is lousy.

(0) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/13/2008 - 10:11 am \"Obamacans\" vs. \"McCainocrats\": The scoop Over the course of the primary season, and now the general election, Obama - in an attempt at showing he's a man who can \"unite\" Republicans and Democrats so as to help weave this image of a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere in DC (cough) should he become elected president - has talked about so-called \"Obamacans\", Republicans who are supposedly switching over in heavy numbers to vote for the O-man, or who plan to come November. Andrew Romano at Newsweek has done some digging on this claim and found that when it comes to which side has been crossing over more to vote for the other candidate, during the primaries it's actually not Obama who won that battle; it was McCain. General election polls so far show them running about even (via Dan Riehl): As I discovered from examination the last 18 months of head-to-head general election polls, the answer seems to be \"no.\" In fact, John McCain's share of the Democratic vote has typically-and surprisingly-been larger than Obama's share of the Republican vote. In other words, it's not that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scared the Obamacan masses off, as some pundits have theorized-it's that they never existed (in any unprecedented way) to begin with. In December 2006-before the unfamiliar Illinois senator had officially announced his candidacy-McCain attracted 25 support among Dems versus Obama's eight percent among Repubs, according to a FOX News poll. Those numbers tightened over the next few months, but Obama never established a sustained lead. A February 2007 Quinnipiac survey showed McCain with 17 percent crossover support, for example, versus nine percent for Obama; in a June 2007 sounding by the same firm, McCain still led 15 percent to 11. During primary season-between December 2007 and April 2008-McCain's Democratic number hovered between 18 and 22. Obama, meanwhile, never climbed higher than 13 percent. Much of this gap can be attributed to the primary clash with Clinton, whose supporters often said they preferred McCain to Obama in head-to-head polls taken before the final Democratic contests on June 3. But even though McCain's support among Dems declined after Hillary bowed out-a natural result of Democratic unity-Obama's Republican backing didn't budge. Today, Republicans for Obama and Democrats for McCain effectively cancel each other out. The latest numbers from CBS News show Obama at 11 percent crossover support and McCain at 10 (and tied among Independents); FOX News puts the pair at six percent and seven percent, respectively. That deadlock mirrors 2000, when George W. Bush won over 11 percent of Democratic voters and Al Gore poached eight percent of Republicans-and it means that neither Obama nor McCain, both of whom have repeatedly boasted of their \"strong record[s] of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems,\" will be able to count on crossover voters to carry them to victory. They may not even best their predecessors. Things could always change, of course. Perhaps over the next 84 days the newly-formed \"Republicans for Obama\" will add a game-changing number of actual Republican voters to its current roster of Republican politicians. But I'm inclined to see it mostly as a publicity effort. With Obama vacationing in Hawaii this week, the major challenge facing Chicago is finding a way to control the news cycle without its candidate's help. \"Republicans for Obama\" was today's solution-a convenient way to repackage a handful of well-timed GOP endorsements and reinforce the senator's \"post-partisan\" brand in the process. Whether or not it reflects reality, or has any electoral impact, is probably irrelevant-as long as it transforms a few whispers into a day's worth of headlines. Keep that in mind when you read stories like this one of Republicans crossing over for Obama. The mediots hype stories like this more than they do crossovers for McCain because, well, Obama's The One and all Posted By: Sister Toldjah in: Election '08, Elections, McCain, Obama Files Comments & Trackbacks (2) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/12/2008 - 11:05 pm McCain's response to Georgia/Russia conflict shows presidential qualities I've been searching for the right words to describe the differences between McCain's response to the war Russia has waged on Georgia, and Obama's initial response (which was later revised to sound more like McCain's), but Investor's Business Daily pretty much sums up my feelings on the matter. The differences, as they note, are indeed stark. McCain clearly knows what he's talking about, while Obama's statements (made while he is vacationing in Hawaii) sound like they're being read from cue cards. This is one situation where, unfortunately for him, not even a teleprompter (or hoping that McCain will be asked the tough questions first a la Hillary during the primary debates) will help. Posted By: Sister Toldjah in: Election '08, Elections, International, McCain, Obama Files, Russia Comments & Trackbacks (3) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/12/2008 - 10:47 pm Stuck On Stupid: Tuesday Edition I hate to do this, but some things must be said, so here goes: \u2014- First up: Jake Tapper. Tapper's done some excellent work over the last few months helping expose Barry Oh! as a smooth-talking double-speaker, but he veered way off course with a blog post he wrote today titled \"Count the Young White Women in McCain's Anti-Obama Video.\" There's so much wrong with this what he wrote that I don't know where to start. MM has it covered, though, and makes mincemeat out of both Tapper and the implications he clearly made here. \u2014- An idiotic Xenia, Ohio Burger King employee who took a bath in one of the restaurants sinks has been fired after video of the incident was posted on YouTube.com. In the vid, he called himself \"Mr. Unstable\" - now they just call him \"Mr. Unemployed.\" All those involved in the bubble bath video drama were also fired. \u2014- Focus On The Family has pulled an embarassing video from its website which featured director of digital media director Stuart Shepard jokingly asking people to pray for \"rain of biblical proportions\" during Obama's DNC nomination acceptance speech. As expected, Obama apologist Andrew Sullivan, who is always looking for creative ways to insert his term \"Christianist\" into the debate, is not pleased. \u2014- Let's play \"Count McCain's Houses.\" Yippee! While we're at it, anyone got any \"Blue's Clues\" DVDs we can all watch? \u2014- And speaking of juvenile behavior, what clueless wonder came up with the idea for the Spanish Olympic men's basketball team to pose for a photo which shows them deliberately slanting their eyes? \u2014- American Airlines is charging US troops on their way to the battle zone in Iraq to pay extra fees for all their baggage. A VFW group is trying to get them to waive the charge, rather than the troops having to try and get reimbursed for the charge later when they've got more, shall we say pressing, matters to attend to. If you'd like to help the VFW get these extra fees waived for our brave men and women in uniform altogether, here's the contact info for American Airlines. \u2014- The creator of the now-infamous unofficial Obama \"O\" hand signal speaks. His plan is to make the symbol the \"peace sign of our generation.\" No doubt our enemies would approve. Posted By: Sister Toldjah in: Clueless Wonders Comments & Trackbacks (4) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/12/2008 - 9:53 pm \"Green\" elevators in NYC: Miserable failures (so far) This is a prime example of taking the \"going green\" theme too far (h/t: ST reader and NYC resident Leslie): The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's experiment to introduce 35 \"green\" escalators in four subway stations started with a lurch on Monday. In some places, it didn't start at all. Escalators at the 34th Street-Herald Square and Roosevelt Island stations in Manhattan and the Jamaica-Van Wyck and Jamaica Center-Parsons/Archer stations in Queens were to begin operating at variable speed, as part of a pilot program to save energy and reduce wear and tear. According to signs posted by the authority, each escalator was equipped with an infrared motion sensor that \" 'sees' customers approaching and 'tells' the escalator to speed up.\" The escalators are supposed to slow to just 15 feet per minute when no one is on them, from the normal speed of 100 feet per minute. When someone steps on, the escalators should accelerate gradually to the full speed over a few seconds. Late in the day, officials acknowledged that only 22 of the 35 escalators at the four stations were working as intended. (There are 169 escalators in the subway system.) Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit, the arm of the authority that runs the subways, said that there were some technical glitches, but noted that not all of the 35 escalators had been activated to run at variable speeds, even though Monday was the program's start date. [...] Even at the working escalators, there was some confusion. At one point, a man who was trying to go down to the subway platforms stepped on a slow-moving escalator, not realizing it was going up. As he walked down, the escalator suddenly activated, bringing him back toward the station. He did not turn around, but instead tried to race against the escalator, toward the bottom. (Officials said the escalators have an alarm that sounds if someone tries to walk past the sensor when the escalator is going in the opposite direction, but it was not clear whether it had sounded.) \"It's dangerous,\" said one passenger, Anthony Hack, 30. \"Someone's going to walk on it thinking it's not working and then it's going to start.\" It was also clear that some visitors were not accustomed to escalators of any speed. Vijaya Lakshmi, 52, who was visiting from India and is unused to escalators, was hesitant to take the first step going up. She ended up falling, and sitting as the escalator moved. A man helped her to her feet, preventing her dress from getting caught in the escalator as she approached the top. Can you say \"lawsuit waiting to happen\"? I know it's fashionable to go all out on the \"green\" wave, but, c'mon, some things need to be left alone. Like escalators. In related news, ST reader Sev sends along a must-read link that dissects, analyzes, and debunks the hockey stick lie still being promoted by GW True Believers as the \"gospel truth\" as it relates to the discussion about whether or not global warming is \"man-made.\" Make sure to read the whole thing. Posted By: Sister Toldjah in: Clueless Wonders, Global Warming Comments & Trackbacks (5) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/12/2008 - 9:03 pm Who needs 300+ foreign policy advisors when you've got George Clooney? Well, last month we found out that the man who for the last two years has claimed experience doesn't matter has some 300+ foreign policy advisors on hand to give him some advice/insight into important international matters - this in addition to the fact that last year he cited the four years he lived overseas as a child to be sufficient enough experience on the foreign relations front, and also in addition to the fact that earlier this year he assured us all that his VP pick would be \"somebody who knows about a bunch of stuff that I'm not as expert on.\" If all that doesn't ease your concerns about Barack Obama's serious lack of credentials on the foreign policy front, then I have no doubt that this will take care of any lingering doubts (h/t: ST reader NC Cop): George Clooney once famously declared he could never run for public office because he'd 'slept with too many women, done too many drugs and been to too many parties'. But now the Hollywood heart-throb has entered the political arena at the highest level - by becoming an unofficial adviser to US Presidential front-runner Barack Obama. Oscar-winner Clooney, 47, is said to be helping the Democratic candidate to polish his image at home and abroad. But he is also sharing with Obama his strong opinions on Iraq and the Middle East. Sources say the actor has tried to hide the pair's friendship for fear his Left-wing views and playboy image would hurt the Presidential hopeful's bid for the White House. But Democratic Party insiders have revealed that Clooney and Obama regularly send texts and emails to each other and speak by phone at least twice a week. One said last night: 'They are extremely close. A number of members of the Hollywood community, including Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, offered to help raise funds for Barack but it was with George that he struck up this amazing affinity. 'George has been giving him advice on things such as presentation, public speaking and body language and he also emails him constantly about policy, especially the Middle East. 'George is pushing him to be more \"balanced\" on issues such as US relations with Israel. 'George is pro-Palestinian. And he is also urging Barack to withdraw unconditionally from Iraq if he wins. 'It's a very risky relationship. His hope of becoming America's first black President depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a Hollywood Leftie, which is how they regard George. 'But they text and email each other almost every day and speak on the phone at least a couple of times a week, often more.' The Ocean's Eleven star is among many Hollywood figures to have endorsed Obama, including Barbra Streisand, Scarlett Johansson, Warren Beatty and Steven Spielberg. One of Clooney's trusted acquaintances said: 'George is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping Obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad. Hey, Senator Obama: Next time you send Georgie Boy an email, make sure to ask him what's the best way to treat people who disagree with you politically. Let us know what he says. Oh wait - we know already (scroll). Next thing you know, an attractive, Oscar-winning Hollywood actress will salivate, \"I'll do whatever he says to do. I'll collect paper cups off the ground to make his pathway clear.\" Oh wait- - that's already been said. It's no small wonder the McCain campaign have hit out at Obama with the \"racist\" Celeb ad, and the new \"Fan Club\" ad - not only does Obama act like a celebrity sometimes, but his celeb pals treat him as such. I'm sure part of it is due to his famed oratorical skills, but I'm betting part of it has to do with the fact that he does such a good job at acting like he's already president. Considering the IQs of some of the celebs in question, it wouldn't surprise me if they believed he had already been elected president. Heck, why not? He thinks he has been. \"Huh? Wha?

Posted By: Sister Toldjah in: Election '08, Elections, McCain Comments & Trackbacks (7) | Email This Post | Print This | 8/11/2008 - 12:25 pm Obama veep selection to be announced early next week? The LA Times Top of the Ticket blog writes about an email the Obama campaign is sending out to those who signed up for email updates from the website telling them they can sign up to be the \"first to know\" when Obama announces his VP running mate: Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is on vacation in Hawaii tonight. We believe. But, thanks to loyal Ticket reader Mark, just minutes ago we learned that the freshman senator's presidential campaign has confirmed that announcement of Obama's running mate choice is very near. An e-mail just sent out says Obama \"is about to choose a running mate.\" And when word comes, it will come by text message, e-mail and on the campaign website. An interesting twist that could mean the word might be released this week even during Obama's family vacation. The announcement will surely come before the Democratic National Convention starts in Denver on Aug. 25. It could even come while the candidate is on vacation, scheduled to end next Friday. If not, that leaves a 10-day announcement window of Aug. 15-25. The traditional scenario would be for Obama and his pick to appear at a grand joint announcement somewhere with their families and dozens of TV cameras. However, if hypothetically the announcement was to be made dramatically via cellphone texts, e-mails and the Obama website, the two candidates would not need to be together. I seriously doubt he'd announce his VP selection while sunning and funning in HI. I anticipate an announcement early next week in an effort to blunt whatever momentum McCain might have gained from having this week all to himself. Related to all this, USA Today has an article up today about how the pasts of several VP contenders for both McCain and Obama are being scoured. Let's hear some predictions: Who's Obama going to pick? My $$'s on VA Gov. Tim Kaine. Virginia is a toss-up state at this point, and would be a feather in the cap of Obama, who desperately wants to show that he can win key Southern states. Your thoughts?

If only I can get other internet service, but it is impossible since I don't have land lines phone. Anyway, let this be a lesson for you guys out there that are thinking about getting Time Warner Cable for internet service and cable Tv, don't get it from them. What had happened was that I have been having service interruption from their network since the day I got the damn service. The bad part is that I called them several times and the problem never got resolved. First they told me maybe it was the router than they came here and change it, but that didn't solve the problem since I always get dropped from the network. Then they say it was because they were updating their network connection, yet I don't see any of them mofo around here doing anything to any cable outlets or underground system, WTF!!! Then this time around, they told me maybe it is my computer, so I got pissed off and tell them that it can't be my fucking computer or my PS3 or the Xbox 360 or the Wii, because I built my own computer with way better peripherals that manufactured computers, also the fucking problem is that all off my electronics can connect to my neighbor's wireless internet but it can not connect to my damn wireless connection, because everytime I'm on it a couple of minutes or hours later that I got dropped from the damn connection that I paid over $100 a month to get. So, I fucking called them and told them that I need a technician to come over here and fucking take care of it and fix it or fucking take the router back and fuckin return my fuckin money! Lets just see what happens next wednesday when they come over here and tell me another stupid lame ass excuse why the internet kept dropping me from my damn wireless connection. Fucking assholes! 3 Comments \u00bb Information Architecture. Posted in Assignment, Blogging, School Related on January 21, 2008 by jansenborg I know that I have not been up to speed lately with my blogging, it seems that as if time flies through very quickly. This upcoming tuesday is my third week in Information Architecture class with Ms. Esther Kibby as the instructor. Let me cut to the chase, this class is pretty dry and what I mean by that is that the instructor gives you what you need to know and you are put into groups of at least three the most five people and we were given instruction that we are making a blue print for a website for a company that we are to make. Most people think that this class is boring and that is stupid, but to me, I think its what you make out of it. If you are not interested in learning than most of the time you will think that every class is boring for the most part. In this class you will need a book by Jesse James Garrett titled ,\"The Elements of User Experience.\" This book is pretty dry too, but it gets the message done by the amount of information that is given to understand it, even if you have a low user level experience (not much computer knowledge but to use the internet for watching youtube or reading your email and myspace). Anyway, my group originally consist of four people, but this one girl think that the class is way too boring that she changed her stupid major to something else that doesn't include or require this class to be taken. So, here I am having three people in my group including me and we had to pick up the slack since I know that it is already in the third week of school and there will be no more students added to the class. Pretty much we are screwed, but like I said its what you make of it. So far my group had been pretty consistent going to the group meeting assisting me in our need to make the steps to make this company happen. I will be posting some pictures later on as the class progresses and that we are requires to present what we have in our group. Jansen.

Posted in Blogging with tags 8, number 8 on January 12, 2008 by jansenborg This is a later posting, Happy New Year Everyone, This year it will be better than it would last year. The year 2007 was a really bad year for me, death in the family, my best friend died in an accident, I got discharge from the military and everything else in between. Fortunately as an Asian, I don't believe the number 7 is a lucky number. To most Asians, the number 8 is a lucky number when said and written resembles that of the word \"Prosper\" or \"Wealth.\" In the muslim culture, the number 8 is the number of angels that carries the throne of God, in arabic is \"Allah\" the God who created Adam and Eve. In the Hindu religion, it is the number of wealth and abundance. This year also the start of my third quarter at The Art Institute of Dallas. Followed by the 2008 Consumer Electronic Show (CES '08) from the 7th to 10th of January, which I followed vigorously by watching G4TV Attack of The Show, hosted by Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn (she's hot for a NERD!). The main thing that I notice was the introduction of Apple computer's new Mac Pro, with an outrageous component specs, that would make any gaming pro drools with envy and for art students in AID kill themselves with spending too much money. However, if money is no issue to you, I suggest you nerds, geeks, and the likes to get one. One of the most anticipated gadget that I have been waiting for is the new Sony OLED (Video - Organic Liquid Emitting Diode) TV. It is so thin that it is only 3mm thick, contrast ration 1,000,000: 1, they don't need backlighting and it is surely an amazing piece of gadget. Though this is the first time that it had been shown, the price sure is pretty damn expensive, however; with the developing technology around us, I'm quite sure within a couple of years if not months that this all will be affordable for us students at AID. Check this one out Bug (Video). Jansen. Leave A Comment \u00bb Podcasting/Vodcasting. Posted in Assignment with tags Podcasting, Vodcasting on December 4, 2007 by jansenborg To me the word podcasting is nothing new. I usually go to http://www.npr.org/ at times to listen to their programs and usually download stuff on \"Cartalk\" or \"All Things considered\" sometimes even other news and music programs that they offered. One thing about podcasting, though it is not new to me, the process and tools that are involved can be quite expensive and also that when trying on podcasting, I have to think of what issues or thing that I want to use as materials. Vodcasting, that's another story. I've heard about it but never use it. I read that article and it seems that the equipments are quite expensive if you want to have vodcasting to be something to do, let alone the time that you have to spare to do so. One interesting thing that I read in the article is that vodcasting is very helpful for students and teacher in the classroom. I think that this is a good idea, since sometimes students can't make it to class because of an illness, they can download vodcasts that had been uploaded to the school's site and not missed what the professor or the teacher discussed with other students that day. I've heard something about Harvard and Yale are starting to do this, aside to them having online classes last year, but I can't remember as to when they started this. With the development of technology and mobile computing, I think that more and more people would be able to do podcasting and vodcasting, specially with the prices of technology are getting cheaper and cheaper by the year. I think that as an Art School, the Art Institute should do this, have their classes be vodcasted or podcasted to the school website, that way it will help students and help prospective students in the long run.

Posted in Assignment with tags CSS, HTML on November 27, 2007 by jansenborg At first I thought that HTML was going to be a nightmare for me, since I really don't know anything about scripting whatsoever, let alone using CSS to do anything. However, I went to the W3 Tutorial Website and started to take the tutorials for html, I found it very easy to work with. I started to write my tutorials and every once in a while I open it and try to see if it will work. I think that it work pretty well for me as a beginner. The information given on the tutorials are pretty simple and self explanatory, however; I still find my self a little edgy about using it. Like I said, that this is my first time trying on scripting. Then I went to another tutorial for CSS at the HTML dog website. I try to see how CSS implement HTML so that it work as a whole, html is the content while css is how to present it on the webpage, as it was said in the the tutorial page. I tried to take on myself with the tutorial and I find it a little harder than trying to write html itself. So far I'm only able to understand on a couple of things that I can do with it. I guess with a little more practice I can learn a little more, as every one would say it, baby steps one at a time. Jansen 1 Comment \u00bb My PLE. Posted in Assignment with tags Google Reader, Netvibes, PLE, Yahoo Pipes on November 27, 2007 by jansenborg Man!! It has been one hell of a semester and the last couple of weeks had been hell for me. I can't even get enough sleep with all the stuff that is going on. Anyway... at first I was introduce to Google reader and I thought that it was an interesting tool to used for aggregating some blogs and other important things that I can use for school. However, I later found out that I'm not only subscribing to that one particular blog, but I was subscribing to the author's ENTIRE BLOG, which I thought is a nuisance. I mean I can see that the author is blogging about PLE or Communities of Learning, however; I also realised that some of the blog that I was subscribing was also a personal blogs about many other stuff that is not related to what I was looking for. In a short, it was to general and redundant and I was not able to read all of them to update what I need and what I don't need. Phew... So, then I go and work on Netvibes and I realized that it was a handy tool and I can work with it. However, I later realized that the only way for me to use netvibes is for me to sign in to the service, which to me is a hassle! I don't like having to sign in to what I am subscribing to read blogs about something. It is still a cool tool to use and have a very good user interface that people can tinker with, I find that most people in the class likes to use it. So, here I am and from all those tools that I have mentioned, I found another tool that I found interesting that is Yahoo Pipes. I started reading what it is and what it is all about and I learn a few things here and there. I found out that it is an aggregator service, combined with mash up service, search engine and many many more. As for right now all I can say is that this is an interesting piece of tool to play with. 2 Comments \u00bb Syndicated RSS Crime! Posted in Assignment with tags RSS on November 26, 2007 by jansenborg No, No, I'm not talking literally about syndicated crime. Just the meaning and use of RSS in today's webpage and how it has develop in today's technology. RSS is a data format used to to provide users with frequently updated content. This data is widely used in providing upadated blog entries, news feed, podcasts and many more, it exist as a document called feed, webfeed, or channel that contains what the blog, news or podcast is about, literally it is a summary of the document. It is designed to help people keeping up with their favorite websites easier. The history of RSS started as an attempt to syndicate formats, which didn't do pretty well with Netscape as a portal, later it was picked up by UserLand Software where it was used as a publishing tools that could read and write RSS. Other companies also release newer version of RSS software and that they came out with different icon to represent the RSS icon which was debatable who has the right to do so. In 2005 Microsoft finally adopted the the feed icon that was used in Mozilla Firefox and since then the RSS icon has been the orange box with white radio waves enclosed in it. 2 Comments \u00bb Communities of Practice. Posted in Assignment with tags Community of Practice, PLE, Socioanthropology in learning. on November 5, 2007 by jansenborg This is one lengthy article! First, I understand that on this assignment that we only need to pick one either Communities of Practice Brief Introduction, Learning as a Social System or Communities of Practice by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger. However, when I read the first article, I have to admit that I am so confused about the article. Then I thought, I'll try to read the other ones, maybe I'll understand it better. Unfortunately, after I read the second article I became somewhat aware what the article is, but I still sat on a bunch of blank thoughts, so I decided to read the third article and by gosh! I got it. At least to what I think that I got it. I will also put it some questions throughout this posting and I would appreciate the comments and answers. Ok, going back to the article. As stated by Jean and Etienne, that Communities of Practice \"are everywhere and that many of us generally are involved in it,... and furthermore we often assume learning has a beginning and an end.\" When I read the article presented, I realized that it is true that many of us assume that learning has an end. Don't believe me? Okay, how many of you right now thinking of graduation? You, know you are! Because with graduation, you think that you will not have to worry about studying, tests, midterms, or even final exams. I remember the very first day in this class Mr. Batchelder says this, \"You all have been thought about learning something or a subject in school that you all think when you've learned it, that is it. However, in this class you have to have an open mind because in this area of learning you have to know where this thing will grow and evolve and take it to the next step, whether you will move forward in this business or stay behind and you need to make a decision if this is the area you want to be in or you need to go with something else.\" So spoken minus stuff here and there. Sorry I quoted you Mr. Batchelder.! Lave and Wenger pointed out that we learn by interacting with each other and those around the world and that our relationship with one another is what brings us together, the community that we learn from are a community of learners where we practice what we learn and teach it to others. According to Wenger, a \"community of practice defines itself along three dimensions: 1. What is it about - a joint enterprise as understood and continually renegotiated by its members. 2. How it functions - mutual engagement that binds members together into a social entity. 3. What capability it has produced - the shared repertoire of communal resources (routines, sensibilities, artifacts, vocabulary, styles etc.) that members has develop over time.\" What I learn from this article also, is that a person's intention on learning is influenced by his or her social and cultural background. Which to me reminds me of how I learn everything. Being a person with multicultural backgrounds and that I have been fortunate being able to visit many places around the world and learn about other culture, I realized that the way I think, act, and my motivation on learning something new had been influenced by my background and the way I was brought up by my community and the people that surrounds me. People who are involved in community of practice engaged in different activities ranging from discussions, helping each other with solving problems, sharing information, and learning from one another. In this computer era, the interaction between the members of the community that share the same interest to learn from one another is considered as the community of practice itself. This all comes down to one one question that I kept pondering, it might misconstrued, but there is no wrong answer to this, however; I would really like for all of you to ponder it and give me your opinions too. So here is the question... Does Community of Practice related to Personal Learning Environment? Or is it the next step of PLE? Or is it both? Leave A Comment \u00bb How to be heard - Stephen Downes... Posted in Assignment with tags Starting a blog on October 27, 2007 by jansenborg First listen than be heard! Holy Crap, can you believe what this guy is saying? First of all, I think that this is one of the best article that I have read so far that I didn't have a brain fart! For real! I thought I was gonna have another migraine headaches from reading this article, aside to the length of the blog itself. In life as much as it is in blogs, we all have to plan for something, have a purpose for and what the plan is for, have a way to support the plan and execute the plan accordingly and make sure that the plan is progressive enough to undergo a change in the future. As is the same with blogs. According to Downes, writing a blog needs a well thought and well excised plan. It also needs a purpose for that blog to exist, be it may serve personal or social agenda or benefits these. If the blog doesn't have any purpose nor it benefits anyone, than it is nothing but something that some one wrote to complain or just bitch about something. Usually when you write a blog, aside to talk about an issue, you should address or promote some solutions or a question of something of value. For instance the interests that represents the blogger or the reader and the general community as a whole. Your blog also should have content that can be meaningful to the readers and that it should present future purpose and gives explanation to what is important. This content could be anything to everything, the best way to get a good content is to look at what you are reading, listening, watching or anything that involves you that other people can connects to or have a similar experience that people wants to relate and read about. Collect the info that you have and link all the hobbies and interest to websites that have a similar blogging and write about them too. Focus on something educational or something that can teach some one while the same time emphasize on more important things. That way the content will not be too boring. Hello!!! YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT!!! First of all... any one who wants to start a blog should know what he or she wants to write about, if not then don't blog at all, because not only that you are wasting your time, you also wasted my freakin time. Basically that's what it said for the first couple of paragraphs. But here's the interesting thing that Downes points out... There are many people out there that have other blogs that are probably the same that you are thinking...so, link these blogs to yours, this way you have a support network of what you are writing, and it guarantees you to readers. However, pick what you link to your blog very well otherwise you are just linking bullcrap to your blog and there for what you write will in turn be nothing but a pile of steaming manure. Look for sources that can support your ideas in your blog, when you find them, give them credits to what they wrote and make sure that you comment on their page and vice versa, this will ensure the readers that you know what you are blogging and that there are a community out there that are interested to what you have to blog about. Stimulate your sense of knowledge, open your mind to ideas that are different than yours. As a blogger, you should have different ideas that can be related to what you are blogging. Also, you need to know how to design a website that way your blog can be as much as enticing to those who reads it and make them know that you are knowledgeable and make the blog easier to read for your reader whom ever they may be. Make your blog as creative as you can be, show your blog that your ideas in the blog represent who you are, represent what you stand for, be meaningful, understanding and be assertive while being resourceful. Aside to that, the design of your blog is as much as important to your blog as it is to the content of your blog. An eye appealing design to your blog, readable fonts, neutral colors that is easy to the eye for reader to read, different color scheme, inclusion of pictures and videos would make sure that your blog have a cult of followers and readers. Use all the resources that are available to you and most important thing about blogging - set aside a time for you to blog about what you are passionate about.

Posted on July 28, 2008 by TKtraveler BIO On The Road is now Blogging Biotech, visit our new home at http://bloggingbiotech.wordpress.com/ Why? BIO's events capture the latest trends and goings-on within the biotech industry so it seemed only natural to turn our events blog into an over-arching all-about-the-biotech-industry blog. One of our main goals and reasons for getting up every morning is to open up a dialogue on the biotech industry and Blogging Biotech will do just that. What next? Come on in and make yourself comfortable and we will do our best to continue to identify the latest and greatest topics and trends within the industry.

We ended up with 20,108 industry leaders from 70 different countries and 48 states. The full Convention program included four full days with 175 breakout sessions, 21 educational tracks, more than 1,000 speakers, three keynote sessions, six Super Sessions and three CEO Forum sessions. And that wasn't all, more than 6,000 business leaders met at the convention and participated in the Business Forum. More than 14,500 one-on-one partnering meetings were held - a new record - and a total of 1,500 companies participated in the Business Forum. Then, as you read here on Bio On The Road, The all-star keynote line up included Gen. Colin L. Powell, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA), and J. Craig Venter, PhD. In addition, Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA); Former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL) discussed healthcare in an election year with moderator Neil Cavuto, Anchor & Managing Editor of Fox News Channel. In addition, many high-profile VIPs attended the Convention with 10 governors and numerous international public officials, including The Hon. Lino Baranao, Minister of Science, Technology & Production Innovation, Argentina; Sen The Hon. Kim Carr, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science & Research, Australia; The Honourable Dr. Ewa Bjorling, Minister for Trade, Sweden, among many others. The convention featured the largest gathering of biotech exhibitors in history, with more than 2,100 companies, 126 of which were new, and more than 208,000 sq. feet of exhibition space, the largest ever at the convention. The exhibition included more than 60 domestic, country and regional pavilions representing every aspect of the biotechnology industry. For more information, you can read the full press release here. To summarize, we hope you had a great time, learned a lot, and found it to be a productive environment. And most important of all, we hope to see you in Atlanta in 2009. All the best, The BIO Team.

Thanks to all the bloggers on BIO on the road, who reported their experiences as they happened. Thanks to the members of the BIO2008 Twitter group, who really gave us a feel for the convention, blow-by-blow. Finally, thanks to those of you who joined and participated in our group on facebook. The really great thing about social media is that helps us to stay connected in the absence of face-to-face interactions, like we've had at the convention. And while there is nothing that can replace those meetings, the online world gives us the opportunity to continue our conversations 365 days a year, and on a global scale. Having said that, we hope that you will connect with us year-round by visiting us on BIO.org or any of our sister sites and blogs. We hope to see you soon online. And to everyone, thanks again. \u2014Susan Cato, Director Online Communications \u2014Nicole Ruediger, Editor, Bio.org Filed under: BIO, Convention, bio08 | Tagged: biotechnology, blog, thank you | No Comments \u00bb Science is your brand Posted on June 20, 2008 by christineross Demand for greater transparancy from industry and scientists is a theme that's been mentioned more than once this week. Today's Scientific Communications Trends & Liabilities session provided a diverse panel of speakers, from open source publishers to Public Relations professionals. Natalie de Vane, VP of Public Relations for Wyeth Research reminded the audience that science is your brand, and that all stakeholders need to understand what you do as they will be the key to influencing your long term success. Interest in medicine and medical products is very strong and attracts a lot of media coverage and scrutiny. Remember media are a conduit to spreading your information to the public. Science communication is not easy - it's a complex topic, debates can be easily overblown and misunderstandings can be damaging. Reflecting what some other speakers have said, Ms de Vane warns that it's hard to fix a problem once it's happened - do everything you can to make your science easy to understand - and watch out for your competitor's issues too as their troubles can affect you too (same class drugs being a particularly clear example). Her final advice? Be transparant in your communications and focus on the facts. Filed under: BIO, Convention, bio08 | Tagged: branding | No Comments \u00bb Globalization in Biotechnology, Ernst & Young report (cont) Posted on June 20, 2008 by Jennifer Miller As promised here is the post on globalization, one of the three major trends driving the biotechnology industry to reinvent itself, according to Ernst and Young 2008 biotechnology report. Pharma and biotech companies are taking advantage of the 'flattenning world,' as described by Colin Powel in his keynote speech, and jumping into the globalization trend in the hopes of finding new opportunities for cutting costs and for increasing profits by selling to underserved markets. In order to cut costs but not production, many Western biotechnology and pharma companies are laying off domestic workers, but also hiring new workers in emerging markets due to their willingness to work for significantly lower salaries without compromising education and/or productivity levels. The convention's panel on the EO 2008 global biotechnology report highlights this hiring practice as a temporary solution for cost cutting and for the need to expand globally, predicting that the workers from current emerging markets will eventually raise their salaries as competition for their work increases. From the perspective of the current emerging markets, the new hiring trend is also only a temporary fix for their desire and need to grow internationally. As new markets continue to emerge competition within the emerging markets will increase. The West will have an ever-growing pool of highly trained employees willing to work for potentially even lower salaries, making a relationship based solely on this factor somewhat unsustainable. In an effort to forge more sustainable relationships, emerging markets are moving beyond offering 'cheaper labor' and large bodies of \"clinically na\u00efve patient populations\" to \"acquiring assets from, or allying with, western companies.\" Ultimately, this will then challenge and increase competition for western markets. It is worth noting that being tempted by 'clinically na\u00efve patient populations,' may not be the most ethical of temptations, particularly since one of the big challenges in pharmaceutical R&D is obtaining a quality informed consent. Balancing the need and desire for innovation and for respecting individuals and communities is a continuous challenge. Even NASA struggles with finding the balance between its drive for scientific advancement and its responsibilities to its employees and communities. A more sustainable and obvious approach regarding globalization for the biotechnology industry, involves western markets seeing emerging markets not solely as opportunities for 'cheaper labor' but as emerging consumer-bases, according to the report. Since these emerging consumer bases cannot yet afford to pay western prices for products, the report suggests that western companies \"work collaboratively with innovative companies in emerging markets to develop products designed specifically for local conditions.\" As you can see the convention was filled with information and inspiration for professionals from all niches within the biotechnology field, from the scientists to the executive and the salesmen to a bioethicist. It was wonderful to see Vertex Pharmaceuticals taking the lead in creating awareness of the ethical challenges facing the biotech industry and courageously attempting to meet those challenges, by sponsoring the convention's bioethics track! Thank you to Navigant Consulting, CRT-Tanaka and Nicole Ruediger at BIO for making my participation possible. The experience was fantastic and I am already looking forward to next year's convention!

I was particularly impressed with the lunch session. Jim Greenwood painted a compelling picture of the power of biotechnology. Colin Powell was impressive as well. His leadership lessons a good reminder for all of us in the industry that people are following us and that we are out in front where the future is not certain, but that when we build relationship and trust with others, they will follow, but they won't follow if we simply tell them to. Spent a good chunk of the day on the exhibition floor, looking at some of the offerings of the companies that might be a fit for some of my clients. I've noticed that over the years at BIO I take less stuff home every year. Part of me is disturbed by the amount of paper that is consumed, the number of low value things with logos that you know will be trashed either before people get home or shortly after. I've worked at taking a minimum of paper and other paraphernalia home, rather taking web links and business cards. I would encourage all the exhibitors to find sustainable ways to promote their products and services. Don't get me wrong, BIO is like going out for that once a year dinner. You know you ate and drank too much and it might be bad for you, but you've got the rest of the year to stick to your healthy lifestyle. You also know that you should come back next year, because it is a conference that keeps on reinventing itself and pushing the boundaries of science and business. I'm on my way home this morning, exhausted, yet recharged and excited about the prospects for the industry. I look forward to BIO 2009!

Maybe. I went to the Women in Bio party early last night at the Mr. Tiki lounge, complete with leis and Hawaiian food and drink (no spam). I made a lot of great contacts and met very knowledgeable people in the field. After that, I went to the BIO 2008 Gala Reception Gaslamp Quarter Block Party on 5th. The party was complete with mimes, fire dancers, and other entertainment, along with great food from the restaurants on 5th street. Being from San Diego, I left early, as living in a great vacation spot is never as fun as visiting . . . hope you all didn't stay up too late.

Filed under: BIO, party atlanta bio09 | No Comments \u00bb Understanding the science of communication Posted on June 20, 2008 by christineross It was standing room only for the last session on Thursday covering Communication Challenges: Defining the Industry for Policymakers and the Public. Session Chair Richard Gallagher, editor & publisher of Scientist magazine, started with some provocative questions, asking: is the industry misunderstood and undervalued by the public and politicans? And are we telling the best stories in the right way? Local senator Christine Kehoe gave the industry a glowing report card, describing biotech's contribution to San Diego. Delegates will spend an enormous amount of money while they're here (not all of it on food & drink), with the local industry comprising 700 companies employing around 40,000 people with an average salary of $80,000. So how to approach your local politician? Senator Kehoe reminds us that politicians are people too, start talking before there's a crisis you want fixed and keep the lines of communication open. All common sense stuff for most of us. Barry O'Leary discussed the rise of capital intensive investments into Ireland's biotech industry, in the form of new facilities built by Pfizer, Merck, Lilly and J&J. Although biotech is perceived favourably by the Irish, there is still a need to communicate transparantly with the public over what is happening in their back yard. By the way, all the world's botox comes from Ireland. Perhaps it's an informed public that will be the key to widespread public acceptance of biotech, as Seema Kumar suggests. It's time for scientists to come out of their ivory towers where they've enjoyed splendid isolation talking to each other and start explaining themselves to the rest of us, instead of leaving that to the media who often get it wrong - so much being lost in translation, Kumar says. Scientists should be the face of science, it's core communicators, she added. Matt Nisbet will be known to many from his research and writing, and he has spent much of his time looking at why issues become controversial. Matt's tips for biotech's future are: Invest in science education - the world needs more citizen scientists who can make informed decisions. This could take the form of adding 'science in society' or similar to what is taught at school. And for the industry and scientists: engage in public dialogue - people need to feel they are being listened to. This was followed by robust feedback and opinions from the audience, as people shared their thoughts and experiences. Not everyone agreed, but at least we were talking to each other and even more importantly, listening as well.

Partnering, talks, and an exhibit hall that has a lot to offer. How should you spend your last day? After spending 3 days pounding the \"exhibit floor\" pavement (carpet), I have some suggestions for you. Visit the various pavilions in the exhibit hall, representing different regions of the world and the biotech companies that do business there. Each has its own flavor, and each region is obviously anxious to show you why you should do business there. With the price of travel these days, you could even consider it to be a mini-vacation. My favorite pavilions? Holland, for its inviting display, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin, for their midwestern hospitality, and South Africa, representing biotech that will make a difference in the issues that plague the continent. California, my home state, also has an impressive display of companies and institutions from our growing biotech hubs. Visit the Emerging Technologies area, located in the southernmost (H) region of the exhibit hall. Of course, it is always interesting to hear about new technologies, and to hear about it from the entrepreneurs who will represent the next wave in biotech. Visit the BIO Patient and Health Advocacy Display, which is in the Ground Level Lobby, section F. Learn more about the efforts of these advocates in making a difference in getting funding and cures for a wide variety of diseases. It is always worthwhile talk directly to the patients and advocates for diseases which we are working towards curing, as they have important perspectives. For fun, visit the Lab Support Virtual Roller Coaster Ride at Booth 4316. Don't forget to get your green Crocs at RNL Bio, Booth 1015 (if they have any left!). I am not responsible for any fashion faux pas that result. -Mary Canady of Comprendia, LLC.

The Obesity Myth is that he focuses almost entirely on BMI studies to make his case that bodyfat isn't relevant to health or mortality. He constantly points out that there's a U-shaped curve in which underweight people (by BMI) have higher mortality, people technically classified as moderately overweight (by BMI) have lower mortality overall, and obese people then have the highest mortality. But BMI studies don't tell us whether bodyfat is healthy or unhealthy. That's because BMI doesn't correlate very well with bodyfat in the first place. The most recent study I could find was this: Romero-Corral et al, \"Accuracy of body mass index in diagnosing obesity in the adult general population,\" International Journal of Obesity 32 no. 6 (June 2008): 959-66. From the abstract: Body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used measure to diagnose obesity. However, the accuracy of BMI in detecting excess body adiposity in the adult general population is largely unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional design of 13,601 subjects (age 20-79.9 years; 49% men) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate body fat percent (BF%). We assessed the diagnostic performance of BMI using the World Health Organization reference standard for obesity of BF%>25% in men and>35% in women. We tested the correlation between BMI and both BF% and lean mass by sex and age groups adjusted for race. RESULTS: BMI-defined obesity (> or =30 kg m(-2)) was present in 19.1% of men and 24.7% of women, while BF%-defined obesity was present in 43.9% of men and 52.3% of women. . . . However, in the intermediate range of BMI (25-29.9 kg m(-2)), BMI failed to discriminate between BF% and lean mass in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly. A BMI cutoff of> or =30 kg m(-2) has good specificity but misses more than half of people with excess fat. These results may help to explain the unexpected better survival in overweight/mild obese patients. Note the bolded text, because it rather starkly undermines Campos's whole argument that because BMI isn't linearly correlated to mortality, people shouldn't worry about being fat. BMI /= bodyfat. What's more, there's a whole area of medical literature that, as far as I can tell, Campos's book completely ignores (again, it was a very poor endnoting system). Researchers have found for years that bodyfat cells produce inflammatory agents (such as C-reactive protein or its precursors). One recent study isolated this process experimentally, by studying specific fat cells extracted from plastic surgery patients and observing the excretion of cytokines and resistin; on exposing the fat cells to statins or aspirin, the production of inflammatory agents declined. Another similar study isolated higher levels of interleukin-6 -- another inflammatory marker -- in blood that came from visceral fat in the abdomen. In turn, chronic inflammation seems to cause cancer, heart disease and strokes, etc. So when we are learning more and more about the specific biological mechanisms by which fat cells make a person less healthy, it's a waste of time to point out how BMI ( not an accurate measure of bodyfat) and mortality are correlated. To be sure, Campos is basically right that except for the morbidly obese, it doesn't make sense to worry about lowering your BMI or even your bodyweight per se. But it's still true that people should think about lowering bodyfat (or, rather, eating a healthy diet and exercising with high intensity several times a week, which, in my experience, inevitably does the trick). The hype on this new study seems way overstated. From the New York Times: For all who have wondered if they could enjoy the benefits of exercise without the pain of exertion, the answer may one day be yes \u2014 just take a pill that tricks the muscles into thinking they have been working out furiously. Jack Benny Researchers at the Salk Institute in San Diego reported that they had found two drugs that did wonders for the athletic endurance of couch potato mice. One drug, known as Aicar, increased the mice's endurance on a treadmill by 44 percent after just four weeks of treatment. * * * Four years ago he found that PPAR-delta played a different role in muscle. Muscle fibers exist in two main forms. Type 1 fibers have copious numbers of mitochondria, which generate the cell's energy and are therefore resistant to fatigue. Type 2 fibers have fewer mitochondria and tire easily. Athletes have lots of Type 1 fibers. People with obesity and diabetes have far fewer Type 1 and more Type 2 fibers. Dr. Evans and his team found that the PPAR-delta protein remodeled the muscle, producing more of the high-endurance Type 1 fiber. They genetically engineered a strain of mice whose muscles produced extra amounts of PPAR-delta. These mice grew more Type 1 fibers and could run twice as far as on a treadmill as ordinary mice before collapsing. Given that people cannot be engineered in this way, Dr. Evans wondered whether levels of the PPAR-delta protein could be raised by drugs. Pharmaceutical companies have long tried to manipulate PPAR-delta because of its role in fat metabolism, and Dr. Evans found several drugs were available, although they had been tested for different purposes. In a report in the Friday issue of Cell, he described the two drugs that successfully activate the muscle-remodeling system in mice, generating more high-endurance Type 1 fiber. The drug GW1516 activates the PPAR-delta protein but the mice must also exercise to show increased endurance. It seems that PPAR-delta switches on one set of genes, and exercise another, and both are needed for endurance. Aicar improves endurance without training. Dr. Evans believes that it both activates the PPAR-delta protein and mimics the effects of exercise, thus switching on both sets of genes needed for the endurance signal. So they found that giving certain drugs to mice may ultimately have switched on certain genes that affect muscle endurance. We don't know that this drug would work in humans in the first place, let alone that the drug would have any of the many other benefits of exercise (decreased risk of many diseases, longer lifespan, better mood, improved cognitive performance, increased aerobic capacity, maintenance of bone mass, lowered blood pressure, etc.), let alone that it would do so without serious side effects. I'm not sure why, at this early point, this drug is being given publicity different from that of steroids. Jack Benny is one of my favorite comedians from all-time. I always loved it when Mel Blanc (voice of Bugs Bunny) made a guest appearance. Here's a clip where Mel Blanc delivers a telegram. Tuesday, August 05, 2008 Traffic One of the funniest Jack Benny episodes of all time involved Mel Blanc as a plumber fixing Benny's pipes. That episode can be downloaded here, and Amazon has some used videos available here. You can download dozens of clips from the Mel Blanc radio show (circa 1946) here or here. An interesting excerpt from an essay by Tom Vanderbilt, who has a new book: Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us). In the mid-1980s, Monderman, then a regional safety inspector for Friesland, was dispatched to the small village of Oudehaske to check the speed of car traffic through the town's center (two children had been fatally struck). Previously, Monderman, like any good Dutch traffic engineer, would have deployed, if not an actual traffic light, the tools of what is known as \"traffic calming\": speed bumps, warning signs, bollards, or any number of highly visible interventions. Friday, August 01, 2008 What's Important But those solutions were falling out of favor with his superiors, because they were either ineffective or too expensive. At a loss, Monderman suggested to the villagers, who as it happens had hired a consultant to help improve the town's aesthetics, that Oudehaske simply be made to seem more \"villagelike.\" The interventions were subtle. Signs were removed, curbs torn out, and the asphalt replaced with red paving brick, with two gray \"gutters\" on either side that were slightly curved but usable by cars. As Monderman noted, the road looked only five meters wide, \"but had all the possibilities of six.\" The results were striking. Without bumps or flashing warning signs, drivers slowed, so much so that Monderman's radar gun couldn't even register their speeds. Rather than clarity and segregation, he had created confusion and ambiguity. Unsure of what space belonged to them, drivers became more accommodating. Rather than give drivers a simple behavioral mandate\u2014say, a speed limit sign or a speed bump\u2014he had, through the new road design, subtly suggested the proper course of action. And he did something else. He used context to change behavior. He had made the main road look like a narrow lane in a village, not simply a traffic-way through some anonymous town. Vanderbilt also reports on what happened when the traffic engineer replaced a traditional intersection with a roundabout: A year after the change, the results of this \"extreme makeover\" were striking: Not only had congestion decreased in the intersection\u2014buses spent less time waiting to get through, for example\u2014but there were half as many accidents, even though total car traffic was up by a third. Students from a local engineering college who studied the intersection reported that both drivers and, unusually, cyclists were using signals\u2014of the electronic or hand variety\u2014more often. They also found, in surveys, that residents, despite the measurable increase in safety, perceived the place to be more dangerous. This was music to Monderman's ears. If they had not felt less secure, he said, he \"would have changed it immediately.\"Which reminds me of another excellent article, John Staddon's Distracting Miss Daisy: Why stop signs and speed limits endanger Americans, which makes a similar point. A friend in the music business forwarded me this advertisement seeking guitarists, amused by the requisite qualifications: Thursday, July 31, 2008 How Obama Got into Law Teaching If it's hard to read, the text says, \"Rihanna is seeking 2 types of guitar players to join her current tour. The first is a guitarist that double on keyboards, and the second is someone with dreadlocks.\" No mention of musical talent, but maybe that's just assumed . . . . This revelation from a New Republic article was new to me, but based on what I know of Mike McConnell, I'm not surprised that he would have done something like this: Obama first came to the University of Chicago Law School's attention via one of its more celebrated conservative faculty members, Michael McConnell, who's now a federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and reportedly was on George W. Bush's short list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Back in 1990, when McConnell was still teaching at Chicago, he wrote an article about church-state relations for the Harvard Law Review that Obama, who was then the Law Review's president, edited. As McConnell recently recalled the experience to Politico: \"A frequent problem with student editors is that they try to turn an article into something they want it to be. It was striking that Obama didn't do that. He tried to make it better from my point of view.\" McConnell was so impressed with Obama that he recommended him to the head of Chicago's appointments committee at the time, Douglas Baird, a bankruptcy expert and a law-and-economics devotee. \"Michael's a very smart guy who's basically a very good judge of horse flesh--he wouldn't typically recommend people,\" says Baird. Monday, July 28, 2008 Michael Lewis on Golf It's a bit harsh, but I have to admit I enjoyed Michael Lewis's rant on golf. Golf can be fun, of course, in the same sense as target practice, but I wouldn't really consider something a \"sport\" unless the participants regularly find themselves gasping for breath. It somewhat reminds me of this recent study, which found that people who read muscle magazines while on an exercise bike don't get the same mood improvement from exercise as do people who read nothing or who read Oprah Magazine. My rule of thumb is, if what I'm doing allows me to read or watch TV, it isn't really exercise. Saturday, July 26, 2008 Overcoming Bias post I have another post at Overcoming Bias. Friday, July 25, 2008 Class-Based Integration Emily Bazelon wrote a New York Times article recommending class-based school integration (much of her article resembles previous work by Rick Kahlenberg). She suggests that class-based integration would improve test scores: Test scores may not be the best way to assess the quality of a teacher or a school, but the pressure to improve scores, whatever its shortcomings, is itself on the rise. And if high test scores are the goal, it turns out, class-based integration may be the more effective tool. Tuesday, July 22, 2008 New Screenplay Researchers have been demonstrating this result since 1966, when Congress asked James S. Coleman, a Johns Hopkins sociologist, to deliver a report on why the achievement of black students lagged far behind that of white ones. The expected answer was that more than a decade after Brown, black kids were still often going to inferior schools with small budgets. But Coleman found that the varying amount of money spent on schools didn't account for the achievement gap. Instead, the greater poverty of black families did. When high concentrations of poor kids went to school together, Coleman reported, all the students at the school tended to learn less. How much less was later quantified. The Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks reanalyzed Coleman's data in the 1970s and concluded that poor black sixth-graders in majority middle-class schools were 20 months ahead of poor black sixth-graders in majority low-income schools. The statistics for poor white students were similar. In the last 40 years, Coleman's findings, known informally as the Coleman Report, have been confirmed again and again. Most recently, in a 2006 study, Douglas Harris, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, found that when more than half the students were low-income, only 1.1 percent of schools consistently performed at a \"high\" level (defined as two years of scores in the top third of the U.S. Department of Education's national achievement database in two grades and in two subjects: English and math). By contrast, 24.2 percent of schools that are majority middle-class met Harris's standard. A few points: 1) The problem with using Jencks' analysis here is that it doesn't account for selection effects -- poor black sixth-graders in the 1970s who managed to attend majority middle-class schools may have had very different family backgrounds, attitudes, and motivations than the ones stuck in impoverished schools. 2) Citing Douglas Harris's report is even less convincing. As Bazelon's text itself suggests, Harris merely compared the test scores in high-poverty schools to those in low-poverty schools. This is just a static picture; it tells us nothing about what would happen if you took an impoverished child and set him down in a low-poverty school. Thus, Harris's finding doesn't \"confirm\" the Coleman Report's finding as to how poor children did when they attended middle-class schools (Harris doesn't deal with that point at all). 3) A more enlightening and relevant study -- one that Bazelon doesn't mention -- comes from the Moving to Opportunity experiment, which took families in public housing and randomly assigned them to three groups: a control group, a group that got regular housing vouchers, and the experimental group that got housing vouchers to be used only in neighborhoods with a poverty rate under 10%. Researchers who expected to find that the experimental group did better academically were disappointed: Lisa Sanbonmatsu, Jeffrey R. Kling, Greg J. Duncan, and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Neighborhoods and Academic Achievement: Results from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment. Although we had hypothesized that reading and math test scores would be higher among children in families offered [housing] vouchers (with larger effects among younger children), the results show no significant effects on test scores for any age group among over 5000 children ages six to 20 in 2002 who were assessed four to seven years after randomization. Program impacts on school environments were considerably smaller than impacts on neighborhoods, suggesting that achievement-related benefits from improved neighborhood environments alone are small.To be sure, that last sentence is important: many of the people given housing vouchers to use in low-poverty neighborhoods ended up with their children attending new schools that were not a whole lot better than before; some even kept their children at the same schools (as this followup article reveals). So while the MTO experiment doesn't fully predict what would happen if you took the most impoverished inner-city kids and somehow transplanted them into the highest-performing suburban schools, it does give some idea of how hard it would be to pull off that kind of school reassignment. UPDATE: I dug up my copy of the book \"On Equality of Educational Opportunity,\" edited by Frederick Mosteller and Daniel P. Moynihan, in which (as I recalled) Christopher Jencks had published his reanalysis of the Coleman Report data. Sure enough, after noting that poor black sixth graders in middle-class schools did well, Jencks adds, \"poor families who send their children to middle-class schools may also be more achievement-oriented and more competent than poor families who send their children to lower-class schools. The EEOS [Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey, or the Coleman Report] does not provide adequate data for testing this theory.\" Jencks makes another interesting point, which I take to imply that the most educational improvement could be gained from improving schools and curriculum, not from merely rearranging students within existing schools: P. 86: Contrary to popular belief, the students who performed best on these tests were often enrolled in the same schools as the students who performed worst. . . . In some ways this is the most important and most neglected single finding of the EEOS. It means that if our objective is to equalize the outcomes of schooling, efforts to reduce differences between schools cannot possibly take us very far. If by some magic we were able to make the mean achievement of every Northern urban elementary school the same, we would only have reduced the variance in test scores by 16-22 percent. If, on the other hand, we left the disparities between schools untouched but were somehow able to eliminate all disparities within schools, we would eliminate 78-84 percent of the variation in 6th-grade competence. The implications of this are in many ways more revolutionary than anything else in the EEOS. In the short run it remains true that our most pressing political problem is the achievement gap between Harlem and Scarsdale. But in the long run it seems that our primary problem is not the disparity between Harlem and Scarsdale but the disparity between the top and the bottom of the class in both Harlem and Scarsdale. Notice the following films: All Time Best Blog Post Title -- Armageddon. A meteor is headed for earth, and the only thing that can save us is if Bruce Willis and his scrappy team drills into it and unloads a nuclear weapon. -- The Core. The center of the earth has stopped spinning, and the only thing that can save us is if Hilary Swank and her scrappy team drills into the earth and unloads a nuclear weapon. (Actually, I couldn't watch more than about 20 minutes of this, but I think that's the plot.) -- Sunshine. The sun is burning out, and the only thing that can save us is if Cillian Murphy and his scrappy team flies near the surface of the sun and unloads several nuclear weapons. So clearly nuclear bombs can fix just about anything. But the problem with all of these films is that the stakes are too low. Hence my new screenplay (yet to be written, but that's just a technicality). In my movie, the whole freaking universe has stopped expanding. A maverick scientist has figured out what's going on. After some infighting with government bureaucrats, he coaxes Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Sigourney Weaver, and Tom Cruise to fly six separate spaceships to specific points in the universe, and drop off 100 nuclear bombs apiece. This will restart the universe and save us from the unfortunate fate of collapsing inwards upon ourselves (never mind that this wouldn't actually happen). There's a touching scene where Sylvester Stallone says goodbye to his estranged daughter as he realizes that the escape hatch on his spaceship doesn't work. There's another touching scene at the end where all the rest of the astronauts are back safely on earth, and they clap each other on the back, to the tune of something by John Williams while an American flag unfurls in the background. This will be the summer blockbuster to end all summer blockbusters. This reversal of a Socratic maxim: \"The Unlived Life is Not Worth Examining.\" It's about why we shouldn't be asking kids who have barely experienced anything of life to write personal essays for school or college applications. Sunday, July 20, 2008 Caving The big news around here has been this story of a local girl who got stuck for about 16 hours in a cave in a state park: An afternoon outing at Devil's Den State Park turned into a nightmare for a Van Buren teenager. About 2 p.m. Friday, Bianca Calloway, 17, ventured into a cave with a group of friends from the Community Bible Church in Fort Smith. The group slid through a crack in the wall of the main cave into a section called Satan's Maze. Bianca lost her footing and slipped into an hourglass-shaped crevice. Her legs were wedged in the rock formation. More than 50 rescuers worked through the night to free the frightened, cold teenager. Rescuers, using a pulley system and a harness, pulled Bianca from the rocks shortly after 6 a.m. Saturday. She walked, with help, out of the cave. * * * \"She was wedged vertically into a vertical space,\" said John Luther, director of the Washington County Department of Emergency Management. \"It was an hourglass-shaped hole and you had to fall a certain way to get trapped. There was no way to work on either side of her.\" Rescuers had to work from above. Luther said the unique rock formation and the limited space was a nightmare for rescuers. \"Our smallest guys had to wiggle through a tight space, then turn sideways and pull the rest of his body through,\" Luther said. \"It was one of the strictest natural confinements you could have.\" . . . Rescue workers continued to emerge from the mouth of the cave with frustrated faces, and Comstock would send more back down. Because of the tight proximity of Satan's Maze, only a few workers could fit down there at a time, Comstock said. The remaining emergency responders had nothing else to do but sit around the cave entrance on a rock wall and crags around the cave and wait for their turn to return to the cave. * * * Baby oil was one of the low-tech methods applied, Luther said. It was so constricted, workers had trouble passing bottles of baby oil hand-to-hand over their heads in complete darkness, Luther said, shaking his head. On a local caving website,* I found this picture that someone managed to take of the narrowest part of that passage: That photo isn't turned sideways, as I know because I've been through that passage myself. It's that the passage is extremely tall and narrow, and the only way to get through it to wedge yourself sideways and scoot through, with open space above and below you. The one time that I went through there, I had gone feet first, and the only way I could get through was to 1) exhale every bit of air in my lungs (when I breathed in, I couldn't move at all); and 2) then pull frantically with my toes. By this process, I'd move a few inches. Also, it's not a lighted cave, so it was completely pitch black except for a few flashlights, which weren't much help when you couldn't even move your head to look in a different direction. At the time I was concentrating too intensely to feel claustrophobic, but I definitely wouldn't do it again. The only reason I went through that passage in the first place was because some college friends (all thinner than me, and I'm not fat in the least) insisted that it was fun and that I'd have no problem fitting through. Ha. * Photo is in the discussion thread here. The guy's description: \"a lot of the corridors were very narrow in the maze. this is a spot i didnt think i would make it through. i found myself suspended in the air between 2 rock walls.\" Sarah LaFon NotEng [My first ever second post], [My first ever post] skip to main | skip to sidebar Saturday, June 21, 2008 God save the... tripe Wow - it's been a while.

I got my last prescription, pair of glasses and box of contacts there. So when I needed new contacts, I went back. I went to the Grafton St. branch of a Thursday evening and asked for a new box. They asked me if I had my prescription with them and I said I had. So the lady proceeded to a massive filing cabinet (!!) to look for my prescription. I informed her that she probably wouldn't find it in there as I got my prescription in the Henry St. She then told me that she wouldn't be able to give me new contacts because the Henry St. branch was closed and she couldn't call them to have them fax me over a copy of my prescription. I asked her could she not look it up on their system and she said they don't have a system! They only have physical copies of patient/customer details!!! How fucking archaic is that?! As I believe it's optician's policy not to give lenses without a prescription even though I clearly have been there before, I had my prescription in the form of the box from my previous set of lenses (bog standard disposable ones), I left empty handed. I went to this branch because it was open late. Apparently the Henry St. one never opens late which I guess leaves me in a bit of a pickle. So to SpecSavers I say 1) stop living in the long long ago and get yourself some sort of electronic customer database and 2) alter your misleading advertising slogan. I leave a suggestion below.

My main sticking point was that it ran on AA batteries, and it ate them alive. I'd be lucky to get an hour out of two Duracell before the LCD would go off and it was very frustrating at times. So the day I accidentally cracked the screen I saw the chance to get a new camera and resolve all the issues I had with the Olympus. After much research I eventually settled on the FUJIFILM FinePix Z100 fd. It seemed to be the answer. It had a proprietary battery and charger with long lifetime, it wasn't as clunky as the Olympus, it was easier to use and of course it used 900,000 more pixels. After wading through all these bells and whistles, it was much to my dismay that when I took some photos using the highest image quality setting, the quality didn't compare to that of the Olympus on a moderate settings. The images weren't as sharp. There's a lot more purple fringing, especially with low light shots and in general the pictures were slightly noisy. Now I'm aware that one gets what one pays for, but this camera was around \u20ac250 (i.e. not dirt cheap), came from the same range as the Olympus (i.e. subcompact) and used more of the almighty megapixels. This, I believed, was how to gauge the capabilities of a camera from the outside but it appears I was wrong. Now I'm far from an expert in digital imagery and all that goes with it, but it's apparent that the marketing folk in the camera industry have decided to latch on the \"megapixel\" as the proponent of the camera that serves as its ultimate benchmark, when I suspect that this is not the case. To the untrained, if Camera A from Brand A costs \u20ac350 and proclaims 8 megapixels, and Camera B from Brand B costs \u20ac335 and proclaims 7.1 megapixels then it would be forgiven of them to immediately nab Camera A. How disappointed would they be if they found out Camera B was actually better at the bread and butter? So in my opinion I feel I've been duped. You may say it's my own fault and it probably is but I think I only fell for what the majority of casual camera buyers fall for also. I also should have known better. In areas in which I command greater expertise, for example computing, I know to look past the bullshit to what really matters when buying, say, a new graphics card. I think I attempted to employ this tactic when I bought my camera but obviously I failed miserably! Maybe someone more knowledgeable could give me the actual low-down?

Unfortunately I have to go through a proxy server in order to connect to anything, but normally it's not a problem, at least to begin with. So I went through the settings on the Wii but was never given the choice to connect via a proxy, so of course I couldn't get online. I looked through the intertubes to see what the deal was and it seemed that the Wii does give the user the option to connect via a proxy. Upon further investigation I saw that this option doesn't appear unless you have Wii update X.X. In order to get this update I had to connect my Wii to the internet and download it.

Ecosystem Feedster Search Popdex Technorati Technorati Breaking News Gratuitous cute kitty pic of golden girl Tiny out in the yard this afternoon staring at things we don't see. \"He makes everything so clear and commonsensical,\" we emailed Goomp this morning re Thomas Sowell's latest dissection of candidate Obama's Economics 101 deficit: Since Obama can do no wrong in the eyes of many of his supporters, they resented [anchorman Charles] Gibson's having asked him ... why [he] was advocating a higher capital gains tax rate, when experience had shown that the government typically collected more revenue from a lower capital gains tax rate than from a higher rate. Senator Obama acted as if he had never thought about it that way. He probably hadn't. He is a politician, not an economist. Politically, what matters to the left-wing base that Obama has been playing to for decades is sticking it to \"the rich.\" What effect that has on the tax revenues received by the government is secondary, at best. Inside looking out, Babe the Magnificent catches our camera's eye, the kitchen window screen creating an effect not unlike Photoshop's \"Crosshatch\" filter. And voters are only too happy to oblige, preferring \u2014 in Dr. Sanity's words referencing a Sowell column last May on why voters don't listen to economists \u2014 \"quick fixes and someone to blame, not solutions.\" As we wrote during the heat of the primary season last winter, referencing yet another Sowell column, \"Unfortunately for the future of the Republic should McCain or either of the front-running Democrats \u2014 who all of them seem to believe a President can and should 'manage' the economy rather than step back and let the invisible hand create wealth \u2014 should one of them become Leader of the Free World, we'll have an Economics 101 gap in the Oval Office, and THAT worries us and Thomas Sowell, whose Basic Economics: A Citizens Guide to the Economy ought to be at the top of the Arizona senator's [not to mention Obama's] must-read list.\" Sowell: One of the biggest problems with government intervention in the economy is that politicians usually have neither the knowledge nor the incentives to intervene at the right time. Bruce Bartlett has pointed out that most government intervention in an economic downturn comes too late. That is, the problem it is trying to solve has already worked itself out, and the government intervention can create new problems. More fundamentally, markets readjust themselves for a reason. That reason is that people pay a price for their misjudgments and mistakes. Government interventions are usually based on trying to stop them from having to pay that price. People who went way out on a limb to buy a house that they could not afford are now being pictured as victims of a heartless market or deceptive lenders. Rewarding bad behavior only encourages more bad behavior. But who has time to worry about bad behavior when there are voters to pander to? August 10, 2008 An evening of \"rich cultural, social, economic and political history\" The view from Carol and Alan's porch in the heart of Watertown's Mount Auburn Street Historic District late yesterday afternoon. We love the zigzag play of light, shade and cast shadows on the Second Empire slate tiles of dormer and mansard roof. \"The purpose of the [Mount Auburn Street] Historic District is to preserve the distinctive architecture reflecting the character of Watertown's rich cultural, social, economic and political history which began on the banks of the Charles River in the early 1600's,\" says the District's website. If you happen to live within this neighborhood, densely packed with stately residential architecture of note, it's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is the spirit of the place. We felt its aura draw us in yesterday afternoon as we drove past Mount Auburn Cemetery on our way to Carol and Alan's. The curse is when you want to tear down your rusting old tin garage and rebuild, as the Wards plan to. The permitting process can be daunting. Snowball bides her time beneath the clothes hanging near the door yesterday, waiting for her chance to spring. The cat who came to dinner, the stunningly beautiful and articulate \u2014she talks! \u2014 Snowball chose Carol and Alan's companionship over that of the neighbors who \"owned\" her. Above she lurks atop a large container beneath clothes hanging near the door to the back porch, unseen by the unwary, as we were yesterday when she chose the moment we opened the door to leap outside for the first of two daring escapes. Quick as a cat, Alan sprang into action, retrieving the straying feline. \"In this photograph, and in the dramatic seascapes that followed and that won him international renown, Le Gray used a new technique \u2014 the glass plate negative and the albumen silver print \u2014 to achieve a limpid atmosphere, extreme clarity of detail, and flawless surface.\" according to Timeline of Art History. \"The Imperial Yacht La Reine Hortense,\" Le Havre, 1856. Ever heard of Gustave Le Gray? Our host, Alan, had, of course. What else would you expect of the contemporary photographer whose breathtaking landscape architectural images are showcased in American Designed Landscapes: A Photographic Interpretion? Regular readers will recall the Wards presented us with a signed copy of that tome as a hostess gift in July when they were the cool cats who came to dinner. But back to the question of who's ever heard of Gustave Le Gray? We hadn't until yesterday morning, when googling revealed the now obscure 19th-century photographer had been the cat's pajamas of his day. Among his many accomplishments in pushing the envelope of photography as art and science, Le Gray is credited with having invented wax paper, the hot topic of our blog yesterday. A few fascinating tidbits from Timeline of Art History: His real contributions \u2014 artistically and technically \u2014 however, came in the realm of paper photography, in which he first experimented in 1848. The first of his four treatises, published in 1850, boldly \u2014 and correctly \u2014 asserted that \"the entire future of photography is on paper\" ... In the 1852 edition of his treatise, Le Gray wrote: \"It is my deepest wish that photography, instead of falling within the domain of industry, of commerce, will be included among the arts. That is its sole, true place, and it is in that direction that I shall always endeavor to guide it. Beauty in expected places. Carol had cooked up an eye-catching menu of totally delicious sweet-and-savory veggies, some soft \u2014 the firm-but-fork-tender sweet-potato-and-regular-potato salad above left \u2014 and some crunchy \u2014 broccoli mix, right, and perfect corn on the cob. We gotta get those recipes! Note Corny Cornbread mini peeking out from behind the ear of corn, part of our own hostess gift, as blogged here. After being grilled, the thick, juicy porkchops rested in a tent of foil. When did foil and plastic wrap displace wax paper among home cooks, and how has wax paper nevertheless managed to hold its own on your local supermarket shelf? Enquiring minds want to know. As Carol worked her magic in the kitchen and Tuck and ourselves sipped wine outside on the back porch overlooking the garden below, Alan went to work in the lower forty near the garage, grilling up a storm. The conversation ranged from art and architecture through gardening and home heating to the zigzag pattern cast by the dormer of the neighbor's house (top photo, above). Something called The New Best Recipe moved center stage. As Carol and Alan explained with much enthusiasm, the authors present their findings on the best way to cook everything under the sun. In the case of pork chops, you soak them in brine a few hours, rub in some herbs and then throw onto a hot grill. Cook/sear briefly on both sides, turn down the heat and cook a few more minutes. Then everybody into the foil tent (above photo) to continue cooking and let the juices settle. Update: Carol adds email meat to the bones of our New Best Recipe copy: Alan gave it to me at Christmas several years ago, and after three months I pronounced it one of the top ten presents. I have a collection of cook books, and I have to say this one is the go-to book for how to make the best fill-in-the-blank (pork chops, grilled fish, etc.). I may not follow every recipe 100%, due to a missing ingredient here and there, or a desire not to measure, but I think it belongs on the wish list for presents. The new furnace and associated copper tubing were a work of art in themselves. You know you've come to the right place when an elegant evening of good food, good wine and good company includes tours of both the basement \u2014 furnace, extensive wine cellar (below) and Alan's darkroom \u2014 AND the Wards' inspiring collection of black-and-white photographs by some of the best in the field. At one point a perky, lime-green katydid decided Tuck's arm was the place to be of a Saturday night. We didn't manage a presentable photo so are borrowing this one we found online: Greater Angle-winged Katydid/Broadwinged Katydid (Microcentrum rhombifolium), Quartz Mountain, Oklahoma \u00a9 2006 Rick Destree. We're guessing that our little friend was the Common True Katydid (Pterophylla camellifolia). Listen here. So fond of our company was the crispy critter that it rode inside, under the radar so to speak, on our own head, where Alan discovered and \"rescued\" the little fellow, gently plucking it up and returning it to the wild. Carol and Alan share an empathy for all things bright and beautiful as big as all outdoors. August 09, 2008 \"Just two old-time things that people have kind of forgotten about\" A come-hither whisper from within a \"Beggar's Purse\" of wax paper, where one of our Corny Cornbread mini-muffins poses provocatively atop the dining room table. To make your own: Use the recipe at \"Extremely corny and very moist,\" substituting a cup of thawed, pur\u00e9ed frozen corn if you don't have fresh steamed. Then dollop the batter into a Pam-sprayed mini-muffin pan and bake 15 minutes at 350. Yield: 12 minis. See below for how to make wrapper. It's a piece of cake. \"I have just invented the most adorable bit of packaging,\" we wrote our imail correspondent this morning: 'Was trying to find a cute container for a batch of Corny Cornbread minis to present as a hostess gift this evening. 'Didn't have any containers or cute boxes of the right size. 'Was about to just put 'em into a reclosable food storage bag when inspiration struck: Wax paper! She: TELL ALL!!! We: You place a mini in the center of a six-inch square (half the roll width) of wax paper, draw together opposite corners over the top of the mini and give the thing a twist. She: AWESOME!! They're called Beggar's Purses, I think, in regard to wrapping little things in dough. We: I must try it in DOUGH sometime. I LOVE the term, and it fits perfectly with how I stumbled upon it. I do LOVE the look and feel of wax paper. Very sensuous, dreamy ... WAXY! She: LOL. You know whose mother necessity is. We: Beauty in unexpected places. The structural memory of wax paper is such that the twist held, creating a swirling array that reminded us of the spiraling armies of dancers in the totally awesome opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympic Games, masterwork of former dissident movie director Zhang Yimou, now dissed by critics as \"a kind of Chinese Leni Fiefenstahl, creating beautiful backdrops for iron-fisted rulers.\" We caught some of the stagecraft and pyrotechnics \u2014 Busby Berkeley squared \u2014 in the wee hours this morning on NBC. George and Laura were there, bravely soldiering on as the world teeters on the edge. \"How cute is THAT???\" wrote our sis when we imailed the top photo: She: I think you can do for waxed paper what you did for lard. We: LOL. May I quote you? She: Well, just two old-time things that people have kind of forgotten about. So much good stuff that people have kind of forgotten about, so little time. August 08, 2008 Tomorrow is another day Tiny's becoming a totally glamorous bleached blonde, says Tuck, her Chelsea Gray fur turning more and more peaches and cream by the day. She worships the sun. \"Now I Know,\" headlines Amba re her turning inwards in the wake \u2014 in the Irish sense \u2014 of the campaign season from Hell: -- why I've been instinctively tuning out the campaign coverage and involuntarily shunning the political blogosphere. I've been avoiding Obama Fatigue like the plague. We, too, have been instinctively tuning out the campaign coverage other than an occasional lapse \u2014 but take issue with our dear friend's dismissal of the possibility of poor folks' pride: So, to put it as crudely as possible: the rich don't want to be taxed; the poor want more handouts; and everybody in between is trying to figure out whether life is better for them (us) under the frankly powerful or under those whose power derives from purporting to represent the interests of the powerless. \"The poor want more handouts\"? Only in a soul-deadened socialist society whose welfare-anesthetized work-free citizens believe their \"betters\" know better than they what's best for them. As we've blogged a zillion times, there is no honor -- and no really feeling good -- in being handed something you didn't earn. If you're talking \"the poor\" in a mobile society like ours, tomorrow is another day. Update: A great way to tune out campaign coverage is to head over to Mind of Mog for the beautifully designed, fully illustrated Carnival of the Cats #230. August 07, 2008 Paris Hilton has Huffington in a huff Paris who? Like us, Baby \u2014 above vying for Tuck's lunchtime pb-and-bacon sandwich \u2014 never once had the slightest interest in the Hilton heiress who was famous for being famous. Not until we saw her hot, hot, hot \"Paris Hilton Presidential Campaign\" FunnyorDie.com political spoof the other day. Click here for backstory. Some say her response to John McCain's \"Celeb\" ad is anti-McCain, but Johnny's hilarious response \u2014 not to mention Obama's lame \"Whatever\" \u2014 tells our gut our man comes out on top. Ariana Huffington is in a huff over John McCain's raising Cain over Barack Obama's obamboozlement of some of the people all of the time. And Paris Hilton's to-the-hilt response to McCain's \"Celeb\" ad \u2014blogged here, here and here \u2014 has got the Huffington woman's panties in a bunch: With just ninety days left in the election it's come down to this: our energy policy and a good deal of this presidential campaign are being discussed through the lens of Paris Hilton. What a big goof it all is! If you just ignore all the soldiers and civilians dying in the Mideast, and all the millions losing their homes and their jobs at home, you could really see the lighter side of it all. Her Bush-bashing boilerplate, designed to smear the Republican candidate by association, recalls Nancy Pelosi's battle cry on the eve of the Democrats' big 2006 victory \u2014blogged here \u2014 \"You must take him down.\" Ariana's complaint is music to our ears: It all started with McCain's ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. And then we had Paris Hilton's \"response,\" followed by the McCain camp's response to Paris Hilton: \"It sounds like Paris Hilton supports John McCain's 'all of the above' approach to America's energy crisis \u2014 including both alternatives and drilling. Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan.\" Who ever thought this election wasn't going to be about the issues? After lunch Tiny washes her face, lounging on the velvet-upholstered Victorian balloon-back armchair known as \"The Throne.\" Issues? You mean like \"When's supper?\" When they start whining that the other side is avoiding \"the issues,\" you know you've hit a nerve. \"Of course, it's not exactly a surprise that the Republican election machine would resort to trying to make the entire election into an issueless sideshow. I mean, what else do they have?\" asks the Huffington Post proprietress, seething with schoolgirlish sarcasm: Instead of the media calling the McCain campaign on its pathetic trivialization of the presidential race, they have been engaging in meaningless horse-race analysis of \"did the ad work?\" The conventional wisdom appears to be that it did ... But it now appears that the bigger the problems, the more likely it is that they'll be completely ignored. So here we are: huge problems and a correspondingly empty election. It's the politics of nothing. The McCain camp knows that the only way they can win this election is to turn it into a carnival sideshow. \"The politics of nothing\" and \"a carnival sideshow.\" You're projecting again, Ariana. Update: \"I thought, from the minute I saw Paris, that her spot ribbed both candidates, and gave the perfect opening for McCain's clever response,\" writes our imail correspondent: We: Yes. I felt it, as I said, in my GUT!!! McCain's humor may be the thing that saves the day. She: As we know, RATS have no sense of humor or irony. Many Republicans have it in spades, whereas, look at the candidates the RATS have fielded ... Dukakis, Kerry, Hillary, Obama ... nothing to laugh at there, except their looks. I forgot ALGORE!!! We: You're right, though. GW has a good sense of humor. So does Poppy. She: Yes, and OUR RONNIE was TOPS in the humor department. That's why OUR FRED is lookin' good for the VP nod. Laughter is the best medicine. LOTS better than what Michael Knox Beran in City Journal calls Obama's \"charismatic healer-redeemer fable.\" Update II: Speaking of spiritual healing, open your eyes to Henry Thoreau's shimmering vision: The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him. Then head over to a beautifully illustrated Carnival of the Cats #229 at Samantha & Tigger and a no-beasts-barred Friday Ark #203 at Modulator.

Its rotors' turbulence roiled the waters, stirring up half-remembered miasmas of the mind. Teresa Hummel photo. \"This is really sick,\" we wrote our sis re a UK Independent article headlined \"Attenborough alarmed as children are left flummoxed by test on the natural world\": Less than two-thirds (62 per cent) identified frogs. It seems impossible. Even if they are out of touch with nature, haven't these kids ever seen \"Sesame Street\"? Can you say Kermit the Frog? 'Guess that being green is even harder than we thought. And here's the irony of it all: Experts blamed the widening gulf between children and nature on over-protective parents and the hostility to children among some conservationists, who fear that they will damage the environment. They said that this lack of exposure to outdoor play in natural environments was vital for children's social and emotional development. \"They don't understand beauty, let alone recognize it in unexpected places,\" noted our sis. Christian and Susan, two for the seesaw, beautiful people \u2014madonna and child \u2014who light up our life blessed us with their presence for 24 hours starting midday on Saturday.

Eastern Salt imaginator Dan Adams and his stunning bride Marie were there, of course.

Out came the children running. All the little boys and girls, With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after The wonderful music with shouting and laughter. \u2014 Robert Browning's The Pied Piper of Hamelin (cover illustration by Kate Greenaway) \"To the movement conservatives in charge of McCain's campaign, and to the movement conservative that McCain himself has settled in to being, Obama is just the most recent leader of a series of children's crusades \u2014 spoiled children's crusades,\" writes Marty Kaplan at The Huffington Post, unwittinglyy stumbling onto the truth about that \"Celeb ad of McCain's that we can't stop blogging about. Imagining himself a soothsaying satirist on a \"Fantastic Voyage\" inside the conservative mind, Kaplan recognizes in spite of himself that \"Celeb\" is not about Barack Obama at all. In fact, it's about the adolescent fantasies of his groupies amongst the citizenry and their fellow travelers in the media. Just as that New Yorker cartoon cover of Barack and Michelle Obama as Islamist terrorist and 60s \"revolutionary\" was meant to be about the hysteria of extremist Obama critics, so \"Celeb\" is meant to be about the hysteria of extremist Obama advocates. Neither has anything to do with Obama per se, beyond his ability to inhabit the superstar role of what Virginial Postrel has called \"the fresh young prince onto whom Democrats project their hopes and dreams.\" Update: \"Secret charms ...and looking for innuendo in all the wrong places.\" Dr. Sanity's Carnival of the Insanities will drive you crazy. Update II: Maggie's links. \"Locked up in modes that surely have little interest to voters\" Not unlike the editors of the Wall Street Journal, Baby Cakes \u2014 outside on the lawn early morning, locked up in a squirrel-monitoring mode \u2014 has little interest in presidential dog-and-pony shows. \"Both men have locked up in modes that surely have little interest to voters,\" declare the WSJ editors this morning, in high dudgeon over that anti-Obama \"Celeb\" ad we awarded four stars yesterday (Click here to view ad): Senator McCain's latest \"inexperience\" TV ad about his opponent opened with fleeting images of celeb babes Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, who likely don't know who he is. The celebrity link was a leap that fell flat. If that was silly, Senator Obama's verbal crackback at his opponent's criticism was more troubling. Campaigning in Missouri, he said: \"So what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, 'He's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name,' you know, 'He doesn't look like all those other Presidents on the dollar bills.'\" Dog-and-pony shows? Tiny is not amused. We beg to differ, of course: 1. For us, Barack Obama's race-card tricks are old hat. Why be \"troubled\" about his legerdemain now? As we blogged way back in December of 2006 when we picked up on something \"troubling\" the Illinois Senator said that seemed to elude our betters in the mainstream media \u2014 that people of our political persuasion are probably \"not going to vote for me because I'm African-American\" \u2014 Obama has been race-baiting Republicans like us from the starting gate. She much prefers locking up in a mode of \"rapt contemplation Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of her name: Her ineffable effable Effanineffable Deep and inscrutable singular Name.\" 2. As for the WSJ editors' dismissal of the McCain \"Celeb\" ad's conflation of fans' unquenchable thirst for all things Britney and Paris with Obamaniacs' similarly insatiable appetite for the object of their lust, our friends at the Journal would appear to be projecting their own high-falutin' preferences for low-key, measured, rational debate onto an unwilling populace. Update: Dogs, ponies, snakes, snails and all things bright and beautiful, including Tiny and Baby, at Modulator's Friday Ark #202. July 31, 2008 \"Comparing him to Obama, though, I LOVE the big old lug\" Chelsea Chamber of Commerce automobiles go tire to tire with earth-moving equipment across the street at Eastern Salt as respectable local business people take off on a cruise of Boston Inner Harbor to embrace for a few hours the \"ephemerality, cacophony, multiplicity and simultaneity of Everyday Urbanism. \"I think that the years of captivity truly rattled his brain, as it would,\" writes our imail correspondent, taking the ball of Daniel Henninger's rhetorical \"Is John McCain Stupid?\" and running with it: I think he's an idiot, in many ways. Comparing him to Obama, though, I LOVE the big old lug. That's pretty much where we've been as of late in this disingenuously who-me? race-bating race from Hell, from the moment in December of 2006 that we got a glimpse of the cynical heart of darkness that is Barack Obama's game plan. That so many of our fellow Americans are buyin' his snake oil reminds us of how nothing changes but the date. McCain's new \"Celeb\" ad linking Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Barack Obama was a breath of fresh air to those of us on the right side of the aisle. The shock, shock and outrage of our friends on the other side of the aisle told us the McCain folks had hit a nerve. \"I have a blogpost in mind but haven't found the mental space to pursue it,\" we further imailed our sis, following a blow-by-blow accounting of a day of wall-to-wall cooking in preparation for the apr\u00e8s ski part of Saturday's Eastern Minerals Maritime Festival: She: What is rattling the cell? We: Having to do with that walkable neighborhoods thing and a ridiculous Chelsea Record article about Eastern Minerals' Maritime Festival. The first paragraph is right out of the liberal playbook. She: Oh, no. Is the Record panning it already? We: And I quote: \"Chelsea's working waterfront can often seem like an unfriendly, uniniviting place.\" They introduce the concept with boilerplate anti-salt and then go on to praise the events: \"Heavy machinery, mountainous piles of road salt and large seagoing ships are among the drawbacks that make the waterfront a less than ideal place to go for a stroll or take a leisurely walk. However, that will change this weekend as the Eastern Salt Company plays host to the Sixth Annual Eastern Salt Maritime Festival.\" The search for beauty in unexpected places that is the essence of our worldview and the paradigm of Everyday Urbanism eludes the close-minded, inside-the-box thinkers of what we have called the \"permanently angry folk of the Chelsea Green Space and Recreation Committee, who 'demand' that Eastern Minerals 'find an alternative site for the salt' and 'any remaining salt be covered with a solid structure, as required by state law.'\" Chelsea Record reporter Joseph Domelowicz, Jr. appears to have bought their story, no questions asked. One man's drawbacks are another's romance of the sea. More about \"walkable neighborhoods\" \u2014 ours is \"Very Walkable\" according to Walk Score's algorithm \u2014and how they may make you fat or thin as soon as we come up for air. July 28, 2008 By the beautiful sea Goomp out on the terrace pronounces our Tomato Soup de Soie the love apple of his eye. What to do when the homegrown tomatoes start feeling their oats? We clicked over to Epicurious.com and found the perfect cold tomato soup to serve as appetizer for Saturday's Clambake Lite down Goomp's. See below for preparation notes. The clambake itself was clamless. Unlike last summer's no-holds-barred Bill Foster's Down East Clambake to go, we simplified, simplied: Lobsters \u2014 Hannaford's steamed 'em to order \u2014 corn on the cob, potato salad, grilled red dogs and garden salad. Lobster roll for Goomp and nutcrackers, picks and drawn butter for the rest of us. Another new recipe, Shortbread Lemon Bars, for dessert. \"Force pur\u00e9e through a fine sieve ... discarding seeds,\" says Epicurious. Waste-not-want-not Yankee that we are, we kept the seeds and other solids left in the sieve and used a dollop as garnish for broccoli soup. Tomato Soup de Soie, our latest Cold Turkey Cookbook triumph, comes straight out of the Epicurious files. We didn't change a thing. Just peel and pur\u00e9e your tomatoes, add a little lemon juice, lemon zest, chopped scallion greens, sugar, dried thyme, marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Serve in your finest soup bowls to showcase the dazzling color, and top with a dollop of sour cream. As diners spoon into the dollop, the swirling factor becomes part of the eye appeal. Click here for detailed instructions. The Food Network makes peeling tomatoes look easy. The trick is to plunge 'em into boiling water for a few seconds and then immediately into iced water. We used a plastic spatula to force the juice through our fine sieve. Tuck, Goomp and Suzi wait for the hostess to lift her spoon so they can all dip into the soup du jour. With his eye ever on the prize, Babe goes for the jugular of the bag of lobsters. Moving back and forth between kitchen and supply room, we noticed Baby Cakes hovering near the bag of lobsters. In self-defense of our own meal, we fine-tuned the Babe's minute-by-minute location accordingly, carrying him to the supply room and depositing him there while we gathered things from the #2 fridge. By the time we got back to the kitchen, Cakes was just arriving back there himself for another lobster vigil. From imail with Suzi next morning: She: I was remembering your carrying Baby around like a fashion accessory yesterday. Wicked tow koot. We: I wish you HAD taken peectures, peectures. She: I know. It was classic, and priceless. What I loved was that he didn't seem to mind . . . didn't fight you, or claw to get away. Kind of went limp, like a Fendi purse. :-) We: Kind of like the kitten being transported by the nape of the neck in the mother's mouth. Tuck, the man of many hats, becomes a man of leisure for the day. Suzi loves Chris loves Mom loves Barney II. Check out the mother's glamorous Michael Stars designer jeans with the perfect fit. Chris takes the wheel as we head out after lunch to perform the annual ritual of total immersion in the waters of the Atlantic. After lunch we drove over to York Harbor Beach across the river from Goomp's Camelot-by-the-Sea. Just as we arrived, a parking place opened up magically a stone's throw from the shore, where a larger-than-usual throng was starting to believe life's a beach. All agreed the scene had the look and sound and feel of the early scenes of \"Jaws.\" Life IS a beach. Everybody into the surf! There weren't too many babes, Tuck and Chris decided, but that's the trade-off when you're talking a family beach. No radios or other canned music broke the spell of the soundmix of waves breaking and retreating and happy people frolicking in the water and playing in the sand. Talk about playing in the sand. Toes sanded up as we dripped dry in the afterglow of a rousing session of body surfing. The waves were bigger and more powerful than usual \u2014 due to \"a strong storm system\" at sea, we learned next day \u2014 for this pristine little strand tucked between the granite bedrock of Eastern Point and Stage Neck near the mouth of the York River. When you catch the wave just before it breaks, it carries you straight and true into the shallows. Laughing and feeling as light as air, you pick yourself up and head out for more, enjoying the sensation of letting some of the interim waves crash in your face before the next perfect wave takes you soaring again. The timeless hysteria of the history-challenged multitudes This image of you-know-who giving the sieg heil salute to a mob of rock concert fans near the \"take-down-this-wall\" site of President Reagan's June 12, 1987 remarks at the Brandenburg Gate made our blood run cold. All those mostly pink forearms raised in a cascading lambda of mindless \"yes-we-can\" bandwagonism called to mind the wizened limbs of the victims of the holocaust. Obama's flip-flopping political antics are par for the course, of course -- we've had his number since December of 2006 when he gratuitously called us a racist -- but there are two things now that haunt us: 1. The timeless hysteria of the history-challenged multitudes and 2. The fellow travelership of the still so-called mainstream media. \"My opponent, of course, is traveling in Europe, and tomorrow his tour takes him to France ... a throng of adoring fans awaits Senator Obama in Paris \u2014 and that's just the American press,\" quipped John McCain the other day. We'd missed those bon mots at the time but stumbled upon them in our Site Meter stats this morning at Democracy Project. McCain has always been what's termed \"problematic\" for us, from McCain-Feingold on down to pandering to the anthropogenic-global-warming crowd. At the same time, in years gone by when we were still able to stomach Imus in the Morning on MSNBC, McCain's quick-on-the-uptake sense of humor was always a hoot, something you'd never get from the Obamessiah. As we blogged awhile back, given the alternatives, in \"How I learned to stop worrying and love John McCain\": \"Nothing in America is inevitable. We are the captains of our fate. We can overcome any challenge as long as we keep our courage and stand by our principles,\" Super-Duper Tuesday's Republican man of the hour John McCain told supporters and the immediate universe in his Victory Party speech last night [via A Second Hand Conjecture]. The words were what we disaffected freedom-loving, small-government-embracing, invisible-hand-holding types thought we'd never hear from the free-speech-restricting, anthropogenic-global-warming-proseletyzing, economics-challenged frontrunner who is enjoying what Shepard Smith is calling a \"monster lead\" over rivals Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee. Who knew the proprietor of the Fast-Talking Straight Talk Express had principles? \"And when I came to the room with shoes, nothing but empty shoes, I broke down,\" wrote Jeff Jarvis of his epipany at the Holocaust Museum in DC a few years back. We blogged about it in our post \"The city upon a hill shines through.\" That sea of mostly pink forearms raised in support of Barack Obama's dreamy \"yes we can\" chimera echoed ironically the ocean of empty shoes pictured poignantly at the Holocaust Museum in DC. July 25, 2008 A vertical delivery on the salt dock Everyday Urbanism will out. \"Between 12 and 2 pm next Saturday the USCG will perform a vertical delivery on the salt dock\" across the street from us here at Chelsea-by-the-Sea, emails Dan Adams re the highlight of Eastern Salt's Chelsea Maritime Festival 10 to 4 p.m. on Saturday, August 2: A helicopter hovers high over the ground, and USCG personnel repel down cables onto the dock ... It should be a really spectacular demonstration and vision. \"The newest and most powerful tractor tug in Boston is Leo,\" according to Professional Mariner. Leo will be dockside across the street for tours August 2 for Eastern Salt's Chelsea Maritime Festival. We're hoping for the totally awesome repro of Darwin's Beagle with state-of-the-art innards for sometime next year, but while we're waiting, the \"newest and most powerful tractor tug in Boston,\" Leo will be lying alongside Eastern Salt next weekend for interested boarding parties: Boston's traditional tugboat company, Boston Towing & Transportation, has had to make room this year for an expanded, refinanced and revitalized competitor \u2014 Constellation Martitime, acquired by Foss Maritime of Seattle in 2006 ... Out at the end of Pier 1 in Charlestown, near the autoport at the end of Terminal Street, just north of the Charlestown Navy Yard, it's beginning to look like a Foss Maritime satellite yard with half a dozen green and white tugs tied up around a couple of work barges, one of which houses a maintenance facility and offices. What's left of the old Constellation fleet \u2014 tied up around the corner \u2014 is totally eclipsed by the newer and more powerful green and white Foss tugs. While a couple of new Foss tractor-style tugs get the headlines these days, a handful of very capable twin-screw tugs are also there to do the heavy hauling. Most of them are being renamed after stellar constellations, except the newest and most powerful \u2014 the 5,080-hp z-drive tractor, Leo, which arrived in Boston in mid-March already bearing a constellation name. Leo and another Foss tractor, the 3,000-hp cycloidal-drive tug America (just renamed Orion), were both towed around from the West Coast as dead ships, arriving with a disfiguring coating of ice at the tail end of winter. Boston Towing, with 13 tugs including two LNG-capable, z-drive tractor tugs, still has the majority of ship-assist work in this mid-sized port \u2014 estimated to be at least 75 percent market share \u2014 but Constellation, backed by an aggressive parent company eager to build itself as a national brand, is sure to be coming on strong in the near future. We're totally into the USCG these days, our nephew's beloved's being a member of the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Tahoma of cocaine-busting fame. Our exhibition at Pearl Street Gallery just up the street from Eastern Salt will be open for tours during the festival, and for friends of sisu there'll be food and drink at Chelsea-by-the-Sea following the formal event. If you're in the area \u2014or if not, feel free to go out of your way \u2014 please stop by. July 23, 2008 \"As a grain of mustard seed\" Tiny relaxes mid morning surrounded by the English ivy that covers the neighbor's house. \"Hoo, boy - thems is some kittehs,\" comments par excellence Elisson re the Chelsea Grays. Here's lookin' at you, kid. A bristling specimen of common burdock (Arctium minus) \u2014 Old World invasive biennial forb of waste places and member of the daisy family (Compositae or Asteraceae) \u2014 has set up shop just under the forsythia by the side steps at Chelsea-by-the-Sea, a perfect place for our camera's eye to study its progress from flower to seed. The first-year rosette of basal leaves went unnoticed by us, but this year's bushy crop of stunning magenta and pink flowerheads surrounded by hooked green burrs (x 4) towering over the stairs is making quite a splash. You're probably aware that the \"hook and loop fastener\" Velcro was inspired by the structure of burdock's fruit, but did you know it all started in the Alps? Detail of botanical illustration of Arctium minor shows cross section of flowerhead (magenta and pink) enclosed in a prickly burr or involucre, a series of bracts or phyllaries (green turning to brown when ripe) with hooks curving inward. (Flora von Deutschland \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz, 1885) From SwissInfo.org's How a Swiss invention hooked the world: It was in 1941 that [Velcro inventor Georges] de Mestral had his eureka moment. Walking his dog in the woods, he spotted that his woollen socks and jacket and his dog's fur were covered with burrs \u2014 small seeds or dry fruits found in many types of plant including thistles and, in this case, burdock. Back home, de Mestral slipped a few burrs under a microscope and saw that their barbed, hook-like seeds meshed with the looped fibres in his clothes ... in 1955, the hook-and-loop fastener was patented under the name Velcro, which comes from the French words \"velours\" (velvet) and \"crochet\" (hook). Most \"flower flies have \"yellow-and-black stripes and are excellent mimics of wasps or bees,\" according to the US Forest Service site. \"Flies are considered 'incidental' pollinators,\" adds the USDA Agricultural Research Service, \"moving pollen on their body hairs from one flower to another as they search for nectar.\" This striking specimen was busy incidentally pollinating flowers of gold of pleasure, AKA false flax (Camelina sativa), another weedy plant of waste places that caught our camera's eye this morning along a seedy stretch of sidewalk during walkies. Camelina has \"long been grown in Europe, its oil used as a lamp oil until the 18th century. Gold of pleasure (Camelina sativa), a weedy member of the Brassicaceae or Cruciferae (AKA the crucifers, mustard family or cabbage family) of economic plants is another one of those \"volunteers\" in our own backyard that promises to be a boon to mankind. According to a Journal of Applied Poultry Research study, it is \"one of various oilseed crops being studied for its potential value in biofuel production. The resultant by-product of oil extraction, camelina meal (CM), could be marketable as a livestock feed. Update: Compare profile of burdock blossom, far right, with cross-section of flowerhead in botanical illustration above. We stumbled onto camelina's virtues the other day when the Professor commented \"I certainly agree that non-food-based biofuels are the future. Corn-based ethanol is justifiable, if at all, only as a bootstrapping measure,\" linking to an AgWeb article by Dr. Don Panter, President of Sustainable Oils, LLC: Most important to the debate of fuel vs. food is the fact that biodiesel can be produced from non-food crops. Camelina, for example, is a non-invasive, oilseed crop of the mustard family. It can be grown in arid conditions or rotated with cereal crops and requires low amounts of fertilizer and pesticides. Aptly nicknamed \"gold of pleasure,\" the high-yielding energy-crop boosts farm revenues by creating a food-plus-fuel scenario. The meal produced from crushed camelina can be used to create omega-3 enriched feed for livestock, a significant benefit that has gotten swept away in the controversy. The beauty of non-food crops like camelina is that they are here today and don't require new technology breakthroughs, just a commitment to see them succeed. Update II: Burdock receives a gentleman caller, one of those fuzzy flower flies that looks like a bee to the untrained eye, \"but there are several features that make it easy to separate [Syrphus sp.] from a bee: the eyes are huge, the antennae are short and stubby with a bristle half-way along, there's nowhere to carry pollen and there is only one pair of wings.\" And camelina's bounty isn't just for diesel-powered vehicles, livestock and flower flies: Camelina's other attraction is its possible application in human nutrition. It has a unique fatty acid profile that could make it a good source of omega three and omega six fatty acids. McVicar suggests that the health food industry is currently seeking products that have improved health attributes, which might present new opportunities for camelina. The biblical parable of the mustard seed comes to mind: And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. \u2014 Matthew 17:20 (King James Version) Back to biodiesel, Rudolph Diesel himself planted the seed \u2014 a peanut seed \u2014 over a hundred years ago, as BioShuttles explains: Biodiesel has been around for over a century. Dr. Rudolf Diesel actually invented the diesel engine to run on vegetable oil and in fact when he presented his engine at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900, his engine was running on a fuel derived from peanut oil. Prior to his death in 1913 he stated that; \"The diesel engine can be fed with vegetable oils and would help considerably in the development of agriculture of the countries which use it.\" \"The use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today. But such oils may become in course of time as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time.\" However due to the low cost of mineral oils at the time his engine was modified to run such oils. However, in European countries since the mid 1990's and in UK since 2002 reductions in biofuels duty has made the use of biodiesel economically viable as is now seen to be the \"sustainable fuel of the future\". The Lord and the Invisible Hand move in mysterious ways. Update: Maggie's links, commenting on the old saying that \"The good Lord didn't create anything without a purpose, but mosquitoes come close\": 'Toon from Theo. It's wrong, though. Without mosquitoes, we would have no Gin and Tonics. Be sure to check out all the links. It's a treasure trove, as usual. Update II: A treasure trove of links to all things bright and beautiful at Modulator's Friday Ark #201 Update III: Lots more things bright and beautiful at Carnival of the Cats #228, now playing at Cat.Synth.com. July 21, 2008 Site inspection Out on the east drive this morning, Babe inspects the detritus of Tuck's project to reset the posts, restore the fence and reset that part of the brick walk and steps along the side of the house disrupted by the Big Dig two weeks back. Notice the difference in green between typical New England midsummer brown lawn (foreground and background) vs. spring-green rogue patches of grass growing in amongst the bricks of the drive. Do the bricks set into the soil act as a dry well drawing water towards the roots? Taking his work seriously, Inspector Cakes leaves no stone unturned. Update: Artsy Catsy presents Carnival of the Cats #227, \"the greatest traveling cat show on the face of the Earth.\" July 20, 2008 \"Without any understanding\" Looking for love in all the right places. TV screen shot of a young pilgrim basking in the warm glow of BXVIs blessing during Papa Ratzi's triumphant visitation to Australia for World Youth Day 2008. \"Euphoria in politics is an invitation for disappointment,\" Eckart von Klaeden \u2014 a German parliamentarian and foreign policy expert in Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union \u2014 said with reference to Herr Obama's imminent visit to the Fatherland: \"One reason Obama is so popular here is that people expect him to break radically with the politics of Bush, without any understanding of what this would involve,\" said Eckart von Klaeden ... He likened the huge crowds Obama is expected to draw in Europe to those that cheered on former Chancellor Helmut Kohl during the build-up to German unification. Kohl's fans turned against him when his promises of \"flourishing landscapes\" in eastern Germany failed to materialize. Benedetto schmoozes down under with youthful pilgrims from the four corners of the earth. Back on this side of the pond, \"Moving abruptly to the center, as Mr. Obama has been doing, may be a smart overall political strategy,\" notes the WSJ, \"But it clearly comes at some cost to his standing among his most idealistic supporters.\" ABC's George Stephanopoulos says enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate among young voters \"has been dampened\" and \"all of the questions in recent weeks on whether or not Barack Obama is shifting positions, becoming 'a typical politician,' is turning some of them off.\" Thank God. He may not be the anti-Christ, but Obama's line is as old and tired as the hills, his recently astronomical poll numbers the wages of history-free public education and wishful thinking. 'Wonder how much overlap there is between the youngsters who look to the Lord, through Benedetto, for their help and those who look to Barack Obama for their personal salvation? Enough about the unspeakably narcissistic Democratic presidential candidate and the sheeple who bleat to his call. Let's move on to the Vicar of Christ. \"Before the Pope and the crowds arrived, Sydney tried hard to be cynical about the whole affair,\" says Time, succumbing to the glory of it all in spite of itself: People asked why the government was spending $80 million on World Youth Day, a Catholics-only event. They grumbled that streets would be closed and traffic disrupted. Then the pilgrims came. The winter weather turned heavenly \u2014 one blue day after another. And the crowds of youths weren't quite the kind party-mad \"Sinny\" is used to. They were happy, patient, peaceable. They sang hymns and waved flags. When protesters threw condoms at them, they shouted, \"Jesus loves you, too.\" Throughout the week, attendees filled Sydney's streets, in groups clearly identifiable by their bright backpacks and occasionally breaking into song. For many, part of the joy had been being with like-minded people, what the organizer of World Youth Day, Bishop Anthony Fisher, called \"the ability to say 'God' in public, not having to hide it away in church for an hour each week.\" Then there was the NYT, whose \"despite\" tells everything about the editors' anti-Catholic mindset: \"Despite the presence of hundreds of thousands of young visitors, 125,000 of them from overseas, there was almost no trouble,\" the New York Times reported. The police reported only one arrest, of a young Australian Catholic who punched a demonstrator who was throwing condoms into a crowd of pilgrims to protest the church's stand on birth control and its opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. \"The world needs this renewal,\" Benedict said. \"In so many of our societies, side by side with material prosperity, a spiritual desert is spreading; an interior emptiness, an unnamed fear, a quiet sense of despair.\" 'Guess the Times didn't have the time to notice the body language of \"happy, patient, peaceable\" youngsters feeling the joy. It wasn't \"despite\" their presence but BECAUSE OF their presence that there was \"almost no trouble.\" As Benedetto said, \"Our world has grown weary of greed, exploitation and division ... of the tedium of false idols and piecemeal responses, and the pain of false promises.\" Obama who? \"From the forlorn child in a Darfur camp, or a troubled teenager, or an anxious parent in any suburb, or perhaps even now from the depth of your own heart, there emerges the same human cry for recognition, for belonging, for unity,\" he told a gathering of 180,000 pilgrims during an evening vigil on the eve of his final Sunday mass. \"A new age in which hope liberates us from the shallowness, apathy and self-absorption which deaden our souls and poison our relationships. Dear young friends, the Lord is asking you to be prophets of this new age, messengers of his love, drawing people to the Father and building a future of hope for all humanity.\" That \"human cry for recognition, for belonging, for unity\" struck a cord here, where the importance of being noticed is our ur-theme, from the suicidal monsters who terrorized London to the astronauts who flew to \"the stars.\" As we've said before, it's all about whom you choose as your peers. Update: A chorus of human cries for recognition at Dr. Sanity's Carnival of the Insanities. July 18, 2008 \"Everything I designed was unnecessary\" Designer Philippe Starck talks about his TeddyBearBand [1998 for Roty]: \"In my opinion, an overabundance of toys fosters infidelity. As an advocate of the one-true-love approach, I dreamt of a single toy that would serve as an apprenticeship for the lasting human relationships that await our children.\" \"Everything I designed was unnecessary,\" superstar French designer Philippe Starck told an interviewer last March, bemoaning the state of his art and soul: \"I was a producer of materiality and I am ashamed of this fact,\" Starck told Die Zeit weekly newspaper ... Starck, who is known for his interior design of hotels and Eurostar trains and mass consumption objects ranging from chairs to tooth brushes and lemon juice squeezers, went on to say that he believed that design on the whole was dead. \"In future there will be no more designers. The designers of the future will be the personal coach, the gym trainer, the diet consultant,\" he said. Starck said the only objects that he still felt attached to were \"a pillow perhaps and a good mattress.\" But the thing one needs most, he added, was the \"ability to love.\" \"It seems to have nothing to do with the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea,\" the WSJ quotes leading British yacht designer Donald Starkey re Russian billionaire industrialist Andrey Melnichenko's new yacht, A. \"Created by Philippe Starck, the superstar French designer of lemon squeezers and luxury hotels, A is a deliberate slap in the face to an industry known for its classic conformity,\" comments the Journal. What's got M. Starck so upset? Maybe it was that yachtspotter.com comment about his design (above photo) for Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko's new yacht: Starck shouldn't design yachts. It's marriage, Mrs. [Aleksandra] Melnichenko turned [the Starck-designed ship] A into one of her pet projects ... She downsized the disco and commissioned new more practical furniture with the aim of turning Mr. Starck's 'hotel into more of a home,' according to someone close to the project.\" Or was the designer's discomfit induced by the decadence of clients whose id\u00e9e of celebrating Starck's restoration of a historical Paris hotel was to invite a coterie of celebs to trash the place? \"Yeah, you know, the usual throwing the telly out of the window type of thing,\" Kanye West (unattributed photo, left) is reported to have characterized a recent VIP \"demolition party\" in Paris. The rap artist and hip hop producer, \"who roamed the corridors with a bemused-looking Yves Carcelle, said that trashing hotel rooms was old hat.\" West's mascot and trademark is a teddy bear, above on the cover of his singles album \"Stronger.\" Can you say displacement \u2014 in the Dr. Sanity sense of \"the separation of emotion from its real object and a redirection of the [usually intense] emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening.\" We're thinking of the French housing-project riots. Normally the displacement would involve BDS, but here it was good, clean fun, fiddling while Paris burns: Hundreds of select guests are invited Thursday night to wreck and smash one of Paris' grandest hotels, the Royal Monceau, in a performance-style \"Demolition Party\" before it closes for renovation. From teaspoons to tables, a million euros worth of hotel contents were put up for auction ahead of its year-long makeover by design guru Philippe Starck. VIP guests, fitted with helmets, are invited to take a hammer and chisel to the rest, walls and left-over furniture included, as concerts and art performances are staged in the hotel's wings. \"The cream of Paris' intellectuals and artists are invited to this festive, ferocious happening,\" the hotel said in a statement. The demolition party that went down at the The Hotel Royal Monceau in Paris wasn't just any old party. This is Paris after all. and the hotel managed to make their demolition artistic by inviting 25 contemporary artists and celebs to \"artistically ruin\" the hotel rooms on the third floor. \"Meanwhile Philippe Starck was on hand at the party dishing about his renovation plans for the hotel,\" reports Hotel Chatter: He also said he's more focused on \"democratic eco-friendly projects.\" He even mentioned a green building in LA that he's working on and while he couldn't elaborate he said it was going to be \"big.\" A mini-turbine of one's own. It's where market forces lead. Starck knows and goes where the invisible hand leads: \"Environment becomes a good business opportunity. In the end, why not? As long as the final result is to help us to survive and to continue the evolution of our civilization that is based on intelligence.\" \"Philippe Starck's personal invisible windmill 'Democratic Ecology' (above) was introduced at Milan's Greenergy Design show earlier this year in a vibrant display relaying the intent to enable every man, woman and child on Earth to generate their own power in designer style,\" reports Inhabitat: The transparent mini-turbine will be available to all in September 2008 and, in typical Starck style, if everyone's going to have one he's going to make sure they all look great. \"If you can't use things for what they're not intended for, you have no business on the Internet,\" writes poet-in-residence Greg of Sippican Cottage. \"The kids like the tinkertoy vibe of the plumbing pipe.

Closer to home, local superstar designer Greg of Sippican Cottage, a man with a plan, makes \"democratic eco-friendly projects\" (above) look like child's play. July 17, 2008 \"The facts are irrelevant\" \"They are like bookends. They will bring you many years of pleasure,\" a veterinarian's assistant predicted years ago of then kittens Tiny (above) and Baby (below), out in the side yard this afternoon assuming full bookend posture. Googling a half-remembered quotation post \"An exultation of adolescence\" of a couple of years back, we had a eureka moment this evening \u2014 unrelated to the quotation itself \u2014 reading the words of Dr. Joy Bliss of Maggie's Farm: What if the part of human nature which wants paternalism, or maternalism, in the State is sometimes, or often, stronger than the part that wants freedom and self-determination? It called to mind our imail conversation with Goomp yesterday morning as we shared thoughts on Thomas Sowell's latest essay, \"Are Facts Obsolete?\" First, here's Tom: As the hypnotic mantra of \"change\" is repeated endlessly, few people even raise the question of whether what few specifics we hear represent any real change, much less a change for the better. Raising taxes, increasing government spending and demonizing business? That is straight out of the New Deal of the 1930s. The New Deal was new then but it is not new now. Moreover, increasing numbers of economists and historians have concluded that New Deal policies are what prolonged the Great Depression. Babe mirrors Tiny's leonine pose in the countdown to supper. \"It is depressing how ignorant people are of how the world works,\" Goomp wrote, responding to Dr. Sowell's point that \"A politician's problem is how to look like he is for 'the poor' and against those who are 'exploiting' them. The facts are irrelevant to maintaining that political image\": Goomp [channeling Dr. Bliss's question]: It is all because they want to escape from personal responsibility. We: They want to continue to suckle at the maternalistic udder. He: And be told how wonderful they are. And politicians are only too happy to oblige. Flirting dangerously with Godwin's Law, we summed things up awhile back in \"What's wrong with the utopianist left world view,\" our post linked by Dr. Bliss in her own post referenced above: As we've blogged early and often, the totalitarian instinct runs deep and dark in our species. It is forever raising its ugly head on both ends of the political spectrum, and cheating your way to victory is precisely where it's at. Ends justify the means. That's why commies and Nazis -- not to mention Islamofascists -- parrot the same party line: We educated elites know what's best for you plebes. Bill and Hill's \"What if you spend your money wrong?\" and \"We are going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good\" come to mind. Then there's \"libertarian paternalism,\" a subliminal approach to political persuasion that has \"caught the imagination of top politicians\" including Barack Obama, according to a breathless London Times interview of behavioral scientist Richard Thaler, co-author with Cass Sunstein of Nudge: So why the political interest? Because you can influence people's choices without being accused of \"nannying\" and it is cheap. Or, as the authors put it: \"If incentives and nudges replace requirements and bans, government will be both smaller and more modest ... In short, libertarian paternalism is neither left nor right, neither Democratic nor Republican. In many areas, the most thoughtful Democrats are going beyond their enthusiasm for choice-eliminating programs. In many areas, the most thoughtful Republicans are abandoning their knee-jerk opposition to constructive governmental initiatives.\" Considering ourselves among \"the most thoughtful Republicans,\" we are skeptical. So is David Gordon of the Ludwig von Mises Intitute, who notes that \"Tocqueville long ago warned against the policies of which libertarian paternalism is an example.\" Blogger Cassy Fiano gets it just right in her post \u2014 with video link \u2014 on GWs press conference this morning where he tells mewling reporters that \"Americans are smart enough to figure out whether they're going to drive less or not.\" Liberals just can't seem to grasp the fact that people don't need their all-knowing wisdom-filled genius to live happy and full lives. When President Bush said that it was presumptuous to tell Americans how to live their own lives, I wanted to cheer. It's something that liberals aren't able to understand. They think that the American people are idiots who can't be trusted to be intelligent enough to figure things out on their own, and therefore need liberals to come in and do everything for them. And now back to Dr. Joy Bliss for the final word: State parentalism is one step from totalitarianism. And not just psychologically, but also in reality. First, you get the people used to the idea that they can depend on the government to take care of you and to solve your problems (rather than simply to defend you, and to keep life reasonably fair), and, having slowly softened them up, you build on that until you can't smoke a cigarette in your car without getting fined, or find a decent fried chicken take-out in NYC. We're smart enough, Barack Obama. Oh, and we're not a racist. Update: Congratulations to the blogosphere's own Noah, our good blogfriend Steve of Modulator, for launching the Friday Ark on its 200th outing! Update II: Lots more smart talk at Dr. Sanity's Carnival of the Insanities. July 13, 2008 \"Photography's ambivalent posture\" Alan, Tuck and Carol degli spiriti last evening on the terrace. \"This duality, which is familiar in the work of such important twentieth-century American photographers as Ansel Adams and Walker Evans, is linked to photography's ambivalent posture \u2014 as tool and product, means and result, reportage and artistic work,\" writes Gary R. Hilderbrand in the introduction to Alan Ward's totally awesome American Designed Landscapes: A Photographic Interpretion, a signed copy of which we were gifted with last evening when longtime blog commenter extraordinaire Carol Ward and her significant other came to break bread with us at Chelsea-by-the-Sea. We never read books at home \u2014 That's Tuck's job. He reads everything \u2014 the tininess of the type usually sending our fading eyesight careening to the internet, where you can increase the size of type with a click or two of the mouse. But for Alan's book and Gary's introduction, we make an exception. Gary was one of the best teachers ever during our Harvard School of Design days last century. We remember thinking of it in these terms: Gary was rather modest of physical stature, but when he came to your studio desk to look at your project to date and challenge you to be the best that you could be, his empathetic heart and historically-charged critical mind expanded to fill the entire universe for a few magical moments, when everything seemed possible. Gary Hilderbrand's deep, dark and delicious professorial exposition on \"photography's ambivalent posture\" called to mind by contrast the egregious excesses of fauxtography, from al-Durah on down to the latest photoshopped gunboat-diplomacy travesties of the missile-happy Iranian dictators. Our dear friend Scott Ott of ScrappleFace catches the conscience of the thing with \"Iran Threatens to Photoshop Israel from Map\": Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his nation's missile tests this week are part of a previously-secret plan to \"Photoshop Israel from the map. \"Images of the missile tests showed apparently-real, as well as computer-generated duplicates of Shahab missiles, which Iran claims have a range of up to 1,250 miles \u2014 long enough to strike Israel \u2014 a claim which has since been questioned by Western arms experts. Mr. Ahmadinejad said that while it may take years to produce actual weapons that could strike \"the Zionist state\", Iranian scientists and graphic artists have already demonstrated the ability, using Adobe\u00ae technology to \"completely obliterate\" Israel from the map. Tiny of the tethers. She and the Babe were all over Carol and Alan, totally honest and true cat people. Usually when new folks drop by, the Chelsea Grays head for the hills. With the Wards, they just sat there, made eye contact and started to purr. A couple of fascinating addenda. First this totally clueless, damned-by-faint-praise 1998 NYT \"review\" of Alan's book: Nature happens but gardens don't, and the pleasure of large illustrated garden books is greatly increased if you can adopt a Bourbon indifference to the matter of labor and gaze over your demesne, like Louis XIV while Versailles was still a construction site, without noticing the little people at work upon it. And, of course, the invariable convention of large illustrated garden books is to show completely uninhabited gardens, as if the camera were king and everyone had suddenly ducked out of its regal path. Three very different but worthwhile examples of this genre. Pathetically all about the reviewer with not an inkling of Alan's heart-grabbing vision of a \"poetic balance between architecture and landscape; they are inseparable.\" And now, for something completely different relevant, Boss Tweed's insightful take on how to fool most of the people most of the time: \"Stop them damned pictures,\" Mr. Tweed complained. \"I don't care so much what the papers say about me. My constituents can't read. But, damn it, they can see pictures!\" One of them is worth a thousand words. July 12, 2008 \"He could disagree but do it agreeably\" \"From our house to the White House, the People's Choice is now the President's Choice,\" we captioned this image of the late Tony Snow back in April 26, 2006, rejoicing that \"The host of The Tony Snow Show will now host Helen Thomas, David Gregory and the other strange bedfellows of the White House Press Corps at weekly briefings, the President will announce today. (Aljazeera file photo)\" \"The main thing about Tony Snow is that he had character,\" former boss Roger Ailes is telling Fox & Friends this morning as we mourn the loss of that incandescent light Ailes remembers as \"a simple guy, with all of his intellect ... but he was the epitomy of somebody who would say it's God, country and family.\" And from George H.W. Bush, another former employer: He was a kind man. He was a generous man who wanted to help others. He was just a good person. He could disagree but do it agreeably, and so I think we can all learn from this good man. Barbara Bush adds: He was loyal to the core, and to a mother, that means the world. He didn't have a mean bone in his body. In fond memory of this Renaissance man, full of humor and grace, we republish our post of April 26, 2006: \"That's another thing that's tremendous about Tony's becoming the White House Press Secretary,\" writes blogfriend Laura Lee Donaho, using a personal anecdote to reveal something important about \"Good Natured Tony Snow,\" who has officially answered the President's call: This person was talking to Tony [on his radio show] about the weapons of mass destruction that hadn't turned up in Iraq and explaining to him that while he had been stationed in Europe he had been on the V CORPS Headquarters staff and had seen a great deal of classified information that had convinced him that Saddam was a threat whether or not the WMD were ever found. Tony engaged him in conversation for quite some time, and as I listened I realized that it was my husband Tony was speaking to. . . . The man has spoken to so many Americans through his many broadcasts on the Fox News Channel and Radio Network. He understands our viewpoints and possesses similar opinions. He will represent us to the Bush administration and to the national media better than any elected official ever could. Aljazeera gives a fair and balanced report: The Washington Post said Snow decided to accept the job after top officials assured him that he would not be just a spokesman but an active participant in administration policy debates. The Post quoted sources as saying that Snow views himself as well-positioned to ease the tensions between the Bush White House and the press corps because he understands both politics and journalism. Snow has written and spoken frequently about the current president -- not always in a complimentary way. The Center for American Progress [a great place to meet up with all the usual suspects], a liberal think tank, has circulated unflattering observations by Snow about Bush. We agree with Michelle Malkin that \"He's exactly what the White House needs.\" Besides, Mr. Bush isn't afraid of a little constructive criticism. His choice of our beloved Tony is more proof, if it were needed, of the President's character -- not to mention his street smarts. Update: \"That there are already voices from the leftist sewer vilifying the man tells you everything you need to know about the left,\" writes Gaghdad Bob: Naturally they've had to shut off the comments at Huffington Post, so that we can't see just how depraved they are. They are not just evil, but gutless. Everyone knew Tim Russert was a liberal, but I didn't see a single conservative say an unkind word about him. I don't know why there aren't more people who are able to convey the joy, excitement, creativity, expansiveness, optimism, hope, compassion, decency, humor, spirituality, and love that animate conservatism. Maybe they just don't get it the way Snow did, and connect all the dots, both horizontal and vertical. Be sure to read the whole thing for a take that is both depressing and uplifting at the same time. Update: \"A class act all the way,\" avers Dr. Sanity. July 11, 2008 \"They have essentially reinvented themselves\" \"Leptin [computer-generated image of its structure by Vossman above] signals to the brain that the body has had enough to eat, or satiety,\" according to Wikipedia, which adds \"A very small group of humans possess homozygous mutations for the leptin gene which lead to a constant desire for food, resulting in severe obesity.\" A new study suggests it isn't just the obese but all of us who are driven by the leptin imperative. \"They have essentially reinvented themselves, and they are worthy of the utmost admiration and respect,\" says Michael Rosenbaum \u2014 lead author of a brain-scan study by scientists at Columbia University Medical Center published in the July issue of Journal of Clinical Investigation \u2014 re folks like us who have \"lost weight and kept it off.\" Melinda Beck of the WSJs Health Journal explains: So, you ate less and exercised more and lost weight. But now the pounds are piling back on. You're hungrier than ever, and you can't seem to resist food. Once again, it's all your fault, right? Wrong. Blame evolution, and the fact that for the vast majority of human history, famine was a bigger threat than flab. Even your seeming lack of will power is part of a complex biological system that drives humans who have lost weight to regain it ... \"Loosely put, after you've lost weight, you have more of an emotional response to food and less ability to control that response,\" says Michael Rosenbaum ... The key driver of this system is leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells. When humans (and rodents) lose 10% or more of their body weight, leptin falls rapidly and sets off a cascade of physiological changes that act to put weight back on. Skeletal muscles work more efficiently, thyroid and other hormones are reduced ... all so the body burns 15% to 20% fewer calories, enough to put back 25 pounds or more a year. \"It's only been in recent decades that this mechanism is contributing more to obesity than survival,\" writes Beck, quoting Rudolph Leibel, a co-author of the Columbia study who helped discover leptin in the 1990s at Rockefeller University: Now, anyone can summon an unlimited amount of food just with a cellphone. \"How do some people manage to overcome the leptin effect and keep weight off?\" ponders Beck: Generally by watching their food intake very carefully and continuing to increase their physical activity. \"Anybody who has lost weight and kept it off will tell you that they have to keep battling,\" says Dr. Rosenbaum. We don't know about increasing physical activity, as we've been walking about an hour a day through all the years of trim, tubby, trim, tubby, trim, tubby, obese and now normal BMI. But \"mindful eating\" is where it's at. As we wrote in the comments of Beck's \"Putting an End to Mindless Munching\" two months back: It's mind over matter, and it worked for me. Just under a year ago I jumped on the \"mindful eating\" bandwagon and started blogging about my experience in the The Cold Turkey Cookbook. It took about 5 or 6 months to lose 40 pounds, and I've never looked back. The key is to treat yourself to a host of small portions of delicious and colorful, sweet and savory dishes, including fruits, veggies, a mini muffin and a small bit of meat or fish. That and a little of the bubbly, as George Will asserts in \"Survival of the Sudsiest\": The development of civilization depended on urbanization, which depended on beer. To understand why, consult Steven Johnson's marvelous 2006 book, \"The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic \u2014 and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World.\" It is a great scientific detective story about how a horrific cholera outbreak was traced to a particular neighborhood pump for drinking water. And Johnson begins a mind-opening excursion into a related topic this way: \"The search for unpolluted drinking water is as old as civilization itself. As soon as there were mass human settlements, waterborne diseases like dysentery became a crucial population bottleneck. For much of human history, the solution to this chronic public-health issue was not purifying the water supply. The solution was to drink alcohol. \"Often the most pure fluid available was alcohol \u2014 in beer and, later, wine \u2014 which has antibacterial properties. Sure, alcohol has its hazards, but as Johnson breezily observes, \"Dying of cirrhosis of the liver in your forties was better than dying of dysentery in your twenties.\" Besides, alcohol, although it is a poison, and an addictive one, became, especially in beer, a driver of a species-strengthening selection process. We'll drink to that. July 10, 2008 Yard work Outside early morning inspecting the site of yesterday's dismantlings and excavations, the Chelsea Grays were drawn to the garden gate, lying dismembered across the lawn in a favorite spot of theirs near the English ivy. Each in turn took the high ground (Babe, above left) atop the curiously located structure to survey the scene and then retreat to lower ground (Tiny) for rest and relaxation. He caught wind of something cats smell that we don't, coming in on a river breeze from the south. Tiny, on medium alert with eyes mostly closed, kept a well-turned ear tuned in to sound cues upwind beyond the yard. When something stirred above the retaining wall behind the house, Baby pulled an about face while Tiny \u2014 pehaps unaware of whatever it was her brother had heard because of her location behind the sound barrier of the gate post \u2014 continued to maintain a low profile. Back inside, Tiny was not amused by the thank-you card we'd made for Ellen of Grove Street featuring Wheatland Terrier Barkely the Bighearted blending in with his surroundings at Ellen's elegant ladies' luncheon Wednesday. Neither was Tiny amused outside after dark on her tether yesterday when she had another run-in with a member of the local skunk community. Fortunately we had on hand the ingredients for an antidote, the \"Skunk odor remedy\" we'd linked in our post \"Whatever is once polluted by it, is for ever useless\" last March. Forget about tomato juice or products with names like \"Nature's Miracle Skunk Odor Remover.\" They don't work. Instead, try drenching your sweet little pussycat's muzzle, ruff and front legs with paper towels soaked in a mixture of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide and a little dishwashing liquid. The recipe calls for adding water, but we didn't bother. The straight sodium bicarbonate, H2O2 and Ultra Ivory Dish Liquid did the trick. It took a few hours for her silky fur to dry off and fluff back up, but the relief \u2014 for her smarting eyes and our nettled nose \u2014 was immediate. Note: Hydrogen peroxide could damage the eyes. Tiny naturally closed hers while we were washing her face, but be sure to avoid wiping the eyes directly, instead daubing away from them upwards, downwards and sideways. Happy cat, happy mother of cats. Update: \"Tiny is just odorless,\" remarks Tuck this afternoon. \"Amazing.\" Update II: Elisson links with a soulful portrait of his blue-eyed beauty, Hakuna. Update III: Lots more creaturely portraits at Modulator's Friday Ark #199. Update IV: Carnival of the Cats #226 joins with the 53rd Edition of the Bad Kitty Cats Festival of Chaos! for an all-cats-all-the-time supershow. July 09, 2008 \"We're not fat\" The day the Deere men came. It will be remembered with much joy and celebration in these parts. How many months \u2014 years? \u2014 has it been since we dreaded every flush and tried to space every washing of dishes and clothes for fear of evoking evil fluids and vapors out of the ancient failed concrete pipes that run just this side of the east wall of the basement, site of Tuck's shop? It only got worse with time. Recently it was unmentionable. We will say no more at this time but only Hallelujah for our salvation this day. Above Tuck chats with miracle worker Jimmie Caron at the controls of the totally awesome John Deere backhoe that delivered us from evil. Jimmie drove the backhoe up the east drive and set to work in the area beside the basement window at the southeast corner of the house. Above, the view from the front porch. Tuck had weeks ago removed bricks and set them aside on the east drive (just behind dirt pile) in preparation for their arrival. Unto us this day in the city of Chelsea came the brothers Caron, Jimmie (orange shirt) and Paul (blue shirt), the very embodiment of those hard-working Americans our facile politicians are forever evoking in tremulous tones. The Carons used to employ perhaps twelve workers, but, they told Tuck, they're down to just the two of them, having realized they were doing all the work while their employees were watching. Their earnest and steady devotion to the task at hand called to mind \"Christ Carrying the Cross\" by Hieronymus Bosch (right). They're so darned good that they're usually occupied with big-time, public-related works. Our good luck today in getting them to work on our project was someone else's bad luck in having had a major piece of equipment break down. Above the view over our border garden towards the front of the house, porch at right. Digging first with the backhoe and then by hand with shovels as they got down deeper, the Carons carefully spared our precious plants \u2014 day lilies above on the precipice of the black hole beyond, and even the weedy milkweeds we treasure as nursery and nectar bar to so many interesting insects and arachnids throughout the growing season. Speaking of watching men work, it was mesmerizing. The two brothers' having dug a grave-sized hole perhaps nine feet deep and the length and width of a casket, they ferreted out useless shards of the old, decrepit sewer pipe and laid in a shiny green PVC replacement (below just to right of Jimmie's head). Above Jimmie holds the water supply pipe they had installed years ago in his left hand while probing with shovel in his right for the remains of the sewer pipe. They came, they saw and they conquered. Filled up the big hole before they headed out. Above Jimmie checks out stream of stuff now freed up and flowing from the basement as Tuck, pretty in blue, looks on, ever at the ready to lend a hand. They'll finish up the details inside next time there's a rainy day. According to NOAA, all sun all the time for the next period of time. \"You sure work hard,\" we ventured, thanking the brothers for their awesome efforts and congratulating them for their ultimate success at the end of the day. Our contribution had been to flitter in and out with camera in hand as documentarian. \"We're not fat,\" answered Jimmie. \"You won't have to go to the gym today,\" quipped Tuck. July 08, 2008 Good neighbor policy Living off the fat of the land. A delightful Ladies Luncheon at Ellen of Grove Street's this afternoon. The house she lives in was rebuilt by her grandfather following the Great Chelsea Fire of 1908, and every room is a revelation of craftsmanly carpentry \u2014 a mixture of old and new \u2014 and personal touches. Here a note-card reproduction of a local artist's watercolor of her ancestral home. Above, the raised tin ceiling of her recently renovated kitchen lends a feeling of airiness, referencing ceilings of yore but in a fresh, up-to-the-minute iteration. Perfect host Barkely, lord of the manor, is a Wheatland Terrior par excellence. He tried to keep his kisses to himself but couldn't resist giving Tuck's hands a good washing under the table. Dueling salads, chicken and potato, with asparagus on the side, made for a coolly elegant menu on a muggy, muggy day. The chicken was based upon the Caf\u00e9 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum's signature dish studded with pistachios, cranberries and chunks of apricot. Deelish! Recently retired from a richly rewarding lifetime of teaching music to kids from K-4, Ellen regaled us with tales of soothing the savage breast of the young and restless. Her bottom line: You don't let them get away with being uncivilized. Obama and the appeasers could learn a thing or two from our friend's wise counsel. Her house was full of eye candy \u2014 everything seemed designed to complement our own white linen with mint green outfit, the same one we wore to the gallery opening two weeks back \u2014 and original paintings by her father and a famous relative who'd studied in Paris and limited-edition 19th-century lithographs. The dazzling centerpiece was fashioned of all things bright and beautiful from Ellen's own garden: Orange daylilies, pink and purple hydrangeas, delicate panicles of Coral Bells \"Palace Purple\" white flowers. Even the desserts came off the land, a delicious cobbler with raspberries picked that morning in her lower forty. She hadn't planted them herself, but the neighbor's Rubus strigosus preferred her sunny garden to his shady one and jumped the fence. She sent us home with a bagful. Raspberry soup, anyone? What a good dog. July 05, 2008 Caught with our pajama bottoms down If you're known by the company you keep, our own Betsy Ross Secret Soup (left) and Pajamas Media A-List blogger Roger Kimball (right) were caught with their pajama bottoms down this afternoon: Who's that hussy, left, pretty in black, drawing the viewer's eye away from our patriotic bowl of soup? A super-sized-me lingerie model for Catherine's Plus Sizes 16W - 34W, that's who. Same gal, together with a colleague, pretty in white, who's making our head spin as Roger Kimball's dapper image goes head-to-torso with the kind of thing that used to be hidden away in our day in the back pages of movie and women's magazines. Beyond the visual shock, shock, was the humorous disjunct between blogger's and advertiser's copy. Take our own post, for starters, where we interspersed excerpts from the Declaration with anectodal reportage of our festive Fourth-of-July family gathering down east. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\" vies with \"Buy one, get one 50% off. 18 Hour Comfort Strap bra: A favorite for the comfort it delivers.\" But come to think of it, isn't that what the Founding Fathers were after? \"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\" however defined by the individual. Not to mention that the business of America is business. We say, bring 'em on! Then there are Roger Kimball's cogitations on the undermining of American identity under fire from the cacophonous chorus of the cacodemons of pc and so-called multiculturalism \u2014 \"really a form of mono-cultural animus directed against the dominant culture\": These various agents of dissolution are also elements in a wider culture war: the contest to define how we live and what counts as the good in the good life. Anti-Americanism occupies such a prominent place on the agenda of the culture wars precisely because the traditional values of American identity \u2014 articulated by the Founders and grounded in a commitment to individual liberty and public virtue \u2014 are deeply at odds with the radical, de-civilizing tenets of the \"multiculturalist\" enterprise. Public virtue? When it comes to those Catherine's ads, the jury's still out, but if you're taking talking individual liberties, they're downright uplifting. Update: Is that a Freudian slip bra?\" asks Dr. Sanity in the latest Carnival of the Insanities, now open for business. Update II: Is nothing sacred? Roger himself gets upstaged by the larger, lovelier \"comfort strap bra\" woman: sophisticated voice of the Zabar's Zeitgeist.\" Update III: A pretty girl may be like a melody, but that ubiquitous plus-size model is to our eyes like unwelcome elevator Musak to our ears: Gentlemen. There are ladies present. July 04, 2008 \"Let Facts be submitted to a candid world\" \"Perhaps nowhere was patriotism so downplayed or deplored than among intellectuals in the Western democracies in the two decades after the horrors of the First World War,\" writes Thomas Sowell, noting that \"Our media are busy verbally transforming American combat troops from heroes into victims, just as the French intelligentsia did \u2014 with the added twist of calling this 'supporting the troops.'\" Tiny, above atop the Independence Day groaning board down east this afternoon, is not amused. \"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \"It's the best dish you've ever made,\" declares Tuck re Betsy Ross's Secret Soup, the latest entry in our Cold Turkey Cookbook, debuted at family Fourth of July festivities down east at Goomp's this afternoon. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Cool and breezy, a combo of Silky Cauliflower Soup, Roasted Beet Soup and sour cream. We'd been thinking of using red and blue food coloring for an all-cauliflower concoction, but thanks to our sis we bumped it up a notch. \"What if you used pur\u00e9ed beets for the red part? Borscht Belt. Color, unless it's a different taste sensation, is just color. Maybe put some tiny dollops of sour cream on as stars for Old Glory.\" Which we did, to elegant effect. But when it came to blue, the blueberry soup we tried didn't make the grade. Color was muddy and too red, so we colored a bit of the cauliflower soup for the field of blue. \"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. The usual beauty in unexpected places showed up in the sink, where a container of water-diluted beet soup with blue cover and pale yellow pastry decorating tube caught the light fantastic filtering through the red oaks outside the kitchen windows. \"That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Goomp frames the view from the terrace, where boats large and small, under power, sail and paddle, ply the mouth of the York Harbor River. \"The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.

This really sounds a lot like my GearSync proposal, but using Atom instead of Microsoft's FeedSync protocol (which I still haven't seen anyone using). The big difference from Gears appears to be the transparent model of data access. There's a detailed paper here. Posted by Adam MacBeth at 12:57 PM 1 comments Monday, July 21, 2008 The MobileMe Lockdown I love my new iPhone 3G. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best mobile device that's ever been built. But like many people, I'm torn - the iPhone isn't an open device and there a few things that are difficult or impossible to do as a result. With my BlackBerry I simply installed the free Google Sync program in order to keep my calendar up to date over-the-air. Now with the iPhone, Exchange support works great, but if I want to do OTA sync thing without an Exchange server, I need to pay Apple $99/year for their MobileMe service. This feels like extortion, especially given that there can't be any alternative given Apple's prohibition against background apps. Not only are other companies disallowed from building an app like MobileMe, Apple IS building such an app and charging users for it. For companies that provide seamless, real-time sync and upload like Ontela and Dashwire, this is a non-starter - they will probably never build apps to run on the iPhone. Sync providers such as Funambol have built manual-sync apps, but it's a stretch to say this is sync. The only real-time messaging on the iPhone is Apple's push mail and SMS, so IM apps are pretty much out of the question (though if you don't care about incoming messages, there are a number of options such as browser-based Google Talk.) More important than the companies being locked out are the users who can't get access to their data. With MobileMe, for my $99, I get web-mobile-PC sync with a whole new set of applications to use, plus 20 GB of free online storage. The only problem is that I don't want new applications. I use Flickr, GMail, Facebook, Google Calendar, and other services whose data I want to access on my iPhone. With web access and SDK-based apps I can access this data through site-specific portals, but this isn't the same as syncing this data into the core apps on the phone. I can always fall back to cable-sync, but that's truly a step backwards. Apple has never used \"compatible\" or \"open\" rhetoric like Microsoft or Google, choosing instead to provide the end-to-end solution that \"works\". In this case, it's hard to see how MobileMe works for most people when it's not open enough to pull in data from my existing sources. In the PC era, MobileMe might have been good enough, but today it just feels like an anachronism. Posted by Adam MacBeth at 8:11 AM 0 comments Tuesday, July 15, 2008 Is Android the Next OS/2? Amid news that Apple sold over 1 million iPhone 3G over the weekend I just read that Android developers are miffed about the lack of an SDK update. Not only that, but it's not clear at this point when a device will actually ship with Android software. I've mentioned in the past how the SDK was initially unpolished but I really thought it would improve pretty quickly with frequent updates. Aside from a demo at Google I/O, there's little indication of when the first Android device will ship. Unlike the iPhone which had firm ship dates announced and developers (web and SDK) clamoring to build apps before the hardware came out, Android is in a very different situation. I don't know any mobile application companies that are building Android apps at this point, and I don't think they will until there are some firm announcements on real hardware. The Android Developer Challenge is full of hobbyists and desperate startups, not real companies looking to deploy their apps on an innovative platform. Don't get me wrong, I would much rather program to Android's Java APIs and use some of its great features than have to deal programming Objective-C to get my app on the iPhone, but hey, the iPhone is rad and shipping now. Without shipping hardware Android is starting to look like the next OS/2 - a lot of hype and little to show for it. Posted by Adam MacBeth at 8:45 PM 0 comments Monday, June 30, 2008 Facebook Will Never Delete Your Photos ...even if you tell them to. Really. This presentation about Facebook's photo storage architecture details how deletes are performed by only deleting the metadata. James Hamilton has a good summary of the details here. None of this should be too surprising if you know anything about consistency issues in distributed systems, but it's kinda funny to think about. For Facebook, it's way more trouble than it's worth in terms of protocol complexity to recover that space, and few people delete photos, so there's not much to gain anyway. No one should be able to access these files anymore, because without the metadata, there's no way to find the photos. But the data is still there. Those incriminating pictures that you thought you'd deleted could still be subpoenaed, though it would probably take Facebook a long time to find your deleted photos in those 500+ TB without an index... Posted by Adam MacBeth at 7:45 PM 0 comments Sunday, June 15, 2008 Upcoming Gears Features Chris Prince discusses some of the upcoming features in Gears in this Google I/O video. As I discussed previously, Gears and BrowserPlus are both adding new features to the browser. The newest set of features discussed for Gears includes desktop notifications, a file chooser API, geolocation, resumable HTTP upload, and data blob support. Of these APIs, I'm most excited about notifications and geolocation (especially for mobile), but there's a lot to like here. At this point these features are in the prototype phase, so the source code may already be available in svn, but you won't be able to use them in your app quite yet. You can follow the Gears engineering efforts on the Gears Engineering Group. If you're especially interested in Gears, there are a few other Google I/O videos here, including one on standards and mobile. Posted by Adam MacBeth at 10:18 AM 0 comments Friday, May 30, 2008 Aggregation and Annotation in the Social Web A big theme on the web over the last year or so has been aggregation. RSS readers (aggregators) have been around for a while, but the latest theme is aggregating your digital life. FriendFeed is getting a similar level of buzz as Twitter, but socialthing, profilactic, Plaxo, iminta, and of course Facebook all have some similar vibes. I co-founded a company last year called MergeLab that ended up working in a similar space. These so-called \"digital lifestyle aggregators\" have been around in some form or another for a while, but none of them really seemed to catch on until now. The core idea here is that given the large number of web sites and services that people use, it's getting harder to keep track of all of this information, whether it's your personal information or that of your friends. At MergeLab, we called this \"Open Facebook\", since we allowed you to add data from Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, etc. and view it in one location, though we were really referring to just the newsfeed part of Facebook. Facebook itself is moving in this direction with the ability to connect with other sites that publish information about your friends into your newsfeed. Unlike FriendFeed, MergeLab didn't require people to approve you as a friend - if you had access to some publicly available feeds, you could just subscribe to them. This meant that it didn't have the same viral characteristic as FriendFeed, but it did allow you to pay attention to, say, your mom's feed without having to convince her to subscribe to some new-fangled aggregation service. Some people claim that FriendFeed isn't about aggregation, but is about the conversations you can have about all of these activities from your people. Facebook has had some similar features for a while, though I think if you're into following the whole conversation, FriendFeed has a much cleaner model (ever tried following a thread of Facebook by jumping back and forth between wall posts?). Interestingly, Facebook's \"new\" layout puts the profile view front and center, but right now it appears to just include your personal feed items. Now, you might ask why we don't just use RSS here, after all, this is essentially the problem it was designed to solve. I think there are are few reasons. Many sites don't want you to take your data with you to other sites as they see this as their crown jewels. Certainly this is true with Facebook as we've seen in their tizzy with Google over Friend Connect, though there's also Facebook Connect, which purportedly is all about data portablility. A lot of these services don't expose RSS, either because their data is too \"complicated\" to be expressed in RSS, or they're just interested in trying to build a dependence on their API. RSS is essentially one-way. Sure, you can use Atom or POST RSS in some cases, but it's not a widely deployed use like simple syndication is. So is it possible to have neutral parties implement aggregation services? It seems that the natural tendency for these services is to add value through annotation, sharing, and the like to increase stickiness and hopefully make money. Google Reader is doing this, for quite a large user benefit I believe. However, once the point of aggregation becomes a point of stickiness it also becomes a point of control and thus another potential constriction of the free flow of a user's data. So far very few companies have made any money on aggregation (RSS or social) so it will be interesting to see how this plays out. FriendFeed and Twitter don't appear to have any revenue yet and Facebook is making money, but very little in proportion to its valuation. Posted by Adam MacBeth at 3:30 PM 1 comments Wednesday, May 28, 2008 Yahoo's BrowserPlus versus Google Gears Yahoo today unveiled a \"Sneak Peek\" of its core browser functionality extension called BrowserPlus. Meanwhile a similar effort, Google Gears, was renamed to just \"Gears\". BrowserPlus is described as \"desktop capabilities\" for web apps, all of which are exposed through Javascript APIs. The core services in BrowserPlus include some things that are really essential for bringing web apps to the desktop and a few that don't make much sense. DragAndDrop adds support for drag and drop between the browser and the desktop. Pretty cool. Notify displays notifications (toasts) using native window controls. This is very useful and relies on the Snarl (Windows) or Growl (Mac) notifiers being installed already. Snarl is a funny choice here since theoretically it's Growl's counterpart on Windows, but doesn't really have any applications using it as far as I can tell. RubyInterpreter allows you to write services in Ruby. Haven't tried this out, but it sounds like something you'll be able to do soon with Microsoft's Silverlight + DLR + IronRuby. TextToSpeech is novel but inessential. Look for more desktop-only features like this to be added in the future. There's also a FlickrUploader and IRCClient which don't seem like core services as much as one-offs. A number of other utilities are included such as Log, ImageAlter, and FileBrowser. JSONRequest is the one piece of functionality that doesn't really have much to do with the desktop, but is useful for writing browser-based applications. I'm sure Douglas Crockford is to thank for this. JSONRequest allows to you avoid the problems of the Same Origin Policy without exposing you to the security issues of workarounds such as JSONP. I tried out some of the BrowserPlus demos and they seemed to work. I did see my browser (Firefox 3 RC1) crash a few times in random contexts, so watch out. On the Google side of the fence, Gears was originally focused on offline (Database + LocalServer) support, but has recently added some desktop functionality - the ability for a browser application to add icons to the desktop. Surprisingly, there is very little overlap between BrowserPlus and Gears with the exception of local storage where Gears offers a more complete solution than BrowserPlus' PStore. The one feature I haven't mentioned so far is Gears' WorkerPool which allows Javascript code to run in the background. This really just means there's now a thread pool in the browser that allows you to queue up tasks. This isn't the same sort of \"background\" that comes to mind for me, like Apple's lack of background support in the iPhone SDK, but it still seems pretty useful. There are a lot of security implications to having true Javascript background applications in the sense I'm talking about, but I'm sure we'll see this in Gears or BrowserPlus sometime soon. With this feature enabled, there's little reason to use any other desktop app model - combined with the Notify feature described above, you can build a traditional IM application (one of the few desktop apps I still use). Overall this space is looking pretty exciting. Adobe AIR is taking web applications onto the desktop, while Gears and BrowserPlus are melding the browser and the desktop and generally making the browser a better development environment. I don't think it will be long before all application code (for the desktop, anyway) is written in Javascript!

In any event, the slowdown that seemed to be beginning at that point isn't in evidence this week either. Sales of single-family detached homes in Maricopa County were at 4,478 for the past 30 days, slightly higher than the 30-day rolling total from a week ago. And inventory in the Phoenix real estate market was down be literally a handful of homes, for an overall absorption rate of 8.26 months. Bank owned homes continue to move at a brisk pace. Inventory of REO properties in Maricopa County actually fell slightly to 5,491 while there were 1,622 closed sales over the past 30 days. The result is a brisk absorption rate of 3.39 months. There are three sellers' markets in the Valley based on the most recent numbers - Queen Creek at 4.65 months of inventory and Tempe and Ahwatukee each at 5.00 months on the nose. The latter two cities are of note because neither is a hotbed of bank-owned sales. In fact, Tempe's showing only 29 REO listings out of 540 homes for sale and only 12 of the 92 sales were of bank owned homes. Below are the full numbers for the week, minus the typo from a week ago when I failed to update the previous week's numbers. As always, all data is provided by the Arizona Regional MLS and is deemed reliable but not guaranteed.

If you believe the best value you can find is a short sale (and it's probably not, but that's a different story for another day), and your agent refuses to show you short sales, why are you working with that agent? If you have time to look at homes on a Sunday and you want to look at homes on Sunday, why are you working with an agent who doesn't work on Sunday? (Actual quote - \"My REALTOR doesn't work Sundays so I don't want to call and bother him, but I want to see this house so I called you.\") If you're working with an agent to find a home in a given area, why are you using the search on another agent's site to find a home? Put another way, why aren't you searching on your agent's website instead of mine if you already have decide they'll be assisting you? And if they don't have a useful homes search on their website and can't meet your needs, why are you working with them? This last one came up twice yesterday ... anyone who wants to do is welcome to use the Phoenix Homes search here. But I do sell real estate for a living, as some of you may have come to realize.

Technorati Tags: Phoenix real estate Popularity: 4% [?] Share This Tags: General Real Estate, Marketing // 1 Comment \u00bb Simplifying the Phoenix Real Estate Search Posted on August 9th, 2008 by Jonathan Dalton Let's talk about a great new feature that has been added to the Phoenix MLS since the change to flexmls from Tempo, the kind of thing that can save you hours of sorting through listings from everywhere when you want to focus on a certain area. Last week I had a client ask about the Montage Condominiums in northeast Phoenix, right next to the Scottsdale border near the Princess resort. Options were few for townhouses in this particular complex. But thanks to the new MLS, I could take the MLS number for any one of the properties in Montage and search within the radius of our choice for other similar townhouses. This far surpasses the methodology available in the old Arizona Regional MLS, where a similar search would be conducted by searching for a given elementary school or by the clunky and largely random \"areas\" as defined in 1734 by the original mapmaker. Think this is cool? Wait ... don't answer yet! Once the search is established, I can set up what flexmls calls a \"portal\" ... an individual website that will show you all of the listings that match your criteria and fall within the blue circle. We had this in the old MLS but the upper limit was 75 properties. Now? There is no limit.

Turn on your radio and turn to a talk or news program. Find a story or topic and listen to about five minutes on that topic. Now turn off the radio. For the next minute (you can time yourself using the car clock) talk out loud on the topic. Try to recall as many facts and details as you can while weaving your words into a cohesive and coherent oratory. This exercise will: Challenge your listening skills Test your recall Force you to think dynamically Practice \"buying yourself time\" when speaking to link your thoughts together Encourage thinking \"one sentence ahead\" Taking advantage of opportunities to push yourself out of your comfort zone as a speaker is the only true way to grow and develop. Give it a try...you may surprise yourself.

Despite promises of government support and securing of a financial backer, today it closed its doors at 5pm. TV Tonight understands a number of staff have been resigning in recent weeks, leaving the place dangerously under-manned. ... Sources say none of the independent program producers, who comprise the bulk of production, were informed ahead of time. Oddly, though, despite the goodbye message currently being broadcast, the Access 31 website still makes it look like they're open for business.

In my past writing on the Tyranny of Digital Distance I've looked at the way shows like Battlestar Galactica have harnessed a global fan network only to have that network turn sour as national media distributors insist on broadcasting shows at different times (implicitly encouraging fans to participate in peer-to-peer downloading of TV). While Joss Whedon's Dr Horrible had a few similar teething issues, it looks like a very promising model for web-based media that can actually be a fan favourite and make a decent profit in the process. My thinking on this very much in process (as, indeed, is the ongoing story of Dr Horrible's success), but my first stab at drawing a few ideas together was in this paper. I didn't get a chance to record my talk, but I've uploaded the presentation onto Slideshare if you're interested. There's a fair bit not on the slides, but they should give you at least an outline of the argument: Any questions, feedback or criticism would be most welcome!

First, the balanced and detailed Privacy Act, 1998 (Cth) (as amended and consolidated) is an excellent starting point for any legislative development of Irish privacy law. The range and detail of its coverage, and its focus on protecting against invasions of privacy across the board, and not merely by media, make it a far more compelling protection of privacy than the flawed Irish Bill. Second, that Act created a strong and independent Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Australia, similar to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (see also Michael Geists's privacyinfo.ca site); and an important lesson which these offices teach us is that it the proper protection of privacy in modern society requires just such an office. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is a good starting point, but its remit is far less extensive than its Australian and Canadian cousins. And third, the Australian Law Reform Commission has just completed a two-year assessment of the operation of the Act. Its report For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice (ALRC 108), was launched last week by the Attorney General. The three-volume, 2700 page report is the culmination of a prodigious research and consultation exercise: an Issues Paper in late 2006 led to the formal commencement of the review in January 2007 and Discussion Paper later that year (noted here by TJ). Though there are gaps in its analysis, the final report recommends nearly 300 changes to privacy laws and practices, including: a basic restructuring of the Act, focused on high-level principles of general application, to be supplemented by dedicated regulations governing specific fields, such as health privacy and credit reporting; a uniform set of Privacy Principles, developed in the report, to be embodied in the Act, and to apply to all government agencies and the private sector; a rationalisation of exemptions and exceptions from the Act, which only should be permitted where there is a compelling reason; a duty on government agencies and business organisations to notify individuals \u2014 and the Privacy Commissioner \u2014 where there is a real risk of serious harm occurring as a result of a data breach (a matter much in the news nowadays, as this week's story of the theft of a Department of Social Welfare laptop shows); and a cause of action for a serious invasion of privacy, in circumstances where the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy and where the publication was grossly offensive. The ALRC's recommended formulation sets a high bar for plaintiffs, having due regard to the importance of freedom of expression and other rights and interests. It is unlikely that this report will be left to gather dust, as so many of its predecessors the world over have been, as the Australian Government has undertaken to review the ALRC's recommendations in two phases over the next 12 to 18 months, and to legislate on each of these as necessary. The Irish Bill really only covers this last point (as difficult a line to draw, and as contentious, controversial, and overstated a proposal, in Australia as it is in Ireland), and then in a far less balanced fashion. If we are to have a Privacy Act in Ireland, then why can we not follow the Australian example? By all means, then, let there be an Irish Privacy Act; but let it be balanced, let it be the result of a proper consultation process, and let there be a Privacy Commissioner with teeth.

Yes, Minister Posted by: Eoin in Irish Society, Universities Whenever I hear discussions of the funding of universities, my thoughts turn first to a classic Yes Minister (BBC | imdb | wikipedia) episode (imdb | synopsis | wikipedia | YouTube) in which the worthies in Sir Humphrey's Oxford College lobby him against the pernicious effects of government funding policies. Much of that sketch is relevant to the current debate in Ireland about third-level tuition fees ( Irish Times | RT\u00c9 News), where it seems to me that two separate issues have been conflated (or confused) in some quarters. Moreover, one of these issues needs to be resolved before any of the other elements of the current debate can be properly addressed. In 1996, when the Government \"abolished\" third-level fees, what actually happened was a little more complicated. Before that, the Government set a basic fee for each Irish (and EU) student; it paid about two-thirds of that basic fee; and it required the student to pay the remaining third. In 1996, the Government decided no longer to require the student to pay even that amount. If the \"return\" of third-level fees is simply a matter of cost-cutting on the part of the Government, then it will simply require the student once again to pay some portion of the basic fee. And this seems to me to be where most of the debate is being conducted. However, the Minister for Education has said that, although the current economic climate is a reason to examine the re-introduction of fees, the main justification being put forward at present is a different one. It is that the current funding to the university sector is inadequate, a point that has long been made by the university sector. But the main cause of this situation is that the basic fee is too low. This can be seen quite clearly in the difference between the basic fee currently set by the Government for Irish (and EU) students and the fee charged by the universities to international (ie, non-EU) students. The international fee is about three times higher than the Government-set basic fee. In other words, when Irish students were paying fees, they were paying a sum about one-ninth of what international students were paying. Now, one way to remedy the inadequacy of the basic fee would simply be for the government to increase it. Of course, that won't happen: even when the exchequer was in good shape, the government was reducing that fee in real terms. To meet the third level funding inadequacies, the government will need to do more than re-introduce fees: it will need also to allow the universities set the fees. If it does not do that, if the government simply re-introduces the pre-1996 position, then there will be no change to the universities' fee income. If the fee payable by the student continues to be the amount set by the government, the fee income received by the universities will remain inadequate, and all that will change is the source (students [at least in part], rather than government) of that inadequate income. So, when the Irish Universities Association (following the OECD's 2004 recommendation) call for the re-introduction of student fees and welcome ( Irish Times | IUA press release) the Minister's statement), they must be asking for two things. First, they want to be able to set the basic fee charged to students; that is to say, the universities want to be able to set the fee for Irish (and EU) students themselves, rather than having to accept the fee set by the Government (though they may settle for the government continuing to set it, provided that they can be involved in the process by which it is calculated and that the process does indeed result in a more adequate fee structure). And second, since this university-set fee is likely to be (much) higher than the current government-set fee, and since they accept that the government will not pay (all of) this higher fee, the universities want to be able to charge the students this higher fee. If the government is simply concerned with reducing its payments to the universities, and if political calculations allow, then it will simply revert to some version of the pre-1995 position. However, if it is concerned with ensuring that the university sector is adequately funded, it will allow the universities a role in the setting of the fees charged to students. It is only after this basic decision of principle is taken that the issues currently being discussed (how much of the basic fee should be paid by the government and how much by the student; who should and who should not pay; what mechanism of ex post or ex ante payment should be used; whether and how student loans and/or graduate taxes might be part of the package; and so on) can be properly assessed. Moreover, the issue of student fees is not the full solution to the universities' funding problems; it is only one element of a much more broad-ranging approach to the future funding of the Irish University Sector (see, for example, the CHIU 2003 report, pdf, and the RIA 2005 Report Cumhacht Feasa). For all of these reasons, therefore, the question of the return of fees should not be conflated with the much larger questions of adequate funding for the university sector. Finally, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, in a blog-post welcoming the Minister's initiative, express his ... admiration for the Minister for having the courage to raise an issue which, as a country, we really do need to address.

The Hollywood heart attack ... involves dramatic chest clutching and collapse. But in reality, symptoms vary. They can be woolly, ambiguous and easy to ignore. It is very common to have a central chest pain that can spread to the arms, neck and jaw. You may feel sweaty, light-headed, sick or short of breath. You may simply feel a dull ache, mild discomfort or heavy sensation in your chest that makes you feel ill. Or there may be a chest pain that spreads to your back or stomach.

Filed under media, regulation June 11th, 2008 NBA Referee Rigging Scandal Explodes Explosive allegations by an ex-referee rocked the NBA today in the midst of an NBA championship series designed to reinvigorate the league. Tim Donaghy claimed that the NBA routinely encouraged refs to call bogus fouls to manipulate results as well as asking them to withhold technical fouls on marquis players to increase ratings. Quite an interesting development given the league's historical opposition to sports betting on the grounds that it is a corrupting influence on the sport. For example, the International Herald Tribune wrote recently about David Stern's opposition to awarding Las Vegas an NBA franchise due to sports betting activity in that city: David Stern, the NBA commissioner, has made \"integrity of the game\" his battle cry and says that local gambling on the league, though regulated, would violate that tenet. He maintains that casinos must take all NBA games off their oddsmakers' books before Las Vegas could be a viable site. This would seem extremely hypocritical should Donaghy's allegations turn out to be truthful. Let's hope that the true story eventually comes out. In the meanwhile, here is an interesting interview with Professional NBA sports bettor Haralabos Voulgaris on his thoughts regarding this brewing scandal. A key quote: The Donaghy scandal basically made me question whether or not I wanted to continue betting the sport. For one, after the details emerged I have heard from several people who knew about the games while this was going on. This could get ugly.
