Great products, however, are not the whole story -- society expects companies to act responsibly in their pur suit of success. If anything, the fact that our business is about human health makes it even more important that we operate to the highest standards. Corporate responsibility is not just a j ob for selected people at GSK, it defines the way we do busines s. Our ten corpor ate responsibility principles set the standard for everyone, since responsible business is only a reality if it is practised by all employees at all times. In this report we show our progress against eac h principle. We are reporting signif icant achievem ents in 2004. GSK is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the essential ar ea of improving acces s to medicines in the developing world. Fo r example, this year we tripled shipments of our pr eferentially-priced Combivir tablets to help allev iate HIV/AIDS in the developing world. Over 80% of these went to Africa, and we also granted five more voluntary licenc es to African companies to produce HIV treatments locally . We are proud of our commitment to comm unities around the wo rld. Our tota l community investment in 2004 wa s \u00a3328 m illion ($600 million). This inclu des our donatio n of 67 million tablets to s upport the elimin ation of lymphatic filariasis, a debilitating disease that threatens one bil lion people in the developing world. Respons ible business practices are also the key to a good reputation. In 2004, the pharmaceutical industry and GSK continued to come under public scrutiny on how medicines are developed, tested and marketed. To meet this challenge we must act with integrit y and be open about our approach to these important issues. We took an important step this year with the launch of our Clinical Trial Register, pr oviding public access to our product information. We also want to make information on our corporate responsibility performance more widely available. The transition of the 2004 report to the internet, and the integration of our environm ental, health and safety in formation, means this information is now accessible by more of our stakeholders. We invite you to read this report for more information on all our corporate responsibility principles, and we welcome y our comments and suggestions.

We will provide a safe and healthy working env ironment, support employees to perform to their full potential and take responsibility for the performance and reputation of the business. To learn more on employment practices visit our website GSK employs 100,000 people in 116 countries. The succes s of our business depends on us getting the best from our people. We do this by creating a positive work ing environment, offering competitive reward packages that emphasise perfo rmance, providing opportunities for training and advancement, and by lis tening and responding to employees' feedback. We expect employees to meet high standar ds in the way they carry out their work for GSK. The GSK Spirit d efines our culture and the principles we expect employees to work by. These are: performance with integ rity entrepreneurial spirit focus on innovation a sense of urgency passion for achievement Regular performance appraisals a ssess whether employees have upheld these principles and the requirements of our Code of Conduct in their work. The results affect bonuses and career pr ogression. See Standards of Ethical Conduct in the website for more in formation on our Code of Conduct. This section explains our approach and performance in 2004. It covers: the results of our 2004 Global Leader ship survey assessing employ ee satisfaction and the developm ent of GSK's culture our programmes to recruit and retain a diverse workforce employee development and performance appraisals how we communicate with employees and get their feedback our health, safety and wellbeing programmes www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 6Case stu dy Improving Ergonomics at ou r Bar nard Castle Site The new is olator is one of 80 ergonomic improvement projects at B arnard Castle We have taken several initiatives to reduce ergonomic ris ks at our B arnard Castle site in northern E ngland in 2004. The site won first place for safety in our 2004 internal Environment, Health and Safety awards for excellence. The Ergonomic Improvement Team (EIT ) was formed at the site i n 2001 to combat increasing lost time illnes ses and injuries related to musculoskeletal disorders such as repetitive strain injury. It i ncludes 13 employees from a range of different departments across the site. Ergonomic s are considered in the desi gn of new equipment - we conduct risk assessments and discomfort surveys, and consult trained local ergonomic experts. We encourage employees to be aware of ergonomics and have seen a 160% increase in ergonomic hazards repor ted. The EIT has produced two ergonomic s manuals for employees, an awareness training packa ge and completed 80 improvement projects in a three year period (2002-2004) including the ones described below. Warehouse employees operating very narro w aisle (VNA) hi-racker trucks complained of sore ba cks and wrists. T he tru cks were more than te n years old, so we decided to buy a new fleet at a total cost of \u00a3347,000 ($635,000), primarily to improve operat or co mfort. The trucks hav e better controls that require les s effort to manoeuvre, have more headroom to allow drivers to si t or stand comfortably, and fully adjustable seats designed to provide good back support. They are also more effi cient and use less energy to operate. We consulted employ ees when purchasing and installing a new is olator (to be used for the biological testing of produc ts) in order to i dentify and minimise ergonomic risks. Responding to their co mments, we modified the design of the isolator to minimise the am ount of bending, twisting and stretching necessary to operate it. In 2003, the site achie ved its best ev er EHS performance, with 3.4 million hours worked without a lost time i njury or illn ess. The model developed at Bar nard Castle is being ro lled out across other GSK Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 7Employment 2.1 Global Leadership Survey 2004 The sustainability of our success as a business rests significantly o n intangibles such as the quality of our leadersh ip, our culture and our ability to develop talented people. Regular employ ee surveys help us to monitor the evolution of GSK's culture and over all employee satisfaction with the Company. The results are used to a ssess the effectiveness of our people management practices and identif y areas for improvement. In 2004 we conducted our second Global Leadership Survey of GSK managers. The survey was completed by over 9,500 managers in all countries where GSK operates (an 83% response ra te). It tracked their views against our first survey in 2002 and against findi ngs from other global companies such as IBM and Microsoft. Key Survey Findings The responses were generally m ore positive than in 2002. There was a signific ant improvement in the number of positive responses to 29 out of 31 core questions and, overall, responses were on average 4 points higher than two years ago. Areas that received high scores incl uded business ethics, with 92% of managers reporting that they underst and how the GSK Code of Co nduct applies to their job respons ibilities, pride in the company and clarity about how their role is aligned wit h GSK's wider strategy and mission. For example: % 2004 % 2002 People in my department show commitment to performance with integrity 91 88 I can see a clear link between my work and the company's objectives 87 85 The people I work with cooper ate to get the job done 87 82 I am proud to be part of GSK 83 78 Strategies in my department s upport the pursuit of the GSK mission 85 81 People in my department ar e committed and enabled to make meaningful cont ributions 82 76 I feel encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things 77 74 I can report unethical practices without fear of reprisal 76 70 I would gladly refer a good friend or family member to GSK for employment 78 72 The survey also produced clear messages about areas for improvement. Quite a few managers expressed c oncerns about workload and als o frustrations about not being able to do their best work . The areas that received lower score s still showed improv ement over 2002 and include d: www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 8 % 2004 % 2002 The amount of work I am expec ted to do is about right 45 42 GSK is a company where great p eople can do their best work 52 46 When choices have to be made, my manager usually places quality over other business obj ectives (deadlines, budget, etc.) 54 48 How satisfied are you with the recognition you receive for doing a good job? 57 56 Sufficient effort is made to get the opinions and thinking of people who work here 59 51 Leaders in my department act as teachers, coaches, and champions of development 59 54 I receive ongoing feedback that helps me improve my performance 61 57 Comparisons With Other Companies Respons es to many of the survey questions can be compared with those given by employees of other compani es through a cross-company database. This includ es responses from ar ound three million employees in 1 39 countries. GSK scored highly compared to other companies in several areas. These include: My manager effectively communicates GSK goals and objectives I can report unethical practice s without fear of reprisal I have the authority to make decisions that improve the quality of my work We scored below average in other areas, including: The amount of work I am ex pected to do is about right When choices have to be made, my manager usually places qualit y above other business objectives It is important to understand the context of this second finding. This is a business where exceptionally high quality standards are built in at every level. Analys is of the response with employees indicated that their concern was related to hitting deadlines, rather than quality per se. Improvement Plans The survey findings have been reviewed by GSK's Cor porate Exe cutive Team and our business unit s are developing plans to deliver improvements in key areas. For example, additional ethics training is planned for parts of the business that scored lower than the GSK average on business ethics questions. Other business units are looking at ways to improve the effectiveness of their employee development, coaching and feedback systems. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 9Employment 2.2 Diversity To learn more about diversity visit our website GSK is committed to employing a divers e workforce in an environment where all employ ees are treated with respect and dignity. Diversity benefits our business. A wo rkforce with diverse backgrounds, cultures and outlooks helps us to under stand the needs of different patients and customers. Only by delivering genuine equality of opportunity can we be sure that w e have the best people in t he right jobs doing their best work for GSK. We have a range of initiatives to ensure we meet our di versity commitments. We also monitor and report data on gender diversity by management grade worldwide and on ethnicity in the UK and US. Activity and Performance in 2004 Disab ility Review We conducted a comprehensiv e Disability Review in the UK during 2004 to make sure GSK is meeting the needs of disabled employees and visitors. The Revie w covered accessib ility of our UK locations, the GSK we b and intranet sites and an audit of our employment policies. During the Review we consulted wit h employee focus groups and external organisations, including the Royal Nati onal Institute for the Blind and the Employers Forum on Disability. We carried out 21 audits to assess acce ss to our sites a nd offices. They identified physical changes needed to im prove access, which are now being implement ed. We also provided training to our front of house employees so they know how to assist dis abled visitors when necessary. Our internet site was also assess ed and we are making improvements to ensure it is compatible wit h brows ers used by visually -impaired people. All job applications to GSK must now be made over the internet, so it is particularly important that the site is fully accessibl e and that help is readily available for disabled applicants. We have also provided training for employees working in human resources, to make sure that disabled candidat es receive equal cons ideration in our recruitment processes. GSK received the UK Government's Two Ticks accreditation for its commitment to employing disabled people. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 10Gender Diversity Women in management Grades Female % Male % Total A&B Bands 139 19% omen in management increased incrementally this year; however women remain under represented in senior grades. We will continue to focus on ways of ensuring wom en hav e genuine equality of opportunity in GSK. We held our first Women in Science event in the UK in May 2004, enabling female science graduates to give feedba ck on how GSK could attract more women scientists. Women in Science will take place each year and we plan to hold a similar event in the US during 2005. Ethnic Diversity 19.8% People of colour 19.5%UK employees from ethnic minorities Ethnicity of US employee population In 2004, ethnic minorit ies account ed for 19.8% of UK employees. In the US, people of colour made up 19.5% of our workforce, the same as for 2003. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report Multi-Cultural Marketi ng and Div ersity Awards recognis e staff who have found creative ways to reach a wi der audienc e of empl oyees, customers and communities. Awards are given in several categorie s including one for Employee Attraction, Development and Retention.

T he campaign is deliv ered in 12 languages and convey s messages that ta ke into account religious and cultural differences across India A US \"SeniorCare\" programme to help elderly people cope with diabetes and respiratory problems Employee Networks Our employee networks in the US encom pass programmes for Asian, African American, Hispanic and gay and lesbi an em ployees. T he first gay and lesbian network leaders conference was held dur ing 2004 to share practical strategies for leading the employee groups. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 12Employment 2.3 Employee Development GSK invests in training and development to enable employees to perform to the best of their ability and to develop their careers. We provide a range of job-related trai ning to help all employees build their skills an d do their jobs effectively. In addition, appropriate leadership training is available to all managers. Employ ees can enrol in training programmes through our myLearning intranet site in the UK and US. During 2004, 8,882 employees attended 438 development pr ogrammes in these countries. Similar opportunities exist for employees worldwide but data are not currently collected on the take-up of the programme. In 2004, 1540 people attended Leadership E dge, our global programme for senior managers, and 412 attended Leader ship@GSK, the programme for middle managers. A further 221 em ployees attended our foundation programme for new managers, M anagement @GSK. The programmes are designed to help managers improve t he performance of t heir staff and to increase their insight into differing work styles, strengths and motivation. Als o in 2004 the Inspirational Leaders hip Workshop was launched to build on som e of the main concepts of Leadership E dge, focusing on the senior leadership role of inspiring and motivating people to high performance to meet business challenges. The Workshop is targeted at executives and senior leaders, particularly those with significant in fluence over large numbers of s taff. Regular performance appraisals rewa rd strong performance as well as helping employees to set objectives and iden tify the training they need. More than two-thirds of GSK employees receive an annual per formance appraisal through our Performance and Dev elopm ent Planning (PDP) programme. The PDP process includes an assessm ent of how well employees have implement ed the GSK Spirit - the principl es we use to define our culture. It can have a significant impact on bonus pay ments, potentially reducing them to zero if an employee is found not have fo llowed the Spirit, and can also affect future career development. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 13Employment 2.4 Internal Communication Good internal communication is impor tant in achieving our business objectives as well as creating an open and inclusiv e work environment. We have a range of communications channels to keep employees up-to-date with company news and enable them to give feedback. These inclu de: myGSK, our global intranet site, provides news and updates and a Q&A section where employees can put questions directly to the CEO and other senior exec utives. Up to 100 ques tions are answered e ach month. Behind the News, a section of the GSK intranet, gives the compan y's position on important issues linke d to press stories about GSK. Spirit, our internal magazine, reaches around 50,000 employees throughout the company four times a year. In 2004 Spir it won a Gold Award for Best Internal Magazine of the Year from Communicators in Business Awards, Europe's biggest and most prestigious awards programme for corporate communications. \"Townhall\" sessions for employees at all levels of the company, hosted by senior management including the CEO. Employees have the opportunity to discuss the progress of the business, raise questions and give feedback. There were 16 of these events in 2004. Employee surveys are carried out r egularly throughout the organisation to enable staff to give feedback. A gl obal survey of managers is carried out every two years. See Global Leadership Survey. A leadership conference for seni or managers celebrated employee contributions, GSK's future vision of success and the role leaders p lay in the company. Following the c onference delegates debriefed their teams on the messages and outcome of the conference. 97% of managers who attended felt it was a worthwhile use of their time. Many of our sites and offices produc e local newsletters that help keep employees up-to-date on lo cal and company news. Confidential feedback mechanism s enable employees to raise concerns. These include our int egrity helpline. See Standards of Ethical Conduct . In Europe our Works Counc ils and European Employ ee Consultation Forum provide regular opportuniti es for empl oyees and company management to discuss issues. See Human Rights in the website for more information. We also keep employ ees informed about our corporate responsibility programmes. During 2005 all senior empl oyees will receive a copy of our CR Overview. The Overview will also be incl uded in Spirit, our internal magazine, which reac hes around 50,000 employees. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re 14We track the effectiveness of comm unications through questionnaires and employee s urveys. Our Leadership Survey in 2004 found that: 61% of respondents believ e our communications are open, honest and objective 75% feel they have access to the information they need to be an ambassador for GSK. See Global Leadership Survey in the website for more details. We monitor the questions employ ees put to senior managers through the Q&A pages on myGSK to ensure we pick up potential ar eas of concern. We also track readership of news stor ies on myGSK to help improve the relevance and interes t of the content. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 15Employment 2.5 Health and Safety How we Manage Health and Safety 18 Injury and Illness Rates 20 Causes of Injury and Illness 26 Serious Incidents and Fatalities 28 Health Programmes 2 9 Safety Programmes 33 Suppliers 3 5 The health and safety of employees and c ontractors is an absolut e priority for GSK. We systematically assess the ri sks associated with our operations and take action to protect employees and others in the workplace. We track the number of cases of work -related injury and illn ess resulting in time off work. Our target is to reduce work-related lost time injuries and illnesses per 100,000 hours worked by 15% every year unt il the end of 2005. During 200 4 our injury and illn ess rate remained almost constant and therefore w e did not meet our targe t. This may be partial ly explained by improvements in our reporting systems, in cluding training, resulting in more accurate data. We will red ouble our e fforts to resume the positive trend establish ed between 2001 and 2 003 that led to a 30% reduction in the illnes s and injury rate. We routinely monitor the causes of incidents and assess what can be learned to avoid them happening again. About the Health and Safet y Section of This Report This is the 5th year that we have reported on our health and safety performance. The legacy companies (Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham) individually published EHS reports for a number of years prior to the formation of GSK in 2000. Copies of these reports are available on the Corporate Register website In previous years, we have publis hed a separate EHS report alongside our Corporate Respons ibility R eport, but this year we have fully integrat ed the two. There are also more details about our corporate responsibility reporting in the section about this report. Scope of Data The health and safety data covers the ca lendar year 2004. It is collected from all our 84 pharmaceutical and consum er manufacturing sites, 6 of 8 biologicals manufacturing sites and a ll 24 R&D sites as well as all 6 distribution centres, all 6 major offi ce locations and 63 of our smaller offices www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 16and sales locations. We include data for si tes that were in operation for all or part of the year. Notes attached to the charts explain the scope and data collection process for each parameter in more detail. Verification The environment, health and safety secti ons of this report are externally verified by ERM (Environmental Resources Management) . Web pages to which the verification applies are indicated by this symbol See ERM's verification stat ement in this document. www.g sk.com thKline Re sponsibility Report 2004 17Health and Safety 2.5.1 How we Manage Health and Safety We manage health and safety through an int egrated environment, health and safety (EHS) management syste m. The system incorporates our EHS and Employee Health Policies, EHS Visi on and 64 Global EHS Stand ards. Our EHS Plan for Excellence sets out our strategy for improving EHS performance up to 2010. See more on our EHS M anagement System section in the website. Our Corporate Environment, Health and Safety (CEHS) and Employ ee Health Management (EHM) teams help coor dinate our health and safety programmes. See more on our EHS Manag ement Organisation section in the website . In these pages we summarise activities during 2004 that relate specifically to health and safety. See the EHS Management in the website section of our Corporate Respons ibility Report for informati on on how we manage environmental and broader EHS issues. Health and Safet y Feedback Fr om our EHS Audits We aim to conduct EHS audits at each oper ational sit e at least once every four years. We carry out more fre quent visits at selected sites, depending on an assessment of risk and the issues rais ed by previous audits. In 2004, 33 sites were audited inc luding three key o ffice l ocations. The average score was 71%. Our audits identified several priority areas: -Chemical risk assessment and control. -Managing resilie nce a nd mental well-being. -Ergonomic risk assessment and control. -Scope and adequacy of workplace risk assessments. -Management systems approach to auditing EHS programmes. -Root cause analysis of EHS incidents. -Implementation of permi t-to-work programmes. -Management of contractors. All sites are required to develop plans to address any weakness es and opportunities to improve identified in the audit. Auditors monitor si tes' progress in implementi ng the plans. In 2004 the EHS audit process and scoring system were further re fined based on experience and feedback. We are trialling EHS auditing software on our intranet site to help the auditors track progress, and aim to have a fully functional version ready in 2005. OHSAS 18001 Certification In 2004, four sites achieved certificati on to the international health and safety standard OHSAS 18001 for the first time. This brings the total number of manufacturing sites certified to 14 out of 84 pharmaceutical and consumer www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 18manufacturing sites with one additional site that certified only the utilities are a. The certified sites are in China, Egypt, France, India, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and the UK. See audits and certification in the website for informati on on certification to the environment al management standard ISO14001. Health and Safet y Week GSK runs an annual Health and Safety W eek every October (to coincide wit h the European Health and Safety week). Info rmation kits are sent to all sites to help them develop ideas and plan activities. In 2004, over 13,800 employees from 67 sites in 29 countries took par t in the Health and Safety Week. Activities included sports days, safe driving education, ergonomics training, awareness -raising on healthy eating and lif estyles, and family participation events. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 19Health and Safety 2.5.2 Injury and Illness Rates The main indicator we use to measure heal th and safety is the lost time injury and illness rate, ie work-related injuries and illnesses that result in ti me off work. Other measures include los t calendar days from i njuries and illness es, and reportable injury and illness without lost time. Lost Time Injuries and Illnesses Lost time injuries and illnesses are wo rk-related incidents that are serious enough to result in one or more days away from work. In 2004 there were 519 lost time i njuries and 61 lost time illn esses corresponding to a combined rate of 0.30 per 100,000 hours worked. At 71 sites in 35 countries, there were no los t time in juries or illnes ses during the year. At one site in China, there have bee n no lost time injuries or illnesses for three years. In addition: two sites in Canada a nd Mexico achieve d 5 million hour s worked without a lo st time injury or illness; one site in Puerto Ric o achieved 4 millio n hours worked without a lost time injury or illness; three sites in Banglade sh, Pakist an and Sing apore achieved 3 million hours worked without a lost time i njury or illn ess; three sites in India, Saudi Arabi a and the US achieved 2 million ho urs worked wit hout a lost time injury or illness; ten sites in China, India, Pakist an, Poland, Spain, UK, and the US achieve d 1 million hour s worked without a lost time injury or illness. See more on injury and illness milestones in the webs ite. Cases of work-related mental ill h ealth are excluded from the overall illness rate. This is because the consistency of reporting such cases is les s robust than other occupational ill nesses and there are variations in the way these illnesses are defined under lo cal legislation which affe cts reporting. However, we are working to address these inconsistencies and aim to include these cases at a future date. In 2004, there were 30 cases of work-related mental ill health with lost time, a rate of 0.02 per 100,000 hours worked. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 20 Performance Lost Time Injur y and Illness Rate Injury Illness2001 2002 2003 2004 0.43 0.34 0.30 0.30 Lost Time Injur y and Illness Rate by Business 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 R&D Biologicals Consumer Healthcare New Product and Global Supply Regional Pharma Supply Primary Supply and Antibiotics Commercial Other2001 2002 2003 2004 (per 100,000 hours worked) We track the number of cases of work -related injury and illn ess resulting in time off work. Our target is to reduce work-related lost time injury and illness per 100,000 employees by 15% every y ear until the end of 2005. During 2004 our injury and illness rate remained almo st constant and ther efore we did not meet our target. This may be partia lly explained by improvements in our reporting systems, including training, resulting in more a ccurate data. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline 21We will red ouble our e fforts to resume the positive trend establish ed between 2001 and 2 003 that led to a 30% reduction in the illnes s and injury rate. In 2005 we will ne ed to achieve a 24% impr ovement to put us back on track to achieve our 2005 target. Notes to Injur y and Illness Charts The health and safety data cover both our employees and contract workers w ho are directly supervised by GSK employees. All injury and illness rates are per 100,000 hours worked. Lost time injuries and illnesses are work -related injuries and illness es that are serious enough to result in one or more days away from work. Lost calendar days are the calendar da ys that employees could not work because of work-related injuries and illness es. This helps to provide a measure of the severity of injuries and illn esses. Reportable injuries and illn esses without lo st time are reported incidents that did not result in time away from w ork (lost time). They are more serious than first aid but generally less serious than lost ti me. We do not include cas es of mental ill health in our lost time illness rates. This is because of variations in the way mental ill-health is de fined and reported across sites, which we are working to address. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 22 Lost Calendar Day s From Injuries and Illn esses We also measure the calendar days t hat employees could not work because of work-rel ated injuries and illn esses. This helps to provide a measure of the severity of i njuries and illness es, although it is not always an accurate reflection eg some illn esses such as hearing loss and sensitisatio n can result in permanent disability without resulting in los t time. In 2004, excluding wor k-related mental il lness, there were 12,748 lost days due to injury and 1,446 lost days due to illne ss. There were an ad ditiona l 1,513 lost days due to work-related ment al illness. In 2 004, approximately 13% of illn esses resulted in permanent disa bilities, such as noise induced hearing los s, sensitisation to chemical s and some musculoskeletal illnesses.

These are work-related injuries and illnesses that are more serious than fi rst aid but generally less serious than lost time. In 2004 there were 430 injuries without lost time and 345 illn esses without lost time. There was also an addition al 9 case s of mental illn ess without lost time, a rate of less than one per 100,000 hours worked.

Contractors Working on GSK Sites (N ot Directly Supervised by GSK Emplo yees) Here we report health and safety data for construction contractors or contract companies (eg those providing cat ering and landscap ing services) who work on GSK sites but supervise and direct t heir own staff. The data for contract workers who are directly supervis ed by GSK employees are included in the data for GSK employees. In 2004 there were 83 lost time injuries and illnesses (a rate of 0.40 per 100,000 hours worked). There were also 1, 351 calendar days lost (a rate of 6.55 per 100,000 hours worked) and 412 r eportable injuries and illnesses without lost time (a rate of 2.00 pe r 100,000 hours worked). This data is not included in the verification by ERM. These rates are higher than those for GSK employees. Contract companies are responsible for supervising their ow n employees and also for providing them with safety training. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 25Health and Safety 2.5.3 Causes of Injuries and Illnesses Lost Time Injuries and Illnesses Slips/trips/falls, motor vehicle accident s and over-exertions/strains were the main cause s of injuries resulting in lost time. Mental illness, musculoskeletal illness (p rimarily repetitive strain injury) and infections were the main causes of illne sses resulting in lost time. There were two outbreaks of infection (caused by food poisoning at onsite catered events), resulting in 22 cases of food borne illness es that resulted in lost time.

In Egypt, a GSK sales representative fe ll into an elevator shaft while on a business trip. In the United States, a GSK sales represent ative died in a traffic accident. The third party fa tality was in Brazil, where a visitor travelling in a GSK car died in a traffic accident. We ar e working to reduce traffic accidents through our driver safety programme. See safety programmes in the website. Our health and safety data covers driv ing accidents that occur on business travel. We only report data on commuti ng accidents if the vehicle is owned and operated by GSK. However, we took very seriously a commuti ng accident in Nig eria, where a truck collid ed with a bus (not owned or operated by GSK) carrying GSK employ ees to work, leading to six employ ee fatalities . We also report serious incidents ie incident s that result in pe rmanent disability (including amputations) or those that ar e reported to the r egulatory authorities. In 2004, accidents wit h machinery resulted in four empl oyees (at sites in Japan, Pak istan, India and the US ) needing to have part of a finger amputated. In addition, one employee (at a site in India) had to have a hand amputated and one employee (in the US) needed surgery but suffered no permanent disab ility. A Canadian employee s uffered severe hand in juries following a serious car crash. We investigate the circumstances of a ll fatalities and other serious incidents and assess what can be learned to avoid si milar injuries again. We also issue global alerts (posted on our intranet site) to communicate information that could help prevent similar incidents at other sites. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility 28Health and Safety 2.5.5 Health Programmes At GSK, w e recognis e that good employee health contributes to good business health. Our Employee Health Policy - which sits alongside our EHS Policy - sets out our overall commitment to protecting and promoting the heal th and well-being of our empl oyees. An Employee Heal th Management department supports our sites in implementing the polic y globally. In 2004 we held works hops in India, Europe and the US for health practitioners to share informati on and best practice. See more on Employee Health Management organisation in the website . In 2004, our internal audits identif ied a number of weaknesses in the way sites manage key health risks, includi ng chemical agent s, ergonomics, and resilie nce a nd mental well-being. We have responded b y develop ing new strategies on chemica l exposure, er gonomics, and resilience and mental well- being and by introducing a number of new management tools and resources. In 2005, we plan to set up a new employee health \"scorecard\" to measure and monitor the effectiveness of progra mmes and processes to promote the health and productivity of our employees. Our aim is to improve GSK's bus iness performance through enhancing the health and resilie nce o f its people. Here are some of the key health achievements in 2004: Resilience and Ment al Well-being There were 39 cases of mental illness (with and without lost time) at GSK in 2004 - a significant reduction from 79 in 2003. There was also a corresponding decrease in the number of days lost from work-rel ated mental illness from 2,956 in 2003 to 1,513 in 2004. Mental illness was the leading cause of work-related sickness absence, accounting for 33% of all work-related lo st time illnesse s. On average, each GSK case of work-rel ated mental illness resulted in 50 days off work, signific antly more than the average number of days lost from other causes of occupational illness c ausing lost time. We use the term 'resilience' to de scribe the set of skills and behav iours needed to cope successfully with the pressures of a rapi dly changing work environme nt. We have strategies on resilie nce and mental well-b eing in the UK and the US. In 2005 we plan to dev elop a group-wide st rategy on these issues. During the year, a total of 150 teams in the U K used our Team Resilience Toolkit - developed in 2003 - to identify and manage risks and measure performance. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 29In many countries, including the UK and US, we continued to put in place health and stress-reduction programmes that are relevant to local conditions, cultures and workplac e risks. Ma ny of these are designed to reduce workplace pressure and encourage a good work-life balance. Examples include personal and team resilie nce, personal skills su ch as time management, flexible working opt ions, health awareness and education initiativ es, and health y food choices at our on-site catering facilities. We also provide fitness facilitie s either on-site or off-site at many of our sites. For example, in the UK, we have a fitness centre at GSK H ouse in Brentford, and almost half (47%) of the employees who work there are mem bers o f it. In the US, we hav e fitness facilities at ni ne sites and an average of 20% of our employees have enrolled to use the facilities . In 2004, our sites in Singapore and the UK received awards for initiatives to promote resilience. Our manufacturing si te in Jurong, Singapore, received a Platinum Award from the H ealth Promotion Board of the Singapore Ministry of Health for programmes which encourage staff to \"work hard, play hard and stay well.\" A bronze award was also pr esented to our Quality Road site for health programmes. In t he UK, the GSK Resilienc e and Mental Well-being strategy was recognised by the UK Heal th and Safety Executive as a Beacon of Excellence and one of the best stress prevention strategies they have seen. See more on our approach to resilience and mental well-being in the website. Ergonomics In 2004, there were 28 cases of musculo skeletal illnes s (with lost time), mainly due to repetitive strain injury. These accounted for 31% of work-related lost time illnesses - the second most frequent category (after mental health) . There were also 106 overexertion/strain injuries with lost time accounting for 20% of lost time injuries . In addition, musculoskeleta l illness not related to work is the leading cause of sick ness absenc e in the UK and one of the highest categories of healthcare spend in the US. In response to these challenges, GSK has developed an ergonomics strategy up to 2010, and created and appointed a new position of a full-time professional ergonom ist. With this appointment at the end of 2004 we will refine our strategy and programmes going forward. Our approach to managing ergonomic issu es is a collaborative one involv ing Employee Health Management staff, sa fety professional s, engineers, line managers and human resources functions. In 2004, 106 sites carri ed out 3,243 office workstation risk assessments using our on-line ergonomic s risk assessment tool. This has now been translated into French, Italian, Polish, Portugues e and Spanish and is available on our intranet. During the year, we also started work to develop a spec ific ergonomics risk assessment and control tool for non-o ffice based employees. This will be piloted in the US befor e being extended globally. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 30 A key part of our strategy for 2005 and beyond is to establis h employee-led ergonomic improvement t eams at all GSK sites. In the UK, we now have such teams at thirteen sites. In 2004, th ese sites achieved a 40% reduction in musculosk eletal injuries and illnesses. Over 80 examples of ergonomic s bes t practice have been developed and shared on our intranet. We also created a new area on our intranet for people with ergon omics responsib ilities to discuss issues, share ideas an d access resources. In 2005, the GSK ergonomics guidance will be updated to reflect the growing amount of knowledge and experti se in this field. We also plan to incorporate ergonomic principles into our design tool kits for new equipment and processes. Our manufacturing site in Barnard Castle, UK, was awarded 1st place in the safety category of our EHS Exce llence Awar ds for its ergonomic improvements. See case study in the website . See more on our approach to ergonomics in the website. Occupational Hy giene and Control of Chemical Exposure In 2004, there were 9 cases of respiratory or dermal (skin) illn ess resulting in lost time and 115 non lost time cases, ma inly due to exposure to chemicals. Together, they accoun ted for 28% of work-related illn esses. In 2004, we developed a strategy on control of chemical exposur e up to 2010. This sets out a plan of action for achi eving our 2010 goal of a 'shirt sleeve' working environment i.e. a workplace where containment of chemi cals during manufacture replaces the need for personal protective equipment. During the year we surveyed all our sites to review the way they handle chemicals and control exposure to the most potent compounds (those with an exposure limit less than 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Note - a microgram is one millionth of a gram). This has helped us to understand our current position and set priorities for the future. We have introduced new tools to help site s calculate the cost of different options for controllin g exp osure to chem icals. This has resulted in a better understanding of the true costs of control strategies and frequently demonstrates that engineering controls , including containment systems, are more cost effective than traditional control methods of extraction and personal protective equipment. A number of our sites have achieved signific ant savings by installing new containment systems. For example, in Parma, Italy, a new containment system for a toxic compound fo r treating cancer led to savings of \u00a31.4 millio n. In Dungarvan, Ireland, a new enzyme containment solution led to financia l savings of \u00a30.2 millio n. To share best practice across our sites, we have made available on our intranet site 43 engin eering design kits for controllin g rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 31(solutions already in existence t hat we know work) and 10 pre-engineered solutions (new designs ). We are also working to develop new technologies that make i t easier to contain highly potent compounds. We continue to refine the way we asse ss the EHS hazar ds of materials and integrate this into our research an d development process. In 2004, our experts establis hed new occupational expos ure limits for more than 40 materials and environmental limits bas ed on scientific data for more than 300 materials. A task force has been established in our antibiotic bus iness to improve control of chemical exposures during manufac ture. We are also addressing the challenging task of controlling e xposure to the most hazardous category of compounds during the manufactu re of the final formula tion of medicines that go to patients. As with research into new medicines, te sting of material hazards may involve animal experiments. GSK is committed to the principl e of the 'three Rs' to reduce, refi ne and replace animal expe riments. See more on occupational chemical hazard evaluation and ani mal testing in the website. See more on our approach to Occupationa l hygiene and control of chemical exposures in the website . HIV/AIDs In 2004, we continued to provide antir etroviral treatment (ARV) to all GSK employees (full and pa rt-tim e) and their families in the develop ing world wher e treatment is not provided adequately or c onsistently by the local healthcare system. Se e more on our approach to HIV in the website. We also developed a number of awareness -raising initiatives. For examp le, in 2004, our factory in Nairobi, Kenya, wo rked with the National AIDS Trust in the UK to develop HIV/AIDs educational materials. This was funded by our Positive Ac tion Programme in the website which provides support to communities around the world affected by HIV/AIDs. We also offer preferentially priced ARVs to other employers in Sub-Saharan Africa who provide care and treatment for staff. See preferential pricing in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 32Health and Safety 2.5.6 Safety Programmes We systematically ass ess risks to anticipate potential ac cidents, and put programmes in place to minimise them. We also learn from investigating the causes of accidents and make improvements accordingly. In 2004, we introduced a number of new initiatives on driver safety and process safety. Driver Safet y In 2004, there were 113 driving accidents (with lost time), which accounted for 22% of lost time injuries. Our sales r epresentatives drive long distances every year and are therefore particularly at risk of driving acc idents. Our Global EHS standard on Occupationa l Travel includes requirements on driver safety. In 2004, we developed 11 technical instruction docu ments to help GSK businesses comply with the standard. These cover a wide range of topics including driver training, fitne ss to drive, vehicle selection, risk assessment, insurance, accident repor ting, driver ergonomics, and driving and the environment. We monitor co mplianc e with the standard through internal audits and self assessment questionnaires. GSK also produced a number of tools to help commerci al fleet managers improve driver safety. New driv er safety prog rammes for sales representatives were introduced in 18 countries (Belgium, Bosnia, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Fr ance, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Nigeria, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka and Switzerland). More stringent requirements, such as additional training, were added to existing programmes i n a number of countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, Poland and Romania and the US). In the UK, a comprehensive driv er safety programme was developed in 2004 ready for roll-out to the three GSK commercial business u nits in Janu ary 2005. We will con tinue to expand driver safety programmes throughout co mmercial oper ations in the next few years. In a few countries, we provide motorbik es or scooters for employees. In 2004, a GSK Motorbike Rider Safety Manual wa s produced. Th is was distributed in local languages to employees in countries where motorbikes are widely used, including Bangladesh, India, I ndonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. These countries have now also fully implem ented the GSK requirement for every driver of a motorbike to wear a helme t. We will continu e to follow up and monitor the implementation of t he motorbike safety programme. See more on our approach to driver safety i n EHS Programmes i n GSK Commercial in the web site. Process Safet y and Safet y Engineering Our proces s safety pr ogramme e nsures that safety is b uilt into our manufacturing process es. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) must be completed before any new project is carried out. In 2004, we launc hed a new www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co Re 33Failure Mode and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA) system to help engineers develop safer processes. See more on our approach to process safety and safety engineering in the website . We have developed safety data sheets (S DSs) for more than 1,200 of our products. Some of these are availabl e on our website - see safety data sheets . In 2004, we developed an email notif ication tool which auto matically keeps employees up-to-date with changes to SDSs. We also started to make environmental testing data available on our SDSs. In 2004, we also launched the HazCla ss Sy stem to help track hazardous material shipments worldwide and ens ure the safe transportation of over 10,000 materials per month. See more on safe transport of materials in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 34Health and Safety 2.5.7 Suppliers Our supply chain is complex. It ranges fr om major strategic relationships with contract manufacturers that make final medicines for us to suppliers of key materials. EHS Au dits We conduct regular EHS audits of our key suppliers to check they comply with our EHS standards and key legislation. In 2004, we carried out 35 site-based EHS audits of existing and potential suppliers . We f ound a wide variation in performance across the sites audited. The lowest score was 22% and the highest was 92%. We make recommendati ons to sites following the audits and have a process to monitor progress, with a particular focus on poorly performing sites. In 2004, three potential key suppliers achieve d unacceptable EHS scores (less than 30%) and therefore we did not source from them. No existing supplier scored below 30%. We found that health and safety was gener ally well managed at supplier sites in Europe and North America. However, we identified some challenges in emerging economies, especially in areas relating to fire prevention and response, occupational hygiene and control of chemical exposure, identification of hazards and risks, and syst ems for repo rting and investigating incidents. See supp liers and contractors (in the env ironmental section of this website) for more about our EHS audits. Supplier Performance We have approximately 80 centrally m anaged key suppliers, whic h include both contract manufacturers and suppliers of materials. We are working towards reporting the health and safety performance of our contract manufacturers. This is a more difficult process than collect ing data from our own sites because contract manufacturers are independently managed. In 2004 we collected health and safety data from 13 major contract manufacturers. This data is not included in the verification by ERM. Employees at the 13 contract manufactu rers who reported health and safety data worked a total of 12.8 millio n hour s on manufacturing GSK products in 2004. Lost tim e injury and illness: There were 65 lost time injuries and 16 lost time illnesse s corresponding to a combined rate of 0.64 per 100,000 hours worked. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 35 Injury and illness without lost tim e: There were 121 injuries without lost ti me and 22 illness es without lost time corresponding to a combined rate of 1.11 per 100,000 hours worked. Calendar days lost from injury an d illness: There were 1,540 lost days from i njuries and 84 lost days from illne sses corresponding to a combined rate of 12.71 per 100,000 hours worked. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 37 3.1 Emplo yees 3.2 Suppliers 3. Human Rights Human Rights 3 Human Rights Corporate responsibility principle We are committed to upholding t he UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD guidelines for MNEs and the core labour standards set out by the International Labour Or ganisation. We expect the same standards of our suppliers, contract ors and business partners working on GSK's behalf. Hum an rights is a broad subject that is re levant to GSK in a num ber of different contexts. In this section we discuss human rights for GSK employees and hum an rights issues in our supply chain. Our direct employees are generally hi ghly ed ucated and skilled pe ople for whom we are striving to make our com pany an attractive employer. Generally our employment standards on iss ues such as diversity and equal opportunities provide adequate s afeguards on human rights. Our supply chain is complex, diverse and global. We recognise it is possible that our suppliers in some countries do not fully respect the human rights of their workers or those in their community. Within our sphere of influence, we have begun work to ensure that our s uppliers observe similar standards to ours in their relations with employees and communities . www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 38Human rights 3.1 Employees The human rights of our employees at work are fully protected by our employment policies and pr ocedures. For more details see Employment Practices in the website. We operate globally, including in count ries where the government does not fully respect human rights. We believe our presence in these countries is vital to ensure continued access to medicines for their people. We aim to create a working environment for our empl oyees wher e the standards match those in our operations elsewhere. To ensure we are delivering our commi tment to international human rights standards in employment, we conduct an annual global audit. This involves asking the head of Human Resources for each country where we operate to report on w hether GSK employment practices meet these standards. Following the 2004 audit we have not ident ified any significant human rights issues for our workforce. We can confirm that GSK does not employ children or anyone younger than 16. All our employees are entitled to jo in trade unions and to organise, in countries where this is permitted by nat ional legislation. We are committed to listening and responding to the vi ews of our employees, including through works councils and staff consultation committees. Discriminat ion and har assment are not tolerated under any circumstances. Employees can report any concerns to senior management on a confidential basis, using our global integrity helpl ine. Dur ing 2004 there were no cases reported by employees to our complianc e function that directly raised human rights issues. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 39Human rights 3.2 Suppliers Our supply chain is complex. It includes high-spend, strategic relationships with suppliers that manufacture medici nes for us or supply ingredients to multiple GSK manufacturing plants. It also i ncludes relatively lo w spend contracts for locally-s ourced goods or services such as cleaning products, rubber glov es or laundry services. Given the size, diversity and global scope of our supply chain we recognise it is possible that suppliers in some countries do not fully respect the human rights of their workers or those in t heir community. Within our sphere of influenc e, we have begun work to ensure that our suppliers observ e similar standards to ours in their relati ons with employees and communities. The first step is to incorporate clauses in our supplier contracts that seek assurances from our suppliers about t heir commitment to human rights. This includes compliance with minimum wage legislation; provision of a healthy, safe work place free from discrimination; the right of employees to join an independent trade union; and opposition to all forms of slavery and exploitative chi ld labour. During 2004 we continued the proce ss (begun in 2003) to include human rights clauses in our central contract templates for use with new s uppliers. During 2005 we will be working with local procurement managers to ensure they incorporate appropriate claus es in to local contracts. Human rights clauses are also being introduced into cont racts for existing supplier s as they are renewed. Where appropriate, taking into ac count the varying risk of human ri ghts abuses in different regi ons, major existing suppliers have been asked to confirm in writing that they comp ly with GSK's human rights clauses. We began this process in 2003 by contacting over 400 suppliers and in 2004 we contacted over 650 more suppliers. The second step is to audit and monitor suppliers. We already conduct regular Environment Health and Safety audits of our contract manufacturers (see Suppliers and Contractors). In 2003 these audits were extended to incorporate criteria and questions on human rights. There were 35 audits conducted during 2004 and no human rights issues were noted. For other major suppliers, compliance is as sessed during regular supplier review meetings conducted by GSK's pr ocurement professionals. A guidance document 'Supplier Co mplianc e with GSK Human Rights Requirements' has been developed for empl oyees working in proc urement. It explains our standard contract clauses on human rights, the importance of supplier compliance with these standards, how to monitor human ri ghts issues during EHS audits and supplier reviews and how to deal with instances of non-compliance. This is part of our Sourcing Group Management process which provides a training and bes t prac tice programme fo r GSK Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 40professionals. Human right s requirements are included in the criteri a used by procurement for selecting new suppliers. If a supplier is found not to have met our standards we will wo rk with them to agree improvement plans and achieve comp liance. We think this is better than walkin g away from the probl em. Ho wever, we will terminate a contract if a supplier will not or cannot work towards compliance. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 42 4. Access to Medicines Access 4 Access to Medicines Access to healthcare is a signific ant c hallenge in many parts of the world. Millions of poor people in both develop ed and develo ping countrie s cannot obtain the medicines they need. This section describes how GSK is helping to improve access, and our progress in 2004. It covers our: contribution to the develop ing worl d through research, not-for-profit pricing, partnerships and voluntar y licences preferential pricing arrangements and discount cards for middle-inc ome countries Patient Ass istance Programs and di scount cards to help uninsured patients in the US We also support under-served communities worldwide through donations, funding and practical support, see Communi ty Investment in the website. 4.1.2 Pr eferentia l Pricing 4.1.1 Re World Vo lunta ry Licen sing and Partner ships 4.1.2.1 Eligibility for Noi t-For-Profi t Pricing Corporate responsibility principle We will con tinue to research and develo p medicines to treat diseases of the developing world. We will find sus tainable ways to improve access to medicines for disadvantaged people, and will seek partnerships to support this activity. 4.2 Developed World www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 43Case st udy Improving Access to Medicine in Lithuania GSK's new Orange Card in Lithuania is giv ing all senior citizens better access to the medi cines they need. Patients in Lithuania must contri bute towards the cost of prescription medicines. Many senior citizens don' t get the treatment they need because they cannot afford to pay this cost and do not have private medical insurance to cover the expense. Doctors are awar e of this and may sometimes prescribe based on the patient's ability to pay rat her than the best opti on available. In general, the access to innovative treatment is very limited in Lithuania. The standard of living of seniors is relati vely poor and healthcare financing is one of the lowest in the E U. All of t hese causes encouraged GSK Lithuania to implement the Orange Card scheme launched successfully in the US. The Orange Card helps to tackle this problem by giving all senior citizens a discount of up to 100% of the patient's contributi on on all GSK prescription medicines. Patients can apply by completi ng a simple form and if el igible they will receive their Orange Card by post. The card was launched in July 2004 through a national advertising campaign and promotional material sent to pensioner organisations , doctors and pharmacies. By February 2005 more than 3,500 patient s had applied for an Orange Card and 107 pharmacies had registered to participate . Our target i s for 18,000 patients and 125 pharmacies to have joined the programme by July 2005. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 44Access 4.1 Developing World There is a healthcare crisis in many par ts of the develo ping world. Millions of people do not have access to adequate food and clean water. Their governments do not have the resources to fund the clinics and staff needed to deliver healthcare. The AIDS pandemic has made these problems worse, creating a generation of or phans and depriving communities of their greatest asset - fit and healthy people. Tackling this crisis is a complex c hallenge. Poverty is the fundamental cause and a huge barrier to progress. Signific ant political will a nd extra funding are needed from new national and international sources to aid development and build healthcare infrastructure. We believe that it is the responsibil ity of governments a nd intergov ernmental agencies, supplement ed by the work of many NGOs, to work in partnership to deliver the healthcare needed in t hese countries. However, the pharmaceutical industry can play a signi ficant role in supporting their work. We make an important contribution through: - Investing in research and devel opment that targets diseases disproportionately affecti ng developing countries - Providing antiretrovirals (ARVs) , anti-malarials and vaccines at specially reduced pric es - Developing partnerships and granting volunt ary licences to local manufacturers. We also support programmes to i mprove health and education through our community investment programme. Partner ships focus on four major diseases -- lymphati c filariasis, malaria, HIV/AI DS and diarrhoeal disease. Support is given through donations of cash and medicines, as well as employee involv ement. See Community Investment in the website. www.g sk.com thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 45Access 4.1.1 Research and Development To learn more about R&D for the dev eloping world visit our website The research and development (R&D) of new drugs is essential to improve health in the develop ing world. There ar e still no effective treatments for some wides pread and life-threatening diseases . Many existing treatments for diseases s uch as malaria are becoming less effective due to drug resistance. Many of these diseas es disproporti onately affect developing countries. This means there is often no viable commerc ial market for new treatments. New ways are required to encourage R&D and t o ensure that new medicines and vaccines reach the people who need them. O ne solution is the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. This e ncourages R&D and c an often accelerate the product's uptake in the developing worl d on a scale that cannot be achieved by a company on its own. PPPs inv olve companies and the public sector (eg governments, the WHO and other UN bodies, academia, and ph ilanthropic foundations) working together. They are helping to address this lack of effecti ve markets. Companies provide technology, devel opment, manufacturing and d istribution expertise. Public sector partners help fund R&D and de livery costs, ensuring that new medicines and vaccines get to the people who need them. GSK is a partner in several PPPs in cluding the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), Global Allia nce for TB and the Malaria Va ccine Initiative (MVI). PPPs such as these are transforming the landscape of R& D into diseases of the developing world. GSK has created a dedicated group in our pharmaceutical R&D or ganisation, based in Spain, the UK and the US, to focus on diseas es disproportionately affecting developing c ountries. Projects ar e prioritised according to their social and public health benefits ra ther than their commercial returns. A similar group exists in our vaccines or ganisation based in Belgium. We believe GSK is currently the only company researching both new vaccines and treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria - the World Health Organisation's three priority diseases. HIV/AIDS affects both dev eloped and developing countr ies. This means there is a commercial market for new treatm ents, which enc ourages inv estment in the required R&D. GSK is the industry leader in research into HIV/AIDS treatment, and currently has three major clinical development programmes in progress, each with a different mode of action. In total GSK has 14 clinical programme s for medicines and vaccines against 9 diseases1 particularly relevant to the developing world. Seven of these projects are for diseases that dispropor tionately affect developing c ountries. 1 HIV/AIDS, malaria, le ishma niasis, den gue fever, TB, hepatitis E, N. mening itis, cervical ca ncer an pneumon - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 46 Development Pipeline at end at end of 2004 for dis eases relevantto the whole call Pertussis) PHAS E lll PHA SE ll PHA SE whole call Pertussis) PHAS E lll PHA SE ll PHA SE l Pre- clinical activit yFocus * more detailed information on our product pipeline can be foundin the Annua l Report [link] **the pyridoneproject should enter phase 1 in 2005 Progress in 2004 Malaria Phase IIb clinical trials of our malaria vaccine for children showed unprecedented results.

Dr Melinda Moree, Director of MVI, commented that \"The findings represent a breakthrough in the science of malaria vaccines\". GSK is working with the Medicines fo r Malaria Venture (MMV), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and ac ademic partners to develop an affordable fixed-dose artemisinin comb ination treatment for malaria in Africa, based on GSK's Lapdap . We received the MMV' s Project of the Year award for our Pyridone Project, investigating a new class of comp ounds for use against malaria. The project was chosen by the MMV's Exper t Scie ntific Advis ory Committee - a group of 12 experts in malaria and dr ug development - for its rapid success in identifying a drug candidate. We have sinc e signed an agreement with the MMV to take a lead compound into clinic al development. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 47 HIV/AIDS We have also made progress on R&D into HIV/AIDS. Epzicom /Kivexa , a new fixed dose combination of Epivir and Ziagen , was approved in the US and Europe. This new once-a-day combi nation tablet will help to simplify treatment regimens for patients. We plan to register it across the developing world in 2005 once it has received a European Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product. Telzir , a new protease inhibitor, was approved in Europe in 2 004 and is being regis tered in the develop ing world, where it will provide yet another treatment opti on. In September we signed a materi al transfer agreement with the International Partnership for Microbi cides (IPM). Under the agreement, GSK's HIV drug candidates will be tested for use in microbicides to prevent transmission of HIV and help wom en reduce their vulner ability to HIV infection during sexual intercourse. Phase II clinical trials of our CCR5 antagonist, a new class of AIDS therapy, produced po sitive data. The t herapy will no w be tested in further clinical studies. If trials are successf ul the therapy may benefit people liv ing with HIV who have developed viral resist ance to existing HIV treatments. Proof of concept trials and drug inte raction studies are underway for two additional HIV/AIDS compounds, a protease inhibitor (P reverse transcriptase inhib itor (NNRTI), and results are expected to be reported in 2005. GSK is supporting clinical trials that are sponsored by external organisations - such as the WHO, t he UK's Medical Research Council and US National Institutes of Health (NIH) - through our HIV-collaborative research programme for resource-poor settings. Twenty trials are currently underway mainly focussing on public hea lth-related issues and involving more than 13,000 patients in the developing world. Phase l clinical trials on our most advanced HIV vaccine candidat e continued in 2004 with no majo r milestones to report. TB GSK and Corixa, a US pharmaceutical company, began phase I clinical trials of a new vaccine for tuberculosis in 2004. This is the first study of this vaccine candidate to be conducted in humans. During 2004 GSK continued to screen compounds for possible use as new classes of anti-TB drugs agai nst enzymatic targets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. tu berculosis whole cells . Should our search be successful the leads identified fr om screening will be progressed to candidates for development. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co tavirus vaccine, Rotarix , for the prevention of gastroenteritis, was launched in Mexico in January 2005. Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea and vomiti ng (gastroenteritis) in children under two and kills around 600,000 children each year - one child every minute - mostly in developing c ountries. Rotarix was tested in the largest phase III clinical trial ever performed for a va ccine, inv olving over 60,000 children. We are now seeking regulatory approval for the vaccine in other developing countries. Cervical Cancer Clinical trials of our cervical cancer vaccine, Cervarix , produced positive results. Cervical canc er is the nu mber one cause of cancer deaths in women in the developing world. Current studi es suggest Cervarix could reduce by 70% a woman's lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer. We hope to launch the vaccine in Eur ope and our International region during 2007. Leishmaniasis GSK is developing sitamaquine, a new oral treatment for visceral leishman iasis which a ffects at least half a mil lion people a year in the developing world and is usually fatal if untreated. A new treatment for leishmaniasis is urgently needed sinc e current medicines are either impractical or becoming ineffectiv e due to drug resistance. Sitamaquine has shown good efficacy in phase II st udies and clinical development is ongoing. www.g sk.com - Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 49Access 4.1.2 Preferential Pricing To learn more about preferentia l pricing vis it our website There are many barriers to healthca re in developing countries. Most signific antly, poverty, and a lack of politic al will, have led to a lack of medical infrastructure - hospitals, clinics and medic al professional s - that prevents poor people accessing the healthcare they need. The affordability of medicines is also important and there are two elements to this. First is the ability of government s or patients to pay for medicines. Solving this problem will require de veloped country governments and inter- governmental agencies to make signific ant additional financia l resources available to developing countries. The second element is the price at which medicines are sold, an area GSK can help to address. We are making ke y medicines av ailable to developing countries at more affordable prices and in sufficient quantities for as long as they are required. This is a major commitment that we call 'prefere ntial pricing '. All our AIDS and malaria treatments are av ailable at not-for-profit prices to public sector customers and not-fo r-profit organisations in over 100 developing countries, including all the countri es covered by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Re lief (PEPFAR).[Link to eligibility criteria and How to Guide] Our pri ces are sustainable - we do not make a profit on them, but we do cover our manufacturing and distribution costs. Therefore we can sustain supply of t hese products for as long as they are needed. We aim to reduce not-for-profit pric es for our ARVs and anti-malarial medicines whenev er improvements in m anufacturing, or economies of scale, allow. For example, Combivir, one of our key ARVs, is now available at $0.65 a day, compared with $1.70 in April 2003. This equates to around $237 per patient per year and includes delivery costs, which com pares favourably with generic tablets. The February 2005 pr icing report by Medecins Sans Frontieres shows that the average cost of generic equivalents is $0.75 a day and the lowest priced generic eq uivalent costs $0.55 a day. In addition, we negotiate public sector prices with middle-income developing countries on a case-by-case basis. These combine a viable and s ustainable commercial return for GSK with incr eased a ffordability for the healthcare systems co ncerned. GSK vaccines are also availa ble at preferential prices. Here we work with multinational organisations such as UNI CEF, the World Health Organisation and the Pan American Health Organisation, governments and non- governmental organis ations, to provi de appr opriate sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 50 Progress in 2004 In 2004 we shipped 3 2.7milli on preferentially-priced Combiv ir tablets to the developing world, with over 80% of t hese going to Africa. This is nearly three times the 11 million tablets shi pped in 2 003. We do not routinely collect data for our other preferenti ally-priced medicines but a similar increase has been experienced f or Epivir , another of our ARVs. Overall shipments are still low given the scale of the AIDS epid emic in Africa but the growth is encouraging. More doc tors, hospitals and clinics are needed to treat more patients and ensure bette r take up of preferentially priced medicines. Shipments of preferentially priced Combivir excluding diverted stock 05101520253035 Y2001 Y2002 Y2003 Y2004 It is difficult to estimate the number of patients treated as a result of our preferential pricing agreements, sinc e GSK does not control healthcare provision. A report from the UN-led Acceler ating Access Initiative (AAI), suggests that by September 2004 more than 333,000 patients in developing countries were receiving ARV treatments supplied by the seven pharmaceutical companies in the AAI. This in cludes 157, 500 patient s in Africa, a 50% increase since September 2003. For more on GSK's work with the AAI see Accelerating Access Initiative in the website. At the end of 2004 we had 208 arrangements to supply preferentially-priced ARVs in 57 countries. This includes 30 agreements with priv ate employers. We added new supply agreements wit h a number of middle-inc ome countries during 2004. These incl ude an agreement with the Chinese Ministry of Health for preferentially priced Epivir tablets to support China's national HIV treatment programme, and a number of arrangements in Central and Eastern Europe. We are also introducing discount cards fo r senior citizens in several middle- income countries, see Devel oped Countries in this report. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 51Suppl y Arrangement s by Type of Customer Employers Public Hospitals NGOs Govt Non AAI AAI Q1 medicines are ille gally sh ipped back for sale in wealth ier countries, unde rmines our ability to provide n ot-for- profit prices and denies treatment to the intended pat ients in poorer countries. We can only afford to supply pr oducts at low prices in the world's poorest countries if we can still make an adequate return on them in wealthier markets. We have introd uced different packaging and tablet colours for many of our not-for-pro fit medicines to help prevent product diversion. Special tri-lingual 'a ccess packs' are now approved for Combivir, Epivir and Trizivir in over 50 countries, and we are now receiving regulatory approvals for the red Epivir and Combivir tablets. GSK has nine ARVs registered under the EU's Anti- Diversi on Regulation. We are the only company to have registered produc ts under this Regulation. We have set up five pilot projects in collaboration with NGOs in Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi to assess the impact of extending preferential pricing to a wider range of products. Initial results show that lack of healthcare capacity and infrastr ucture are major barriers. When capacity (for example the number of heal thcare professionals) or funding is improved there is an increase in take up of preferentially- priced medicines. For example two of the pilot sites have received funding from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for the treatment of opportunist ic infections. This has led to an increase in orders for antibiotics. A report on the findings from the pilots will be prepared at the end of 2005. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi y for Not-for-Profit Prices Our not-for-profit prices are available in over 100 countries. This includes all the Least Develop ed Countries (LDCs) and all of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - a total of 64 countries. In addition, all private employers in sub-Saharan Africa who provide care and treatment to t heir unin sured staff can purchase our ARVs at not-for-prof it prices. The not-for-profit pr ices are also offered to all projects fully funded by the Global F und and the 15 countries covered by the US Preside nt's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPF AR). We offer these prices where we believ e the need is greatest. This is to governments, NGOs and agencies that ar e providing treatm ent on a not-for- profit basis in the poorest and worst affe cted countries. We also seek not-for- profit arrangements with individ ual countri es to facilitate access for core public employees such as teachers, nurses, police and fire-fighters who are not covered by private health insurance schemes. We negotiate prices with t he private health sector on a case-by-case basis. We depend on revenues from sales to the private market to maintain a loca l presence and much-needed infrastructure in developing countries. Without this local c apacity we would be unable to provide essential servic es such as training healthcare workers to use our products, product support, safety monitoring and registration and launch of new products. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 53Access 4.1.3 Voluntary Licensing and Partnerships Learn more about voluntary licensing in the website Learn more about partnerships in the website We want to play an active role in addressing the healthc are crisis in developing countries. We believe pref erential pricing a rrangements are the best way to do this because we are able to ensure deliv ery of a safe, quality product at an affordable price for as l ong as it is needed. This is where we focus our e fforts . But i n some situat ions partnerships and voluntar y licences may also help to increase the supply of medicines. Voluntary Lice nces Voluntary licences (VL) enable local manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of our products. GSK has granted six VLs for our antiretrovirals (ARVs) in Africa w here HIV/AIDS is having a devastating impact. This is a creative respons e to a unique situation. A decision to grant a VL depends on a number of factors includin g the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in that country, local healthcare provision and the economic and manufacturing env ironment. VLs are not a universal solution to HIV/AIDS but a specific response to a particular set of circumstances. We discuss VLs with potential par tners on a case-by-case basis. Selecting the most appropriate licensees is key. We need to be sure that the manufacturer will be able to provide a long-term s upply of good-quality medicines and will implement safeguards to pr event the diversion of medicines to wealthier markets. (S ee Preferential Pr icing in the website). We do not seek to prevent voluntar y licence holders from combining the active ingredients they have licens ed from us with ot her licensed active ingredients to produce Fixed Dos e Combinat ions. They can also us e the US Food and Drug Administration's fast tra ck approval process for A RVs to accelerate the availab ility of generic ARVs for PEPFAR programmes in Africa. There has been much discussion about the use of compulsory licences, under which intellectual property rights are taken away from rights holder s. Compulsor y licenses are one of the flexibilities in the World Trade Organisation's TRIPs agreement on intellectual property, which can be used for humanitarian purposes. However, wi despread use of compulsory licences will undermine the intellectual property framework and be counter-productive in the long term. R&D into new treat ments, especially where commercial markets exist, such as for HIV/AID S, depends on protecti on for intellectual property. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 54 Progress in 2004 GSK granted five VLs in 2004, four in South Africa and one in Kenya. We have now granted a total of fi ve VLs to South African generics companies for the sale of some of our antiretrovirals2 to public and private sector customers in South Africa. Thr ee of these VLs also include rights to sell in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004 we granted a similar VL to Cosmos, a Kenyan pharmaceutical company, for manufacture and sale in Keny a and other countries in East Africa. Partnerships HIV treatment is complex, often requiri ng patients to take a combination of different tablets at different times of the day. This increases the risk of patients missing a dose or taking their medicine at the wrong time, which can reduce the effectiveness of treatment. In July 2004, GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) agreed to assess the development of co-packaging for Combivir and Viramune (BI's HIV treatment sometimes used in conjunction with GSK ARVs) for use in developing countries. Given the complexities of HIV treatment, we recognis e the need for multiple treatment opti ons and support e fforts to simplify treatment regimens. Aspen Pharmacare is developing the combined pack through the voluntary licenc es granted by both GSK and BI. 2 lamivudin e, zidovu dine, a nd Report 2004 55Access 4.2 Developed World Learn more about Patient Assist ance Programs in the w ebsite Access to medicines is not just an i ssue for the developing world. Even in developed countries some patients cannot afford the medicines they need. This is a particular problem in the US where many people do not have health insurance. GSK has developed Pati ent Assis tance Programs and discount cards in the US to help patients without ins urance. We are also introducing discount cards in several middle-income countries to enable qualifying patients to obtai n prescription medicines at a discount price Programmes in the US Patient Ass istance Programs provide pr escription medic ines to low-income, uninsured patients free or at minimal cost. GSK operates two Patient Assistance Programs. Commitment to A ccess covers ca ncer treatments; Bridges to Access covers other medi cines for outpatients. Patients are registered through one phone call from a patient advocate and receive medicine at their local pharmacy or by mail order. In 2004, 475,000 patients received GSK medicin es worth $372.5 m illion through these programs (based on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of these medicines). GSK was the first pharmaceutical company in the US to offer a card providing savings on medicines to low-income senior citizens and disabled people. Known as the Orange Card this enables thes e people to buy GSK outpatient prescription medicines at a discount. Introduced in 200 1, the Orange Card provides savings of up to 40%. In 2004, 37,319 patients, received 73,740 prescriptio ns. This resulted in WAC savings of $2.9 mill ion for patients. In 2002, GSK and six other pharmaceut ical companies established the Together Rx card which provides discounts on over 155 prescription medicines for low-income senior citiz ens who are eligib le for Medicare. In 2004, over 190,000 patients received 683, 364 GSK medicin es through this programme, saving $12.3 million ( based on WAC). In January 2005, GSK and nine other phar maceutical c ompanies c reated a new card to improve access to medici nes for other uninsured Americans, not just seniors. The Together Rx Access card provides savings of 25-40% on more than 275 medicines. Approximatel y 36 million pe ople, around 80% of uninsured people in the US, ar e eligible to enrol. We also offer discounts on our prescr iption medicines through cards launched by the Centers for Medicare & Medica id Services, a US government agency, in 2004. Orange Cards in Middle Income Countries During 2004 we introduced Orange Cards providing dis counts on certain GSK prescription medicines for eligible pati ents in Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Ukraine. www.g sk.com thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 56The nature of the discounts varies between countries, depending on the needs of the patient and the way in wh ich the healthcar e system o perates. Our Orange Card in the Ukraine gives all asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pat ients who are under 25 or over 50, an average discount of 19% on GSK's Seretide asthma medicine. Asthma patients of any age wh o suffer disabilities or who are affected by the Chernobyl nuclear dis aster are also eligible. Eligibility is assessed by the patient's doctor and patients can receive the medicine at participati ng pharmacies. A hotline number has been set up to help patients find their near est pharmacy, and so far 1,100 patients are enrolled. In Lithuania, patients must pay towards t he costs of their medicines. This is known as patient co-payment. Our Orange Card gives senior citiz ens an average discount of 40% on the patient co-payment on all GSK prescription medicines. By February 2005 more t han 3,500 patients had applied for an Orange Card and 107 pharmacies had registered to participate . (see Improving Access to Medicine in Lithuania c ase study) A GSK Orange Card was also introduced in Bulgaria in May 2004 for low- income patients with chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. Card holders receive an average 35% discount on four GSK prescription m edicines, and over 16,000 patients have registered so far. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Discount Programmes Countr y GSK programme Number of patients Value of benefit to patients US Patient Assistance Programmes - Free o r minimal cost medicines for low-income, uninsured patients. 475,000 received prescriptions$372.5 million US Orange Card - Discounts for low income senior citizens and disabled people. 37,000 received prescriptions$2.9 millio n US Together Rx - Discounts for low income senior citizens.

Data releas ed in January 2005 by the AAI estimated that the number of patients in developing countries rece iving ARV treatments supplied by the pharmaceutical companies in the AAI reached more than 333,000 by the end of September 2004. This includes 157, 500 patients in Africa, a 50% increase since Sept ember 2003. This increase is encouraging but much more needs to be done. The AAI companies are committed to working toget her to accelerate these trends and bring the benefits of HIV ca re and treatment to those in need. We will continue to work closely with affected communi ties, non-governmental organisations, the medical community, governments and multilateral or ganisations to improve existing initiatives and identify new opportunities. GSK held the chairmanship of the AAI during 2004 and coordinated a process to review the initiative and ensure that it is as effective as possible in the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 61Leadership and advocacy 5.2 Patient Advocacy Patient adv ocacy groups provide their members with support and information on how to live with their disease, repr esent patient views and lobby on issues affecting patients' interests. They are an important stakeholder for GSK and we engage with them as part of our ai m to be a patient-focused company. Our annual Patient Advocacy Leadership Summit (PALS) is one of the ways we do this. The summit includes a foru m for patient groups to learn more about GSK and tell us how we can bette r support their work. There are a range of workshops for attendees includ ing sessions on media training and sharing best practice. Throughout the summi t attendees receive information on GSK patient programmes, such as our Orange Card or disease management programmes. In 2004, PALS was extended from t he US to include patient groups worldwide. Over 400 people atten ded from 23 countries. Attendees represented 233 different advocacy organisa tions including those dedicated to mental health, HIV/AIDS , respiratory diseases, epileps y, cancer, bone and joint diseas es and diabetes. Feedback from the event was very posit ive. For example 90% of attendees from Europe felt the event had been eit her an excellen t or a good investment of their time. It also highlighted the ke y priorities for pa tients - more R&D, better information about their dis ease and access to the best available treatment. GSK has a dedicated Global Adv ocacy Te am which contributes to planning PALS and co-ordinates our interact ion with patient groups. We have developed a code of conduct to guide our work with patient groups and a Patient Adv ocacy Manual of best practice for employees . This work is part of a company-wide effort. Other initiatives include 'Focus on the Patient' in R&D (see Focus on the Patient in the website for more information). www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 62Leadership and advocacy 5. 3 GSK's Unique Business Model for Vaccines GSK's new rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix , received its first launch in Mexico in January 2005. As well as Mexico, Rotarix will be launched in other Latin American countries during 2005 and soon afte r in Asia Pacific countries. It has already been submitted for regulatory approval in more than 20 countries worldwide. Rotavirus infection is the leading c ause of severe diarrhoea and vomiting (gastroenteritis) in children under two. It affects children all over the world but is rarely fatal in developed countries. Howev er in developing countries around 600,000 children die from rotavirus each year. This is the first time that a major pharmaceutical company has focused the clinical and regulatory st rategy for a vaccine first on a region of the world other than the European Un ion or US. The launch is part of GSK's unique strategy to deliv er vaccines first to people with the greatest medical need. \"GSK has a solid track record of provid ing vaccines globally for more than 20 years and is constantly developing novel and unique approaches to ensure new vaccines get to those areas of the world who need them most as fast as possible\", said Jean St \u00e9phenne, Pres ident and General Manager of GSK Biologic als. \"In the case of Rotarix , we focused our clinical and regulatory strategy first on countries where the medical need for a rotavirus vaccine was one of the highest in the world.\" Rotarix was tested in the largest phase III clinical trial ever performed for a vaccine. It i nvolved 70, 000 children, mostly in Latin America and Asia but also in US and Europe. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 63Leadership and advocacy 5.4 Science Policy Conferences GSK R&D is sponsoring a series of annual science policy conferences in the UK on issues relating to the conduct of pharmaceutical and biomedical research. The aim is to promot e discussion and dialogue between key stakeholders including policy makers, r egulators, pharmaceutical c ompanies, scientists, doctors and patient groups. The first conference took place in 2003 and was organised in conjunction wit h the Department of Health and the Nationa l Institute for Clini cal Excellence. It focused on how medicines are evaluat ed by regulators, pharmaceutical companies, patients and other stakeholder s and looked at how the current system cou ld be improved to address m edical needs more effectively. It highlighted a potentiall y important role for the NHS as a source of research data for evaluating medicines in clin ical pra ctice. In 2004 the conference was organised with the Department of Health and the Academy of Medical Sciences. It l ooked at issues influe ncing the quality of clinical res earch in the UK includi ng the regulatory fr mechanism s, sion of infras tructure and the im portance of adequate career development and trai ning provisions. It highlighted actions needed to improve clinical research for the benefit of patients, for example, the need to increase patient involvement by putting more information on clinic al research into the public domain. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 64Leadership and advocacy 5.5 Importation of Medicines The price of brand name prescri ption drugs is often lower in other countries than in the US. For this reason, some people in the US have started to buy prescription drugs from abroad, oft en over the internet. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), whic h has not approved the drugs that foreign vendors offer for sale to Americans, has war ned that this is illeg al and unsafe. GSK has consistently opposed this practi ce because of the increased safety risks to pati ents. Our view of the ri sks was confirmed in 2004 by a report fro m the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Task Force on Drug Importation, chaired by the Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona. The task force looked at safety issues around illegal dr ug importation and the potential for cost savings to be made if the practice were made legal. The full report can be found online at http://www.hhs.gov/importtaskforce/. According to the report, drugs imported by consumers come into the US from a wide range of countries. These drugs are typically not approved by the FDA and may fail to conform in many aspects to the FDA-approved drugs available in the US. Specifica lly, the report found that , \"Importation increases the opportunities for counterfeit and other substandard drugs to enter and be dispersed into the US drug dist ribution system... Ameri can consumers currently purchasing drugs from overseas are generally doing so at significant risk.\" The Task Force conclu ded that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult \" to ensure that drugs i mported by individual c onsumers meet the necessary standards for safety certification. Noting that t he FDA does not have sufficient resource now to ensure the safety of personally imported drugs, the Report concludes that, \"There is no realistic level of res ources that could ens ure that personally imported drugs are adequately in spected to assure thei r safety since visual inspection, testing and oversight of a ll personally import ed prescription drugs are not feasible or practical at this time.\" The Task Force report states that there are a number of new anti- counterfeiting technologies in developm ent that, once they are universally adopted, may provide assurance on the sa fety and authenticity of prescription medicines. Howev er it noted that, \" widespread adoption of authentication technologies, while theoretically able to secure the US drug supply, is a daunting task that could rais e the cost of imported dr ugs thereby reducing any expected savings from importati on\". The report concludes that the cost of carrying out safety checks on imported medicine, and profits going to middlem en, would in large part offset the potential savings from differences in prevailing prices. Based on an analysis of actual data on drug prices and volume s, the Task Force found that, \"Total savings to drug buyers from legalised commercial importation would be one to two percent of total drug spending and much less than international price www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 65comparisons might suggest. The savings going directly to individuals would be less than one per cent of total spending. Most of the savings would likely go to third party payers, such as insurance companies and HMOs.\" The report findings have confirmed our view that patients should stick to trusted methods for saving money on appr oved medicines, such as savings cards, that are legal and safe. GSK is sensitive to patients' concerns over costs and the lack of prescription drug coverage for the uninsured in the US. That is why we led the industry in establishing the first prescription savings card - the Orange Card - and are a founding member of the Together Rx programme. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 67 6.4 Communi ty Partner ships 6.5 Suppor ting Educa tion 6.6 Employ ee Involvement 6.3 Maj or Public Health Ini tiatives 6.2 Humanitarian Relief 6.1 Val ue of Commun ity Investment 6.

Credit with Education, an initiativ e by Freedom from Hunger, aims to break the cycle of poverty an d ill health by providing financial services and education for poor women. GSK's Afric an Malaria Partnership is funding a new malaria education programme as part of this project. Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, is benefiting. Poor women in rural areas can access small loans, savings facilities and other financial services by joining their v illage credit association. They meet regularly to make loan repayments and learn about issues from basic business s kills to child nutrition and family plannin g. Malaria preve ntion and treatment is a recent addition. It is es timated that in Africa a child dies from malaria ev ery 30 seconds but many people are unaware t hat malaria is spread by mosquitoes feeding at night. The malaria education teaches women how to prevent infection by using ins ecticide-treated bednets , and to re cognise early signs of malaria. Kiswenside is one woman who has benefited. She trades soap and clothing and through the credit associatio n was able to save part of her weekly incom e to purchase an insecticide-treated bednet. \"Now even though it is very hot, w e accept that we must sl eep under a net. I feel a great satisfaction an d a little pride that I can make positive changes in my life,\" she says. The malaria educatio n module is expec ted to reach half a million people by 2006 in six West African countries: B enin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, 2004 70Community 6.1 Value of Community Investment GSK donations were valued at \u00a33 28 million ($600 millio n) in 2004, and supported programmes in more than 100 count ries. This is equivalent to 5.4% of pre-tax profits. This figure inclu des medicines wort h \u00a3203.5 million ($3 72 million) donated to low-inc ome patients in the US thr ough our Patient Assistance Programs, and \u00a350 million ($92 millio n) of humani tarian product donations for under-served communities around the world. Product donations are valued at wholes ale acquis ition cost. This is the wholesale list price, not includi ng discounts, which is the standard pharmaceutical industry method for valuing product donations. Our total community investment also includes \u00a317.7 milli on ($32 million) in manageme nt costs and \u00a348.4 million ($89 million) in cash grants. GSK is a member of the UK's Per cent Club for companies which donate at least 1% of their pre-tax profits to c haritable c auses. GSK is regularly one of the top companies in the UK's Guar dian Giv ing List which lists FTSE 100 companies by the percent age of pre-tax profits c ontributed to charitable causes.

We report our donations in line with the guide lines set by the CECP, which values our medicines at wholesale acquisition cost, in line with other pharmaceutical companies. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 72Community 6.2 Humanitarian Relief Link to updated stories in the website GSK donates essential products, such as antibiotics, to help humanitarian relief efforts in disaster zones and to support basic healthcare provision for impoverished communities. Donations are made at the request of government s and major charitable organisations and may be manufactured s pecifically for these partners. GSK works in partnership with relief charities that have experience in delivering humanitarian aid, includi ng AmeriCares, Direct Relief, InterChurch Medical As sistance, MAP Inte rnational and Project HOP E. Activity During 2004 During 2004 we donated life-saving medicine s to support relief efforts in over 100 countries. Immediate supplies of antibiotics and bas ic medicines were sent in response to the devastating tsunami in South East Asia, severe flooding in Banglades h, the humanitari an crisis in Sudan and the hurricanes which affected Central Americ a, the Caribbean and the US. We donated more than 3.6 millio n doses of antibiotics and 600,00 0 vials of vaccines to prevent the spread of infecti ous diseases in countries affected by the tsunami. We have also committed \u00a32 million ($3.7 mi llion) to support organisations working on relief operat ions in the disaster area. The total value of our humanitarian product donations in 2004 was \u00a350 millio n ($92 millio n), based on wholesa le acquis ition cost. The amount supplie d each year varies according to demand. GSK is a member of the Partnership for Quality M edical Donations (PQMD), an alliance of pharmaceutical com panies and humanitarian agencies that works to encourage the donation and timely deliv ery of appropriate medicines to people in need. GSK follows the WH O guidelines for product donations. In 2005 we will contin ue our product donation programme for humanitarian relief though the amount of product m ade available varies each year in response to both variable demand and availability of product. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 73Community 6.3 Major Public Health Initiatives Learn more about major public health initiatives in the website GSK supports public health initiative s in developing countries through donations of medicines, fi nancial and practical support. We focus on efforts to tackle three major diseases - lymphatic filariasis (LF or elephantias is), HIV/AIDS and malaria - as well as our PHASE edu cation programme to reduce dia rrhoea-related disease. Progress During 2004 Eliminating Ly mphat ic Filariasis (LF) Learn more about eliminating LF in the website GSK is a founding partner in the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF (http://www.filariasis.org/ ). LF is a disfiguring di sease pr evalent in tropical countries and one of the world's leading causes of permanent disability. The Global Allia nce is a partnership between pharmaceu tical companies, the World Health Organisation, Ministries of Health, NGOs and community organisations, aiming to totally eliminate LF by 2020. We have committed to provide as many doses of albendazole, our anti- parasitic drug used to prevent transmi ssion of LF, as are needed to treat the one billion people at risk in 80 countries. In 2004 we donated 67 millio n albendazo le treatments, worth \u00a37 million ($13 million), valued at wholesale price s, to 34 countries. Demand from some countries was lower than anticipat ed in 2004 due to problems extending programmes to new regions. We have donat ed 307 million alben dazole treatments since 1998 and ov er 85 millio n people hav e benefited from this programme. We also gave \u00a31 millio n ($1.8 million) in grants during 20 04 to support the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF an d a team of dedicated GSK employees helps in its advocacy, research, community mobilis ation and educ ation initiativ es. The rate of LF infection has already dropped in many participating countries. For example, Egypt began a nationwide campaign to eliminate LF in 2000. Since then 2.4 million people have received treatment, over 90% of those at risk of infection. Infecti on rates have fa llen dramatically over the same period. During 200 5 the Egyptian govern ment will be evaluatin g the impact of the programme to decide whether to c ontinue the prevent ative treatment campaign. During 2004 we expanded our manufacturing site in Cape Town, South Africa, to produce albendazol e tablets and help us deliver enough www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co to support elimin ation efforts in all at-risk countries. This facility is expected to start producing alben dazole for Africa in 2005. Positive Action on HIV/AIDS Learn more about Positive Action in the website GSK provid es HIV/AIDS medicines at preferentia l prices to developing countries (see Access to Medicines in the website). We also support communities affected by HIV/AIDS through Pos itive Action, part of our community investment. Se t up in 1992 Positiv e Action recognises that the involvement of people affected by HIV and AIDS is a key element in helping control the HIV pandemic. During 2004 Positive Action supported 32 programmes in 35 countries in partnersh ip with 23 community organisations. The impact of HIV/AID S is exac erbated by HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination - a major barrier to people accessing healthcare. Positive Action seeks to strengthen the responses of and promote access to care and treatment for the most vulnerable comm unities affected by HIV/AIDS. One example was a grant of \u00a3115,000 ( $210,000) to enable people liv ing with HIV/AIDS and community leaders to attend the 15th International AIDS Conferenc e in Bangk ok, Thailand. This was an important opportunity for community organisations to share ex perienc es and ideas and participate in technical workshops to build skills and improve AIDS services in their home countries. Such conferences provide a plat form for community representatives to voice the needs of their home countries and to champion equitable rights and access to healthcare for people living with HIV/AIDS. We expanded Positive Action during 2004 to new countries in Latin America, Asia, and central and Eastern Europe, in response to growing rates of HIV infection in these areas. This includ ed seed funding to estab lish AIDS Action Europe (AAE), a new pan-Europ ean HIV organisation. This conso rtium will help to mobilise resources for the fight against HIV and support new awareness and prevention campaigns, particularly in count ries that have recently joi ned the European Union. In Latin America, we extended Positive Action to Bolivia, Argentina and Peru, building on our successful programmes in other Latin American countries. These programmes provide at-risk communities with ac curate and up-to-date information on HIV/AIDS and healthcare rights. We also launched Positive Action at Wo rk with the National AIDS Trust, UK, and the Kenya HIV/AIDS Business C ouncil to help businesses dev elop education and awareness programmes to prevent discrimination and help support employees affected by HIV/AIDS. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 75 GSK's African Malaria Partnership Learn more about GSK's African Malaria Par tnership in the website Our African Malaria Partnership is supporting education and behav iour change programmes i n eight African countries, through partnerships with three non profit organisations - Fr eedom from Hunger, AMREF (African Medical and Research Foundatio n) and Plan International. GSK is inv esting $1.5 million (\u00a38 20,000) in the African Malaria Par tnership over three years. This is expec ted to benefit two million people by encouraging effective prevention and pr ompt treatment, particularly among children and pregnant women. One of the programmes s upported through the partnersh ip is the Credit with Education programme, which provides small loans, business and health education to very poor women. During 2004, Senegal was added to the five West African countries already pa rticipating in the programme. See Tackling Poverty and Malaria in West Africa in the website for more information. In 2005 we intend to continue support fo r community-based malaria education and behav iour change programmes. Personal Hy giene & Sanitation Education (PHASE) Learn more about PHASE Every year more than tw o million people die of di arrhoea-related disease, mostly children in dev eloping countries. These deaths can often be easily prevented through better handwashing and s anitation. PHASE is an education programme hel ping to reduce diarrhoea-related disease by encouraging school children to wash their hands. GSK established PHASE in 1998 and h as invested \u00a31.5 millio n ($2.7 million) in the programme. PHASE is run in partnership with AMRE F and Plan International - as well as Ministries of Health and Education. PHASE currently operates in five countries - Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Nicaragua and Peru - reaching mo re than 300,000 children and their extend ed families. Th e programme has had impressive results. For example , studies show that diarrhoea rate s have fallen by 40% following the introduction of PHASE to schools in the Kenyan community of Ongielo. In 2004 the Group committed three-year funding of \u00a3226,000 ($414,000) to extend the programme into Uganda in partnership with the Ministry of Health and AMREF. GSK has convened a PHASE steering co mmittee with representatives from the countries and partners involv ed to identify new partners and help expan d the programme into new countries. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 76Community 6.4 Community Partnerships Learn more about community par tnerships in the website We support a wide range of health and educ ation initiatives in the communities where we operate. D onations ar e made centrally and by GSK sites to support local charities an d good causes. Below are just a few examples of the many community partnerships we supported in our four ma in regions during 2004. Europe Barretstown in Ireland and L'Env ol in Franc e are residential camps where seriously ill children can have fun and develop their self confidence. GSK gave \u00a3250, 000 ($458,000) and \u00a3100,000 ($183,000) respectively, to support the camps in 2004. Employees als o give their time to Barretstown and L'Env ol - with over 40 GSK employees participating in 2004. Three new European programmes were l aunched, each receiving a grant of \u00a3300,000 ($549,000) over three years. These were: Change in Advance, a disease prev ention pr ogramme that promotes healthy eating and exercise, aimed at Slovakian children living on urban hous ing estates a programme in Spain that provi des healthc are for homeless and abandoned children Multi Coloured Lives, an interact ive education programme to help children with disabilitie s integrate into Russian society Internatio nal GSK contributed \u00a3100,000 ($183,000) to the Int egrated Manageme nt of Childhood Illness es (IMCI) initiative in Ethiopia, in partnership wit h WHO and UNICEF. IMCI aims to reduce ch ildhood deaths from preventable and treatable conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles, and malnutritio n. It helps families to impr ove the health of their childre n through better nutrition and healthcare. In Vietnam GSK is supporting the '500 Ethnic Midwives' initiative with $335,000 (\u00a3183,000) in funding. The funding is being used to build a training centre where 500 women fr om Vietnam's ethnic mino rity groups will becom e trained midwives. People from ethnic co mmunities often live in poor rural areas where there is little access to healthcar e services. The new midwives will play an import ant role helping to improve mo ther and child health in their home towns. UK GSK supports over 70 c haritable organisations in the UK. In 2004 this included ov er \u00a3500,000 ($915,000) to s upport medical research undertaken by the charities Breakthrough Breast C ancer, Cystic Fibrosis Trust, DEBRA, Ehlers-Danlos Support Group and the Neurone Disease Ass www.g sk.com GSK grant of \u00a3386,000 ($706,000) over two years will sup port the British Lung Foun dation's Ba by Breathe Easy pr ogramme. It will fund a pilot scheme which will be run in nine regions across the U K supporting parents and carers of young babies and c hildren under fi ve in dealing with diagnosed and undiagnos ed recurring chest problems. US GSK is donating $350, 000 (\u00a3191,000) over three years to the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. The Instit ute provides health education for low- income neighbourhoods in non-traditional venues, including African American and Afro-Caribbean c hurches, barber s hops, beauty salons, laundromats and tattoo parlours. It provides informa tion in English and Spanish to help promote early disease detection and encourage people in multi-ethnic communities to adopt healthier lifestyles. We continued our support for the Ch ildren's Health Fund's Referral Management Initiative (RMI). A three-y ear grant of more than $2 mi llion (\u00a31.1 million) is helping the RMI expand into sev en US states, helping high-risk and homeless children rec eive the specialist medical care they need. Foundations GSK does not operate a single charit able foundation for its community investment programmes but has a number of small country-based foundations in Canada, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and North Carolina in the US. Our local foundati ons support a wide range of charities and healthcare initiatives. Over the last six years, the GSK France Foundati on has supported a number of programmes in 12 African countries and Cambodia to improve HIV/AIDS prevention education, tr aining and care. By 2005 over 270,000 people are expected to have benefited. The GSK Foundation in Canada focuses much of its support on hospice care helping terminally ill p atients and thei r families. The Foundation is also supporting community programmes in Afri ca, including the extension of the PHASE project into Uganda. The North Carolina GSK Foundation in the USA is an endowed, self-funding organisation. It supports initiatives in the areas of mathematics, science and health education in North Carolina. In 2004, this Foundation awarded grants totalling $2. 8 millio Report 2004 78Community 6.5 Supporting Education GSK supports education in the UK and US with a particular emphasis on developing scientific lit eracy and encouragin g the next generation of scientists. During 2004 our programmes focused on ins piring childr en to take an interest in science and improving scienc e teaching. Science Education in the UK GSK is supporting the INSPIRE (IN novative Scheme for Post-doctoral researchers In Research and Educati on) scheme, developed in par tnership with Imperial College London an d the Specialist Schools Trust, with a \u00a31 million ($1.8 millio n) donati on ov er four years. INSPIRE aims to raise achievement by placing post-doctoral researchers in specialist science schools to train as teachers and support science teaching. We also gave \u00a3100,000 ($183,000) to s upport Science Across the World, an international education programme that enables school children in more than 100 countries to discuss science issues over the internet. Bio-Bubble is a giant, inflatable m odel of a human cell, developed by the Edinburgh International Science F estival and sponsored by GSK. During 2004, the Bio-Bubble toured schools ac ross the UK with two scienc e shows helping young people to learn about biology in a fun environment. GSK has committed \u00a31 millio n ($1.8 million) over four years to help build the new Darwin Centre at the Natural History Museum in London, that will en able better display of the museum 's important collection. Education in the US A three year grant of $ 300,000 (\u00a3164,000) from GSK is helping the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to increase the number of science teachers in the North Caroli na and Philadelphia areas. Science in the Summer, a free library -based science education programme in Philadelphia received a grant of $ 365,000 (\u00a3199,000). Now in its 19th year, Science in the Summer has reached over 68,000 children. Not all our support is focused on science education. We also provide more general support to help improve over all education standards. For example GSK gave a grant of $129, 000 (\u00a370,000) to the Phil adelphia Education Fund for the 'Middle Grade Matters' campai gn to improve GlaxoSmi thKline Co 2004 79Community 6.6 Employee Involvement GSK employees are encouraged to contribut e to their local communities as volunteers. Hundreds of employees give their time to good causes through our Days of Caring in the US, and to support science education to school children through our UK Science and Engi neering Ambassador Schem e and US Partnership for Educational Discovery. In September 2004 over 500 employees fr om six GSK sites in Germany gave their time to community projects as par t of a new 'Orange Day' initiative. The volunteers gave practical support to ov er 60 projects. Activities included constructing a bowling course at an ol d people's home, painting rooms in a women's s helter, and helping a local charity develo p a marketing and PR plan. In the UK and US we also make cash donations to charities where employees have done voluntary work. During 2004, our GSK Investment in Vo lunteer Excellence (GIVE) programme gave over $350,000 (\u00a3191,000) to 700 char itable organisations in the USA where employees or their partners vo lunteered at least 50 hours during the year. In the UK our Making a Differ ence programme provided grants of \u00a3269,000 ($492,000) to over 400 charities, based on employee involvement. In many countries we also encourage employees to donate money to charity by matching the money they give or by pr oviding tax-efficient ways for them to make a donation, in accordance with local taxation guidelines. In 2004 in the USA, GSK matched donations by 15,800 employees and retirees at a value of over $4million (\u00a32.2 million). In addition, GSK gave $1.3million (\u00a3710,000) to match donations by GSK employees through the GSK and United Way campaign: \"One thKline Co www.g sk.com - thKline Co Engageme With Stakeho lders Engagement 7 Engagement With S takeholders 7.1 Engagem ent on Corporate Responsibilit y 7.2 Engagem ent With Investors Corporate responsibility principle We want to understand the concerns of those with an interest in corporate responsib ility issues. We will en gage with a range of stakeholders and will communicate openly about how we are addressing CR is sues, in ways that aim to meet the needs of different groups while allowing us to pursue legitimate business goals. Engaging with the different groups that have an interest in the way GSK operates is an important part of re sponsible business practice. These stakeholders include employees, investor s, patients, doctors, governments and NGOs. By listening to them and being open about our views and actions we can build trust and address their concerns. Much of thi s discussion takes place in the normal course of business. For example our scientists meet regularly with academics, researchers and other pharmaceutical companies as part of their work. Through our access to medicine programmes and community invest ment we collaborate closely with NGOs, multilateral agencies, gov ernm ents and community groups. More information is available on stakeholder co nsultation in the followin g sections: Access to Medicine, Animal Res earch, EHS Management, Leadership and Advocacy, and Suppliers in the website. We interact with governments to give our views on polic y issues affecting GSK and the pharmaceutical industry. We engage with governmen ts directly or through membership of trade organisati ons, such as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Association of the British Pha rmaceutical I ndustry (ABPI). Our size and glo bal reach g ive us access to policy makers and we recognis e that we need to use this responsibly to benefit pat ients and our busin ess. More i nformation on our approach to external relations is availabl e at External Affairs in the website. We also meet with some stakeholders spec ifically to discuss corporate responsibility issues. Their feedback informs our approach to managing and reporting on these subjects. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 82This section focuses on our CR engagement . It covers our activities in 2004 including: Our CR survey of key stakeholders Engagement with socially res ponsible investment analysts Case study Investor Briefing on R&D Animal res earch is one of the issues that socially responsible investment analysts look at when evaluating pharmace utical companies for inclusion in their investment funds. They need to be confident that there is robust justification for animal use, animal welf are is a high prior ity during research and that GSK is doing all it can to reduce, replace and r efine the use of animals in r esearch. We welcome engagement on thi s issue and are keen to explain our approach. In April 200 4 GSK held a briefing for 14 SR I analysts at our research facility in Harlow, UK . The aim was to illus trate the role of animals in research, expla in that animal testing is a small but important part of the overall drug development process, and demonstrat e our animal welf are standards. The analys ts visited the animal resear ch laboratory at Harlow, saw the animals us ed in research and their accommodation and had the opportunity to question laboratory staff. They also visited the high throughput chemistry laboratories and viewed some of the new technology introduced to reduce animal testing such as the animal MRI scanner. Feedback from the event was positive: \"Not only did it usefully provide a clear insight into how the animals are cared fo r it also provided in depth information on the processes and work behind drug discovery and development,\" said one SRI analyst. For more information on our approach to animal research see Research and Innovation in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 83Engagement 7.1 Engagement on Corporate Responsibility Dialogue with stakeholders allows us to understand their concerns and ideas and helps to set the strategic cor porate responsib ility a genda in GSK. In 2004 we commissioned a survey of 50 opi nion leaders in Europe, the UK and US. Participants included academi cs, CR organisat ions, customers, government agencies, investors, the m edia, multilateral agencies and NGOs. The survey sought their views on our performance on social and ethical issues and our CR reporting. Environment al issues were not covered because they are addressed by a separate stakeholder panel. The survey provided in-depth qualitat ive feedback but was not designed to produce statistics. The responses gave us a clear indic ation of how GSK is perceived and the areas that stak eholders consider im portant. CR Survey Findings The participants were asked to identify the key CR priorities for GS K and the four considered most material for GSK were: Access to medicines in the developing world Marketing ethics Clinical trials (how they are c onducted and transparenc y of results) Access to medicines in developed countries Access to Medicines Access to medicines in developing countries was seen as the single most important issue. GSK was seen to be doi ng well in this area. Our programmes - preferenti al pricing, research into diseases of the developing world and community investment - were generally rated highly. The issue of access to medicines in developed countries was a growing concern for many parti cipants. Ther e were positive and negative views on GSK's performance in this area. Gener ally participants felt that the pharmaceutical industry should be doing more to improve access for the poor in the developed world. Ethical Issues A number of participants raised issues about our business practices. The publicity associated with GSK's antidepress ant Paxil/Seroxat increased concerns about marketing practices and the conduct of clinical trials and disclos ure of results. Res pondents would lik e to see these issues covered in more depth and how we are addressing them. Animal res earch was also raised as an important iss ue for GSK and our stakeholders gave a positive response to our performance and reporting on www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate 84this issue. Interviewees liked the leve l of disclosure and t he reasoning given. See Animal Research in the website. CR Rep orting Participant s were asked to comment on our 2003 CR Report. It was felt that the report covered the material issues for GS K and they were positive about GSK's commitment to annual CR reporting. The majority of stakeholders thought GSK's reporting would be im proved by increasing the number of performance indic ators, providing information on future plans for key issues and increasing transparenc y by tackling controversial issues in a more direct way. Many participants felt that our se parate CR and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) reports made it harder for them to assess our overall performance. Several par ticipants wanted to see more information on the impact of our access to medicine programmes, with cl earer informati on on the scale of the health problems that our programmes are addressing. Emerging Issues Over the Next 5-15 Years Participant s felt that access to medici nes in develo ping countries will continue to be the biggest issue for GSK, but drug pricing in developed count ries will come under greater scrutiny. Ethical iss ues around clinical trials, marketing, and R&D will a lso be signific ant. How We Are Responding to Stakeholder s The stakeholder survey has provided us with useful feedback and we are grateful to all the opinion leaders for their views. We have been able to respond to some feedback immediately. For example we have now fully integrated our EHS reporting into the Corporate Respons ibility report. In this repor t we have increased the number of performance indicators . We will conti nue to review and a dd to them as appropriate in future reports , though it is important to remember that not all CR issues are amenable to numerical indic ators or objectives. We believe that our existing programmes in the two highest priority areas - access to medicines and ethics - ar e substantial and appropriate. We have improved access to clinical trial results with the launch of our clinical trial register in the website. Sometimes we receive feedback and suggest ions from stakeholders that we disagree with or are unable to accomm odate without damaging the interests of the company and its shareholders. W here possible we explain the reasons for this, for examp le the need to use animals in research. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, particularly opinion leaders, to gauge the success of our CR programmes. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 85Engagement 7.2 Engagement With Investors Investors are taking a growing intere st in the corporate responsibility performance of companies, both as a measure of the l ong term sustainab ility of the business and to decide which companies should be included in their Socially Responsible In vestment (SRI) funds. GSK provides information to these investors in a number of ways. We meet regularly with SRI analysts to discuss CR iss ues and respond to their requests for information. Du ring 2004 we had more than 40 meetings with these analysts and discussed issues including acc ess to medicines, animal rights, supply chain, sales and ma rketing ethics and clinical trials. We also held several events for S RI analysts to meet and discuss issues with senior management: our CR day for SRI analysts in London was attended by 28 analysts and 15 senior GSK managers 14 analysts visited our research labor atories in Harlow where they viewed the high throughput chem istry laboratory, the ani mal research laboratory and viewed s ome of the new technology introduced as part of our commitm ent to the 3Rs (see Investor Briefing on R&D in the website) 13 SRI and mainstream investor s visited our Barnard Castle manufacturing site in the UK to find out about quality control and environme ntal initiativ es. Some investment and research organisa tions collect performance i nformation via questionnaires. These are used to rate GSK's CR performance and to vet GSK for inclusion in CR indic es. GSK is included in the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report STANDARDS ETHICAL CONDUCT www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 878 Standards of Ethical Conduct 8.4 Monitoring and Compliance 8.3 Training an d Awareness 8.2 Manageme nt Certification on Business Ethi cs8.1 Code of Conduct Ethics 8 Standards of Ethical Conduct Corporate responsib ility principle We expect employees to meet high et hical standards in all aspects of our business, by conducting our activities with honesty and integrity, adhering to our corporate responsibilit y principles, and complying with applic able laws and regulat ions. GSK products are important to the health of people around the world, so it is particularly important that we oper ate to high ethical standards, act responsibly and comply with the law. GSK is fully committed to ensuring that all our business practices meet high standards and that our employees behave ethically and honestly. We have clear and comprehens ive policies and procedures, backed by training and monitoring to help us do this. This section explains our approach and our performance in 2004. It covers: - Our Code of Conduct - Management certificati on on business ethics - Training and awareness programmes - Monitoring and compliance systems Information on ethical issues in sales and marketing is covered in Products and Customers in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 88 Case Study Ethics Training for A dministrative Staff Business ethics is the responsibility of everyone at GSK, not just senior managers. In July 2004 we held an ethics seminar for our administrative support staff at GSK Hous e in London. The aim was to raise awareness of our E mployee Guide to Business Conduct and show how ethics are relevant to administrative assistants -- for example, when t hey are handling budgets, dealing wit h suppliers and checking correspondence. The seminar was organised by the GSK House Admin Community and presented by a senior vice president in our legal department. The session highlighted potential ethica l conc erns around gifts and entertainment, and was attended by 55 people. A variety of situations were discuss ed where support staff might need to recognise an ethical dilemma and act with integrity. For example, assistants deal with post and will often be the first to see any letters reporting suspected misconduct. They need to deal with these letters promptly, forward them to the right people and treat them confidentially. A similar ethics seminar is planned for US administrators during 2005. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 89Ethics 8.1 Code of Conduct Download t he GSK Employee Guide to Bus iness Conduct in the website Our Employee Guide to Business Conduct contains the company polic ies that set out the standards of behav iour we expect from em ployees. It requires all employees to act with i ntegrity, comply wit h the law, avoid conflicts of interest and report any violations or unethical behaviour. Detailed guidance is pr ovided, inc luding real-life examples, on what constitutes acceptable or unaccept able behaviour. GSK employees have access to the guide via the company intranet. Our induction training familiarises new emplo yees with busi ness co nduct standards and where they can obtain support and guidanc e. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 90Ethics 8.2 Management Certification on Business Ethics Commitment to our Code of Conduct is reinforced by an annual m anagement certification programme. This requires our top managers to ce rtify that they comply with the statement below. Ce rtification documentation is managed electronically and is followed up to ensure completion. In 2004 over 9,600 managers completed the certification. The full certification stat ement is reproduced below. \"I cer tify th at: I understand that GSK is committ ed to the principle of \"Perform ance with Integrity,\" and in particular, to ensuring that its activities com ply with all ap plicable laws.

Exceptions (list any compliance is sues that should hav e been reported previously but were not):\" www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 91Ethics 8.3 Training and Awareness We have training and awareness progra mmes to make sure employees understand our codes and pol icies, comply with t he law and know what standards of behaviour are required. Our global induction course includes tr aining on our Code of Conduct. This ensures new employees understand the im portance of ethical conduct from day one, know how to deal with potent ial dilemmas and know wher e to seek help. We provide additional training for employees who will be wor king in areas where there are particular conc erns, such as sales and marketing and research and development in the website . In addition, we provide training and workshop s to keep employees up to date with changes and to reinforce key elements in GSK policies. Progress During 2004 During 2004 over 50 training work shops we re held in our International region and Japan (which inc ludes all our operat ions outside Europe and the US). These cov ered a range of business ethics issues including conflict s of interest, competition law, corporat e governance, gifts and entertainment, marketing practices, record keeping, and reporting legal or ethical concerns. The workshops presented employees with examples of ethical dilemmas they could face in their work and asked them to consider how they would respond. Guidance was then provided to help people understand appropriate responses. In R&D, an e-learning module ent itled 'Performing with Integrity' was launched. At present, approximately 19,000 GSK employees are enrolled on the course and over 9,700 succes sfully completed it by the end of 2004. Performing with Integrity encompasse s training on the Code of Co nduct, Conflicts of Interest and Acceptance of Gifts and Entertainment by GSK employees. Objectives for 2005 We plan to develop and deliver additi onal training on ethics and complianc e. In particular we are developing training that reinforces employee obligations under the Employee Guide to Business Conduct and the risks associated with non-compliance. In 2005 we expect to devel op and deliv er this training course to staff in corporate functions (including Finance, HR, IT and Communic ations). www.g sk.com Report 2004 92Ethics 8.4 Monitoring We monitor awareness of ethical iss ues and company polic ies through our Integrity Helplines, reporting channels and regular surveys. As part of our commitment to cont inuous im provement, we benchmark our complianc e programme against other ma jor companies, our industry peers and government and regulatory standards. Monitoring A wareness of Ethical Issues Our Leadership Survey in 2004 included questions on business ethics. The survey was completed by over 9,500 managers and the results were encouraging: 91% of respondents felt that people in their department show commitment to performance with integrity 92% said they unders tood how the GSK Code of Conduct applied to their jobs 76% felt that they could report un ethical prac tices without fear of reprisal. These results help us to identify t he areas we need to focus on. Where necessary we direct ethics training to the business unit s that scored lower than average on these questions . GSK Corporate Ethics and Compliance function GSK has a dedicated c omplianc e functi on that works with the GSK business units to identify compliance issues and how to address them. In 2004 we increased the number of full-time compli ance officers fro m four to ei ght. Complianc e officers are all senio r level managers, with direct access to the leadership teams of GSK f unctions. They are a s ource of expertise and a point of contact for anyone with a ques tion on ethics or complianc e with GSK policies. Complianc e officers are also responsib le for defining the training needs of their section of the organisation and communicating the latest news, policies and legislat ion affecting GSK. Reporting Concerns Employees are encouraged to seek help and to report any concerns or suspected cases of mi sconduct. They can do this through their line management, a compliance officer, or through our confidential Integrity Helplines or offsite post office box. The Helplines and post office box ar e promoted through the Employee Guide to Busines s Conduct, on the GSK intranet and during training. The Corporate Ethics and Complianc e function is promot ed as a source of information and www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 93advice, as well as a mechanism fo r reporting concerns. Data from 2004 suggest employees understand this and see it as a useful source of advice and guidance. During 2004 there were 2, 580 contacts w ith the compliance functions of which 75% were from empl oyees seeking advice or information. The remaining 25% were from empl oyees reporting suspected cases of misconduct. Addressin g Misconduct Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance depar tment ensures that all allegations and suspec ted cases of misconduct are investigated. We are commi tted to taking firm steps to stop misconduct. Disci plinary action, up to and including dismissal, is taken where necessary. Data on dis ciplinary actions have traditionally been collec ted and held by local human resources departments w here it is of most operational value to the company. In 2004 we began to collate this information for t he first time and have collec ted data from all our major business units (including Pharmaceuticals, Manufacturing, Corpor ate, Consumer Healthcare and R&D). We believe the data to be a reasonable reflection of 2004. During this process we identified ways to improve the cat egorisation of disciplinary actions and the mechanics of the data collation. This will improve the quality of data in future repo rts. In 2004 there were 954 disciplinary actions taken as a result of investigations into allegations of misconduct. This in cluded 256 dismis sals and separations. Other disciplinary actions included ver bal and written warnings, and in some cases, financial penalt ies. Employees st aying with the company received re- training and increased monitoring. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 959.3 T raining and Auditing for Cli nical Trials9.

We will ens ure that our products ar e subject to rigorous scientific evaluation and testing for safe ty, effectiveness and quality. We will co mply with or exceed all regulation s and legal standards applicable to the research and development of our products. Research and development (R&D) of new medicines an d vaccines is at the core of our business, and makes a si gnificant contribution to society. New drugs have brought huge benefits to the health and quality of life of millions of people ove r the last 100 years. But continued R&D remains as important as ever. Th ere are still many serious, debilitat ing and life threatening illness es for which there are no effective tr eatments or where treatments could be signi ficantly improved. In 2004 we invested \u00a32.8 billion ($5.1 b illion) in R&D. Nearly 15,000 people work in R& D at GSK. There are many ethical concerns relating to biomedic al and pharmaceutical research - from the use of new technol ogies to the objective reporting of clinical trial results. GSK is committ ed to the highest ethical and s cientific standards in all our R&D work. This se ction explains our approach to animal research, the conduct of clinical trials and the public dis closure of clinical trial results. For information on our approac h to new technologies see Ethical Issues in R&D in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility 96Case Stud y Focus on the Patient \"Everything we do in Discovery Research can make a difference to patients - this is what motivates me,\" ex plains Karen Lackey, Director of Systems Chemistry in Discover y Research. Karen leads a group of 51 research chemists in the UK, US and Japan. They work at the beginning of the drug discovery pipeline, identifying and creating molecules that have the potential to bec ome new treatments. In her previous role in the organisation, her chemistry team was involved in disc overing the lapatinib molecule for use in breast cancer treatments which is now being tested in clinical trials. Karen believes that the introduction of Centre s of Excellence for Drug Discovery (CEDD) at GSK has had an important impact. CEDDs bring together a range of experts in a partic ular dis ease area to speed up the drug discovery process. \"The way GSK R&D is set up helps us to prioritise our efforts and ensure that we discov er the most effective medicines. Through the CEDDs, researchers have acces s to exper ts in all our main therapeutic areas. They evaluate every molecule for its va lue to patients and help us to identify which on es will hav e the most impact.\" Jill an d Eric Wolford under stand the importance of th is better than most. In 1999 Jill was diagnos ed with breast canc er and under went nine months of intensive treatment including chem otherapy, radiati on and stem cell transplants. Now recov ered and back at work as an Associate Director at GS K's Global Clinical Operations Nort h America, she and her hus band Eric, also a GSK employee, are keen to talk about thei r experiences. They are meeti ng with R&D managers and leadership teams to talk about how Jill's illness has shaped their attitudes to life and work. This is part of GSK's Focus on the Patient, an initiative that aims to reinforce a patient centred culture ac ross R&D. Employees have the opportunity to hear from patients about their diseases, t he GSK treatments t hat have helped them and the new medicines they need. One of the goals is to motivate employees by reminding them of t he benefits they can bring to patients through their work. Jill welcom es this initiative. \"My fat her was a breast cancer survivor and I'm 99% sure I carry the breast cancer gene. So when I look at my kids I think 'Please someone find a cure for breast cancer'. For every case report form there is a person, fami ly and network of friends. We treat people not diseases and we need to remind ourselves of this the whole time.\" www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 97 Research 9.1 Animal Research Learn more about animal research in the website Animal res earch is essential to underst and disease and to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new medicines before they are given to people. Regulations require new medicines to be tested on animals before being tested on humans for safety reasons. Some vaccines have to be tested on animals each time a new batch is produced. We estimate that animal research accounts for around 5% of all GSK research expenditure. GSK has 13 animal research laboratories in Europe, Japan and the US. Some research (around 7% of our total anima l research) is conducted by external contractors on our behalf. Over 98% of the animals used in our laboratories are rodents (such as rats, mice, guinea pigs) and rabbits. The remain ing 2% includes fish, ferrets, pigs, dogs, cats and primates. Animals used in Research 2004 The Three Rs Our animal research laboratories are s ubject to strict internal and legal controls. GSK is committed to the 3Rs - reduction, re finement a nd replacement - and to achiev ing the highest standards of animal welfare. The 3Rs commit us to: reducing the number of animals used in eac h study; refining studies to minimise pain and maxi mise the information obtained from each anim al; and replacing animal studies with alternative methods wherever possible. We provide extensive t raining on t he 3Rs to all staff who are involve d in the care and use of animals, and we have a number of initiatives to increase awareness of animal welfare. For exam ple, we produce quarterly bulletins which review recently published journal and news items on these subjects. A UK-based 3Rs committee made up of GSK scientists, statisticians, senior managers, animal technicians and veteri narians encourages a 3Rs culture Co sponsibility Report 2004 98GSK through seminars and producti on and promotion of 'Recommended Practice' guidelines for scientific procedures and animal welfare. Our Animal Welfare Awards encourage employees to find alternatives to animal res earch. The awards, presented twice a year by GSK's R&D Chairman, recognise employees w ho have made outstanding adv ances in implementing the 3Rs. In 2004 awards were made for: refinement of an animal model to discover new trea tments for brain damage caused by strokes; innovative use of imaging systems to minimise animal use while accelerating drug development; use of computer-generated prediction models and cell and tissue cultures to replace animal testing. In Europe, we also giv e a GSK Laborat ory Animal Welfare each year to external researchers or laboratorie s for developing new techniques to implement the 3Rs. The prize this year was won for a proj ect that promoted improvements in husbandry and housin g for laboratory animals. This approach is having an impact. Desp ite a significant increase in R&D activity since 1994 the number of animals used by GSK is broadly similar to ten years ago.

Refined methods for collecting DNA from transgenic mice, that reduce animal stress and increase productivity. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 993. Developme nt of better facilities and refined procedures for ferrets and guinea pigs . Exchange of this kno wledge between GSK laboratories in different countries. Regulation and Internal Controls Our laboratories comply with strict national laws, guidelines and codes of conduct on animal welfare. Regulat ors carry out regular unannounc ed inspections of our sites to c heck standards of animal care. GSK labor atories, and any external labo ratories conducting research on our behalf, must also follow our Code of Pr actice on animal research. When GSK sponsors animal research at other compani es or institutions, we require that such entities meet all legal requir ements to conduct animal based research and we establis h to the best of our ab ility, that best practice standards for animal car e and use are followed. 'Best practice' is defined as a combinati on of what is currently known from the scientific lit erature, from published recommendations , and from the knowledge of experts from within and outside G SK. In addition, GSK expects these external collaborators to demonstrate applicat ion of best practice regarding animal res earch. Accreditation by the Association for the Accreditation and Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care International is one example of how this can be demonstrated. To ensure appropriate use of animals , all proposed animal tests must be reviewed by our Ethical Review Committee. We also obtain independent evaluation from the Association for Assessment & Accredita tion of Laboratory Animal Care (AAAL AC) Internationa l. Ten of our laboratories are accredited by AAALAC inclu ding a ll our animal laboratories in the UK and US. Our labor atories in Belgium, Italy and Spain achieved accreditation during 2004. Communicating Our Approach We believe it is important to explain the need for animal research and to be open about what we do. Our laboratories host visits from schools, colleges, animal welfare organisations and others. In 2004, we also made over 45 visits to UK and US schools to discuss iss ues around animal research. We are in regular disc ussions with ani mal welfare organisations, our investors and other interested parties. For example th is year we have contributed to the work of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and will be develop ing our relationship with the new UK national centre for the 3Rs (NC3Rs). www.g sk.com Report 2004 100Research 9.2 Conduct of Clinical Trials Learn more about clinical trials in the website The safety and effectiveness of new medi cines must be evaluated in clinic al trials before they can be approved for marketing. Regulators will only giv e approval if tr ials demonstrate that a product is safe and effective and that it s benefits outweigh any ri sks fro m potential side effects. A new prod uct will typically be tested thr ough three stages of clinic al trials. These involve both healthy indiv iduals and patients with the relevant disease. In 2004 there were 140 projects i n clinic al development. Traditionally most clinical trials have been carried out in Western Europe and the US. It is however becoming increas ingly challen ging to enrol sufficient patients in these countries as the increasing number and scale of trials is often utilising most of t he availab le investigat ors and patients. Therefore as clinical trial capabilities in Easter n Europe, Latin America and Asia have improved significantly in recent years, we are starting to conduct more trials in these regions. We also conduct a number of clinical trials in the least developed countries of the world to ev aluate medicines for diseases that disproportionately affect these countries. During any clinical trial the safety of participants and future patients is our first priority. All our trials, w herever they are conducted, are carried out according to international standards of good clin ical practice and applicable laws and regulations . The trial protocols are re viewed by external regulatory agencies in the relevant countries when requir ed and all protocols ar e considered by relevant ethical review committees whose remits cover the sites w here studies will take place. Safety dat a are routinely collected throughout development programmes and are repor ted to regulators in line with applicable regulations as well as being reviewed by GSK on an ongoing bas is for any safety signals. The GSK Global Saf ety Board is responsible both for approval of pivotal protocols and internal assessment of any issues related to patient safety that arise duri ng the development programme. Good Clinical Practice standards All clinic al trials are conducted accordi ng to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines developed by the Inter national Conference on Harmonis ation (ICH). These guidelines provide an internationally accepted ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials. They cover issues such as the selection and tr aining of trial investigators, gaining informed consent from trial participants, monitoring and quality as surance. All trials must be approved by an indepen dent ethics committee to ensure the trial is justified and that it is designed and will be conduc ted according to www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co 101appropriate ethical standards. These commi ttees have the power to reject or stop a clinical trial. An ethics commi ttee is typically composed of lay people, medical pr ofessionals and scientists. We conduct audit activities to ensure clinical trials are conducted to the appropriate standards, see Tr aining and Auditing for Clinical Trials in the website. Clinical Tr ials in East ern Europe, Latin A merica and Asia The pharmaceutical industry is starting to perform more trials in re gions such as Eastern Europe, Latin Am erica and parts of Asia. There are several reasons for this. Clinic al trial capab ilities in these regions have improved signific antly in recent y ears and trials in these countries can help to speed up the research proce ss and ensure new medicines get to patients more quickly. Fewer patients are enr olled into trials in these countries so it is easier and quic ker to find pati ents to participate. These patients have often used fewer medicines compared wit h those in Western Europe and the US. This makes them good candidates for a clinical trial because it is easier to assess the effect of the products being tested. Cost is also a factor, with operating c osts in these countries being lo wer. Our objective is to carry out more of our clinical trials in Eastern Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia by 2005. There are concerns that trials in t hese regions may not be carried out to the same high standards as those in Wester n Europe and the US. All GSK clinic al trials are carried out to the same standar ds of GCP everywhere in the world. This is vital to protect patients and ensure that we can gain regulat ory approval for new medicines. Clinical Trials in Diseases of the Developing World GSK has seven products in clinic al development for diseases that disproportionately affect the develop ing wor ld. For more on R&D for developing world diseases see Acce ss to Medicines in the website. Clinical trials for diseases of the de veloping world need to be carried out in countries where the disease is preval ent, and these can include some of the world's least-developed countries. All tria ls that we sponsor, irrespective of location, are conducted according to the standards applied in developed countries. In some of the least-developed countri es extra efforts may be required to ensure that we meet global standards. Fo r example, in areas with low literacy levels it can be difficult to obtain info rmed consent from tria l participants. In these cases investigators work with i ndependent witnes ses to make sure that the trial is properly explained to par ticipants and that they understand what is involv ed. For more information on our policy and procedures in this area see Clinica l Trials in the Developing World in the website . www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 102Research 9.3 Training and Auditing for Clinical Trials We provide training to ensure that clinic al trials are performed to high ethical and quality standards. We also audit the c onduct of clinical trials to ensure they are carried out according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. All employ ees involv ed in designing, conducting and monitoring GSK- sponsored trials are trained in GCP. Training is mandatory and employees must have completed the required traini ng before starting or changing jobs. In 2004 there were 11,239 training activities related to GC P. Each \"training activity\" represents a successful comp letion of an e-learning module or instructor-l ed course related to GCP by one of our empl oyees or complementary work ers. We keep detailed training records which are routinely requested b y regulatory authorities when undertaking an inspec tion to assess the competence of employees undertaking clinic al trials. GSK has an internal audit depar tment (independent of the departments responsible for conducting clinical st udies) which conducts audits of GSK systems an d processes involved in the c onduct of trials, as well as auditing clinical res earch organisations and inve stigators performing clinic al research on our behalf. In 2004, 176 audits were conducted: 102 audits of investigator site s conducting GSK-sponsored trials (representing approximately 5% of investigator si tes participating in pivotal clin ical trials) 17 audits of internal GSK systems and processes used in managing clinical trials / data 26 audits of clinical research organisations carrying out clinical trials on GSK's behalf 17 audits of GSK Country Medical Departments 14 audits conducted in response to suspected irregular ities Audit results are reported quarte rly to the R&D Risk Management & Complianc e Board, and annually to the GSK Audit Committee. Any concerns or issues identified dur ing audits are fully investigated and appropriate action taken. All breaches of GCP are report ed to the appropriate regulatory agency. In 2004 these audits resulted in 144 findi ngs that needed further investigation, and 4 inves tigators were reported to regulatory agencies . Inspections of investigators, clinic al research organisations, independent ethics committees (IECs)/Instituti onal Re view Boards (IRBs) and sponsors of clinical trails are also carried out by r egulatory authorities to ensure the safety of trial parti cipants, the qua lity of data, and that trials are conducted according to GCP. During 2004 there were 29 such ins pections of GSK and investigator s used by GSK to conduct clinical studies . www.g sk.com Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 103Research 9.4 Public Disclosure of Trial Results More on GSK's Clin ical Tria l Register in the website The pharmaceutical industry is legally required to disclose all relev ant data from clinical trials to the appropria te regulatory authorities when seeking approval for a new product. After approval, sponsors have a continui ng obligation to provide regulatory authorities with updated safety information from clinical trials. This ensures regulators can accurately assess t he safety and effectiveness of new medicines and monitor their safety after approval. Safety and efficacy information is provided to doctors th rough prescribing inf ormation which is approved by regulators. In addition there is a need to use ways other than prescribing information to appropriately communicate the results of our clinical trials to healthcare practitioners and others who use or ev aluate the use of our medicines. GSK has taken a signif icant step this year to respond to concerns about access to trial results. Our Approach GSK follows the PhRMA Principles on t he Conduct of Clin ical Tria ls and the Communic ation of Clinical Tria l Resu lts and is committed to timely communication of results for all products approved for marketing. Wherever possible we publish our clin ical trial results in peer-reviewed scientific and medical jour nals, or in conference abstracts and proceedings. These are used by research and healthcare communities to obtain the latest information on treatments. In 2004 there were 374 such publications describing the results of GSK's clinical trials. The number of publicat ions eac h year depends on the number of trials completed and the number accepted for publication. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Y20040100200300400500600 cannot guarantee publication of trial results by t hese methods since this is at the discretion of journal edit ors and conference organisers. That is why we launc hed our onlin e Clin ical T rial Reg ister in 2004, to supplem ent prescribing information and publications in the scientific liter ature (see Clin ical Trial Reg ister in the website). The Regist er contains results and prot ocol information from GSK-sponsored trials of marketed medicines. It also prov ides references to publications that have appeared in medical journals. Anyone can use the internet to access the Register. By the end of 2004 results for 143 clinical trials had been publis hed on the site. We aim to post, by the end of 2005, th e trial results from all clinical trials of marketed products completed since t he merger of GSK as well as earlier trials of these products if they are likely to inform medical judgement. Trial results for new products approved for mark eting will be posted on the register by the time that medicine is fi rst launched in a major market. To maximise access to our clinical trial data, we have also committed to posting trial results on the PhRMA clinical trials results database (www.clinic alstudyresu lts.org). GSK is legally required to post summa ry protocol information for ongoing studies of treatments for serious or life- threat ening dis eases cond ucted under a US Investigational New Drug Applic ation on the National Institutes of Health website ( www.Clinica lTrials.gov ) when the trials initiate enrolment. This provides inf ormation about the tri al's purpos e and contact details for further information, enabling patients and investi gators to take part. In addition to posting summary protocols for serious or life threatening diseases, in 2004 we made an additional commitment to post su mmary protocol information for all other GSK-sponsored clin ical trials on t he site. This will facilitate pa rticipation and enable interested parties to tra ck the trials taking place and the subsequent public dis closure of their results. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 105We are dedicated to assuring that our resul ts Register and our posting of summary protocol information of trials initiating enrolment are consistent with our stated commitments. To that end, we are establishing a means of providing third-party complianc e verifi cation that information being posted to the public databases is in agreement with the principles that we have establish ed. This will b e conducted with the assistance of an external organisation - we expect to complete the first full complianc e verification exercis e in Q3 2005. Additio nally, GSK will assemble a n internatio nal advis ory board to provide input on matters related to the public di sclosure of information arising from our clinical res earch activities. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 107 Products 10 Product s and Customers 10.1 Marketing code s of practice 10.2 Marketing training and c ompliance Corporate responsibility principle We will pro mote our products in line with high ethical, medica l and scientific standards and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations . 10. Products and customer s GSK products are sold in more than 150 countries around the world. The first priority with any product in any country is patient safety. We have systems and proces ses to collect, analyse and report safety concerns about our products. For more on our approach to pat ient safety please go to: Patient Safety in the website. Most of our products are sold by sale s representatives who regularly meet doctors and pharmacists to inform t hem about our medicines and their approved uses. We also market products di rectly to consumers where this is permitted. The sale and promotion of pharmaceutic al products is highly regulated by governments and medical agencies. GSK is aware of the sensitivit y and concerns regarding the marketing of medicines and we are absolutely committed to high ethical standards. We have developed marketing codes and policies and provide training to guide sa les representatives, to ensure that they behave ethically and comply with the law. This section explains our approach to marketing practices and covers our policies, training and complianc e programmes. It includes informati on on complianc e with our marketing policies during 2004. Information on other business ethics i ssues can be found in Standards of Ethical Conduct in the website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 108 Case study GSK Thailand Presses for Higher Standards in the Industry The Thailand Industry Asso ciation, PReMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer Association) has stewards hip of the industry code of marketing practices. In January 2004, the MD of GSK Thaila nd, Rick Gain, was appointed to the Board of PReMA and as Chair of its Sales and Marketing Ethics Subcommittee (SMES). At this ti me the exis ting marketing practices code was three years old and made general rather than specific commitments. Rick's prior ity was to reform the industr y code bringing it into line with US and European norms. The Code was strengt hened in a number of areas. For example, guidanc e on sponsorship for overseas conferences was strengthened. The revised Code now pr ohibits sponsorship of overseas meetings where all (or nearly all) the attendees or speakers are from Thailand. This aims to prevent overseas travel being used as an inducement to conference participants. The review process took nine months and involved gaining agreem ent from 12 major member companies of PReMA. The new code was adopte d by the PReMA Board in November 2004 and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the member companies . Commerc ial staff received training on the revised code from senior member s of the SMES in December 2004. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 109 Products 10.2 Marketing Codes of Practice Our sales representatives promote our products. They do this by providing information to doctors so they underst and our products and the benefits they can deliv er to patients. Our marketing policies and codes of pr actice give guidance to sales and marketing employees about the high ethi cal standards we require. Our codes stress that all marketin g and promotion must be based on valid scientific evidenc e, be consistent with national prescribing documentation, and comply with the law. Inducements such as gifts or bribes are never acceptable under any circumstances. All GSK employees must also abide by our Code of Conduct and Employee Guide to Business Conduct. The Employee Guide contains a spec ific section covering our customers and marketplace. See Code of Conduct in the website and Employee Guide to Business Conduct in the website. Marketing Policies a nd Codes of Practice Our company-wide policy on Pharmaceut ical Marketing and Promotional Activity applies to all employees and agents. It commits us to promotional practices that are ethical, responsib le, principled and patient-centred. It prohibits bribery or other inducements to doctors. In December 2003 we introduced regi onal marketing practices codes in Europe, International, and Japan (marketi ng codes were already in place in the US). These codes apply the same ethical standards in all regions but reflect diffe rences in market stru ctures, and laws and ions. We also adhere to international and regi onal industry codes of practice. These include the IFPMA, PhRMA, EF PIA and JPMA marketing codes. Progress During 2004 During 2004 GSK's regional codes were translated into major local languages and rolled out across GSK. Sales and ma rketing employees now have acces s to them on the intranet and many have receiv ed printed copies. Area champions in each country have coordi nated distribution and training on the new codes. The European code of practi ce includes a quarterly reporting mechanism where the markets confirm whether any breaches of the code of practice have occurred, the severity of any breaches and what actions have been taken to prevent recurrence. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 110We also developed and distributed a new 'Guide to US Healthcare Law' for our US Pharma employees. While this information was previously provided through training, the new guide provides a concise and easy-to-read overview of the complex legal requirement s applicab le to health care businesses in the US. The guide support s our commitment to an ethical c ulture in which employees have a good under standing of GSK's sales and marketing policies and the legal framework behind them. Complianc e with polic ies and procedures is a formal performance objective of sales and marketing employees in the US. This is evaluated as part of employee performance reviews. All US Pharma employees must i nclude the following objective in 2005: \"Consistent ly follow company policies and procedures, take and complete required compliance training in a timely manner, and report compliance issues to manager, Legal or Complianc e.\" In addition, managers must include the following: \"Ensure that supervised employ ees are trai ned on company policies and procedures and have taken all required training, and provide overs ight and direction to supervised employees so that they are in compliance with company polic ies and procedures .\" Objectives for 2005 We plan to analyse the differences am ongst the GSK International, European and US codes of practice and loc al requi rements in an effort to consolidate and harmonise these codes as appropriate. The US will continue to enhance its co mpliance programme with the additio n of resources to act as sales and ma rketing complianc e advisers. These advisers will work with the business uni ts to ensure that complianc e and ethics polic ies are fully integrated and embedded . www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 111 Products 10.2 Marketing Training and Compliance We recognise that strong polic ies and c odes of practice do not guarantee that all employ ees will meet our standards . Commercial pressures and complex regulatory environments can sometimes present our employees with difficult ethical dilemmas. This is why we provide regular trai ning for sales and marketing employees that reinforces the importance of ethical conduct and helps them to understand the behaviour expect ed of them. Internal compliance s ystems are desi gned to identify and address breaches of our codes. Training and A wareness Sales representatives receive detailed tr aining on the medicines they promote and the diseases whic h they are designed to treat. Sales and marketing employees are also giv en training on appropriate marketing practices and their obligati ons and responsibilities under our marketing codes. Practice varies by region but employees receive training when they are hired, with refr esher courses on an on-going bas is. Progress During 2004 During 2004 area champions coordinated training on ou r new regional codes. Information on the codes is being added to induction training for all new employees, regardless of whether they will h ave a sales or marketing role. In 2004 sales and marketing staff were either trained or recertified their understanding of the sales and marketing c ode. This was a global effort in which: Over 1,100 new staff in the US were trained and nearly 8, 000 existing staff completed recertification on polic ies Over 10,000 sales and marketing st aff in Europe were trained on the regional sales and marketing code In our International region training was deliv ered in all s even regional business units Training is provided in a variety of ways, including self-study, on the job training by managers, web- based learning and in-hous e courses. Sales staff are required to pass a test on our code of practice before starting their sales role. In the US, sales and marketing employ ees are now required to assess their complianc e with our marketing codes as part of their annual performance and www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 112development plan appraisal. This encour ages employees to view complianc e as an integral part of their overall performance. Monitoring and Compliance Sales representatives are supervis ed by sales managers who regularly monitor educational events, visits to doctors, and expenses, to ensure best practices are observed. This is s upplement ed by additional monit oring by independent staff as needed in certain areas. Sales managers are directed to report issues and infractions to regional complianc e officers or senior managers. They are encouraged to do this through normal line management channels , but have the prerogative of making reports directly to Corporate Ethics and Compliance if necessary. All issues are investigated and appropriate action determined, with referral to the Corporate Ethics & Complianc e department as appropriate. Employees are also encouraged to report concerns or suspected breaches of our marketi ng codes through their line manager, compliance officer, or confidentially through our Integrity Helpli nes and offsite PO Box (in the US). Staff in local market customer res ponse centres are trai ned to deal with concerns about marketing practices that might be raised by healthcare professionals, patients or the public. They redirect calls to appropriate senior management or a compliance officer if necessary. Our internal audit department also audits sales and marketing practices during regular audits of the business. During 2004, specifically as a result of breaches of sales and marketing codes, 87 employees were dismiss ed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily. In addition there were 109 cases of employees being is sued with written warnings, whic h included remedi al training, and in some cases, financial penalties. These figures form part of the overall figures reported in Standards of Ethical Conduct in the website. Objectives for 2005 Sales an d marketing complianc e advis ers will be ap pointed in the US during 2005. They will work with the business units to ensure that complian ce and ethics polic ies are fully integrated and embedded. A Compliance Analys is and Reporting gr oup will also be set up in the US to review compliance monitoring, auditi ng and investigations data and advise GSK management on complianc e related issues. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report CARING THE ENVIRONMENT www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 114Environment 11 Caring for the Environment EHS Management 118 Energy and Climate Impact 131 Water 140 Waste 146 Ozone Depletion 156 Volatile Organic Com pounds 161 Product Stewardship 164 Suppliers 169 Complianc e 172 Verification Statement 173 Progress Towards Targets 176 Corporate Respons ibility Principle We will operate in an environmentally re sponsible manner through systematic management of our environmental impacts , measurement of our performance and setting challen ging performance target s. We will improve the efficiency of all our activities to minimise mate rial and energy use and waste generated. We aim to find opportunities to use renewable materials and to recycle our waste. Caring for the environment is a key element of our approach to Corporate Respons ibility at GSK. Our Environmen t, Health and Safety (EHS) Plan for Excellence sets out a strategy to impr ove our performance over the ten-year period to 2010, from a 2001 baseline. Th is includes inter im targets to be reached by the end of 2005. We are on track to meet se ven of our ten targets. These cover some of our most important environmental i ssues, including energy and water consumption, ozone depleting potential, global warmi ng potential, wastewater quality, volatile organi c compound emissions and non- hazardous waste. We may not achieve the three targets on hazardous waste, recycling and ozone depletion potential of ancillary equi pment by the end of 2005. A fuller explanation of our performance is prov ided on the relevant pages of this report. Next year we w ill set new targets for 2010. About the Environment Section of This Report This is the 5th year that we have r eported on our environment al performance. The legacy companies (Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham) individually published EHS reports for a num ber of years prior to the formation of GSK in 2000. Copies of these repor ts are available on the Corporate Register website. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 115In previous years, we have publis hed a separate EHS report alongside our Corporate Respons ibility R eport, but this year we have fully integrat ed the two. Further background inf ormation on our approach to managing env ironmental issues is available in t he Environment, Health and Safety in the website section of our website. There are al so more details abo ut our corporate responsibility reporting in the secti on about this report in the website. Scope of Data The environmental data covers the cal endar year 2004. It is collected from 83 of our 84 pharmaceutical and consumer manufacturing sites, 4 of our 8 biologicals manufacturing sites and 20 of 24 R&D sites as well as 5 of 6 distribution centres, 4 of t he 6 major office locations and 6 of the smaller office and sales locations. We include data for si tes that were in operation for all or part of the year. We plan to collect ener gy, water and wa ste data from our smaller offices, sales and distribution centres in a phas ed approach over the next few years. Howev er, the overall environmental impact from these sites is relatively small and we therefore do not plan to co llect other environmental data. Notes attached to the charts explain the scope and data collection process for each parameter in more detail. Verification The environment, health and safety secti ons of this report are externally verified by ERM (Environmental Resources Management). Web pages to which the verification applies are indicated by this symbol See ERM's verification stat ement in the webs ite. www.g sk.com GlaxoSmi thKline rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 116Case Study Raising Children's Awareness of Environment, Health and Safety In 1996, GSK's manuf acturing site in Evreux, France, set up a community partnership project for sc hools. The project was an env ironment, health and safety (EHS) award scheme that encour aged children to learn about the EHS issues that are important to their future. In its first year, five sc hools and 100 children took part. Thanks in part to the continued help of local offices of the French Education Ministry, the French Social and Health Insurance Minis try Office and a local association dedicated to science, 14 schools and 300 children enter ed the competition in 2003. Each year has its own EHS theme. For 2003 the theme wa s Waste Recycling. The first pri ze - 200 euros towards a school project and a trip to the Scienc e and Industry Hall in Paris - went to a team that creat ed a papier mache educational booklet about waste and recyclin g. Other pri ze-winning entries included a game about recycling and a play about waste. An educational film on recycling was shown at the awards ceremony. The theme for 2004 was health and hygiene. The awards scheme has helped to build and enhance GSK's reputation in the local community. The project won first place in the community partnership category of our internal awards schem e - the Chief Executive Office r's EHS Excellence Awards. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi sponsibility Report 11.1 EHS Management Environment, health and safety (EHS ) issues are managed through an integrated system that aims to en sure issues and risks are identified, standards are establis hed, training is provided, targets set and audits conducted. We have a clearly defined EHS m anagement structure. Overall responsibility for EHS issues rests w ith the Corpor ate Executive Team and the Board. The Board champion for EHS is JP Garnier, the Chief Ex ecutive Office r. We also have a Corporate Responsibility Commi ttee and Corpor ate EHS department. See more on our EHS Management Organisation in the website. Our EHS Policy, EHS Vision and 64 Gl obal EHS Standards set the overall framework for managing EHS iss ues. Our EHS Plan for Excellenc e sets out our strategy for improving our envi ronmental performance up to 2010. See more on our EHS Management System in the website.. In 2004, four sites achieved dual ce rtification to t he international environmental management standard IS O14001 and the inter national health and safety standard OHSAS 180 01 for the first time. O ne site did not renew its certification in 2004 and one site certif ied only the utilitie s area. This means that 14 out of 84 pharmaceutical and c onsumer manufacturing sites are now certified to both ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001, and seven sites are certified to ISO 14001 only. We are working to incr ease site certification and expect to have around a third of our sites certified by the end of 2005, which would put us in a position to move towards global certification. Case Study Eliminating Waste From our Chemical Production Processes In Verona, Italy, we have develop ed a process which reduces the environmental impact of producing a chem ical whic h is being tested to help treat chemotherapy-induc ed nausea and vomiting. Originally, the method for synthesising the chemical required very low temperatures and produced sign ificant quantities of wast e by-products. It also required the use of triphosgene - a to xic reagent whic h must be specially transported, managed and handle d. The original process was designed for producing small quant ities of the chemical. It was scaled up several times to produce lar ger quantities for clinical trials, but the process remained unchanged. In 2003, researchers set out to create a more efficient process suitable for commercial production if the clinical tr ials were successful. The innovative new proces s eliminated the need for extremely low temperatures, saving www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 118energy. A number of hazardous substances were removed from the process, including triphosgen e, chlorinated solvents and silica treatments. This help ed to reduce waste by 75% and the cost of raw materials by over 50%. This innov ative development won first place in the green chemistry/technology category of our internal awards sc heme - the Chief Ex ecutive Office r's Environment, Health and Sa fety 119Environment 11.1.1 Letter From the Vice President, EHS This year, for the first time, GSK's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) report is ful ly integrated into the co mpany's Corporate Respons ibility Report on GSK.com. We cover the same issues in the sa me detail as before, but have made it simpler to understand our overall approach to corporate responsibility and to see the connections between the many subject areas covered. Consu ltation with stakehold ers has hel ped us identify the prime sustainab ility challenges we face. These are: climate change, the impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment, and more sustainable materials consumption. We have begun wor k devel oping strategies to tackle these issues and will publish our plans in 2006. We have develop ed a rigorous approach to EHS and s ustainab ility, with a long term 'Plan for Excellence' and fi ve-year improvement targets apply ing throughout our operations. The first fi ve-year phase of the programme will be complete in 2005 so we will set new five-year targets during this year to help drive the business towards sustainabil ity. From the end of 2005 we will expand traditional EHS programmes to include a focus on sustainability. We have continued to make progress - fo r example, in 2004 four additional sites were certified to the EHS management system sta ndards ISO14001 and OHSAS 18 001. We are on track to meet seven of our ten quantifi ed env ironmental targets by the end of 2005. The targets cover some of our most i mportant issues, including energy and water consumpt ion, ozone depleting potential, global warming potential, volatile organic co mpound emissions, wa stewater quality and waste. We may no t achieve the three targ ets on hazardous was te, recycling and ozone depletion potential of ancillary equipment by the end of 2005. A fuller explanation of our performance is prov ided on the relevant pages of this report. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 120Our long term plan for excellence c harts a journey whic h begins with improving our systems, progresses to leadership in EHS performa nce, and ultimately brings us closer toward s sustainab ility. The 10 -year programme envisages continuous improvem ent as well as identifying specific actions. As good EHS management and performance are achieved we will set ourselves more challenging sustainability objecti ves on materials efficiency, energy efficiency and use of renewable resources. We also need to look more closely at the inter-relations between the so cial, economic and environmental impacts of our business. I hope that this report meet s your needs as a stakeholder and I welcome your comments or suggestions. James Hagan Ph.D., P.E. Vice President Corporate Environment, Health and sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re for Excellence Our EHS Plan for Exc ellence sets out a strategy to improve our EHS performance over the ten-year period to 2010. Each year we focus on a different theme. The priority for 2004 wa s to develo p policies in res ponse to external challenges su ch as climate change. In September 2003, we held a meeti ng of an external stakeholder panel (which represented government, custom ers, suppliers, environmental groups , and others) to help us identify external challenges. Three key issues for GSK were identif ied - pharmaceuticals in t he environment, the use of chemicals, and climate change. In response, we develop ed the following spec ific objectives for 2004: Work with external stakeholders to r eview emerging issue s. Draft a posit ion statement on pharmaceuticals in the environment. Draft a posit ion statement on the use of chemicals. Draft a posit ion statement on the fut ure use of e nergy. Implement a regulatory tracking syst em for EHS. In 2004, we made good progress against these objectives. We w orked with the Environment Council to get feedback from external stakeholders on the issues relating to pharmaceuticals in the environment, the use of chemicals and the future use of energy. Following this consultation, we prepared discussion documents in each of t hese three areas and began to get feedback on them from employees. We will complete position statements in these areas in 2005. We also established a regulatory tra cking process to alert us to emerging EHS issues in the USA and the EU. A network of EHS specialists tracks regulations which are made available on a database to employees with EHS responsibilities. In 2005 we will focus on ensurin g that core programmes are in place throughout the busines s. Our specific objectives are to: complete the implement ation of our EHS management system, which is aligned with ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001, at all operations; achieve acceptable audit scores at a ll operations. Our aim is to achieve an average score of at least 75% in each business unit, with no site ach ieving less than 50 %; achieve the published 2 005 EHS global targets; analyse how close we ha ve come to meeting the strategic ob jectives originally pu blished in 2001 in the E HS Plan for Excellence; formalise our external stakeholder e ngagement process; review and revise as necessary the EHS Plan for Excellence f or 2006-2010. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 122 We are also working to develop a road map for sustainable development, which outlines the key steps that we will need to take to become an environmentally sustainable business. In 2004, we commissioned a study by Forum for the Future into the role of a pharmaceutical c ompany in a sustainable society. We then used the findings to develop a draft road map, which will be finalised in 2005. See more on our EHS Plan 123Environment 11.1.3 Stakeholder Engagement We engage with a range of stakeholders to help us understand external perspectives and identify emerging iss ues. Here we report our engagement with stakeholders on environmental issues. See engagement with stakeholders for details of how we engage with stakeholders on other corporate responsibility issues. In the past, we have held ad hoc sta keholder meetings to obt ain feedback on our EHS performance and plans. In Se ptember 2003 we held a major workshop of external stakeholders to help us ide ntify emergi ng challeng es. We plan to establish a more perma nent stakeh older panel in 2005 to pr ovide ongoing advice to GSK on EHS issues. The 2003 s takeholder workshop identified three key external challenges - pharmaceuticals in the environment, the use of chemicals and the future use of energy. In 2004, we worked with the Environment Council to interview around 20 stakeholder organisations (i ncluding NGOs, policy mak ers, regulators, customers, s uppliers and trade associations) to help us develop position statements on these issues. S ee Plan for Excellence in the website for more about the position statement s which will be published in 2005. We also partner with a number of environmental or ganisations in specific areas. For example, in 2004 we commi ssioned a study by Forum for the Future into the role of a pharmaceutical company in a sustainable society, and this is being used to help us develop a road map for sustainable development. Another partnership is with the env ironmental organisation Earthwatch Institute (E urope) . GSK is a member of Earthwatch's Corporate Environmental Responsibility Group and al so funds Earthwatch to develop it s field research and conservation projec ts in the UK and send schoolt eachers on these projects as part of its educat ional programme. For the first time in 2004, we ran a competition to select a GSK employee to participate in a two- week Earthwatch expedition overs eas. Many of our sites also engage with stak eholders locally, for example, through open days, newsletters and community projects. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate 11.1.4 Audits and Certification EHS Au dits We carry out Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) audits to assess implement ation of our EHS management system and standards. The audits also assess sites' compliance with ke y legislation. They are carri ed out by internal auditors who are certified as lead auditors against the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. We aim to conduct EHS audits at each oper ational sit e at least once every four years. We carry out more fre quent visits at selected sites, depending on an assessment of risk and the issues raised by previous audits. In 2004, 33 sites were a udited inclu ding three key office locations. Two thirds of site s achieved acceptable scores (which we define as over 70%). The average score across all sit es audited was 71%. Ten sites in Belgium, Germany, Irelan d, Japan, Turkey, UK and the US achieved high scores of over 80%. One site in t he UK achieved a leadership score of over 90% . See more on audit achievemen t in the website . The highest scores were on environmental issu es. We ident ified a number of health and safety issues which require atte ntion. See h ow we man age health a nd safety in the website for details of the issue s identified. All sites are required to develop plans to address any weakness es and opportunities to improve identified in the audit. Auditors monitor si tes' progress in implementi ng the plans. In 2004 the EHS audit process and scoring system were further re fined based on experience and feedback. We are testing EHS auditing so ftware on our intranet site to help the auditors track progress, and aim to have a fully functional version ready in 2005. EHS Certification In 2004, four sites achieved dual ce rtification to t he international environmental management standard IS O14001 and the inter national health and safety standard OHSAS 180 01 for the first time. O ne site did not renew its certification in 2004 and one site certif ied only the utilitie s area. This means that 21 out of 84 pharmaceutical and c onsumer manufacturing sites are now certified (14 sites are certified to both ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001, and seven sites are certified to ISO 14001 only) a nd one site's utility area is certified to both. The certified sites are in China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the UK. We are working to increase site certification and expect to have around a third certified by the end of 2005.

Operation and maintenance costs are cyclical and therefore vary year on year. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 126Environment 11.1.6 Training and Awareness We have a wide range of awareness-raisi ng and training initiatives on EHS, supported by a detailed EHS section on our intranet (cal led myEHS) which includes policies, standards, guidelines, t ools, examples of best practice and news. See more on myEHS in the website. Our Chief Executive Officers' E HS Ex cellence Awards scheme recognises outstanding efforts in EHS and helps rais e the profile of EHS issues around the busines s. We prepare regular EHS bulletins which are distributed to all sites for posting on bulletin boards. Three bulletins were circulated in 2004. We also include articles on EHS in our internal m agazine (GSK Spirit), our manufacturing magazine and site newsletters. GSK has two key awareness raising events - an Environment Week held every June (to coincide with the Wo rld Environment Day) and an annual Health and Safety Week held every Oc tober (to coincide with the European Health and Safety week and Fire Safe ty Awareness Month in the United States). Information kits are sent to a ll sites to help them develop ideas and plan activities. In 2004, over 7,600 empl oyees from 65 sites in 27 countries took part in the Environment Week. Ex amples of activities included tree planting, computer recycli ng, a no car day, and pledg es to reduce energy use. We also ran a competition during Ea rth Week for the best environmental initiativ e, and funded the winner on a two-week conservation expedition run by Earthwatch. See how we manage health and safety case study in the website for more about the Health and Safety Week. In the summer of 2004 we held our annual regional meetings for EHS professionals in manufacturing to shar e information and best practi ce. These events were attended by more than 100 EHS professionals. EHS training takes place at site level, in accordance with our EHS Standard on training. A range of training material s are available on our intranet site. See more on EHS Communicatio n in the website. www.g sk.com Excellence Awards Our Chief Executive Officer's E nvironment, Health and Safety (E HS) Excellence Awards Programme - run for the third year in 2004 - recognises and rewards GSK sites for innovation in EHS. The winners are chosen by a panel that includes experts from academia, government and NGOs. There are three categories of awar ds - Community Partnership, Green Chemistry/Green Technology, and the EHS Initiative Award (including separate awards for environment and safe ty). Each winner receives a trophy and selects a charity to receive a donation. In 2004, there were 120 entries from 64 GSK sites in 32 countries - 27% more entries than the previous year. The 2004 awards recognise achievements in the calendar year 2003.

Burning fos sil fuels for heat and power releases carbon dioxide (CO 2) - the most significant greenhouse gas. GSK's clim ate impact comes from energy use from our facilities, transport, and compounds we us e that contribute to global warming. The biggest source is energy use from our facilities (two thir ds). We have a target to reduce glob al warming potential from energy per unit sales by 8% by 2005 (from a 2001 baseline) and we are on track to meet this target (see energy in this report). Compounds that contribute to global wa rming are used in the production of metered dose inhalers and in some ancillary equipment. They include CFCs and HCF Cs (which also deplete the ozone layer) and HFCs (which do not deplete the ozone layer). Emissions of ozone depleting compound s are also reported in the ozone depletion se ction of this report. See product stewardship in this report for mo re about the use of ozone depleting compounds in our products. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 131Carbon dioxide and methane from wast e treatment and fermentation also contribute to our global warming impac t. We report our performance in the waste section of this report. Performance Global Wa rming Potential 3,499.7 3,162.3 2,779.2 2,647.9 Global war ming potential decreas ed by 4.7% since 2003. Note to Global Warming Charts Our global warming impact from energy is calculated using conversion factors from the World Business Council For Sustainable Dev elopment (WBCSD) / World Resources Initiative (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, September 2001, its Stati onary and Mobile Combustion Workbooks, and the Intergovernmental Pane l on Climate Change (1996). We use conversion factors from the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs to calculate CO 2 from business air travel and air freight. Energy Use From our Facilities includes a ll energy consumed at GSK facilities in the form of electric ity imported and steam imported and fuels burned in fixed combustion equipment on site, including emergency generators. Figures incl ude fuels used to generate steam and electricity on- site but not fuel for on-site transport. T he energy consumption section of this report includes a breakdown of energy data. Transport includes business travel by air (inc luding transatlantic flights www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 132between the US and UK, flights within the EU and US for routine business activities, and flights origi nating in the UK to l arge group events such as sales conventions), business travel by r oad (including company-owned vehicle fleets, primarily our global sales fleet), and product freight by air. The increas e in global warming potential from trans port si nce 2001 is mainly because we have improved our reporting systems to more comprehensively collect transport data. For example, the 2001 dat a did not include business air travel within the EU and US and did no t include UK and international sales fleet miles. The data do not include employee travel to work. We do not collect d ata for other modes of business travel including ra il and bus. We do not calculate CO 2 emissions from road, rail or sea fre ight transpor t because o ur central da ta collection system is not as robust in these ar eas and the impacts are small when compared to those of air freight transport.

Other is CO 2 equivalents from waste tr eatment and fermentation. www.g sk.com - sponsibility Report 2004 133Environment 11.2.1 Energy Consumption Energy use from our facilities acco unts for 66% of GSK's global warming impact. In 2004, we used 19 million gigajoules of energy - equivalent to the energy consumed in one year by approximately 236,000 UK hous eholds. This produced emissions of 1,750 million kg CO 2. We bought 41% of our energy as electricity and a small amount (1%) as municipal steam or hot water. The rest was gener ated from fuel combus tion on-site. In 2004 we developed a draft position st atement on our future use of energy, which will be finalised in 2005. This was in response to feedback showing that energy use is a key area of concer n among our stakeholders. The draft position set s out a strategy for r educing greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency, renewable energ y and emissions trading. It also acknowledges that climate change may affect disease patterns and proposes that GSK should support research to help society plan for the consequences of climate change. In 2004, we continued to work on a number of energy efficien cy initiatives. For example, in the UK GSK partnered with the Carbon Trust to r educe energ y consumptio n through energy audits and raisi ng employees' awareness. In the US we joined the E nergy Star p rogramme which encour ages busine sses to increase their energy efficiency and share best pra ctice. In the UK, we installe d two wind turbi nes at our Barnard Castle facility. A number of our UK sites are partici pating in the government's emissions trading scheme (ETS) - helping us to gai n experience in carbon trading. The UK ETS is a voluntary scheme which re wards companies that improve energy efficiency with reductions in the tax t hey pay on energy consumption. Sites that keep emissions below an agreed ta rget can bank the spare credits to help with complianc e in subsequent year s or can sell the credits to other participants in the scheme. By the end of 2004, GSK had banked more than 50,000 carbon credits which can be used to help us keep within targets in the future. We plan to parti cipate in the EU Emis sions Trading Scheme which began at the start of 2005. We estimate that more than 50% of our carbon dioxide emissions from energy worldwide will be regulated under the EU Scheme. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report unit sales as percentage of 2001 baselinetargets Energy Consumption by Business (Excluding Transport) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 R&D Biologicals Consumer Healthcare New Pr oduct and Global Supply Regional Pharma Supply Primary Supply & Antibiotics Commercial Other2001 2002 2003 2004 (million gigajoules) Total energy consumption decreased by 4.5% since 2003 (7.3% si nce 2001).

The NO X and SO 2 are calculated from the coal used at some GSK facilities, primarily in India for energy purposes , using conversion factors from the National Atmospheric Emissions In ventory (UK nation al methodology). www.g sk.com - rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 137Environment 11.2.2 Transport We estimate that transport accounts fo r 7.9% of our total global warming impact. In 2004 we e mitted approxim ately 209 million kilograms of CO 2 from transport. Business air travel accounts for over half (54%) of our travel-related CO 2 emissions. In 2004, employees travelled a total of 771 million kilo metres by plane - res ulting in 11 4 millio n kg of CO 2 emissions. This includes transatlantic flights between the US and UK, and flights within the EU and US for routine business activities, as well as travel originating in the UK related to large group events such as sales conventions. In 2004, our global sales fleet (excludi ng the UK) drove a total of 656 million kilometres on busines s travel - resulting in 82 million kg of CO 2. In addition t o business t ravel, we also transport products from our manu facturing plants to di stributors. In 2004, GSK products we re transport ed a total of 152 million kilometres - the majority (81%) by air freight. We estimate that the air freig ht resulted in 13.9 millio n kg of CO 2. We do not calculate CO 2 emissions from road, rail or sea freight transport because our central data colle ction system is not as robu st in these areas and th e impacts ar e small when compared to those of a ir freight tra nsport. We have \"green travel plans\" at a nu mber of sites which encourage employees to reduce the e nvironmenta l impact of t heir trav el to work. For example, at GSK House in Brentford, the UK, privileged parking spaces a re given to car-sharers a nd drivers of fuel efficient cars, bu ses run to a nd from the local train station, while changing rooms and showers are provided for cyclis ts as well as discou nts for bicycle equipment and repairs.

Water conserva tion is particularly important in areas where water shortages are common. GSK uses water in manufacturing (eg for processes, products, cooling and cleaning) and for general site uses incl uding food services and sanitation. We operate in several areas of the w orld that are classified as water-stressed. We have 47 sites in water stressed areas, of which 31 are in areas classified as highly stressed by the Wo rld Resources Institute. In 2004, we used 20.5 millio n cubic metr es of water - a decrease of 10.9% since 2003 (23.8% since 2001). Water consumption per unit sales decreased by 6.3% since 2003 (23.3% since 2001) - meaning we have exc eeded our 2005 target of a 10% reduction per unit sales since 2001. In 2004, we generated 13.9 million cubic metr es of wastewater. 15% of this was reused, recovered or recycle d. We assess the quality of our wastewater by measuring the chemical oxy gen demand (COD) - the oxygen required to chemically oxidise organic and inorganic compounds present in the water. Total COD decreased by 15.0% since 2003 (24.5% since 2001). COD per unit sales decreased by 10.8% since 2003 (24.2% since 2001) - meaning we are on track to meet our 2005 target of a 30% reduction per unit sales sinc e 2001. www.g sk.com sponsibility Report 2004 140Environment 11.3.1 Water Use In 2004, we used 20.5 millio n cubic metres of water - equiva lent to the water used in one year by approximately 80,000 UK households. This was sourced from municipal water supplies (60.5%), wells / boreholes (39.0%), and other sources (0.5%). All five of our sites in India use pr ocessed wastewater for watering plants and trees, which help prov ide shade, improv e the appearanc e of the site, and also a source of food for employees. They do not discharge any wastewater to water bodies or to munici pal sewers.

All of our five sites in India have implemented \"zer o wastewater\" discharge programmes - reusing and recycling all wastewater. Another three sites (in Mexico, the Philippines and Turkey) also reuse all wastewater. We assess the quality of our wastewater by measuring the chemical oxy gen demand (COD) - the oxygen required to chemically oxidise organic and inorganic compounds present in the water.

Note to Wastew ater and COD Charts Wastewater volume includes all manuf acturing and site process wastewater as well as sanitary and food service wastewater. Wastewater quality is measured by Chemic al Oxygen Demand (COD) which is a measure of the oxygen requir ed to chemically oxidis e organic and inorganic compounds pres ent in the water. The COD is measured when wastewater leaves our sites, following any on- site treatm ent. In 2002, we began to ask our sites to submit COD data following municipal treatment. This takes into account final treatment occurring at municipal or publicly-owned wastewater treatment works and therefore gives a better indication of the impact of our operati ons on the final receiving waterways. Howev er, many of our sites have not submitted this data which means that the 2004 data still primarily reflects t he COD after only onsite treatment. We will revisit this parameter and its sc ope as we develop our new EHS metrics and targets in 2005. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 145Environment 11.4 Waste Our waste i ncludes hazardous wast e (mostly waste solv ents) and non- hazardous waste (mostly general site wa ste). We report no n-routine waste (mostly construction and demolition waste) separately because this fluctuates depending on building works and remediatio n projects. Most of the active ingredients in our pharmaceutical products are manufactured using sy nthetic chemistr y processes. This means that a signific ant proportion of our waste cont ains solvents and chemicals used in these processes and is classified as hazardous. In 2004, we disposed of 43.1 milli on kg of non-hazardou s waste and 73.7 million kg of hazardous waste. Non-hazar dous waste disposed per unit sales increased by 2.8% si nce 2003 (but decreased by 18.8% since 2001) - meaning we have exceeded our 2005 target of an 8% reducti on per unit sales since 2001. Hazardous waste disposed per unit sa les increased by 27.5% since 2003 (17.3% since 2001) - meaning we are not on track to meet our 2005 target of a 15% reduction per unit sales since 2001. This is due to a combination of factors which are described in the hazardous waste section. Many of ou r sites have introduced waste mi nimisation and recycling initiativ es. In 2004, we recycled 239.2 million kg of waste (67.2% o f the total waste generated). The proportion of waste re cycled decreased by 11.1% since 2003 (11.5% since 2001) - meaning we are not on track to meet our 2005 target of a 10% increase in the proportion of waste re cycled sinc e 2001. Production changes during 2004 led to a greater proportion of solvent waste being blended as a fuel or in cinerated and less recycled. In 2004, a large number of projects rela ted to waste issues - 20 in total - were submitted for the GSK CEO EH S Excellence Awar ds. Our site in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, was awarded 1st place in the environm ent category of the awards for its pharmaceutical waste bi oremediation project (see case study below). www.g sk.com - Co Stud y Developing Environm entally Friend ly Way s of Disposing of Unused Pharmaceu tical Prod ucts Our consumer healthcare site in B ogot\u00e1, Colombia, has developed a system to reduce the environmental impac t of disposing of unused liquid pharmaceutical produc ts, including product returns or rejects. The liquid waste is treated in r eed beds. Although reed beds are becoming increasingly popular to treat domestic and industrial wastewater, the Colombia team are pi oneers in using them to treat pharmaceutical waste. Reeds (usually phragmites australis) planted in specially designed soil beds provide an ideal environment for bacteri a and fungi to break down hazardous chemicals naturally int o harmless com ponents. The reeds themselves absorb some chemicals in the waste as nutrients. In our initial trial, treating a mixture of waste syrup and used oil, levels of c hemicals in the residual wat er from the reed beds fell below legal limits after 35 days. The system replaces high temperature in cineration, which is ener gy intensiv e and does not dispose of certain wastes su ch as syrups effectively. Using reed beds has reduced the cost of final dis posal per kilogram of product by 60%. Building our own reed bed tr eatment plant at the Bogot \u00e1 site was not feasible because there was not enough space, so the team promoted the i dea of a joint initiative with other companies . In June 2003 the waste treatment company Transform E coskandia Ltda and other financial partners founded Transform Biolodos Lt da to build the firs t large reed bed plant in Colombia for industrial and public use. The Bogot \u00e1 site won first place in t he environment category of our internal awards scheme - the Chief Ex ecutiv e Office r's Environment, Health and Safety Exc ellence Awards. The site closed in 2004, but the reed bed treatment plant is now used by several other major companies. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 147Environment 11.4.1 Hazardous Waste In 2004, we disposed of 73.7 million kg of hazardous wa ste (excluding demolition and construction waste). This is mostly solvents (82.6%), the rest being general site waste (15.3%) and chemic al, biol ogical or radioactive waste (2.0%). In 2004, 50.2% of hazardous was te disposed was incinerated for energy recovery, 47.5% was incinerated without energy recovery. The remaining waste was dispose d to licensed la ndfill sites.

Our previous trend of reducing hazardous waste per unit sales was reversed in 2004 by a combination of factors. GSK's hazardous waste is mostly solvents and one plant scheduled for cl osure had to dispose of redundant solvent stocks. This had a one off impact on our data. In addition, changes to production at other plants included bringing in-house processes that were previously undertaken by contract manufacturers. Our engineers will be assessing how to optimise the new pr ocesses to reduce solvent use and increase recycling. Note to Hazardous Waste Charts Although the external defin ition of what constitutes a waste varies, for GSK reporting purposes a material is considered a waste if i t is no longer fit for its originally intended purpose. Hazardous waste disp osed includ es dispos al to landfill a nd incin eration either on or off GSK property. Incineration wit h energy recovery includes processes that result i n beneficial energy or re source recovery and includes a small amount of composting. Incineration without energy recovery includes processes that do not result in benef icial energy or resource recovery. Hazardous waste disposed does NOT includ e recycling on-site or o ff-site o r non-routine waste. For consistent reporting, GSK considers a waste to be hazardous if it exhibits any of a number of properties as defi ned by the Basel Convention in 1989 of www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate United Nations Environment Progr amme (UNEP). Included in these properties are flammability, explosivity, water or ai r reactivity, corrosivity, oxidis ing potential, acute or chronic to xicity, ecotoxic ity or infection. In addition, because of their nature and potential impact on research and development activities, radioactive wastes are defined as hazardou s. Bioengineered and biohazardous waste is included in hazardous waste. A waste is considered to be non-hazardous if it does not exhibit any of the hazardous properties noted abov e. www.g sk.com - 150Environment 11.4.2 Non-hazardous Waste In 2004, we disposed of 43.1 million kg of non-hazardou s waste (excluding non-routine waste). This is equivalent to the waste produced by approximately 34,800 UK households . Most non-hazardous waste is general site waste such as office waste paper, kitchen waste and non-hazardous substances used in manufacturing.

Ozone depleting substances (ODSs) include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and halons. CFCs are the main ODS we use - as the propellant gas in metered dose inhalers (MDI) for asthma sufferers. The CFC is released when patients use the inhaler. In 2004, 464 thousand kilograms of CFC propellant was released when patients used our products in the EU and US. A much smaller amount of CFCs - 59 thousand kilograms - were re leased during worldwide production. Information on CFC releases is not compiled outside the US and UK where this is not required by regul ation. We now offer a sele ction of alternatives to ODS-containing inhalers in most count ries and plan to eliminate the use of ODSs from our product portfolio by 2010. See metered dose inhalers. Ozone depletion potential from production per unit sales decreased by 67.5% since 2001 - meaning we have exceeded our 2005 target of a 50% reduction per unit sales since 2001. We also use ODSs in some cooling systems and for oth er ancillary uses at GSK facilities. We have switched to usi ng hydrofluoroca rbons (HFCs) in some cooling systems. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer but do contribute to globa l war ming. Ozone depletio n potential from ancillar y use per unit sales decreased by 60.5% since 2001, but the current trend indicates that we may miss our 2005 target to eliminate thes e emissions. We plan to establis h a team in 2005 to develop a busin ess strategy to eliminate ancillary emissions of ODSs. www.g sk.com - 156Environment 11.5.1 Ozone Depleting Substances in Manufacturing A small proportion of the CFC us ed to manufacture Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) is released during the manufactu ring process.

As production of CFC-containing MDIs decreases, the amount of C FC lost during prod uction also declines. We will no longer manufacture CFC- containing MDIs in the US after 2005 and in Europe after 2006. We will continue to manufacture them in Bang lades h, China, India and Pakistan until the end of 2009.

We have switc hed to using hydrofluoroc arbons (HFCs) in some ancillary equipment. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer but do contribute to global warming. ODSs - mainly HCFCs - are sealed inside cooling systems and are only released in the event of a leak or during maintenance.

Case Study Reducing Solvent Emissi ons at Ulverston, UK We use a wide-range of solvents (v olatile organic compounds) in the manufacture of Epivir (an antiretro viral), Zinacef and Zinnat (cephalosporin antibiotics) at our site i n Ulverston, UK. We endeav our to use these solvents in a sustainable manner and over 20,000 tonnes of solvent are recovered each year at the Ulverston site for re-use in the manufacturing processes. We have been working for a number of years to reduce releases of all solvents, including dic hloromethane, at the site. In February 2003, the site produced a Solvent Management Plan and Substitution Plan - in line with the requirements of new EU regulations. These were updat ed in July 2004. The site is authorised under the UK En vironmental Protection Act 1990 to release a maximum of 1,000 tonnes of di chloromethane to air. In 2004, emissions to air totalled 269 tonnes - well below the limit and a reduction of 33% compared with 2003. Over the same period releases of other VOCs reduced by 10% and have declined by 30% over the last five-years. Our target is to reduce emissions of dichloromethane to air to less than 190 tonnes in 2005 and 80 tonnes in 2006. In 2004, we also reduced the amount of dichloromethane dischar ged into water by 80% compared with 2003. We aim to reduce this amount to below one tonne in 2005 and below 0.1 tonnes in 2006. Dichloromethane continues to be used in enclosed equipment and regular monitoring of employees ensures their expo sure levels remain low. The levels of all solvents, including dichloromet hane, found around the edge of the site are well below guide limits set by the Environment Agency for England and Wales. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 163Environment 11.7 Product Stewardship As well as managing environmental issues at our factories, we look more widely at th e life-cycle of our prod ucts - from product design to use and eventual disposal. We call this product stewardship. This section focuses on: Product design - how we are incorporating environmental considerations into the design of new products. Pharmaceuticals in the environment - what we are doing to understand and minimise the impact of pharmaceuticals released to the environment (following use). CFCs in metered dose inhalers - how we are progressing against our target to eliminate the use of CF Cs (an ozone depleting gas) from our product portfolio by 2010. There are a number of other envi ronmental issues associated with our products, including the use of genetically modified organisms and the use of natural resources which may impact on biodiversity. See more on our approach to biodiv ersity and genetically modified orga nisms in the GSK website.. The research and development section of this report covers our approach to animal testing . www.g sk.com - 2004 164Environment 11.7.1 Product Design We are working to incorporate environment al considerations into the design of new products. This helps us to reduc e waste and improve process efficiency. Our eco-design toolkit alerts us to potential EHS issues early in the development process. It includes a green chemistry guide, materials guide, green pack aging guide, and FLASC (Fast lifecycle ass essment fo r synthetic chemistry). It is available on our intranet. In 2004, we made further progress in in tegrating our EHS Milestone Aligned Process (EHS MAP) into our produc t development and supply proc esses, including our \"design for manufactu ring\" initiative. Approximately 650 employees in R&D and manufacturing attended training sessions o n the EHS Map Process during the year. See busi ness processes for more about EHS Map. See more on our approach to product design in the GSK website.. www.g sk.com - Report 2004 165Environment 11.7.2 Pharmaceuticals in the Environment When patients use pharmaceuticals, some of the active ingredient may not be completely metabolised and will generally be excreted. Wastewater treatment plants remove most pharmaceutical residues in the environment, but small concentrations do end up in rivers or the sea. In areas without wastewater treatment, higher concentrations ar e released to the environment. In 2004, following consultation with external stakeholders, we developed a draft position statement on pharmaceutic als in the environment. This will be completed in 2005. Internally, we have developed business pr ocesses to ensure that w e carry out appropriate environmental tests as and w hen we should. Since environmental risk assessments (ERAs) are part of the new drug approval process in the EU and US, we work with various regulatory agencies to ensure that the potential environmental impacts of pharmaceutic als are understood and minimised. We also work with other pharmaceutical companies, univer sities and research groups to develop the science and methodologies to assess the environmental risks of pharmaceutical s in the environment and increase understanding of such risks. For e xampl e, in the US, GSK has been involved with the Pharmaceutical Researc h and Manufacturers of America (P hRMA) in developing the P hATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model, a geographic ally ex plicit model bas ed on hydrology and population patterns. S ee more on our approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment in the GSK webs ite. In 2004, we initiated more compr ehensive environmental risk assessments using the P hATE model for about 40 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including paroxetine (the active ingredient in Paxil/Serox at). These assessments will be p ublished on our webs ite. The underlying env ironmental fate and effects test data for pharmaceutically active components of GSK marketed products are now being embedded in Safety Data Sheets (SDS). These are available on our website at www. msds-gsk.com . The risk assessments carried out to date indicate that our products do not appear to pose a risk for humans or the environment based on current methods for ascertaining effe ct levels. However, we continue to monitor the latest scientific studies and findings to improve our risk assessments in this area. www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi dose inhalers (MDIs) were first introduced in the 1950s an d are used as one of the main forms of treatment for asthma sufferers. They are pressurised, hand-held devices that us e propellants to deliv er doses of medication to the lungs of patients. CFCs were traditionally used as the propellant because they are non-toxic, non-reactive, non-flammable, odour and taste free. When a patient uses the MD I, the propellant is releas ed into the atmosphere. In 2004, 464 thousand kilograms of CF C propellant were released when patients used our products in the EU and US. A much smaller proportion of CFCs - 59 thousand kilograms - escaped dur ing product ion (see ozone depleting substances in manufac turing in the GSK website.). Although the Montr eal Protocol bans the pr oduction of CFCs, it does recognise a number of \"essential uses\" wh ich are exempt from the ban. MDIs fall under the essentia l use exem ption and a re therefore still allowed to be manufactured. We plan to eliminate the use of CFCs from our product portfolio by 2010. We now offer a selection of alternatives to CFC-containing MDIs in most countries. The main alternative propella nt we use is HFC 134a. We have also invested heavily in dry powder deliver y syste ms that do not use CFCs. We estimate that the total amount we have spent on new plant and R&D on CFC- alternatives is over \u00a3550 milli on ($1 billion) s ince we id entified this as an issue in the 1980s.

It ranges fr om major strategic relationships with contract manufacturers that make final medicines for us to suppliers of key materials. We have EHS standards for suppliers. We also include EHS requir ements, based on the standards, in our initial agreements with new key suppliers and when we renew contracts. We conduct regular EHS audits of our key suppliers to assess performance against our EHS standards and key legis lation. We also carry out EHS audits before we start working with major new suppliers. We se lect which suppliers to audit on the basis of risk, including potential hazards. (The audits also cover basic questions on human rights. See human rights and suppliers in the GSK website.) In 2004, we carried out 35 site-based EH S audits. Sixteen of the audits were in Asia, eleven in Europe, six in the US, one in Canada and one in Mexico. We also carried out four follow-u p reviews. We found a wide variation in perform ance across the sites audited. The lowest score was 22% and the highest was 92%. We make recommendations to sites following the audits and have a process to monitor progress, with a particular focus on poorly performing sites. In 2004, three potential suppliers ac hieved unacceptable EHS scores (less than 30%) and therefore we di d not source from them . No existing supplier scored below 30%. In 2004, we developed an action pack for use by our procurement managers to help them identify the EHS ris ks asso ciated with procurement activities. In the US, we signed up to Gr een Suppliers Network (GSN) - a programme run by the US Environment Protec tion Agency to help small and medium sized supp liers to reduce their environmental impact. In 2005, we will encourage our suppliers to par ticipate in the project. Key Audit Findings Environment We found the basic elements of an env ironmental management system at all of the sites we audited and 50% of the c hemical sites were certified to the international environmental managem ent standard ISO14001. Most sites had a good understanding of environm ental regulations and positive relations hips with regulat sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 169In China and India, we generally f ound a high level of complianc e with regulations and effecti ve management of waste water. Howev er, the lack of infrastructure in these countries pres ents challenges. For example, the waste disposal options are limited and electric ity is generated mainly from coal or poor-qualit y oil. We also found that air emissions were poorly controlled in a few cases. Health and Safet y We found that health and safety wa s gener ally well managed at sites in Europe and North America.

We are working towards quantifying the environmental impact of our contract manufacturers. This is a more diffi cult process than collect ing data from our own sites because contract manufactu rers are independently managed. In 2004 we collected data from 14 majo r contract manufacturers for some core EHS parameters. The contract manufacturers produced 6,185,459 kilograms of product for GSK (includi ng raw materials, primary and secondar y manufacturing and sec ondary pac kaging) .

This is the fourth year that ERM has verified GSK's EHS reporting. The objectives of our review were to: c heck that the information present ed is accurate, and that it repr esents GSK's performance fairly; critically review the completeness and relevance of the information present ed; and, assess the effectiveness of GSK's data man agement systems. All pages that contain verified EHS data are marked with the following symbol We have focused on understanding GSK's EHS data manageme nt and reporting processes and EHS performanc e. The assess ment covered 22 percent of GSK manufacturing sites and 17 percent of the R&D fac ilities, expanding ERM's cov erage of sites compared to 2003. Overall Findings Subject to the comments and scope se t out below, we believe GSK's Corporate Respons ibility report covers the key EHS iss ues that interested parties need to know to in form decision making (i.e. is relevant ), does not avoid major issues (i.e. is complete) and fairly reflects programmes and performance on the ground (i.e. is accurate ). ERM Scop e Between November 2004 and March 2005, ERM: 1. Reviewed EHS data managemen t and reporting processes, and performance changes, at a cross-section of sites, through f our site visits and 20 telephone inter views. 2. Interviewed personnel responsible for data collation in Corporate EHS (CEHS) and checked sample group data; 3. Interviewed corporate representat ives to obtain supporting information on the following EHS programmes: acquisitions and div estitures, contaminated land, climate c hange and ozone depleting potential, auditing of suppliers and contract manufacturers, and E HS reporting by the Commercial business support team; www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate 1734. Participated in the final CEHS data-checking and review process undertaken after the si tes had submitted all EHS data; and 5. Checked that the EHS sections of the 2004 Corporate Responsibility report reflect our findings. Findings Relev ance and Completeness Overall, the EHS se ctions of the 2004 Corp orate Responsib ility report cover the key issues that are relevant to GSK's business. Each year, ERM makes recommendations for improvement. In response to an ERM recommendation made in the Sustainab ility in Environm ent, Health & Safety report 2003 , GSK has attempted to collect information on the reasons for changes in site EHS performance. ERM has noted impr ovement to GSK's reporting of the reasons for perfo rmance change in the 2004 EHS report sections. We have also noted progress made in 2004 in relation to GSK's reporting of transport-related gree nhouse gas emissions. In 2004 GSK obtained EHS performance data from 14 contract manufacturers (versus seven in 2003) , as part of its effort to quantify G SK's broader 'EHS footprint'. icator data from business-cr itical contract manufacturers (this data was not verified by ERM). Accuracy This year, corporate data checking processes have been strengthened to increase the quality of the data, th rough involvement of additional GSK personnel and ERM's participation in the final checking process. GSK also observed ERM's verification process at one site visit. N ext year, GSK proposes to use its myEHS database system to trac k data-checking actions with each site. During 200 4, we have seen examples of increased repo rting of illne ss and injury data by sites, which may in part be due to improved awareness as a result of the introduction of the myEHS 'Incidents' database. Associated training has been provided to GSK person nel at approximately 100 sites. ERM identified three material data inaccu racies relating to wastewater qualit y (COD), wastewater volume, and production use of ozone depleting substances . These were subsequently addr essed by GSK to ensure accurate reporting in the 2004 Corporate Respons ibility report. ERM identified potentially material unde r-reporting of EHS data (in particular injury and illness data) by GSK's Commercial business, which includes office- based and field sales- force staff. Respons iveness GSK has reported that stakeholders woul d like GSK to prepare a combined Corporate Respons ibility report i ncorporating EHS and would like to better understand management and performance of a number of non-financial www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline sponsibility Report 174issues. In response, GSK has produced this single web- based Corporate Respons ibility report, and is in the process of preparing position papers on a selection of issues (e.g. climate change). Recommendations ERM recommends that GSK: Builds on work undertaken in 2004 to strengthen internal reporting processes, better understand the r easons for EHS performance changes and enable more consistent and ex plicit ext ernal reporting; Further improves collection and r eporting of performance data from contract manufacturers and suppliers, focussing on those which are business critical and those with the greatest EHS risk profile; Improves the accuracy of environmental key performance data by more comprehensively chec king comple teness of data reported by the operations; Supports key operations to more accu rately monitor material flows and discharges related to key environ mental performance indicators; Assesses the potential for material data inac curacies resulting from under-reporting by GS K's Commercial oper ations and puts in place improvement programmes to obtain a more complete data set; and Reviews the limitations of EHS per formance data, in particular the potential sc ale of statistical uncer tainty for ta rget-related key EHS performance data, including trans port derived emissions of greenhouse gases. ERM March 2005 www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re Towards Targets Our EHS Plan for Exc ellence sets out a strategy to improve our performance over the ten-year period to 2010, star ting from a 2001 baseline. This includes interim targets to be reached by the end of 2005. We are on track to meet se ven of our ten targets. These cover some of our most important environmental i ssues, including energy and water consumption, ozone depleting potential, global warmi ng potential, wastewater quality, volatile organi c compound emissions and non- hazardous waste. We may not achieve the three targets on hazardous waste, recycling and ozone depletion potential of ancillary equi pment by the end of 2005. A fuller explanation of our performance is prov ided on the relevant pages of this report. Next year we w ill set new targets for 2010. Our group targets are based on improvem ent plans and forecasts from our sites. During the year, we asked all our sites to reconfirm t heir commitment to the 2005 targets they set in 2001.

For more information on the CRC and Counc il, includ ing the Terms of Reference for the CR C see Corporate Governance www.g sk.com - GlaxoSmi thKline Co rporate Re sponsibility Report 2004 178 Integration of CR Skills We believe that day-to-day managem ent of corporat e responsibility performance is done most effectively within our business operations, where experts on all our CR issues work. Coordination is provided by a cross-functional team, made up of representatives from key busines s areas. Their role is to oversee development, implementation an d comm unication of CR policy ac ross GSK. This ensur es a comprehensiv e and consistent approach is taken throughout the organis ation. We also have a small corporate team that co-ordinates policy dev elopment, reporting, and communication with socially responsible investment analysts. For details of our EH&S management see EHS Management. Stakeholder Engagement We have frequent disc ussions with a range of stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, patients, doctors, governments and NGOs, to inform our approach to managing corpor ate responsibility. See Engagement With Stakeholders . We have developed Corporate Responsibilit y principles to guide our activity (see Our C R principles), and in this r eport we explain our performance against each principle during 2004. We use external guidelines and fram eworks where relevant.
