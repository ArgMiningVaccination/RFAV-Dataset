In close concert with our collaborators our studies have aimed to address practical questions related to the prevention of HIV-1 infection in infants, mechanisms leading to shedding of virus in breast milk and genital tract of adults, treatment of drug-resistant virus in children and adults and understanding mechanisms underlying the persistence of HIV infection despite effective antiretroviral treatment. Additionally, we have developed economical assays with the goal of making testing accessible to resource-poor communities, to improve the management of HIV infection. When studying transmitted resistance from HIV-infected mothers to their children, our group noted a series of errors that refuted the concept of transient HIV infection occurring in infants (Frenkel et al. Science, 1998; [PMID9582120](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9582120/)). Our findings in this study cemented the importance of meticulous Laboratory Quality Assurance in our research and clinical work. Our group has operated a CLIA Laboratory for >17 years primarily performing assays NIH IMPAACT Network. Our laboratory located within SCRI found evidence and later provided proof that proliferating cells have a major role in sustaining the HIV reservoir despite effective treatment (J Virol 2005, [PMID16014925](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16014925__;!!NuzbfyPwt6ZyPHQ!5FirtSE8uV0UEy67rrtBwMRIQSmiBbg8rhm988KbpA2M--BONbgYYnuqGpZbskK4jTaCYkIMHA$)) (Science 2014, [PMID25011556](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25011556__;!!NuzbfyPwt6ZyPHQ!5FirtSE8uV0UEy67rrtBwMRIQSmiBbg8rhm988KbpA2M--BONbgYYnuqGpZbskK4jTY7sApAtg$)Research Focus Area Infectious Disease, Virology - "}
