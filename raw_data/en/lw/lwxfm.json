Price O ther Med icinal Plan t Species Status of Echinacea species Kelly Kindscher Species in th e plant g enus Echinacea are high ly valued as m edicinal plan ts for the herbal products industry. This industry has grown dram atically, and echinacea sales have been in the millions of dolla rs, with wild-harv ested m aterial being a subs tantial pa rt of the m arket (Am erican Herbal Products Association 2003). As a resu lt, extensive and poten tially unsustainable harvesting o f wild populations of ech inacea has occurred. In addition, two species, E. tennesseensis and E. laev igata , are very rare and are federally listed as endangered. Thus we have developed the national conser vation assessm ent presented in th is report, using the extensive research on Echinacea conducted at the University of Kansas, where one of the m ost extensive Echinacea h erbarium collections is lo cated and w as used to d evelop th e most widely known system atic classification of Echinacea species (McGregor 196 8) and where m ore recent research has looked at its ethnobotany, wild harvest, and plant population dynam ics (Kindscher 1989, 1992; Hurlburt 1999). In addition, th e Kansas Biological Survey at th e University of Kansas is a partne r in th e U.S. Natural Heritage Program and Canadian Conservation Data Centre (CDC) networks, which rank co nservation s tatus of Echinacea and o ther species and conservation elem ents throughout their ranges. W e hope that th is conservation assessm ent will contribute to a framework for successful conserv ation of Echinacea species by prom oting good stewardship among man agers and infor med awareness am ong users of the Nationa l Forests, National Grasslands, and other federal lands, as well as among private landowners. Maintaining the viability of wild populations of the species of th is wild-harvested and po tentially vu lnerable North Am erican plant genus is an im portant goal. 3 The U.S. Fo rest Service is responsible for m aintaining populations of plants and anim als on the 191 m illion acres of National Forests and National Grasslands in 4 3 states and for developing and dissem inating up-to-date informa tion on threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. This inform ation on species status, dist ribution, stewardship, and biology provides an essential lin k in the For est Service managem ent of these great natural resources. Utilizing the vast and up-to-date national and international im periled spec ies data m aintained by coo perato rs like Her itage program s is im perative for implemen ting adequate m anagem ent of National Forests and Grasslands. The Forest Service strives to protect and restore populations and habitats for more than 2 80 species o f plants and anim als offi cially des ignated as b eing threatened or endangered with extinction, and provides spec ial m anage ment for m ore than 2,500 plant and anim al species on its reg ional sens itive-spec ies lis ts. Managem ent of thes e vulnerable links in the biodiversity chain is crucial for im plem enting the Forest Service vision of ecosystem manage ment. Because of its responsibility to natural resource m anage ment, the U.S. Forest Service has undertaken an ev aluation of echinacea species status and conservation. Our assessm ent is a collaborative effort by a team of researchers directed by Kelly Kindscher, Ph.D. at the Kansas Biological Su rvey at the University of Kansas, and is based on field studies, data collection, and observation. Th is work has been peer reviewed, but it is still open for interpretation and, we hope, continued dialogue and discussion. The perspective for th is study is pu rposef ully broad, and we accom plished the following objectives : 1. We co mpiled range-wide status inform ation on all nine currently recognized species in th e plant g enus Echinacea based on herbarium records throughout their 4ranges. W e have developed Geographic In formation System (GIS) m aps showing the docum ented distributions of all species. 2. We thoroughly reviewed the literature related to the conservation status of echinacea sp ecies and as sessed cu rrent spec ies th reats, espec ially the m agnitude of any im pacts on the medicinal herb industry fro m overharvesting of these species. 3. We su mmarized the biology, life historie s, and autecology of all species, with a special em phasis on th e species m ost actively harvested for the m edicinal herb industry ( E. angustifo lia, E. purpurea E. pallida ) and their habitat requirem ents. 4. We reviewed the ethnobotanical us es of echinacea species, especially E. angustifo lia, which is th e most well d ocumented. 5. We m aintained cooperating relationships with pertinent m embers of the Natural Heritage Program network and sought assistance as needed from other organization s, agencies, and research ers to obtain a broad understanding of the biological and conservation status of the genus Echinacea and its com ponent species. 6. We collected field data f rom two loca tions with a history of echinacea harvest (the Little Missouri National Grasslands in North Dakota and private ranches in Kansas) for use in developing population and m onitoring plans. Those data are included in this repo rt. In addition, we visited a ddition al ranches in Texa s, Oklahom a, Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana where E. angus tifolia was growing, and we visited field sites in Mi ssouri, Oklahom a, and Kansas of E. atrorubens, E. 5pallida, E. paradoxa, and E. purpurea . We also visited specific locations where overharvesting is known to have occurred in north-central Kansas and Custer National Fo rest and the F t. Peck Ind ian Reservatio n in Montan a. 7. We detailed the comm ercial h istory of echinacea harvest du ring the last 1 00-plus years in the north-central Kansas ran gelands. 8. We reviewed m odern medicinal uses of echinacea, which co uld have a g reat bearing on the conservation st atus of wild populations. 9. We provided inform ation on what is known about echin acea m arket cycles and demand. 10. We reviewed the legal protection status of echincea under both state and federal law. 11. We assessed the extent o f cultiva tion activ ities pe rnationally, espe cially as tho se activities rela te to po ssible amelioration of i mpacts from wild harvesting. 12. We reviewed the systematics of the genus Echin acea, including current suggested revisions and unresolved taxonom ic que stions pertinent to echinacea conservation. 13. We developed conservation recommendations for all spec ies, includ ing th e seven species tha t are not f ederally lis ted. 14. We assessed the appropriaten ess of proposing listing of any Echinacea taxa under CITES and/or under the U.S. Endang ered Species Act. 15. We created an echinacea-m onitorin g plan that can be used by staff of the National Forests, National Grasslands, other federa l agencies, state agencies, the Nature 6Conservancy, and other nonprofits to m onitor existing stands of echinacea species that occur on lands under their jurisdiction. 16. Lastly, the study of these objectives has resulted in the com pilation of the following reports, resulting in a range- wide conservation assessm ent for the genus Echin acea.

The taxonomy of the genus Echinacea (Com positae ). Univer sity an d Clas sification of Echinacea Species Kelly Kinds cher and Re becca W ittenberg Taxonom y is the science of na ming natural orga nism s so that the nam es of organism s can be organized to show relationshi ps that reflect th eir evo lution ary history. It provides the nomenclatural basis of all the natural sciences. Taxono my enable s us to identify a species no matter what language we speak or common na me we use by assigning a L atin binom ial nam e (genus and species ) to an organism . Each binom ial nam e is unique. Common nam es, although useful in the field, are som etimes confusing and of lim ited use beyond where they are co mmonly used. For ex ample, all nine species o f Echinacea (and of several other genera as well) have been called \"Snakeroot.\" Identifying s pecies by Latin binom ials is important when working with a m edicinal species. Many nam es used in the natural products industry refer to older texts, and older nam es often are quoted in the literature. Thus it is im portant to be aware of all the possible nam es used for a particular plant. W ith recently proposed revisions to the nam es of species in the genus Echinacea, there can b e confusion between the n ewly nam ed E. pallida var. angustifolia and its former name, E. angustifolia. Fortun ately, the Flora of North America editors (Urb atsch et al. 2005) have decided to m aintain the common taxono my of the Echinacea genus. Because of high m orphological variability with in the genus, its taxonomy has often changed since the 1700s . As a result of this taxono mic confusion, som e Germ an research that was actually conducted on the species Echinacea purpurea was originally reported to be on the species E. angustifo lia (Foster 1991; McKeown 1999; Binns et al. 2004). Individual plants do not always fit the descriptions provided below, and hybridiza tion in the w ild occurs where species rang es overlap. 8Taxonomic History of the genus Echinacea The genus Echinacea is in the daisy fam ily, Asteraceae, which is also called Com positae. Although we now know it to be the genus called Echinacea, species belonging in it have also been placed in the gen era Rudbeckia and Brauneria. These n ames are importan t to kn ow because older botanical, horticultural, a nd m edical texts may use these na mes in discussing what we now call Echinacea. In 1753, Linnaeus described a species we know to be in the genus Echinacea, nam ing it Rudbeckia p urpurea. (The genus nam e came from the nam e of the Swiss botanist Olaf Rudbec, and the specific epithet m eans Species P lantarum, the identif icatio n of this spe cies on the e americanum of of Robert Morison (1699). effectively nam ed the genus Rudbeckia. In 1790, Noel Joseph de Necker renam ed the genus Brauneria (after the botanist Jakob Brauner), but that nam e was later invalidated by the organization responsible for regula ting botanical nam es, the Intern ational Botanical Congress. In 1794 Conrad Moench renam ed the species that L innaeus had described as Echinacea purpurea , naming the genus after the Greek w ord \"ech inos,\" meaning hedgehog, because of th e spiny projections on its cone in the seed stage (Hobbs 1995). When it was realized that Linnaeus 's Rudbeckia purpurea did not belong in the genus Rudbeckia , the rules of the Internatio nal Botanical Congress, called the Internati onal Code of Botanical No menclature, dictated that the ge nus nam e should have been the oldest valid published nam e. But no nam e published before 1753, when Linnaeus used the nam e Rudbeckia, had priority, and Brauneria was no longer appropriate. The c ongress therefore decided that Echinacea was the first validly published nam e and should be used in preference to Rudbeckia or 9Brauneria. (Hobbs 1995; Rudbeckia is, of course, a valid genus na me for severa l spec ies, but it does not include the species we refer to as Echinacea .) More Recent Taxonomies McGregor (1968) conducted a 15-yea r morphological analysis of the Echinacea genus, utilizing field studies; transplant, greenhouse, a nd garden studies; and all possible crosses and backcross es of species a nd their varieties. Binns et al. 's (2002) system atic survey of Echinacea is more recen t, using phyto chemical analysis as we ll as m orphological features for classification purposes. System atic DNA research is being conduc ted that may help further clarify the species relationships (Urbatsch et al. 2000; K im et al. 2004; Mechanda 2004). Research by Binns and her colleagues does not support McG regor's taxa at the species level. This is not a new occurrence. For exam ple, in 1955 Cronquist reduced E. angustifo lia to a variety of E. pallida . These tax a are very sim ilar, so wh ether they are sep arate species or varie ties of the sam e species would n ot seem all that im portan t. But thes e two particu lar taxa are both m edicinally im portant, so differences in classification have had a con fusing effect, especially in the m edicinal pl ant trade. For instance, in 1825, Constantine Rafinesque wrote about the m edicinal properties of plants he placed in the genus Helichroa (Hobbs 1995). No one realized that he was refe rring to the genus now called Echinacea, and much of his work went unnoticed. B ecause of this past and p resent confusion, Binns et al. suggested conserving the name Echin acea purpurea \u2014meaning that the nam e stays the sam e even if future taxo nomic work indicates that the n ame should change acco rding to bo tanical n aming rules. The International Botanical Congress deci ded to conserve the name (Binns et al. 2004). 10 For ease of use and to avoid confusion, McGregor's (1968) taxonom y, now essentially adapted by the Flora of North America (Urbats ch et al. 2005), is used thr oughout this chapter. Table 1 compares McGregor's and B inns et al.'s trea tments. Although Echinacea has been cultivated, it has under gone less selection than m ight be expected for a plant with a horticultur al history dating back to 1860 and only E. purpurea has been develo ped as a cu ltivar (S tarman et al. 1995 ). Several cu ex ist, such as \"Magnus,\" lavender coneflower, and \"White Sw an,\" an all-white option (both offered by commercial seed com panies), bu t until recen tly, most varie ties were seen in wild pop ulations (McGregor 1968), with the exceptio n of a newly introduced doubled horticultural strain and a newly developed orange-petalled variety (Hawks 2004). In ad dition, exten sive germ plasm collections by McKeown (1999) and others ha ve now been archived in the USDA National Germ plasm System at Iowa State Univers ity and will be av ailable f or both medicinal p lant and horticultural breeding program s. Distinguishing Characteristics of Echinacea Species Within the fam ily Asteraceae (Compositae), Echinacea are herbaceou s perennials w ith erect stem s. The lower leaves are often with s talks; the up per leaves are usually attached dir ectly to st ems. Leaves are oval to lan ce shaped, s ometimes toothed, som etimes hairy, with three to five veins running fr om base to tip. The center of th e flower is a spiky cone head surrounded by ray flowers. Each flower head is s ubtended by a group of three to four whorls of bracts. Ray f lowers are usually rose-colored to purple, white, pink, or yellow (McGregor 1968). County-specific range m aps for each species are in the Biolog y and Ecolo gy chapter (in this volum e) while generalized ranges related to U.S. Forest Serv ice are b elow. 11Echinacea angustifolia Stem s are 10-50 cm tall, sim ple, som etimes branched, sparsely to densely covered w ith rough thick hairs, and occasionally swollen at their bases. The l eaves are oblong, lanceolate, and entire, with entire (nev er serrated) leaf m argins; dark gree n, with veins slightly m ore rounded than parallel. The head is conical and the pales (receptacle sp ines) are rigid at the tip. The ray flowers are very short (2-4 cm long), shorter than the width of the head and spreading (perpendicular to the stem s) with very little drooping. The pe tals are about as long as the diam eter of the central cone. It is found on barre n, dry prairies, thin so ils, and lim estone and sandstone rock outcrops in the Great Plains. McG regor (1968) recognized two varieties (var. strigosa and var. angustifolia ), but these are not suppor ted by the work of Binns et al. (2002) and others and are the only significant change from the taxonom y that will be used in the Flora of North America (Urbats ch et al. 2005). 12Figure 1. T he range of Echinacea a ngustifo lia related to U. S. Forest Se rvice lands. 13Echinacea atrorubens Stem s are 30-90 cm tall, light green, hairy and simple or rarely branched. Leaves are lanceolate and entire, often sm ooth. Pales tips are rigid. Short ray flowers (2-4 cm long) curve down to touch the stalk. The petals are dark pu rple, occasionally pink, or white. It grows on prairies. 14Figure 2. The range of Echinacea atrorubens related to U.S. Forest Se rvice lands. 15Echinacea laevigata Stem s are 50-100 cm tall and rarely branched. It often has a forked taproot, and the leaves are o vate and so metimes serrated. The b ristles of the central cone are only a q uarter as long as the m ain part of the cone and have flexib le curved tips. The ray flowers are three to ten times longer than wide. It grows in open woods and grassy glades. The U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service h as listed this sp ecies as end angered. 16Figure 3. T he range of Echinacea laevigata related to U.S. Forest Service lands. 17Echinacea pallida Stem s are 40-90 cm tall. The leaves are lanceo late with entire m argins. The head is conical, and the pales are rigid at the tips. This is the only Echinacea with white pollen . The ray flowers or petals are narrow and droop and curve toward the stem and are 4-9 cm . The ray flowers are usually white to pink but can very occas ionally be deep purple. This plant occurs in woods, glades, and rocky prairies. 18Figure 4. T he range of Echinacea pallida relate d to U.S. Forest Se rvice lands. 19Echinacea paradoxa Stem s are 30-80 cm tall, light green, and otherw ise sm ooth. Leaves are lanceolate (never serrated). The central disk is dark brown a nd conical. Pales have rigid tips. Ray flowers are longer than the width of the head a nd vary from generally yellow (var. paradoxa, found in the Ozarks) to light purple (var. neglecta , found only in the Arbuckle Mountain area of Oklahom a). It grows in glades, on bald knobs, in open woods, and in rocky prairies. 20Figure 5. T he range of Echinacea paradoxa related to U.S. Forest Se rvice lands. 21Echinacea purpurea Stem s are 60-180 cm tall, often branching near the top with soft short hairs. The lowerm ost leaves a re oval to b roadly lanceo late and coarsely toothed with irregu lar teeth (the best characteristic for distinguishing this spec ies). The tips of the cente r cone are often tipped bright orange (probably the second-best disti nguishing characteristic). Pales have flexible straight tips. Bristles of the cen tral cone are half as long as th e cone's body. The ray flowers vary from rose to deep purple, rarely white. It grows in open woods, prairies, and thickets. 22Figure 6. T he range of Echinacea purpurea related to U.S. Forest Se rvice lands. 23Echinacea sanguinia Stem s are 40-90 cm tall. Leaves are lanceolate and entire. T he basal leaves are elliptical. Flower head is a ha lf sphere; it ha s thin stem s and dark red, rarely white, flowers. Pales have rigid tips. It grows on sandy pine barrens and prairies. 24Figure 7. T he range of Echinacea sanguinia related to U.S. Forest Service lands. 25Echinacea simulata Stem s are 40-90 cm tall. Leaves are lanceolate and entire. T he head is conical, and the tips of the pales are rigid. The ray flowers are 4-9 cm and dr ooping, usually pale white but can vary to deep purple. The pollen is ye llow, which helps dis tinguish it f rom E. pallida. It grows on rocky, open wooded hillsides and prairies. 26Figure 8. T he range of Echinacea simulata related to U.S. Forest Se rvice lands. 27Echinacea tennesseensis Stem s are 10-40 cm tall and are leafy with soft hairs. The leaves are lanceolate and entire. The head is con ical. The pollen is y ellow and sm all. The tips of the pales are rigid. Ligules are 2-4 cm long and spreading. The flower petals turn up as though to touch the sun. This species has been lis ted by the U .S. Fish and W ildlife Service as endangered. Only five populations are known, all in gravel ly cedar barrens and lim estone outcrops in central Tennessee. 28Figure 9. T he range of Echinacea tennesseensis related to U .S.

Thes e species have sim ilar biological and ecological requirem ents. Echinacea angustifolia has the largest geographical range and is the prim ary species discussed here, with notes given when other species differ significantly. Echinacea u tilizes the C 3 photosynthetic pathway. Although it has a cool-season p lant physiology, it is well adapted to sum mer heat a nd to dry periods. Seedlings germ inate in the early spring and have fleshy cotyledons that are followed by one true leaf . In the wild, this m ay be the entire growth for the first year. For olde r and m ore mature plants, growth begins early, when m ost danger of frost is past. For m ost of its range, that growth begins in April. Echinacea purpurea and E. laeviga ta have spreading, fibrous root s that are not as deep or as larg e in d iameter as other Echinacea species. These two s pecies b enefit from additional so il moisture an d are easier to transp lant, which m ay explain why E. purpurea is a favorit e for gardens and cultivation. Echinacea a ngustifo lia is anchored in the soil by a deep and large taproot (up to 1 inch in diam eter) that is alm ost woody and can grow 5.5-8 feet deep (W eaver and Fitzpatrick 1934 ). Taproot species can resprout from roots. This is not a form of reproduction but, rather, a m ethod of sustainin g the plan t. In Kansas wher e diggers harvested th e top 6 inches of E. angustifo lia roots with a pickaxe, 25% of r oots resprouted the first year af ter harvest, and up to 35% had resprouted by the second (Hurlburt 1999). 32 Echinacea reproduces o nly by seeds in the wild , and only a sm all percentage of the seeds that m ature in the f all germinate. In th e wild, seedlings grow slowly, som etimes requiring 3 years for the sm all rosette of basal leaves to put fort h a flower stalk (W eaver and Fitzpatrick 1934). By May, plants begin to bloom in Te xas and by the m iddle of June, plants throughout Kansas and the genus m idrange are flowering. In the northern reaches of its range (i.e., Montana and Saskatchewan), echinacea will flower into A ugus t. In an y given year, the m ajority of m ature plants do no t bloom , but it appears th at the h ealth iest p lants will b loom during m ost good years. Flowering lasts about a month. Echinacea pol linators includ e a diverse m ix of flying insects, including native bees, wasps and butterf lies. Som e rare butterflies such as Dak ota skippers pollinate Echin acea spec ies in the no rthern Pla ins while regal f ritillar ies po llinate th em in the upper Midwest an d central Plains. \"Echin acea is an out-crosser, sh aring pollen with other individuals f or miles around, the spread of pollen lim ited only by large land features and the practical range of the pollinators\" (Cech 2002). Wh ere species ranges overla p, pollinators carry pollen from one species to another, and this may encourage the species crosses observ ed by McGregor (1968). The sterile s trap-shaped ray flowers have at tractive colors ranging from pink to purple. An exceptio n is E. paradoxa var. paradoxa, which is a yello w-flowered purple con eflower. The brownish-purple to m aroon disk flowers are fertil e, and the corolla expands into a fleshy bulb- like base, while the tube is cy lindrical and has a 5-lobed erec t limb (Hobbs 1989). Flowers bloom from the center of the co ne outward, and the se eds mature later in th e same order. Ech inacea makes considerable quantities of relatively la rge but lightweight seeds. It m ay take 145,000 seeds to m ake one pound (Foster 1990). Individu al cones can produce 100 or m ore seeds, and 33large h ealth y plants o ccasiona lly have m ore than one cone (flowering head) in the wild. An exception to this is E. purpurea , which m akes several flowers each seaso n. Once f ertiliz ation is complete, ray f lowers be gin to fade, and the cone itself swells and becom es nearly round as the seed m atures. The poi nted receptacle spines protect the green seed, but when th e seed ripen s, it loo sens in the con e head and begins to work its way out between the recep tacle s pines. By au tumn, som e of the seed s will ripen an d scatter in the wind. The cones continue to open up over a period of m onths, al lowing for dispersal when air is dry throughout the winter and even into the early spring. Although Echinacea seeds are considered to be gravity-dispersed, high winds acr oss sparsely vegetated habitats can blo w seeds con siderab le distan ces across rocky o r crus ty frozen su rfaces. The rains an d snows of winter leach germ ination-inhibiting co mpounds fr om the seed, and the oscillating tem peratures of winter and early spring help break the dorm ancy (Cech 2002). Echinacea's underground plant parts stor e food during th e long period of winter dorm ancy and account f or the rapid growth of the plants following their early awakening in the spring. Plants rapidly begin stor ing n utrients in th eir roo ts after flowering and seed developm ent are com plete and continue this process until they go dorm ant late in the f all. This is an im portant stage for th e health of th e plant. Echinacea a ngustifo lia is very drought tolerant. Ac ross its range, wind movem ent is fairly constant and often high, which prom otes water loss. The long strappy leaves and coarse hairs of the E. angustifo lia plant protect it from excessive ev apotranspiration. The deep taproot evolved to find water sto red deep in the ground, often am ong l arge ro cks. When conditions are too extrem e, the plan t will go dorm ant or th e seed s will r emain dorm ant, waiting f or more conducive w eather to germ inate. Echinacea angus tifolia seeds can rem ain dorm ant for a couple 34years, then germ inate and grow (Cech 2002). Germ ination rates, as with m any wild species, are low in the w ild, well under 50% (Foster 1990).W hile m any of the plants co mpeting with E. angustifo lia will be s et back by fire (especially w oody species), E. angustifolia 's deep roots are protected in the ground and are likely to reem erge, even after a hot fire, and continue to grow. Seedlings can also em erge after a fire, and seed s, too, will often survive a f ire pas sing through the land scape. Cech (2002) points ou t that \"Echin acea is designed for life among grasses. This is evidenced b y the roo t form (taproot) that u tilizes a different soil horizon than do the grasses. The rosette springs fro m a cohesive crown, and the leaves push back the grasses and lay on top of them to photosynthesize, making roo m for the ta ll echin acea stalks. These stalks are in turn adapted to hold the flow er and the seed out of direct com petition with the grasses. \" (Cech 2002) Echinacea species, with few exceptions, are remarkab ly free fro m disease. It is thought that the m edicinal properties of ech inacea m ay be due to seco ndary chem ical com pounds that defend the p lant ag ainst insects. Desp ite these def occas plants being denud ed by tent caterp illars (in both Kansas and Montana), and we have occas ionally s een root dam age caused by root borer predation (in both Kansas and Montana as well; root borer predation is likely to occur througho ut echin acea's range). T he disease, aster yellows, is found in the wild, but rar ely, occurring m ostly in cultiv ated E. purpurea. Basing her findings on 3 years of field data gathered from detailed plant population work in our study area in north-central Kansas, Dana Price Hurlburt (1999) calculated that wild E. angustifo lia can liv e between 18 and 44 years. T he longe vity of these plants, their ab ility to produce significant num bers of seed in good years, and their ability to at least occasionally resprout if the root is dam aged or du g, all allow for the continuation of wild populations. 35Habitat Echinacea species typically prefer full sun and well-drained soils. They are often found in thick patches on rocky sloping limestone or sandstone outcroppings in native habitats, although they also can occur in glades, barrens, and openings in forest s (McGregor 1968). Under these conditions, they are usually found with in a grass-dom inated plant co mmunity. When growing among native g rasses, echin acea roo ts utilize a deep er soil ho rizon than the g rasses do, reach ing sev eral feet into the ground and ther eby avoiding co mpetition with the g rasses. In the Little Missour i Nationa l Grass lands of North Dakota, we surveyed grasses growing alongside E. angustifo lia and found the dom inant species to be needle-and-thread grass (Bouteloua curtipendula; see the tables in the Baselin e Monitoring chapte r, in this volum e). Echinacea angustifo lia was the m ost comm on non-grass species, ranking fifth of all species in plan t cover, ind icating that it is the most do minant forb species in these habitats. Other dom inant forbs a nd woody species m easured in the dense E. angustifo lia stands of North Dakota in cluded creeping Kansas, E. angustifolia by the following e spaces ex ist for deep- forbs such as ech inacea. Im portan t forbs in the Kansas sites were, in the following order of amount of cover, E. angustifo lia, Echinacea is a slow-gro wing plant in the w ild, and seedlings can eas ily be crowded o ut by invasive, fast-growing taxa. Throughout the centuries, prairie fires have served E. angustifo lia very well by rem oving trees and shrubby growth th at would likely overcom e native fo rbs if left unchecked. Echinacea species with taproots (all species except E. purpurea and E. laevigata, which have fibrous roots) require well-drained soils. Because tapro ots can r each water and nutrients deep in th e ground, these species are extrem ely drought hard y. W ild stan ds of echinacea have survived s evere drough t cycles throu gh the cen turies, bu t such conditions will serious ly affect the production o f seed size and viability. Species with fibrous roots are better adapted to po orly drained so ils, m aking good use of surface m oisture and nutrients (Cech 20 02). Althoug h echinacea can be found in a variety of soil types, rocky clay, sandy loam , and lim e substrates are where large healthy populations will likely be found. Echinacea spec ies genera lly prefer a pH between 6 and 7 (Cech 2002), but E. angustifolia and E. pallida tolera te more alkalin e soil, while E. paradoxa and E. tenn esseens is tolerate a m ore acid so il. Distribution The genus Echinacea has a wide distribution, extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic and fro m Texas and Florida up into sout hern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and O ntario. The densest populations exist throughout the short- and m ixed-grass prai ries, extending to the edge of the ta ll-gras s prairie (see Figures 1-7: range m aps Echinacea's wide, but patchy, dis tribution c a range of moisture an d tem perature regim es, from central Texas, Georgia, and Alaba ma to f rigid winters in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Canada. Most wild p opulations of echinacea occur on private prop erty, based on 37herbarium records and observations. Throughout the northern Plains, m any of these populations occur on cattle ranches. So me private hay m eado ws that are used only for hay production and are not grazed provide know n habitat for E. angustifo lia, E. pallida, and E. atrorubens in the eastern Great Plains and Midwest. The Nature Cons ervancy has protected num erous tracts w ith known populations of echinacea. A dditionally, m any trib al land s contai n extensiv e stands of echinacea, includ ing native p rairie areas on th e Osage, Pota watom i, San tee, Rosebud, Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Ft. Berthold, Crow , Cheyenne, Fort Peck, and other Indian Reservations. Public lands also prov ide important habita t for n ative popu lations of echinacea. Natio nal grasslands are known to contain E. angustifo lia in a wide band stre tching through the Great Plains states fro m Oklah oma to North Dakota, including the Thunder Basi n, Little Missouri, Buffalo Gap, Black Kettle, and Kiowa National Grasslands. U.S. Forest Service lands contain several Echinacea species, notably E. angustifo lia, in th e Custer National Fores t, Black Hills National Forest, and the Nebraska National Forests, a nd other species are found in the Mark Twain, Ozark-St. Francis, and o ther Nation al Forests. Specific Habitat and Range of Echinacea Species The following is a short discuss ion of the specific habitat of each Echinacea species followed by a m ap of the known locations based on county records at herbaria. These m aps reflect on ly location s from herbariu m species wher e it could be verified, direc tly or indirec tly, that the herb arium record was, in fact, the co rrect species. W e prim arily lo oked at herb arium specim ens ourselves or obtained the expert opinio n of other botanists. The three species used in commerce\u2014 E. angustifolia , E. pa llida, and E purpurea \u2014are discussed first, followed by the rest in alphab etical ord er. 38Echinacea angustifolia Echinacea a ngustifo lia has the m ost northerly range of the Echinacea species, stretching from central Texas to so uthern Sask atchewan an d Manitob a. It inh abits rocky and dry prairies, open woodlands, and glades and is often associated with a lim estone substrate. This species will most often be found on sunny, well-drained, rock y outcroppings, hilltops , and southwest-facing hillsides. It is found in openings am ong ponderos a pine trees in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Custer National Forest in Montana, and other ponderosa pine stands throughout the northern plains. Echinacea angus tifolia has a deep tap root, adapting w ell to dry co nditions. of Echinacea angustifolia 40Echinacea pallida Echinacea pallida occurs just east of the rang e of E. angustifo lia in rocky or deep-soil prairies, wo odlands, and glades. It becom es less common in the eastern parts of its range owing to less op en habita t and the occurren ce of other Echinacea species. It is most abundant in sunny, well-drained prairies. 2. Range of Echinacea pallida 42Echinacea purpurea Echinacea purpurea inhabits open woods and prairies and is so metimes fo und in lowland riparian areas, which are also often partially shaded. This species has a fibrous root and can tolerate we tter soils. I t also has la rger leaves , making it m ore adapted f or habitats with less light. For these reasons, hom e owners a nd gardeners do well growing it. 43Figure 3. Range of Echinacea purpurea 44Echinacea atrorubens Echinacea atrorubens occurs in prairies and open woodl ands in both deep soils and rocky habitats in a very narrow ra nge from Texas to Kansas. 45Figure 4. Range of Echinacea atrorubens 46Echinacea laevigata 20 recorded occu rrences from Virgin ia to Georgia at the eastern edge of the range for the species com plex. It is found in open woods, cedar barrens, grassy glades, and bluffs. Open habitats in these states have been lost due to suppression of fire and habitat alteration. Because of its im periled s tatus, E. laeviga ta was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1992 (U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service 1995). 47Figure 5. Range of Echinacea laeviga ta 48Echinacea paradoxa This spec ies has two distinct va rieties. Echinacea paradoxa var. paradoxa is found in glades, on bald knobs, in open woods, and in roc ky prairies in the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri. Echinacea paradoxa var. neglecta is found only in the Arbuckle Mountains of southern Oklahom a, whe re it is found in pr airies, on granitic outcrops, and in woodland paradoxa 50Echinacea sanguinea Echinacea sanguinea has the m ost southern range of all Echinacea species and is found in open sandy fields and pine woods. 51Figure 7.

It has a large nu mber of common na mes and Ind ian nam es (See Table 1). It has been used for a variety of ailm ents, includ ing to othache, cou ghs, colds, s ore thro ats, snakebite, and as a pain killer. In th e Native American h ealing system, the uses of any plant, such as ech inacea, are grounded in a religious o r spiritual context. Spiritual forces, com ing through th e plant, are the healing agent, rather than the chem icals of m odern W estern scie nce. Although the vast m ajority of medicinal plants that Native Americans have used within the region have pharm acologically active sub stances (Kin dscher 1992), these plants h ave not been used by Native Americans for the so le purpose of benefiting from active ingredien ts. Rather, th ese plants, an d others, a re prim arily us ed for their s piritual healing properties. The use of Echinacea an gustifo lia by Native Am ericans is no t just a historical practice. It is still being harvested a nd used trad itionally today on m any reserv ations. The author has observed its use on the R osebud Sioux Indian Rese rvation in S outh Dakota. On the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana where Echinacea angustifo lia is still bein g used trad itionally, there is great concern that it is being over-har vested for the herbal product trade (Kolster, 1998). The history of North Am erican settlem ent by Europeans is a history dom inated by the lack of interest in or antagonism toward traditi onal practices. The traditional m edicinal plant use of Native Am ericans was conta ined within a sp iritual worldv iew that was very f oreign to Europeans. Soon after contact, c onflicts em erged between those of European heritage and Native 58Americans. These conflicts ultim ately resulted in much of Native Am erican cultu re being stripped away and m ost tribes being forced to give up their lands and settle on reservations. Often these reservations were not part of their ho melands, where th eir familiar m edicin al plan ts grew. Travelers, traders, and early doctors sel dom took the opportunity to learn about m edicinal plant resources from Native Am ericans. This occu rred for a varie ty of re asons including warfare, attitudes of cultu ral and scien tific su periority, in ability to communicate because of language problem s, and different spiritual and cultural practices. Ethnobotany (the study of cultural use of plant m aterials) is a relatively new science, so unfortunately there has b een little funding in the past (or currently) for this endeavor. Most especi ally in the G reat P lains, m any tribes that us ed echinacea were never en couraged to share what they know. Because of this situation, there is relatively little ethnobotanical inform ation on how echinacea species were used for m edicine among Native Am ericans. Specifically, we kno w little t the lesser-k nown echinacea species uses (Kindscher, 1989; Foster, 1991). In addition, we know very l ittle about trad itional harvest methods, m anagem ent, preparation, and dosage. The ethnobo tanist Melvin Gilm ore reported in 19 17 that the m acerated root of the pu rple coneflower (m ethod of p reparation and dosage not gi ven) was \"used as an antidote for snake bite and other veno mous bites and stings and poisono us conditions\" by all th e Indians of th e Upper Missouri River region (Gilm ore, 1977). In addition, these Indians used the purple coneflower \"for m ore ailm ents than any other plant\" (Gilm ore, 1913a). The Dakota (Sioux) used the freshly scraped root as a rem edy for hydrophobia (rabies), snakebite, and situa tions where a wound had putrefied (Sm ith, 1928). They applied the root (probably ground up) for its \"feeling of coolness\" to areas of inflammation to relieve the se nsation of burning (Gilm ore, 1913b). The Lakotas (Sioux) used the root and green fruit for relieving thirst or perspiration and also as a painkilling 59remedy for toothaches, tonsillitis wels (Rogers, 1980; Munson, 1981). The Lakota on the Standing Rock Reservation use the powdered root for toothache and as a poultice for wounds and sores (Left Hand Augu st, as cited in Kraft, 1986). During visits to the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota over the last 12 years, the author learned that the purple coneflower is still widely harvested by th e Lakotas for a variety of m edicinal uses. The Om ahas recognized two kinds of purple coneflower: nuga (\"male\"--being larger and having (\"fem ale\"--b Gilm ore, 1913a). The Omahas used som e parts of the plant (identified as Echinacea pallida , but probably E. angustifo lia, see discussion by Baskin et al., 1993, 1994) for sore eyes, and m edicine m en applied the m acerated roo t as a local anesth etic so that they could remove pieces of m eat from a boiling po t without flinching. This practice indicated to others their ability to perform supernatural feats. A W innebago m edicine m an also used it to m ake his mouth insensitiv e to heat so tha t he could ta ke a liv e coa l into h is mouth to dem onstrate his power (Gilm ore, 1977). Both of these feat s helped to create confidence in the hu man ability to heal. The Kiowas have used the purple coneflower root as a cough m edicine since prehistoric times. In the 1930s, they still used the dried seed head as a comb and brus h (Vestal and Schultes, 1939). The Kiowas and the Cheyenne treated co lds and sore throats by chewing a piece of the purple coneflower root and let ting the saliva run down the throat (Vestal and Schultes, 1939; Grinnell, 19 62). The Kiowa-Apache used a little pi ece of the root and s tuffed it into th e cavity of an aching tooth or pounded it to use against a sore gu m or toot h like a poultice (Jordan, 1965). They dug the roots at any tim e of the year, but the plants were m ost easily located in the summ er when they were in bloom or shortly thereafter. A year's supply of roots would then be dug and 60dried. Dried roots were supposedly more potent than fresh ones, though either could be used (Jordan, 1965). The Cheyennes used the purple con eflower as a rem edy for sore m outh and gu ms. They made a tea from the leaves and roots; som etimes it was powdered first (Grinnell, 1962). This liquid was also rubbed on a sore neck to relie ve pain. Toothache was relieved by letting this liquid contact the cavity . The root was chewed to stim ulate the flow of saliva, which was especially useful for Sun Dance participants as a thirst preventative (Hart, 1981). The Cheyenne also drank a purple con eflower tea for rheum atism, arthritis, mu mps, and m easles. A purple coneflower salve was made for external use in treating these ailm ents. When the roo ts were mixed with blazing star ( Mentzelia laevicau lis) and boiled, the resulting tea was drunk to relieve smallpox. When purple coneflower roots were mixed with puffball ( Lycoperdon species) spo res and skunk oil, they were used to treat boils. Edwin Denig lived at Fort Union along the Missouri River in Montana for 21 years during the mid-1800s and cam e to know the Assi niboine people well. In discussing their medicine, he reported that the purple coneflower was their m ost im portant m edicinal plant: \"The principal of these is the black root, called by them the comb root, from the pod on the top being com posed of a stiff surface that can be used as a com b. It is called by the French racine noir, and grows everywhere in the prairie throug hout the Indian country. It is chewed and applied in a raw state with a banda ge to the part af fected. W e can bear witn ess to th e efficacy of this roo t in the cure of the bite of the rattle snake o r in alleviating the pain and reducing the tension and inflammation of frozen parts, gunsho t wounds, etc. It has a slightly pungent taste resem bling black pepper, and produces a great deal of saliva while chew ing it. Its virtues are 61known to all the tribes w ith which w e are acquainte d, and it is often used with success.\" (Denig, 1930) As this pass age indicates, French trappers and traders were p robably aware of the medicinal qualities of the purple coneflower. Other tr ibes that lived in the Grea t Plains and the Tallgrass Prairie reg ion to the eas t used the native purple coneflower. Am ong these trib es were the C rows, Hidatsas, Co manches, and Pawnees. The Crows chewed the root for colds an d drank a tea prepared from the root for colic (Hart, 1976), and on the present-day Crow Reserv ation in Montana, trad itionalists describe E. angustifo lia as having the \"greatest m edicinal value of all p lants (Sne ll, as cited in K olster, 1998). Hidatsa warrio rs chewed sm all pieces of th e root as a stim ulant when traveling all nigh t (Nickel, 1974). The Comanches used the root for treating sore throat and toothache (Carlson and Jones, 1939). The Pawnees also used the root for m edicinal purposes (Gilmore, 1977). Roots excavated fro m one of their earthen lodge vill ages (the Hill site, located near Guide R ock, Nebraska, and occupied around 1800 ) were identified as purple coneflower by Melvin Gilm ore at the University of Michigan Ethnobotanical Laboratory (Wedel, 1936). H.C.F. Mey er, who introduced echinacea to the Lloyd Brothers Phar macy, suppo sedly learned of its m edicinal use from the Pawnee (Meyer, 1887; Foster, 1991). Echinacea s pecies were also used ou tside of the Great Plains . An Indian from Mexico, who served as a translator for Melvin Gilm ore when he was interviewing the Lakotas on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in 1912, indicated that the purple coneflower was used by his people for snake bites (Gilm ore, 1913b). The nativ e distribution of the purple coneflower does not extend into Mexico. Its use in Mexico m ay indicate a his tory of trad e for this roo t between 62tribes of the southern po rtion of the P rairie Bioregion and Mexi co or that s pecies us ed sim ilarly were also found in Mexico. The Meskwaki or Fox used the plant (probably E. pallida , rather than E. angustifo lia), along with the roots of wild ginger ( Asarum canadense part of a m edicinal cure for stom ach cram ps (Smith, 1928). Their nam e for the plant translates as \"sm ells like a m uskrat scent\" or \"widow's comb\" (to co mb the hair; Sm ith, 1928). The use of E. purpurea is record ed for the Delaware in Oklahom a in 1942 (Tantaquidgeon, 1942, as cited in Shem luck, 198 2) and for the Choctaw (Ca mpbell, 1951). The Choctaw use was recorded by a self-taught physician and trading-post operator, Gideon Lincecum , who lived in Mississipp i and Georgia between 18 00 and 1835 and m ade herbarium specim ens. He reported: \"The tincture of the roots of this plant ha s been used with success in bad cough, and dyspepsia attended with a bad cough. . . The Choctaws use it for the above purposes, by chewing and swallowing the saliva. T hey keep a small piece o f the root in the m outh nearly all the tim e, continuing its use for a long tim e\" (Cam pbell, 1951). As m entioned previously, ech inacea use is not ju st a his torical phenom ena. Many tribes in the Gre at Plains a re still ac tively using it f or medicine. There has been little recent ef fort to learn about those practices, although the work of Kolster (1998) is one recent exception. For this to be rem edied, funding for research and suffici ent tim e for traditional learning opportunities are needed. Most Native American people still have great qualm s about sharing their knowledge and often feel th at it is inapp ropria te to s hare it for published resources beca use it could be taken out of context. As m entioned prev iously, the Nativ e Am erican h ealth and healing system does not 63separate sp irit from substance. Med icinal p lants n eed to be gathered and p repared p roperly (usually with prayers and cerem ony) to be effect ive. Nonetheless, ethnobotanists have much to learn, and th e entire con text of echin acea's uses can be appro priately sh ared and understood if the sharing can be done within a context of re spect. This provides an opportunity for Native Americans and ethnobotanists (of any heritage) to develop ways to collaborate. Considering the great im portance of the use of echin acea a nd the wealth of in formation still unknown by ethnobotan ists of its trad itional use, N ative American knowled ge about ech inacea is still an untapped resource. 64Table 1: Nam es for Echinacea species (Kindscher 1992) Common Nam es: Purple conef lower, root Indian head, com blac k susans, hedge hog (in referen ce to spiny seed head) \"comb plant\" Ponca): inshta m eans h ksapitahako, ce to mushroom ) ica'hpehu, you n umb\" (Kiowa-Apache) 65Literatur e Cited Baskin, J.

Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 112. 68One Hu ndred Years of Echinacea angustif olia Harvest in the Smoky Hills of Kans as, USA Dana M. Price and Kelly Kindscher The popular m edicinal herb echinacea led a dr amatic expansion of the U.S. herbal products m arket from 1994 to 1998. During this tim e medicinal plants, sold as herbal products in the United S tates, expanded out of their specialty niche in health food st ores to reach the m ass market. In the process, sales of herbal produc ts grew fro m U.S. $360 m illion per year in 1981(Tyler 1986) to $1. 6 billion in 1994 (Brevo ort 1996) and $3.87 billion in 1998 (Brevoort 1998). Despite a downturn from 1999 to 2000, herbal products had sales of about $4.13 billion in 2000 (Blumenthal 2001 b). Echinacea accounted for a bout 9% of this m arket and was the top - selling m edicinal h erb in the United States, wi th retail s ales totaling approxim ende mic to tall- and midgrass prairie and glade habitats and open woodlands of North Am erica (McGregor 1968; Binns et al. 2002; Urbatsch et al. 2005). Three o f the nine sp ecies in the genus are importan t in commerce: Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, E. pallida (Nutt.) Nutt., an d E. angustifolia DC. Because it is easy to gro w, Echinacea purpurea use has been predom inantly f rom cultivated sources (McGuffin 2001). E. pallida, E. angustifo lia, and other uncomm on species in the genus have been h arvested pr imarily f rom the wild, with the m ajority of wild harvest be ing E. angustifo lia (Foster 1991; Fuller 1991; McGuffin 2001). For these and other wild-harvested medicinal species in comm erce, concerns are incr easing regarding the sustainability of supply. Trade in wild-harvested (\"wildcrafted\") m edicinal herbs is culturally and econom ically important, yet its effects on wild populations are not well understood. The long-term econom ic or ecological sustainability of comme rcial ha rvest of even well-known wild-harvested plant 69products has received little study (Godoy and Ba wa 1993; Hall and Bawa 1993; Balick and Cox 1996). Co mmerce in wild plants, with the excep tion of those listed under the Convention on Intern ational Trade in En dangered Sp ecies (CITES), is seldo m tracked b y U.S. federal or s tate agencies. Only five of the 175 native North Am erican plant taxa in comm erce are listed under CITES (Rob bins 1998). The tonnage of plants harv ested and the value of this trade have been quantified f or few species. Exam ples of i mporta nt medicinal plant harvests from the United States inclu de goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis; Bannerm an 1997), wild 1 999); saw palm etto ( Serenoa ), harvested for export in quantities possibly exceeding 6,800,000 kg annually (Bennett and Hicklin 1998); and Am erican ginseng (Panax quinquefolius ), with annual exports of 60 m etric tons of wild m aterial (Dreyfuss 1999) despite its large cultivated supply. Wild Echinacea angustifolia root harvest in 1998 w as over 90,000 kg (McGuffin 2 001). The vast majority of sustainable-use studies have concerned forest products, especially in the tropic s. Wild-harv ested p lants of North Am erican grassland habitats have rec eived little study, with the notable exception of Anderson' s (1993, 1996, 1997) and Anderson and Downey's (1999) work with food and fiber plants us ed by indigenous peoples of California. Echinacea angustifo lia, native to th e tall- and m idgrass p rairies of North Am erica, has been comm ercially harvested for its m edicinal properties for over 100 y ears. The threat of overharvesting has been a concern throughout its 100- year comm ercial history. Noneth eless, like other wild-harvested medicinal herbs, the impact of harvest on pl ant populations has neve r been quantified or associated w ith actual p ractices used by the harv esters, o r \"diggers.\" 70Echinacea's 100-year history of harvest Although echinacea was one of the most im portant medicinal plants used by indigeno us people in the Prairie Bioregion (Gilmore 1977), the de tails of its traditiona l method of harvest are not well known (Kindscher 1989). E. purpurea was the earliest ech inacea species to be mentioned in Euro-Am erican m edical botany (F oster 1991; Flannery 1999). E. angustifo lia was introduced to m edical use in 1885 by the folk doc tor H. C. F. Meyer of Pawnee City, Nebraska. Meyer sent a sam ple of his \"Meyer's Blood Puri fier\" to prom inent Eclectic physician John King (King 1887). The corresponding botanical sam ple, se nt to the Lloyd Brothers Pharm acists in Cincinnati, Ohio, was determ ined to be E. angustifo lia (J. U. Lloyd 1917; Foster 1991). King conducted therapeutic trials and becam e convinced of the plant's value; shortly thereafter, the Lloyd Brothers began m anufacture of E. angustifolia preparations (J. U. L loyd 1904, 1917). By 1897, the plant was well established am ong the Ec lectics, a group of physicians who emphasized the use of medicinal plants in their practice (J. U. Lloyd 1897). Also widely used by \"regular\" doctors, E. angustifo lia was the m ost-prescribed m edicine ma de from an Am erican plant through the 1920s (F oster 1991). Its use s ubsequently declined with the introduction of sulfa drugs and antibiotics (Foster 1991; Flannery 1999). However, since the 1980s, the resurgence of herbalism in the United States and Europe has brought a renewed interest in echinacea. The passage of the Dietary Supplem ent Health and Education Act of 1994 initiated the expans ion of herbal products includ ing echinacea into the m ass market. It was th e best-selling m edicinal herb in health foods stores in the United States fro m 1995 to 1999 (Rich man and Witkowsk i 1996, 1999; Johnston 1997, 1998a) and was also in the top 3-5 selling herbs in the m ass market during this tim e (Johnston 1998b; Blumenthal 2000). 71Conservation concerns and harvest practices : gaps in understanding With echinacea's increased popularity have co me warnings from the botanical and conserva tion community that its com mercial exploita tion is u nsustain able. Only a f ew years af ter its introduction to the m edical profession, conc ern was express ed that the q uantity harv ested exceeded th e plant's ab ility to reg enerate (Say re 1903). Decades later, McGregor (19 68) noted declin es in E. pallida populations in Eastern K ansas. Foster (1991) docu mented large harvests of uncommon echinacea sp ecies, E. paradoxa and E. simulata , in the Ozarks. Poaching in protected stands and overcollecting have been reported in Missouri (Missouri Depa rtment of Co nservation 1998; Trager 1998) and (Boyd 1997; La ntz 1997). A \"gold rush\" of unethical harvesting has affected North Dakota (Crawf ord 1998, 1999) and Montana (Kolster 1998; Kolster and Youpee 1998; Klein 1999). While these observations are com pelling, they a re insuf ficient to dete rmine how harvesting affects populations over tim e. To und erstand the impact of harvesting m ore fully, it is important to observe and quantify the actual ha rvest and m anagem ent practices used (Anderson 1993, 1997; Joyal 1996). It is essential to learn from harvesters both how they work and what they understand about the plant's growth and eco logy. This ethnobotanical approach leads to understand ing why diggers operate as they do an d what econ omic realit ies they face. These insights will enable the conservation community to place harv esting within the contex t of other e species' pe rsistence. Echinacea is unique am ong m ajor native Nort h Am erican medicinal plants in that it is native to the prairie rather than the forest and occurs in extensive populations on a landscap e scale. In contrast to the m edicinal plan ts that are forest herb s, such as ginsen g and goldenseal, E. angustifo lia still m ay be common over m uch of its historic range despite a long 72commercial harvest (th e NatureServ e global Heritage status rank is still G4, \"apparently secure\", although it is reported as declini ng to an unknown extent; NatureSe rve 2005). In this study, our objectives w ere to (1) learn from harv esters a bout their m ethods of harv est and views regarding its sustain ability; (2) co mpile historical inform ation about th e trad e in echinacea roots; and (3 ) identify factors that m ay contribute to sustain ability and to apply this inform ation to conservation of wild populations. METHODS Study area The study was conducted fro m 1996 to1998 with a follow-up visit in 2002. Our study area was in north-central Kansas, in Rooks C ounty and adjoining counties (39\u00ba05'-39\u00ba34'N, 99\u00ba00' -99\u00ba30'W ). This area was chosen for its 100-year history of E. angustifo lia harvest because it was an area of continu ed comm ercial activ ity during th e study and because it is likely the area of greates t wild echin acea harves t during th e past cen tury. T he study area is in the S moky Hills physiographic province and contains large areas of mixed-grass prairie rangeland that provides habita t for E. angustifolia . Detailed infor mation on the study sites is given in Hurlburt (1999). Historical research While the history of Echinacea angu stifolia's medicinal use is well docum ented, less is known about its comm ercial history. We reviewed published literature and unpublished correspondence from ca. 1890 to 1920, the period of E. angustifolia's intro duction to th e medical profession and popularization. Th e historical literature has been previously summarized (Kindscher 1989; Foster 1991; Hobbs 1995; Fl annery obtained from the Kansas Histor ical Society and fro m the Ll oyd Library, Cincinnati, Ohio (Hurlburt 1999). 73 To obtain local history, we interviewed four older resi dents of Rooks Co unty who had been involved in the \"root\" trade since thei r youth (Mr. Kenton Lawson, Mrs. Sandy Lawson, Mr. Ivan Thrasher, and Mr. Thornton Sanders), and three others who were second- or third- genera tion h arvesters (M r. Pat Thras her, Mr. Pa t Thayer, and Mr. T. Houser). Pat Th rasher was the m ajor buyer of E. angustifo lia roots in Stockton, Kansas, duri ng the tim e of the study. Initial interviews were conducted in March 1996, and follow-up in terviews too k place in 1 997-1998 and 2002. Market information To obtain quantitative inf ormation on the m arket in E. angustifolia roots, we first searched the historical literature and unpublis hed correspondence m entioned above. Interviews with olde r harvesters p rovided furth er inform ation on root prices. Additionally, we obtained wholesale price quotes fro m the Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter, which lis ted prices of echinacea from 1910 into the 1940s. Contem porary inform ation on the price and quantity of echinacea roo ts on the m arket came from various literature sources (McGre gor 1968; Bare 1979; Brevoort 1998). Finally, during the course of our collabo ration with buyer Pat Thrashe r of Stockton, Kansas, we observed and discussed with him the variable m arket cycl es experienced in the bu siness. He su mmarized the prices and quantities of root sold fro m 1986 to 2002. Harvest methods We learned about harvest m ethods through semi-structured interv iews with twenty harvesters, Duri ng interviews we inqui red about harvesters' method of di gging, m otivation, and views on th e abundance, life history, and resilience of E. angustifo lia. To efficiently obtain qu alitative in form ation, we began by interviewing 74knowledgeable individuals who were easily id entifiable following the techniques of Patton (1990). In our case we were interested in the sp ecialized topic of root digging and specifically, dealers who advertised that they were buying ro ots. The harvesters with who m we co nsulted constitute a snowball sample, as outlined by Robson (1993), and generated a pool of respondents through referrals from the root buyer, other harves ters, landowners, and fortuitous m eetings. It was difficult to survey h arvesters sy stem atically because m any of them , responding to the fluctuating m arket for E. angustifolia roots, m oved or changed occupations during the period of study. We particip ated in echin acea roo t harves t on four occasions ; two of these were commercial harvests. We used these occasions an d others when we cam e upon diggers working, to confirm methods described by diggers. RESULTS History of the echinacea market in Rooks County, Kansas Liter ature from the perio d of Echinacea angustifolia's introduction and popularization shows that n orth-central Kansas quickly becam e an im portant area of sup ply. The earliest published reference to Echinacea digging in the area is from the diary of Elam Bartholom ew, a settler, bo tanist, and m ycologist. In 1894 he re cords digging 45 kg (100 lbs) of \"Echinacea roo ts for shipm ent to Lloyd Bros. wholesale druggists, Cincinnati, Ohio,, for which he received $25.00 (Bartholom ew 1998). University of Kansas Professor L. E. Sayre (1897) called E. ang ustifo lia \"the m ost noteworthy plant growing abundantly in the state and of m edicinal quality\" and noted that echinacea \"is on ly gathered in comm ercial q uantities f rom the north western part of the state\" (Sayre 1903). 75 Interviews with older-gener ation and second- or third-ge neration harvesters and buyers confirm that E. angustifo lia harvest was established in Rooks County by 1900. One early buyer of medicinal roots, furs, wool and horses, Fred Lawson, set up shop in Stockton in 1895 or 1896 (K. Lawson, interview); his son's \"Snake root W anted\" poster (ca. 1968) appears in Figure 1. The family's history in the trade was confirm ed by ot her diggers. Am ong them is Thornton Sanders, who began digging E. an gustifo lia root with his father in about 1927 at age 10. Writings from the period suggest that quali ty, abundance, and econom ic considerations were im portant in the es tablishm ent of comm ercial harvest in the Sm oky Hills. Felter (1898) stated in the Eclectic Medical Journal that \"the best quality of root com es from the prairie lands of Kansas and Nebraska.\" Sayre (1903 ), referring to the Sm oky Hills extens ion area of soft lim estone, stated that echinacea was h arvested in comm ercial q uantities from this part of the s tate because \"the root thriv es better in the rocky soil of that district.\" Finally, responses to the Lloyd Brothers' 1903 inquiries seeking supp liers em phasize that profitability and the cost of la bor determ ined who would harves t roots. Several correspondents stated that th e price offered was insufficient fo r a person to m ake a li ving by collectin g echinacea in the rocky areas o r thin stands of the Kansas Flint Hills, sou theast Kansa s, southwest Kansas and Oklahom 1903; Co Sharp 1903). For exam ple: \"The plant in this locality grows only on rocky land and stone ledges and the process of digging is very laborious, and the tim e required is out of al l proportion to what you can pay\" (Roberts [1903], writing fro m Manhattan, northeas t Kansas). Affirm ative responses to the Lloyd Brothers' inquiries cam e from Elk City, sout heastern Kansas (Blank 1903), W ebster and Burr Oak, Kansas, in the Sm oky Hills (Oliver 1902; Kirk 1903), an d Whitewater, Kansas, in the southern Kansas Flint Hills (Luddington 1903). Intere stingly, these three areas have continued to 76experience echinacea harvest up to th e presen t (E. angustifo lia in the Sm oky Hills and s outhern Flint Hills, a nd E. pallid a in southeast Kansas). History of market quantities and price E. angustifo lia has experienced periods of both intense and w eak dem and. A chronology of market and price inform ation from all av ailable sources is listed in Tab le 1 and is illustra ted in Figure 2 . Unfortunate ly, short- term changes in m arket demand are cap tured during on ly a few years f or which data are available on a m onthly ba sis. The pr ice paid to diggers is a su bstitu te index for scarcity of supply, in absence of da ta on quantities dem anded b y the m arket (Fuller 1991). However, supply depends on av ailability of wild plant stoc k, availability of diggers' labor, and amount previously stockpiled. Changing market con ditions The correspondence between Elam Barthol omew and the Lloyd Brothers Pharm acists reveals changing m arket conditions even during the beginning of trade. T he earliest price of $0.55/kg ($0.25/lb) of dry root in 1894 was re duced to $0.275/kg ($0. 125/lb) by 1901 as m ore suppliers entered the tr ade and the Lloyd Brothers obtained large contracts (C. G. Lloyd 1897, 1901). Nevertheless, in years of p eak dem and, prices returned to , or surpassed, their earlier levels. For exam ple, in June 1897 when the Lloy d Brothers ran out of echi nacea, p rices rose to $0.55/kg but began fallin g in November of th at year (C. G. Lloyd 1897; Sayre 1897). In 1903, the m arket for echinacea appears to have experienced a very large dem and. The Lloyd Brothers not only contacted Bartholom ew but also sought new suppliers throughout the Great Plains and Midwest stat es (Hurlburt 1999). In this y ear, the price rose to $0.55/kg ($0.25/lb). Sayre (1903) reporte d that echinacea \"in one year has brought to the state over 77$100,000, as over 200,000 pounds have been collected , and it has brought at tim es as much as fifty cents per pound.\" In 1910, ech inacea was well established as a dru g commodity and was reported as \"scarce\" in the New York wholesale m arket, \"w ith quotations at 65-70 cents\" ($1.43- $1.54/kg). Subsequent reports listed the price in slow d ecline, so that by 1914 it was bringing only $0.48- 0.53/kg ($0. 22-0.24/lb). Another period of price in creases January 1921 with a peak ($0.75- 0.80/lb). W holesal e prices then declin ed, reaching a low of $0.33-0.35/kg ($0.15-0.16/lb) in 1933 ( Oil, Paint and Drug Reporter 1910-1941). Nevertheless, the prices paid to diggers dur ing the Depression era, 3-4 cents per pound of \"wet,\" fresh root (equivalent to $0.20-0.26 per kg dr y root or $0.09-0.12/lb), m eant that \"snakeroot digging paid bette r than a Governm ent job\" (T. Sanders, in terview). From this low point, the price of ech inacea ro ot appears to h ave stead ily increas ed (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the underlying m arket m ay have been m ore com plex. For exam ple, the species preferred for harvest ( E. angustifo lia or E. pallida ) changed h istorically, as did the part of the plant used (root, aerial parts, or whole plant) a nd m ethod of s hipment (fresh or dry; K. Lawson, interview). Further, cycles in the m arket that occurred during 1996-98 probably occurred in other years as well. In recent years, the p rice of echinacea root paid to Kansas diggers has tended to cycle (P. Thrasher, interview). Dur ing this stud y, the m arket as experien ced by di ggers had two peaks and three \"crashes\" when the local buyer was not pu rchasing roots. In winter-spring 1995-1996, the price of dried root reached $46-48/kg ($21-$22/lb). In sum mer 1996, with excess root on the market, the price plummeted, and no root was bo ught for several m onths. In spring 1997, activity resum ed at $26/kg ($12/lb). The winter of 1997-1998 again saw the price increase up to $44- 7846/kg ($20-21/lb), but in May 1998 it began falling again. By Septem ber the price had declined to $26/kg ($12/lb) or lower, and there was no root -buying activity for over 2 weeks. The m arket for echinacea root was w eak throughout 1999-2001 (Blum enthal 2000, 2001a; Nutrition Business Journal 2001), but digging resum ed in 2002 at a pr ice of $26/kg ($12/lb); Pat Thrasher, interview). During periods of little dem and, di ggers f ind oth er work; m ost do not r eturn to digging until the price is favorable again. Social aspects of \"snakeroot digging\" Since the 18 90s, echinacea, or \"sn akeroot,\" digging has been one of a few natural commoditie s that could provide c ash incom e to ru ral residents of the Great Pla ins. Digging was a family enter prise; father-son digging team s and multigene rational f amily outings to dig root were common (Bartholom ew 1999; Hurlburt 1999). Sim ilar family enterprises characteristic to the digging business have been recorded in Montana (Kolster 1998) a nd W est Virginia (ginseng root digging, as discussed by Bailey [1999]). A variety of people still dig snakeroot, incl uding those with f ull-tim e jobs (Kolster 1998) and college degrees; however, di ggers are often self-em ployed or not fully em ployed and m ay be econom ically m arginalized (Fuller ported that youth, underem ployed people, agricultural workers in the off-season, and people who want to set their own working conditions are attracted to digging. Landowners' views of echinacea root diggers ap pear to be more negative now than in the past. The harvesters we interviewed com plained about being viewed as people who did not have \"steady\" jobs and said that e fforts to restrict digging am ounte d to \"trying to take away our buffalo.\" Those who participate in digging as a resu lt of family tradition s aid tha t they seek out known digging areas and always obtain the owner' s perm ission to work there. However, 79newco mers to the trade who were trespassing to dig were said to be \"ruining it for people who've been doing it for years and years\" (P. Thrasher, q uoted in the Lyons Daily News [1996 ]). older harves ter comm ented that \"peo ple's attitud e has changed\"; while it used to be th at \"peop le would help each other o ut and I nev er had any problem s with anyone I asked going o n their land,\" now people \"don't want digg ers around\" (T. Sanders, interview). Kansas landowners have reacted negatively to increased digging pre ssure during tim es of peak dem and. Their complaints include trespass di gging, gates being left open, trash left in the pastures, holes left uncovered, and the threat of fire when veh icles are d riven over th e dry grass in search of echinacea plants. Sim ilar concerns have been expressed in harvested areas in Montana and North Dakota (Crawford 1998; Kolster 1998). As a result of these problem s, many landowners in Kansas no longer allow harvest on their properties a nd prosecute trespassing diggers. Of seven landowners we contacted during the study , three h ad allowed a r elative to dig on their property, one allowed a nonrelative to dig, and three di d not allow harvest. L andowners who perm it digging generally restrict this to one person or group of people, who then keep others out (Hurlburt 1999). W hile we did not estim ate the frequency of trespass digging, another study recorded that three of four la rge ranch m anagers who had encount ered diggers reported trespass digging (Loring et al. 1999a). Harvest methods and economics o f digging Harvesters u niform ly expressed con cern abou t getting a goo d return for their efforts when digging \"snakeroot.\" The im portance of ha rvesters' econom ic motivation to obtain a good return o r hourly wage from their efforts has se veral im plications. First, sp eed of work is important and is expressed in term s of quantit y of root dug per hour or per day. The usual harvesting rate was said to be 0.9-1. 35 kg per ho ur, or up to 2.25 kg per hour in a good stand (2- 803 lbs up to 5 lbs/hr). Four factors determ ine the hourly yield: tim e spent searching, distance trave led, time spent ex tracting the roo t, and weig ht of the root (influenced by its diam eter and length). The depth to which a root can be dug is limited by rocky soil and th e depth of a swing of the pick. Mo st harvesters prefer to d ig large r oots, and som e seek out very large roots, which they ca ll \"carrots. \" However, th is may com e at a cost in the form of increased search tim e. A second implication of the harvesters' econom ic motivation is that the desired pace of work inf luences the qu alities of stands in wh ich a harves ter will cons ider digging. In dividua ls' preferences and styles of work are varied in their choice of wh ere to d ig. For exam ple, m any diggers prefer to work in rocky areas with little vegeta tion where E. angustifo lia is easie r to f ind and dig. However, som e prefer the \"sod root,\" w hich is said to be larger and heavier than \"rock root\" as a result of better soil in g rassy areas. Size of the stand is al so a co nsideration. One harvester was said to be good at finding and digging little patches, while others prefer to obtain perm ission on a large ranch where they can work for m any weeks or m onths. Harvesters have repeatedly st ated that \"you can't get all th e root.\" This statem ent has two m eanings: first, the entire root of any one plant is not harvested, and second, it is not possible to harvest all the plants in a population. It is not profitable to search out every plant or to spend tim e digging the entire root of any single plant. As the density of rem aining plants decreases in a stand being harv ested, search tim e increases and econom ic returns dim inish. At one site, we estim ated th at E. angustifolia harvest density represented between 6.4% and 36% of the m ature plants in a population (Hurlburt 1999). All the harvesters we encount ered during this study used a pi ck m attock as a digging tool. The pick has been the tool of choice historica lly, as reco rded by Sayre (19 03). The harvesters interviewed believe that it is a quicker m ethod of digging and has less im pact on the grassland 81than either a shovel or the special ized digging tool in use in the No rthern Plains, a m etal bar with a thin, sharpened blade (Kolster 1998). Resilience o f Echinacea angustifolia plants Harvesters' opinions on the abundan ce and resilience of E. angustifo lia are varied. Most currently active diggers were op timistic about th e resilience of E. angustifolia and illustrated their point b y referring to trad itional, longtim e digging areas. We visited s everal of these areas, including a pasture that had b een known as a digging area since the 1930s. In 1999 we observed thousands of plants at a ranch that was heavil y harvested in 1996. The uplands surrounding the Saline Rive r were m entioned as an a rea th at was trad itionally harvested a nd \"still ha s lots of root,\" but it has been closed to diggi ng (Hurlburt 1999; P. Thrasher, interview). The need to allow populations to recover af ter harvest was noted by several diggers. A 2- or 3-year rotation was commonly mentioned a s a practica l harvest in terval. Harveste rs all claim ed that plants whos e roots hav e been harve sted will respr out and can be harves ted again in 2-3 years. Older harvesters expresse d a different opinion, recalli ng their fathers' friendly competition s, with daily harvests ex ceeding 45 k g (100 lbs; K. Lawson, interview; T . Sanders, interview). This is double the am ount that coul d currently be harvested (at 2.25 kg/hr) in a 10- hour day in a good stand. In traditional digging ar eas as well as in stands close to Stockton, plants were said to be fewer and sm aller th an in the past (Hurlburt 1999). Though these m en thought th at over-harvesting had caused the declin es, they reco gnized oth er causes of echinacea population declines, such as sprayi ng the pastures with herbicides. 82Partic ipatio n in harvest Participation in comm ercial harvest conf irmed the methods described by diggers and many of their observations. In contrast to th e team approach used by Mo ntana harves ters (Kolster 1998), the diggers in this study work ed individually. They sw ing their pick once or twice to cut or loosen the root below ground, pull it up by its top, clip or pull off the aerial portions, and toss the root into a bag tied at the hip (Fig. 3). Th is method enables the digger to move quickly fro m plant to plant. The diggers did not appear to either select or avoid flowering plants; instead, they looked for plants with m ultiple s hoots or larg e rosettes of green and dead leaves. Sm aller rosettes were skipped over, as were plants that would have be en difficult to dig, such as those growing in dense sod or next to the sharply pointed leaves of Yucca glauca plants. Many harvested roots appeared to have re-g rown following ea diam portions attached abrup tly to a larger diam eter lower portion. Shoots emerging fro m last year's pick holes were furt her eviden ce of regrowth . These observations of regrowth were confirm ed separately at another site by tagging holes wher e plants had been dug (Hurlburt 1999). At that site, 5 of 14 roots had re-sprouted w ithin 2 years of digging. Our observations thus support the harv esters' a ssertions that h arvest is incom plete and that som e plants g row back after h arvest. DISCUSSI ON Economics of digging, harvest intensity, and recovery E. angustifo lia harvesting in Kansas m eets thr ee of Godoy an d Bawa's (1993) four criteria that encourage \"judicious us e\" of wild -harvested reso urces: secu re property rights, population d ensity, and s imple harvesting techno logy. A fourth criterion, tr aditional rule of use, 83is not m et. Lacking traditional rules that would govern Echin acea harvest practices, econom ic criteria influ ence the sev erity of harv est. For E. angustifo lia, these econo mic factors are th e price p er kg (or lb ) of echinacea r oot relative to availab le wag es, the effort required to dig the roots, and accessibility of land where the plants grow. The economics of digging m ay explain why Echinacea angus tifolia harvesting became estab lished in the Sm oky Hills but no t in som e other par ts of the species' r ange. The c ost of labor in Kansas in 1903 was $1.50 to $3.00 per day (K irk 1903). A t $0.33 per dry kg ($ 0.15/lb) and assum ing that roots dry down to one-third of thei r fresh weight, a person would have to dig about 13.5-27 kg (30-60 lbs) per day to earn the going wage . While this was probably possible in a dense, unex ploited echinacea population in the Sm oky Hills, it would no t have been possible in sparse populations or in areas where digging was difficult. The daily harvests of 45 kg (100 lbs) claim ed by the older generation likely represent a maximum, not an average. It would have been difficult f or an inexpe rienced harve ster to d ig this much. In today's m arket, a person w ho digs 1.5 kg fresh root per hour (equivalent to about 0.5 kg dry) can earn m ore by digging root only when the price per kg of dry root is more than twice the going hourly wage. This assum es that jobs are available and travel cos ts do not ex ceed those of going to a wage-earning job. In contrast, Kolster (1998) reported that high unem ployment on the Ft. Peck Indian Reservation in northeas t Montana led to harvesting even when root prices were lower. The m ethod of digging wild Echinacea angustifolia roots in K ansas norm ally leads to a low intens ity of harvest. Plants a re selectively harvested based on apparent size and accessibility, leaving m any plants and parts of populations untouched in the variable terrain of the Sm oky Hills. Harve sters d igging echinac ea m tim e costs. This str ategy is sim ilar to tha t 84noted by Runk (1998) for collection of vegetable ivory, tagua ( Phytelephas aequatorialis ) seeds. As a result, diggers s eek out areas th at have not been harvested recen tly and that hav e an abundance o f large and easily accessible ech inacea plants. Access to Echinacea an gustifo lia, like other wild-harvested resources, affects the intens ity an d sustain ability of its h arvest. Resources characterized by op en access to all harvesters tend to be exp loited to m aximize im mediate return s, while resources where access is controlled by a single owner are harvested to maximize long-term yields, a m ore sustainable strategy (Milner-Guland and Mace 1 998). E. angustifo lia may fall toward eithe r end o f the spectrum . Populations along roadsides and in pub lic areas are easily acce ssible and have proven problem atic to protect fro m harvest in Missour i, Oklahom a, and Montana (Lantz 1997; Kolster 1998; Traeger 1998). However, in Kansas, m ost E. angustifo lia grows on private land, and trespass law s are enforced. Conservation is carr ied out in effect by landowners who restrict harvest to one individual or do not allow it at all. For exam ple, when high dem and led to increased harvesting in early 1996, so me Kansas landowners closed thei r properties to digging and prosecuted trespassers. Thes e actions create refuges for E. angustifolia and m ay prove to be an effective conservation m easure for the species. In contrast, local populati ons that are left open to harvest (such as those on Indian R eservations or federal lands in Montana) m ay be extirpated under persistent high dem and (Kolster 1998). This interplay of m arket price and cy cles, harves ters' effort, and access to the resou rce determ ines the sever ity of harvest on Echinacea a ngustifo lia populations. The large fluctuations in dem and that we observed during this study have occurred since the beginning of the species' commercial history (Table 1). These m arketing cy cles hav e been repo rted for other medicin al plants (Fuller 1991). The periods of reduced ha rvesting pressure corresponding to m arket 85downturns provide recovery tim e for harvested po pulations. However, high prices could lead to overexploitation and local extirpa tion of populations if high dem and is sustained for m onths or years. Moreover, harvest const itutes just one sou rce of enviro nmental var iability af fecting E. angustifo lia populations. The co-occurrence of all thes e factors m akes it difficult to assess the long-term effects of harvest on E. an gustifo lia over its range. Harves ting a population to very low density m ay leave it vulnerable; for exam ple, harvest followed by a \"bad\" year co uld lead to further declines. In this case, wild populations are unlikely to have sufficient recovery time without other conservation m easur es. The plant's longevity, drought tolerance, and ability to resprou t after harves t provide som e buffer against this s tochas ticity. Resilience a nd resprouting The resilien ce of Echinacea has been noted by other observers (Little 1998). Despite being recorded as a species that decreases unde r grazing pressure by W eaver and Hansen (1941) and intolerant of grazing in the Kansas Flint H ills (Eddy 1990; Loring et al. 1999b), E. angustifo lia plants p ersist in th e less intensiv ely g razed pastures of the Sm oky Hills area of this study. Rangewide, E. angustifo lia occurs not only in native prairies but also in slightly disturbed, rocky areas such as graded roadsides, em bankments, pipeline trenching areas, and abandoned limestone quarry areas. However, it does not r ecolonize agricultu ral la nd or old fields. Echinacea species are noted for drought tolerance (W ge 1994). Regrowth of harvested E. angustifolia plants, as we observed dur ing this study, was also docum ented by Kolster (1998) in Montana. This as pect of resilience sugg ests that occasional harvest (once every 3 o r more year s) will not elim inate lia continues to be locally common in centr al Kans as but still faces th reats to its abundance and persistence. Lo ss of m ixed-grass prairi e habitat is less than that of tallgrass prairie but has been estim ated fro m 30% to 77% across the Great Plains states (Sam son and Knopf 1994 ). Of the rem aining native m ixed-grass prairie, habitat altera tion has occurred under a manage ment system that focuses solely on produc tion of grass and cattle. Fire is not norm ally used as a m anagem ent tool in Sm oky Hills pa stures, and encroachm ent of woody vegetation or \"brush\" in to the gras sland is apparent (Loring et al. 1999a). Landowners in the area are increasing their use of h erbicides to com bat brush and the noxious weed, musk thistle ( Carduus nutans ). that E. angustifolia has disappeared from sprayed pastures. Finally, ob servers h ave noted that when pastures are grazed more heavily in the sp ring, flowering stalks of E. angustifo lia are m ore often dam aged and seed production is lower com pared to E. angustifo lia in pastu res that were no t grazed un til mid- or late summer (Hurlburt 1999 ). These impacts, when com bined with harvesting pr essure, m ay threaten the species' long -term persis tence. Restoration and management: To m aintain via ble wild pop ulations of echinace a, conservation m easures are needed in addi tion to the harvesting m ethods employed by experienced diggers. Restoration and m anage ment of mixed-grass prairie is needed to counter the loss and alteration of E. angustifo lia habitat. R eturning distur bed land to prairie, and improving the quality of degraded prairie, can ex pand availab le habitat for wild Echinacea populations. Methods of brush and thistle contro l that do not involve widespread herbicide applic ation, such as se lective spray ing and effective b iocontrol for m usk thistle, are n eeded. Program s to assis t in re-v egetating degraded ar eas and Conservation Rese rve Program lands with 87E. angustifo lia and other native forbs (in addition to grasses) would be beneficial. Landowners could be m ade aware th at they can in creas e E. angustifo lia on their lands by deferring grazing until m idsummer in the pastures where it is p resent. In the S moky Hills, where rangelands are almost entirely privately owned, this will ha ppen only with th e support of landowners. Som e public lands in the area also have E. angustifo lia populations that need stewardship. Degraded areas su ch as public road rights -of-way also co uld be res eeded to Echin acea and other native plants. Cultivation : One commonly advocated so lution for the threats to echin acea populations is to replace wild harvest w ith cultivation as a sou rce of echin acea roo t supply (Foster 1991; Hobbs 1994; Crawford 1998). W hen a wild resource becom es scarce relative to its dem and, cultivation b ecom es a logical step. T he shift to p rimarily cultivated sources has alread y occurred for ginseng (Robbins 1998), which has been cul tivated since the early 1900s, and goldenseal (McGuffin 1999). The dem and for echinacea roots is increas ingly being s upplied fro pers. com.). Cultiva tion of echinacea , however, like any ne w crop tha t has a lim ited market, is a ris ky endeavor (Oliver 1997; Redhage 1997; Byczynski 1998; Coltrain 1999). It takes at least 3 years to produce a crop with m arketable sized root s (Foster 1991). The cu rrent downturn in the medicinal herb business m eans m any growers ha ve lost m oney and even plowed up m edicinal crops or gone out of business ( Nutrition Business Journal 2001). Nevertheless, E. angu stifolia is being cultivated in Kansas and elsewhere both by small-scale and larg e-scale growers interested in producing a high-value crop. The future of w ild harvest: We do not expect cultivated Echinacea an gustifo lia to replace wild harvest entirely. W ild harvest appe ars to be driven by rapid increases in dem and 88(associated with higher pr ices) that would be impo ssible to m eet quickly enough with cultivation. There is a sp ecific m arket dem and for wild-harv ested ech inacea, particularly from small local companies and the Euro pean m arket (P. Thrasher, interview). Finally, we believ e that there are importan t reasons why wild ha rvest should continue. Family and cultu ral ties trad itionally, and in the f uture, will e ncourage pe ople in a reas with la rge populations of echinacea to continue to harvest. T his local harvest provides an economic benefit, cash incom e that can serve as an im portan t pers onal resource for people who are not involved in full-tim e, year-round jobs. Most diggers who we ha ve m et enjoy work that allows them to be outdoors in the native prairie landscape, pres erving the connection between people and land. Concern for the echinacea on their land is driving som e landowners to be more careful stewards of biodiversity. In this study we met landowners who were controlling brush m anually or with spot spraying of herbicides rather than aeria l application. W e have observed that long-term diggers have a strong conservation ethic and appreciation for the nati ve prairie. This is one of two activ ities (hunting b eing the o ther) that en courages local people to be out on foot in the rural prairie landscape observing and valuing biodiversity. Conclusion Echinacea angustifo lia harvest in north-central Kansas has a 100-year history that is well docum ented and represents one of the longest peri ods of sustained use recorded for a m ajor wild harvested sp ecies in the United States. Interv iews with harves ters and observations of commercial harvest and harvested po pulations su ggest th at ex perien ced diggers use p ractices th at contribute to sustainability of harv est: rota ting ha rvest a reas, selec tive h arvesting of low-density plants, and returning to known areas to dig. La ndowners also aid in the conservation of this species by restricting digging on their land. E. angustifo lia is som ewhat resilien t to grazing and 89disturbance, and som e plants resprout within 2 years after harvest. Neve rtheless, in the highly variab le env ironm ent of the Great Plains, a large and increasing commercial dem and sustained over years is likely to ex ceed the ability of E. angustifo lia populations to recover from harvest. This is especially true when drought years oc cur at the sam e time that commercial dem and is high. Cultiv ation of E. angustifo lia is under way and can potentially ease the pressure on wild stands. Other conservation m easures such as habitat restoration and reintroduction of Echinacea into dis turbed lands are also neces sary to preserv e the species in face of its dim inishin g and altered habitat. In addition, further educati on of landowners, reserv e agency personnel, and diggers about Echinacea harvesting and conservation woul d be useful. If restoration, stewardsh ip, and respons ible harves t techniqu es are practiced, the valu ral trad lia market developmen t and price history Year Market and Price Info rmation and Reference 1885 Meyer sends \"blood purifier\" Lloyd B Pharm acists (King 1887; J.

Introductio n The popularity of m edicinal plan ts has increa sed over the p ast decade, m ost lik ely as a result of sharp increases in prices of prescr iption drugs, restrictive access to physician s, media reports of adverse effects of prescription drugs , and as a result of the 1994 Dietary Supplem ent and Health Education A ct (DSHEA; 2002). DSHEA broadly defined medi cinal plants and created confusion about standards and m echanism s under wh ich claim s about effectiveness and safety are evaluated and enforced. The Food and Drug Ad ministration has been given the m andate to regulate dietary supplem ents for quality assurance an d good m anufacturing p ractices (US Code, 63 Fed. Reg. 23624). W ith the im plem entation of regulations to insure quality control of product m anufacture of phyto medicinals (21 C SR 201.128, Food and Dr ug Cosm etic Act), species certification is likely to be required of all bot anical raw m aterials . Even if not required by the FDA, such certification increases co nsum er confidence a nd provides com petitive m arket advan tage for producers of the certified product. As one of the m ost popular m edicinal plan ts, ech inacea has b een widely used and regard ed as safe. Yet current efforts at inve stigation have left m any health care providers perplexed about when or even if to recomm end i t. To effectively guide f uture investigators and to make use of the prom ising potential of echin acea as a therapeutic tool, it is im perative to understand the history of us e and research to date. By understanding the h istory of ech inacea investigatio n and curr ent clinica l trials, pitf alls can be identif ied and chan ges m ade in approaches. Echinacea m ay then serve as a model for study of other m edicinal plan ts. 103Evidence fr om Researc h for Safety and Efficac y A. Background Echinacea is indigenous to m id-North Am erica, and it has a history of medicin al use in treating colds, infections, bee and insect stings, snakebite, headache and wounds that long predates European contact. Ethnobotanical uses o f echinacea by Native Am ericans, early travelers, traders, settlers, and doctors reveal a history of use as a blood purifier, wound healer, described immuno- modulatory effects and are known to be relatively safe for hu man use (Kindscher, 1989; of echinacea fr equently incorporated m ore than one species, and apparently species und er use were o ften m isnamed. A review of this ear ly liter ature led to the co nclusion that ch emical analy ses were m ost lik ely co mpleted on Echin acea angustifolia, while biological activity E. purpur ea (Schum acher and Friedberg, 1991). Currently, th ere is strong evidence fo r ech inacea's action as a stim ulant of innate immunity ( et al., 1991; DerMarderosian, 1996; Burger et al., 1997; Bauer, 1998) as well as cellula r immunity (Rehm an et al., 1999). In recent years, echin acea preparations h ave developed into one of the elling medicinal plants (Brevoor t, 1998; Klepser, 1999; LaPum a, 2000). Most of the recen t research on the echinacea has been conducted in Germ any where there is greater scientific interest in m edicinal plants (F oster, 1991; Foster and T yler, 1999). Subsequently, the Germans have published addi tional research, even on plants found only in North Am erica. Currently, m ore that 800 products containing E. purpurea and to a less er extent E. angustifo lia are m arketed in Germ any alone (Bauer , 1998). Research has been conducted 104prim arily on E. purpurea , but also on the sim ilar and closely related E. pallida and E. angustifo lia. The delive ry forms used in tr ials in clude ointments and solutions for external use, extracts for oral use, and am pules for intravenous and intraperitoneal injection. It is regarded as effective in treating certain viral and bacterial infections as well as wounds and inflamm ation, while stim ulating the im mune syste m. In 1989, the Germ an Co mmission E published the official Germ an m onog raph on the use of the fresh juice of the aboveground E. purpurea tops (Blum enthal, 1998). Its use is allowed for stimulating the regenerative processes, restori ng dam aged tissue, activating phagocytosis, and for the ind irect anti-inf ectiv e influence resulting fro m the effect of the herb on the hyaluronidase/ hyaluron ic acid system (Foster, 1991 ; Blum enthal, 1998). Echinacea p reparations hav e been found to be safe, but controversy exists for eff ectiveness in the treatm ent of upper respiratory tract infectio ns ,and it is rela tively ineffective when used on a preventativ e basis. B. Medicin al Uses 1. Safety Overall, the long histo ry of safe use of echinacea by North Am erican indigenous grou ps, its widespread use as a phytom edicine in Europe, its use as a food, tea, and dietary supplem ent additive, an d recen t scientific data in dicate th at echinacea is relatively no n-toxic. Som e individuals m ay experience rare im mediate allerg ic reactions of varyi ng degrees of severity, particularly with parenteral use of the substanc e, which is not uncommon for plant species in the Asteraceae. The Germ an Commission E m onograph on E. purpurea aboveground parts state that no side effects are known when juice of the abovegr ound portion is adm inistered orally or locally (Blum enthal, 1998). W hen and miting m ay occur. In some medical ed itorial reports, an increas e in temperature associated w ith parenteral adm inistration is cited without reference to echinacea species, plant part used, product form used, route of ad ministration, or pr imary source literature cited. Multip le studies have b een conducted in the m urine m odel to assess acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, and genotoxicity of E. purpurea expressed juice adm inistered as oral or intravenous doses. Long-term oral ad ministration in doses many tim es above the human therap eutic dose in rats showed no evidence of toxic effects (Mengs et al., 1991). Negative results were achieved for m utagenicity with m icroorganism s and m ammalian cells in vitro and als (Coeugniet m alignant transfor mation of ha mster em bryo cells was not observed in an in vitro carcinogenicity test with E. purpurea expressed ju ice. It can be concluded that the acute and subacute tox icity stud ies car ried out in rodents together with genotoxicity tests in vitro and in vivo do not reveal any eviden ce of to xic effects from E. purpu rea even when adm inistered at excessiv e dose levels or concentratio ns. The risks and benefits of the express ed juice of E. purpurea for long-term immunostimulant therapy were assessed base d on an exhaustive review of published toxicological, pharm acological , and clinical studies (Par dosing forms includ ed intraveno us and intraperitoneal ampules, oral lozenges, and topical application forms. Only those stud ies were rev iewed in wh ich the treatm ent protocol and num ber of patients were clearly defined and in which safety assessm ent could clearly be m ade in relation to the dose, route of ad ministration, and indication. It was concluded that the low rate and m inor nature 106of reported adverse events further supported the good tolerability of E. purpurea expressed juice on long-term adm inistration. No co nclusi ons co uld be draw n regard ing efficacy. Thirteen adv erse ev ents related to oral ingestion of expressed juice of E. purpurea were reported to Germ an hea lth authorities (Parnham , 1996). Analysis of the related reports revealed that on ly four cases we re direc tly attributab le to e chinace a, all of which were a llergic s kin reactions. In 1996, a series of reports in the popular Germ an pr ess attributed several deaths due to anaphylaxis in patien ts taking ech inacea (Foste r, 1996). A n investigation by German federal health autho rities failed to estab lish d irect caus e between the d eaths and echinacea and reported that a num ber of other treatm ents were being co-adm inistered in each case. In a review of three earl y studies of parenteral (int ravenous) adm inistration for the treatm ent of children with whoopi ng cough, doses ranged from 1 to 2 m l of the aqueous extract injected twice daily for 3 to 21 days (Parnham , 1996). These three studi es involved 257 children from infants to children 14 years of age. No adverse events were observed. In one nine-m onth- old infant, an increase of tem perature fro m 40\u00b0C t o 40.6\u00b0C of 12 hours duration was observed. Slight reddening at the injection site (of 1- 2 days duration) was seen in a f ew cases. In over 500 child ren with tubercu losis, paren teral adm inistration of echin s igns of i imulation su ch as shivering, headach e, vom fever within 2-4 hours of injection (Parnham , 1996). The sym ptoms disappeared after 1-2 hours, along with a 40- 100% increase in blood leucocyte count. An addi tional report of near ly 300 children with whooping cough reported transient pain at the injec tion site and an increase in tem perature of 1- 2\u00b0C. The ris e in tem perature is attr ibuted to stim ulation of phagocytosis and associated production of cytokines and is a therapeutic goal of treatm ent. No othe r adverse events were observed. 107 A case of echinacea -asso ciated anaph ylaxis was reported (Mu llins, 199 8). Subsequently, an analysis of 15 random ly stored sam ples of serum from patients with atopy was undertaken, and 20% of the sam ples tested showed m oderate to strong reac tivity to echinacea challeng e (Mullins, 1998). A comm entary on the conclusi ons of the cas e report stated that in 19 98 Australian consum ers purchased an estim ated 200 million do ses (tablets and liquid ) of echinacea preparations (Myers and Wohl muth, 1998). The au thors noted that if the rate of echinacea- induced anaphylaxis sug gested was true, the wid espread use of echinacea in Australia over the previous decade should have cons ervatively resulted in at least 2000 cases of anaphylaxis. Over the sam e period, over 20, 000 cases might be expected throughout the world. This was not the case, and in fact relativ ely few reports of echinacea problem s were iden tified. Relating the association of echinacea to ana phylaxis in th e first case, the conclusion d rawn was there m ight have been an acute reaction to the high concentra tion of isobutylam ides in the original product. Five additio nal cas es of adverse reac tions to echinacea were reported (Mu llins and Heddle, 2002). Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third an acute asthm a attack after a first- ever dose of echinacea (species and product form not specified). A fourth patient had recurrent episodes of m ild asthm a each tim e echinacea was ingested. A fifth patient develop ed a rash two days after in gestion of echinacea. The authors concluded th at some atopic patien ts might have positiv e to echinac ea even wit hout being it, gesting a po env ironm ental induced allergens. They note that, given its widespread and largely unsupervis ed comm unity use, rare adverse even ts are inevitable. In an extensive search, 2 6 possible cases of echinacea allerg y were found. The denom inator - those at risk - is likely in the 100s of 1000s. Therefore, the resu lts are actually in favor of safety, 108as less than 1 consum er in 10,000 exposed was f ound to have a serious a dverse reaction (Barrett et al., 2002). Ondrizek et al. (1999) analyzed th e effects of popular herbs including \" Echinacea purpura \" [sic], St. John's wort, saw palm etto, and Ginkgo biloba on sperm DNA and the fertilization process. The prospective com parative study found that high concentration of echinacea reduced oocyte penetratio n. This resu lt is perhaps explained by anti-hyaluronidase action of E. purpurea since hyalu ronidase is E. High con centr ation s of E. purpurea caused a significant denaturing of hu man sperm DNA in an acridine orange study, reducing sperm viability af ter 7 days' inc ubation a t 23\u00b0C. Of note, there is no m ention of the source of the plan t material, species tested, plant pa rt tested, whether it was a lipophilic or hydr ophylic extract, or whether any effort was m ade to authenticate the plant m aterial used. One unanswered question requiring further i nvestigation is in th e continuous daily administration of echinacea for periods longer than 2 weeks . Work in healthy individuals indica tes tha t a per iod of initial stim ulation (t ypically 1-7 days) is followed by a period (typically after about 11 days) when the imm une system no longer responds (Hobbs, 1989; Bauer and Wagner, 1991). Accordingly, echinacea is often prescribed in 10 day treatm ent periods followed by two weeks of no ad ministration. A recent s tudy evaluated the ability o f E. angustifolia root preparations to inhibit the action of cytochrom e P450 isozym e CYP3A4 in vitro. Suppression at high dilutions indicated the potential for significant drug- herb interactions, which m ay be a concern (Budzinski et al ., 2000). Further investigation should be dir ected to answering this q uestion. 109 There is co mparative ly little inf ormation av ailable from clinical tr ials o r publish ed reports about side effects and t oxicity of specific echin acea pr epara tions. Clinica l stud ies report side e ffects or into leran ce following oral use in ordinary doses (Lersch et al. , 1992). However, it can be concluded from the above reports th at ech inacea is relatively safe at recomm ended adm inistered doses. 2. Reported Immunomodulatory Effects The m ajority of the m ore than 350 studi es on th e pharm acology of echinacea to concern its immunosti mulant ac tivity (Hobbs, 1989). Pharmacologi cal investigations over the past twenty-five years have shown immunostim ulatory activities for cichoric acid, alkam ides, and polysaccharides extracts of th e roots and aboveground parts of E. purpurea (Bauer, 1998). Of these compounds, highly active polysacch aride m olecules in E. purpurea were reported ulating properties (W Proksch, 1985a; 1985b). arides stim T-cell activity 20-to y poten t T-ce ll stimulato r. Immunological defense involves a complicated set of responses, but the overall objective is an increase in phagocytosis by m acrophages an d granulocytes that m igrate freely fro m blood vessels into tissues during infl amm ation (Awang and Kindack, 1991). An early study using an E. purpurea product containing the juice of the fresh aerial parts of E. purpurea was found to m ake mouse cells 50-80% m ore resistant to influenza, herpes, and vesicu lar stomatitis viru ses when the m ammalian cells were pretreated 4-6 hours before exposure (Wacker and Hilbig, 1978). The resi stance lasted 24-48 hours. The antiviral active ingredient could not be isolated and was believed to be relate d to several of the chemical fractions tha t were sep arated. 110 A hydrophilic, highly purified polysaccharide from E. purpurea was found effective in activating m acrophages to cytotoxicity ag ainst tumor cells an d enrie ttii (Luettig, 1989). This polysaccharide induced or necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interf eron-beta-2. Arabinogalactan did not activate B cells and did not induce T cells to produce interleukin-2, interfer on-beta-2, or interferon- gamma, but it did induce a slight increase in T -cell prol iferation. W hen injected intraperitoneally, m acrophages were stimulated, a finding that m ay have therapeutic im plications in the def ense agains t tumors and infectious (Luettig, 1989). System atic fractionation and subsequent pharm acological testing of aerial parts of echinacea d emonstrate ev idence for s timulation of non-specific immunity to include natural killer cells and monocytes (Sun et al. , 1999). Again, the aqueous acea species stim ulate phagocytosis, th e production of oxygen radicals, increases in natural kille r cells, and production of the inflamma tory cytokines in varying degrees (Tubaro et ; et al., 1996; Burger et al., 1997; B auer, 1998). Caffeic acid derivatives, which include a variety of com pounds, have been shown to stim ulate phagocytosis, inhibit hyaluronid ase, and protect collagen from free radical degradation in varying degrees depending on the compound (cichoric acid) and the source (Facino et al. , 1996; Bauer, 1998). Stim ulation of the immu ne system appears to be strongly influenced by dose level in the case of isolated polysaccharides from E. purpurea . Pharm acological studies indicate th at an oral 10 m g/kg daily dose of the polysaccharide give n over a ten-day period is effective as an immunostimulant. Increases in the daily dosag e beyond this value, however, resulted in 111\"markedly decreased ph armacological activity,\" indicating a need for pharm acokinetic studies Proksch, 1985; W agner et al., 1985b). Ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea demonstrated immuno modulating activity on m and bacte ricidal activ ities m ice (Bohlm an and Grenz, 1966; Bauer et al., 1988, 1989). The echinacoside component has low antibacterial and antiviral activity but does not have immunostimulatory activ ity (Beuscher et al., 1989, 1992). Cichoric acid hows phagocytosis ulation vivo but echinacoside, verbascoside, and 2-caffeoyltartaric acid do not (Bauer al., 1988). Cichoric acid also inhibi ts hyaluronidase (Soicke et al. , 1988) and protects collagen III fro m free radical induced dam age (Sicha et al., 1989). Purified alkam ide fractions fro m E. angustifo lia and E. purpurea roots enhanced phagocytosis in carbon-c learance tests. Th e main com ponent, dodecatetraenoic acid iso butylam ide only showed weak activ ity, however. A cell tissue cultu re was reported in which cultured supernatants of stim ulated whole blood cells derived from 23 tum or patients who were treated over a 4-week period orally with an extract from an herb preparation that included E. angustifo lia, Thuja orien talis, and Eupatorium perfoliatum . At baseline, a rather wide range of cytokines was found in the treatm ent and the control group. After therapy with the herbal m ixture, there w as no significant alteration in the production of the cytokines, and the leukocyte po pulations rem ained cons tant (Elsasser-Beile et al., 1996). It could be argued that th e active constituent m ay not have been presen t. Currier and Miller (2000) showed that an E. purpurea root ex tract increased natur al kille r (NK) cell production in aging m ice, paralleled by an increase in anti-tumor, lytic function capacity. Th ey state that the extract appeared to be the only a gent iden tified to date th at significantly increases N K cell production and numbers in spleen and bone m arrow of aging 112mice to levels present in young adulthood. A fo llow-up study dem onstrated there was NK cell augm entation potential of an E. purpurea root ex tract in vitro and in vivo (Currie r and Miller, 2001). After 9 days of treatm ent with m ale DBA/ 2 mice, a 2.5-fold increase in NK cells in spleens were observed. After thr ee ic mice com pared with controls. They concluded that the profoundly positiv e effects in d isease abatem ent suggest th e therapeu tic potential of E. purpurea , at least with respec t to le ukem ia, if not othe r tumors. E. purpurea and m elatonin (e ither alone or in com bination) we re inves tigated to determ ine effects on m yeloid cells in mouse spleen and bone m arrow (Cu rrier et al., 2001). Administered alone, E. purpurea did not affect the differentiati on of granular leukocytes from their precu rsor myeloid cells, bu t in c ombination with m elatonin, it hindered their differentiation into granular leucocytes fro m myeloid cells. This study highlights the importance of studying individual co mponents as well as mixtures of combination products. An in vivo study on m ale Sprague-Dawley rats ex amined the immunomodulato ry effect of isolated and alk ylamides from E. purpurea (Goel et al., 2002). At a dose of 12 m icrogram s/kg body weight/day, th e alkylam ide fraction significantly increased the phagocytic index and phagocytic activity of alveolar m acrophag es. Contrary to other studies on isolated co mpounds, they failed to show an immuno modulatory activity for polysaccharides or cicho ric acid. They co nclude th at the al kylam ides, used alone or in a com plete ech inacea extract, m ay be effective in upper respiratory tract infections. This is in co nflict with the m ajority of other studies. A double-blind, placebo -contro lled crossover stud y evaluated the effects of echinacea on the imm une system of he althy young m ales (Schwarz et al., 2002). The author stated that the 113study m edication was the freshly expressed juic e of echinacea, however the study m edication was delive red as an alco holic tinc ture, lik ely ch anged the ac tive constitue nts. No effort was made by investigator s to evaluate the study m edication for content or to determ ine what constituents were present in the sam ple. The study conclusion was that echinacea failed to produce any effect on innate imm unity in vivo in healthy subjects. The general conclusion d erived from the above studies is that no single echinacea constituent appears to responsib le for the imm unostimulant activ ity of expressed juice or of extracts, but evidence seem s to fa vor the polysaccharide fraction. Both the lipophilic constituents and the aqueous soluble constituents have dem onstra ted ac tivity in in vitr o immunostimulant tests, although in vivo investigation should be co nsidered the gold standard . In addition, there is no decisive infor mation favoring the use of one particular plant or plant part. The m ost supportable conclusion is that certain echinacea products m ay prom ote innate imm une activation in the form of transformation, production of interferon and s ecretion of certain lym phokines. This results in enhanced T-cell m itogenesis, macrophage phagocytosis, antibody binding, natural killer cell activity, a nd increased numbers of circulating polymorphonuclear cells. Evidence also exits for increased cellular im munity, but certainly m uch m ore work needs to be done. 3. Deficiency of Well-Designed Controlled Hu man Trials Opinion is d ivided as to whether ech inacea species are imm unostim ulant in hum ans and, if so, whether the active constituents are solv ent soluble, water solub le, or a com bination. It seem s probable that the confused state of the repo rted hum an trials results from a combination of a lack of identification o f plant m aterial us ed and the chem ical constituents present. Given this confusion, it is not possible at present to de vise suitable analytical m eans of standardizing 114echinacea preparations s o as to ensu re consis tent reported inf ormation from controlled clinical trials. One obstacle to the p erform ance of definitiv e studies on th e issue of efficacy of echinacea is the fact th at different m edicinal preparati ons o f echinacea have different com positions. Three different species of echin acea, each with a d ifferent phytochem ical com position, are used for medicinal purposes. In addition to the sele ction o f plant spec ies, the com position of the final product m ay be altered by the parts of the plan t used, the m ethod of extraction, and even the season in w hich the p lant is harves ted. As a res ult, variab ility in phyto chemical composition exists not only am ong different Echin acea prepa rations bu t also between lots of the sa me products. It has been suggested that different preparations of echin acea be standardized by measuring specific com ponents. However, gi ven the m any variables that influence the composition of the preparations, it may be difficult to reprodu ce the m aterial us ed in a particular study even when this infor mation is provided (T urner, 2002). Few well-designed controlled studies have been performed to dem onstrate the the rapeutic value of ech inacea p reparations. The studies that do exist po int to th e use of echinacea species in the m odulation of length and seve rity of acute upper respiratory infec tions (Bauer, 1998; Brinkeborn et al., 1999 ) and a positiv e effect in patien ts with chron ic fatigue or acquired immunodefi ciency syndro me (See et al. , 1997). It has been reported that echinacea is not effective as a preventative for upper respiratory tract infections in the cons umer but probably acts to shorten the duration of the inf ectio n once it is acquired (Melchart et al., 1998). The m ost consisten tly po sitive clinic al results inv olving ech inacea prepara tions a re tho se using freshly expressed juices, which are m ore likely to con tain the water soluble polysaccharide fraction (Bauer et al., 1988; Bauer 1998). An adjuvant study of the use of expressed juice of E. 115purpurea on recurrent vaginal Candida infections over six m onths showed a 5-16% recurrence rate with the expressed juice con trasted with treatm ent with econazol, which led to a 6 0% recurrence rate (Coeugniet and Kuehnast, 1986). A retrospective study with 1,280 children with acute b ronchitis d emonstra ted tha t treatm ent with the expr essed juice led to faster h ealing than in the cohort treated with an antibio tic (Baetgen, 1988). It is specul ated that viral infections m ay have partly accounted f or this difference. In healthy v olunteers, a commercial echinacea preparation w as adm inistered intram uscularly on 4 successive days to 12 m ales. Phagocytosis by granulocytes against C. albicans and the activ ity of natural ki ller cells were m easured a nd correlated with echinacea administration. A definite increase in cellu lar activity was see n, and this d eclin ed when administration stopped (Moese, 1983). A subseque nt study w ith healthy volunteers dosed an alcoholic extract of E. purpurea roots whose constitu ents h ad been dete rmined by high perform ance liquid chrom atography. This was give n orally to 24 healthy m ales daily for 5 days. Phagocytosis was stim ulated, and this decr eased when ad ministration stopped. These prepar ation s were well tolera ted (Jurcic et al., 1989). Interestingly, oral administration appeared to produce a greater rate of in crease than did in jection. A Ger man placebo -controlled clin ical trial enrolled 109 volu nteers who were determined to be at risk of upper respirator y infections (Sch\u00f6enberger, 1992). Tolerability was comparable in both the placebo and treatm ent groups, and this a ssessm ent was scored subjectively at four and eight weeks by patien ts as very good, good, satis factory, o r poor. Efficacy of echinacea was deem ed somewhat better than placeb o. In another Germ an study, com parative doses of an Echinacea purpurea root tincture were evaluated (B ra\u00fcnig et al., 1992). In a double-b lind placebo -controlled trial with 180 volunteers, 116the effect of E. purpurea root ethanol extract (1 :5 in 55% etha nol) was evaluated for efficacy in relieving sympto ms and duration of upper respiratory tr act infections. Vol unteers receiving a dose of 180 drops per day exhibited statistical ly significant improvem ents com pared with placebo. Volunteers who received half that dos e showed im provem ent only com parable to the placebo. The study highlights the importance of dosage in evalua ting effectiveness of echinacea preparations. The sam e investig ators enrolled 160 patients us ing a hydroalcoholic extract of E. pallida roots showed a trend to quicker recovery f rom an uppe r respiratory tract infection when compared to placebo (Braunig and Knick, 1993). This study was less definitiv e. Prelim inary investigatio n in patients with f ar adv anced colo rectal cancer treated with an echinacea preparation found that there was im provement in the suppressed immune fun ction and possibly som e effect on tum or regression or stab ilization and decreases in tumor markers (Lersch et al. , 1992). Meta-analyses of random ized trials in h ealthy young volunteers were completed focusing specifically on the imm unomodulatory effect of echinacea. One conclusion drawn from the earlier m etaanalys is was the quality of the m ajority of studies was unsatisfactory. In the later review, two of the studies dem onstrated that ph agocytic activity was signif icantly enhanced over that of placebo, while in the rem ainder of the st udies no sign ificant effect could be demon strated. Concerns were raised because the participants in five studies were conducted using healthy voluntee rs, and additiona l questions were ra ised concern ing dif ficultie s in phagocytic labor atory assessm ent in the th ree n egativ e stud ies (Melchart et al., 1994, 1995). Hoheisel et al. (1997) conducted a d ouble-b lind placeb o-controlled trial enrolling 12 0 volunteers that investig ated the therapeutic b enefits of the ex pressed ju ice of fresh-flowering Echinacea purpurea on the sym ptoms and duration of the common cold. The results of the study 117demonstrate that daily treatm ent with an echinacea preparation at the first signs of a cold inhibit the full expression of sympto ms. In addition, if symptoms were fully developed, the echinacea preparation produced significantly more rapid r ecovery co mpared with placebo. No specific adverse events were rep orted. The treatm ent was deem ed both well- tolerated and ef fective (Hoheisel et al. 1997). trial was cond ucted using echinacea ro ot preparations in the prevention of upper respiratory tract in fections (Melchart et al. 1998). At the end of the twelve-week period there was no st atistically significant d ifference between the treatm ent group and the placebo g roup. No adverse even ts were reported. It was concluded that echinacea ro ot preparatio ns are not effective in p reventing the inciden ces of cold infections. This seem ed to confirm previous reports that ech inacea preparations work best when taken at the onset of symptom s, rather than as a prev entative used over a l ong period of tim e. In a study involving triathletes, daily oral treatm ents for 28 days using pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea or m agnesiu m cytom etry ents revealed slight changes in peripheral tes exerci se-induced increases in urinary IL-6 and serum cortisol. None of the treated athletes developed upper respiratory infections co mpared to the control group (Berg et al. , 1998). The contrast between the use of the alcoholic root tinctures in the pr eceding study and the use of fresh pressed juice of plant tops in this study should be noted. A random ized, double-b lind, placeb o-contro lled trial of 559 volunteers was conducted to determ ine th e effectiven ess and safety of Echinacea purpurea prepar ation s in the tre atment of the comm on cold (Brink eborn et al. 1998). During the study period, 246 volunteers contracted a cold. They were treated with ei ther echinacea preparations at di fferent doses versus placebo. The 118prepar ation s were taken until sym ptoms improved or until se ven days ha d passed; no prepar ation was given for m ore than one week. The echinac ea preparation produced a reduction of 60% of complaints in the com plaint index as m easured by physicians. The investigators concluded that echinacea preparations are effectiv e in reducing the severity of symptoms; they did not m easure reduction in the duration of the cold. A random ized contro l trial assessed the effects o f echinacea versus placebo on the incidence and severity of colds and upper respiratory tr act infections. A tota l of 109 patients with a histo ry of 3 or m ore colds or respiratory inf ections in the p receding year were rando mized to receive E. purpurea expressed juice or placebo. No signifi cant differences were reco rded in the number and severity of infections between th e two groups. The investigators concluded that echinacea is no better than placebo fo r preven tion of the common cold, once again estigation. iden tified nine treatm ent trials and four prevention trials for efficacy in uppe r resp iratory tract in fections (Barrett et al., 1999). Eight of the nine treatm ent trials repo rted g enerally pos reported neg ative resu lts benefits. It was conclud ed that echin acea m ay be beneficial for the early treatm ent of acute upper respiratory tr act infections, but there is very little evidence to support the long-term use as a preventative. Echinacea for early trea tment of infection was cautiously supported. A random ized, placebo -contro lled, d ouble-b lind trial evaluated the effects of an echinacea h erbal tea co mbination for efficacy in early ons et of cold and flu sym ptoms (Lindenm uth and Linden muth, 2000). Ninety-five vol unteers received either echinacea tea or a placebo. In the echinacea group, subjects reported that acute sym ptoms such as stuffiness, 119scratchy throat, and fever seem ed to subside in a day or two. In the control group acute symptoms lasted six to ten days without relief. The study had several flaws including lim itations in blind ing, sim plicity of measured o utcom es and self-reporting, a nd lack of quantifying measures. Nevertheless it pointed to a favorable outcom e in reducing the se verity and duration of cold and flu sym ptoms when take n at early onset of sy mptoms. Turner et al. (2000) assessed the effectivene ss of echinacea (species, plant part and form not specified) and showed that treatm ent had no significan t effect on either the o ccurrence of infection of the severity of illness in 117 subjects . No signifi cant sid e effects were recorded. A recent m eta-an alysis of clinical stu dies using echinacea co ncludes that the availab le work does not convincingly establish the valu e of echinacea in immunostimulation and the prevention/relief of colds. The review suggests th at a m ajor source of the confusion stem s from uncertain id entity of the m aterial being evaluated and lack of inform ation on the m echanism of action. Som e preparations are definitely of valu e in reducing the severity of sy mptoms, but only some. The positiv e tria ls appear to in clude m ainly fresh juic e and isolated polysacch arides (Percival, 2000). Another recent review concluded that many reported trials have m ethodological deficiencies ranging from too few p articipan ts to unknown sources of medication. T welve studies repo rted efficacy for trea ting the comm on cold. These studi es also were judged to have procedural inadequacies . Despite clear-cu t evid ence of efficacy, apparen t lack of adv erse effects suggested that the lay use of echinacea was probably harm less and should not be discouraged (Giles et al., 2000). The m ost recent randomized blinded clinical trial reported that echin acea was no better than placebo in treating the common cold (Barrett et al., 2002). One hundred forty-two college 120students were random ized to receive either ech inacea or p lacebo at th e onset of an upper- respiratory tract infection. The endpoints of th is study were self-reports of sy mptoms with severity over the treatm ent. Mean cold duration was 5.75 days in the placebo group and 6.27 days in the echinacea group. Af ter controlling for severity and durations of sym ptoms before study entry, sex, date of enrollm ent, and use of non-protocol m edicati ons, researchers found no statistical significant treatm ent effects for echin acea. The authors conclu ded that co mpared with placebo, un refined echin acea prov ided no detectable benefit o r harm in college studen ts who had contracted the common cold. Of note, the study m edication was analyzed for content and was not found to contain any po lysaccharide fraction, whic h is believed to be a very im portant immune- stimulating com ponent. It is conceiv able in th is trial, the s tudy drug containing ech inacea was not in th e active f orm. In comm enting on the problem s of v ariability in results observed in various echinacea clinical stud ies, Rining er et al. (2000 ) iden tified two key problem s of echinacea clinical literatu re irrespective of study desi gn, includ ing the adm inistration of different echin acea ex tracts with varying phytochem ical profiles, and a lack of in vitro studies the immunom odulato ry activ ity of echin acea test m aterial. Based on their in vitro work with various echinacea products and/or raw m aterial, they found that E. purpurea herb and powders clearly stimulated m acrophage cytokine activation; however, finished products and raw m aterials standardized to contain 4% phenol ic com pounds or to echinacoside/ alkylam ides were inactive. In conclusion, while efficacy studies are im portant, studies n eed to be des igned to elu cidate the action of echinacea in vivo, and m ethods should be devised to st andardize active in gredients with a sensib le reporting sy stem prior to designing f urther clinica l trials. Then and only the n will th e 121results of clinical efficacy trials be u seful in guiding health care prac tition ers in the pr oper administration and dosing of echinacea . C. Current Concerns and Future Directions 1. Variability in the Herbal Industry Considerable variability exists in the preparation of the available echinacea products. Most products in Europe cont ain the expressed juice of E. purpurea aerial parts o r alco holic tinctures of E. pallida or E. purpurea roots. In the United Sta tes, either dried whole plant products or tinctures from the roots are sold (B auer, 1998). As a result, there is considerable variability in the product used in the reported research (Tragni et al., 198 8; Egert and Beuscher, 1992; Steinmuller et al., 1993; Burger et al., 1997) or the studies do not state in what for m or from what part of the p lant the echinacea product is obtained (Stahl et al., 1990; Lersch et al. , 1992; Melchart et al., 1998). var iability in ex traction m ethods m akes it nec essary to estab lish bo tanical and chem ical standardization in order to obta in reproducible pharm acological and therapeutic results. Another obstacle to a sy stem atic app roach to the study of echinacea is th at neither its activ e com ponent nor th e mechanism s of action for treatm ent of infections have been defined. Several cons tituents of echinace a have been eva luated and sh own to have various b iological activ ities. U nless an a ctive constitue nt or com bination of constituents can be identif ied and a desired biological activity defined, it is difficult to address such funda mental issues as dosing, bioavailability, or pharm acokinetics. In inf ormation, it is dif ficult to generalize the results of an i ndividual study beyond the specific conditions under which the study was conducted (Turner, 2002). 122 A wide variety of products are in use invol ving various echinacea species and plan t parts in the form of alcoholic tinctures, hydroalcoho lic extra cts, tea s, and expre ssed juice ( Bauer, 1998). Unfo rtunately, although m any la boratory studies have been carried out on root-derived materials, in the clinic the m ost convincing results have com e for the expressed juice of the aerial parts. In Germ any today, health auth orities app rove the use fo r health purposes of the expressed juice of E. purpurea aerial par ts in tr eating relaps ing inf ections of the respiratory and urinary tract and for external use in poorly healing su perficial wounds. Also approved is the use of tinctures of E. pallida roots for adjuvant therapy of comm on cold and s imilar ailm ents. Conclusions based upon the references cited fail to allow a convinci ng choice of the best species, the best plant part, the best dosage form s, and the best m eans of preparation (Foster, 1991; Melcha rt et al., 1994; 1995; Bauer, 1998; Barrett et al., 2002; Turner, 2002). 1. Contamination and Adulteration Fungal contam ination is known to occur second ary to im proper harvesting, handling, and processing techniques (Roy, 1998). It is im perati ve that controlled growing, processing, and manufacturing techniques be established. Also of concern is intentional adulteration of herbal products. The best known is the use of Parthenium integrifolium as an adulterant in echinacea products (Hobbs, 1989; Foster, 1991; Bauer, 1998). Adulteration by P. can also be detected readily in the sam e manner based upon the presence of sesquiterpen e esters, which are no t present in echinacea (1987 ). Identification of widespread adulteration of E. purpurea root with that of P. integrifo lium led to develop ment of macroscopic, m icroscopic, and chem ical m ethods to differentiate echinacea species and potential adulterants. Though Parthenium is not sim ilar in appearance to echinacea, once the root is cut and sifted, it has an uncanny resem blance to E. angustifo lia or E. pallida roots, though it 123possesses a characteristic flavor and fragrance. It does not resem ble the root of Echinacea purpurea (Foster, 1991). Lower-quality echinacea r oot m aterials wild harvested from the southern half of the United States overlap with Parthenium in distribution and are m ost likely to be contam inated.

Wagner H, Proksch A, Riess-Maurer I, Vollm ar A, Odenthal S, Odenthal S, Populations Kelly popularity of echinacea m edicine has rep eatedly risen an d fallen in recent history, cyclically renewing concerns th at unregulated harvesting will decim ate wild stands. Although wild-harv ested Echinacea angustifolia has been an im portant m edicine for m any Native American tribes, predating the 1800s, their historic use did not consti tute a threat to existing wild stands. The first concern regard ing o ver-harvest of echinacea occurred ov er 100 years ago, when questions w ere raised about over-harvesting E. angustifo lia in Kansas (S ayre 1903; Kindscher 1989). These worries p assed, but th e most recen t cycles of po pularity are causing con cern for the sustainability of wild stands which are thre atened by consum er preferen ce for wild over cultivated E. angustifo lia, with resulting price spikes s purred on by research and product developm ent by large ph armaceutical and natu ral product com panies, exp anding dom estic and international m arkets, ov ergrazing, and loss of habitat. These threats are exacerbated b y high levels of unemploy ment, which is as high as 60%-80% in the rural count ryside, especially on Great Plains Indian reservations that ar e close to som e of the best stands o f E. angustifolia (Kolster 1998; Kolster and Youpee 1998). Habitat Los s Conversion of land to other us es (farm land, hous ing, indus try, roads)and degradation caused by o vergrazing are the b iggest causes of h abitat los s for echin acea st ands of all species over the las t few decades. This loss is probably substantially greater th an the loss du e to over- harvest, which has seldo m been the sole reason for extirpatio n of an echinacea population. Echinacea a ngustifo lia has thrived through the centuries by establishing a niche am ong grasses and slow-growing nativ e plant species, but gr asslands, open woodlands, and other echinacea 135habitats in N orth Am erica, once extending from Canada to the Mexican border and fro m near the Rocky Mountains to western Indian a, W isconsin, and the S outheast, have dram atically declined in area. Some states and provinces in North Am erica r eport le ss than one -tenth of 1% of the historic area of native grassl and is still intact (Sam son and Knopf 1994). In som e areas the declin e has not been as dram atic, but consid er so me of the stark loss es of prairie hab itat rev ealed by the U.S. Departm ent of the Inte rior's Endangered Ecosystems of the U nited States (Noss et al. 1995): 90% of original 58 m illion ha of tallg rass pr airie destroyed ; remaining 10% m ostly in fragments. 99% loss of tallgras s prairie eas t of the Missou ri River; 85 % loss west of the Missouri River. 90% loss of native grassland in North Dakota. 47% loss of native grassland in S outh Dakota by significant but undocum losses Kansas. 97% loss of tallgrass prairie that once covered the eastern one-third of Nebraska. Loss of prairie and grassy open woodland habi tat also h inders the ability of echinacea populations to interbreed, greatly reducing genetic diversity. The long-term effects of this are speculative, but what is known is that genetic diversity greatly enhances the ability of a population to adapt to fundam ental changes in the ecosystem and changi ng weather patterns. Species range and habitat m aps (see the Biology chap ter, in this volum e) clearly indicate that some populations have lim ited ranges and theref ore lim ited opportunity for developing genetic diversity. It has been shown that limited genetic diversity in Echinacea ten nesseens is may be a 136population constraint for these spec ies when compared to the other Echinacea species (Baskauf et al. 1994). Of the rem aining f open woodlands, barrens, and sim ilar ha bitats), m any have b een lost to expansion of agricultural fields, roads, and subdivisions, which t ypically leaves only islands of native habitat. When prairies are f ragmented in this way, th ere is no buf fer between the c ultivated an d natura l landscap e to prevent so il erosion and chem ical runoff. When fertilizers co ntam inate native prair ie, inva sive plants a re given a c ompetitiv e edge. In par ticular, non -native cool- season grasses are f avored in echinacea stands, and this has hurt som e E. angustifolia habitat where the non-native cool-season brom e grass, , has invaded som e stands. Fragm entation also opens up native prairies to potential disease orga nism s that have not evolved with the plan t comm unities. Although there is no h istorical reco rd of wild stands of E. angustifo lia being wiped out by disease or insect pests, th e blight that decim ated the Am erican chestnu t is a worst-case scenario for what can happen when new organism s invade an established ecosystem . Currently, aster yellows (a plan t disease caus ed by a microorganism that yellows and stunts echin acea and o ther plan ts) an d root borers are known to attack individual E. an gustifo lia and E. purpurea plants, but they are not consider ed a threat to whole populations. Cattle g razing is anoth er stress on e chinace a spe cies, esp ecially in rem aining are as of native g rasslands in th e Midwest an d Great Plains. E. angustifo lia has b een recogn ized as a species that declines under heavy grazing (W eaver and Fitzpatrick 1934; Baskin et al. 1994; Fraser and Kindscher 1997). Spring grazing m ay be particularly detrim ental since flowering shoots get dam aged and overall seed producti on is reduced (Kolster 1998; Hurlburt 1999). Grazing later in the year, however, when leaves and stem s are tougher and less palatable, does 137not seem to affect the plant. I have observed that in pastures where there has been continuous heavy grazing, especially spring grazing over m any years, E. angustifolia , E. pallida , and E. atrorubens are not seen in habitats w here they are f ound locally in sim ilar situations. Under these conditions, the species mix will sh ift, and echinacea will loose its com petitive nich e. In pastures that hav e been ligh tly to moderately grazed, echi nacea s tands continue to thriv e. The presence of echinacea can be an indicator of goo d pasture h ealth, especially when ech inacea is obs erved in grassy areas of a pasture, not just on rem aining rock outcrops. The Echinacea Market as a Threat to Wild Pop ulations Increased dom estic and international dem and for echinacea (s ee the Mark ets chap ter, in this volum e) has put pressure on native stands over the las t decade. W ith such larg e nationa l and international dem ands, e chinacea expert Steven Foster asks, \" Who is going to supply the global market? \" (Foster 1997). While cu ltivation fills som e of the h eavy dem and, m ost commercial supply of E. angustifo lia still com es from the wild (Am erican Herbal Products Association 2003). Despite cultivation efforts, wild populations throughout the Great Plains constitute the majority of commercial supply of this species and are potentially thre atened by over-harvest (Fuller 1991; Kolster 1998). Local population declines due to root digging of wild E. angustifo lia stands have been observed in Montana, N orth Dakota, Wyoming (Crawford 1998; Kolster 1998), Oklaho ma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas (M cGregor 1968; Foster 1991), as well as for E. pallida and other species (Foster 1991). Fo rtunately for the survival of E. angustifolia (and possibly the other tap-rooted Echinacea species), we have observed root re-sprouting after comm (Kindscher, personal obs ervation Montana and Kansas; Hurlburt 1999). W e have 138recen tly co mpleted field experim ents which found a 50% rate of re-sprou ting for harv ested populations in both eastern Montan a and north-central Kansas (Ki ndscher, et al. preparation). Although research on echin acea m edicinal effects has been insufficient to drive the market for echinacea, it som eday m ight. Im agine how the m arket would change if E. angustifo lia was proven efficacious for whooping cough, tuberc ulosis, leu kemia, tum ors, or infectious diseases. Already, initial results look prom ising (s ee the Medical chapter, in this volum e). So me specific results will clarify this. In a study i nvolving over 500 children trea ted for tuberculosis, echinacea treatm ent resulted in acu te signs of immunostim ulation, and an increase of 40%-100% increase in blood leukocyte count, w ith no other adverse events observed (Parnham 1999). As isolated com pounds, polysaccharides from E. pur purea stim ulated T-cell activity t T-cell s timulato r (Luettig 1989). Th e profoundly positiv e effects of treatm ent in disease abatem ent sugge st the therapeutic potential of E. purpurea , at leas t with respect to leukem ia, if n ot othe r tumors (Currier and Miller 2 001). W hat if these experim ents were replicated using E. angustifo lia or other Echinacea species and the results were even bette r? If one of the Echinacea species with a much sm aller range, su ch as E. atrorubens or E. paradoxa, were found to have a m uch higher content of som e active m edicinal constituent, it could be driven onto the endangered species list. The m edical community is not conv inced that echinacea o r other m edicin al plan ts are valuable therapeutic sub stances. Pharm aceutical co mpanies are unlikely to be able to patent a wild and historically useful m edicinal plant and have been relu ctant to fund clinical trials on Echinacea species. Bef ore most doctors in th e United States will pr escribe Echinacea species for any conditio n, more research will be necessary. Bu t if funding does become available f or clinical 139trials us ing E. angustifo lia, and if wild E. angustifolia is discovered to b e the m ost efficacious of the species available, how long would it take befo re there is intense pressure on wild stands? The strong dem and for E. angustifolia has com e from Europe, where it h as been widely used and where m uch of the resear ch has been conducted in Germ any. Echinacea purpurea is used in m any European m edicines, but there is strong dem and for E. angustifo lia over E. purpurea because it is believed to be superior owi ng to its use by Native Am ericans and its status as a wild p lant. The inab ility of comm ercial gr owers in pe to produce m arketable quantities of E. angustifolia is due to the clim ate being too moist, which\u2014coupled with a large cult-like following for E. angustifolia , even though there is no conclusive evidence that it is better than E. purpurea (Foster 1991)\u2014has led to continued strong dem and for this species. The suitab ility of cultiv ated E. angustifolia to replace wild -harvest ed roo ts of the sam e species has not been established. Myths have pe rsisted th at wild-harv ested roots a re bette r, especially b ecause they are wild. Bu t in defense of this idea, one broker confided to u s in the summer of 2 002 that a E uropean buyer of roots cancelled an order for 40, 000 pounds of cultivated E. angustifo lia, (irrigated under a cen ter-pivo t in so uthwest Kan sas) as serting that it takes five tim es more cultiv ated r oots than wild roots to supp ly the des ired results. It is known that well-watered and fertilized p lants (of m ost species) have higher yield but lower content of secondary com pounds. This rejectio n of cultivated E. angustifolia roots was the resu lt of chem istry-pr ofile tes ting that som e European f irms use to make sure the y get the rig ht spec ies and high-qu ality m aterial. In add ition, cultivatio n of E. angustifo lia is not easy and requires som e labor and sk ill. Bec ause this wild pla nt grows slo wly, it takes 3 years or m ore to ge t marketable roots. Price fluctuations due to dem and also make cultivation difficult. When the ech inacea boom in the 1990s was sustained for a few years, a considerable am ount of E. angustifo lia was 140planted by growers. Unfortunately, much of it was plowed up when it was m ature enough for harvest b ecause the echinacea m arket had crashed, and no one would buy or pay a sufficient price for the harvest of the roots. Wild Harvest as a Threat Another re al threa t to the wild E. angustifo lia is the price harvesters are p aid for the roots. W hen the price is high (see the graph in th e History of Kansas Har vest chap ter, in this volum e), or when econom ic conditio ns are poor, harv esters can decim ate a stand in a relatively short am ount of tim e. Ec hinacea d igging has been likened to a \"Gold Rush\" (Crawford 1999) that begins abruptly, occurs intensely, and sp reads to other potential root m ining sites when resources becom e depleted. After sweeping the central Great Plains states, E. angustifo lia root digging spread northward in the m id-1990s and increased greatly when the dem and dou bled from 1997 to 1998. The dem and brought buyers into the essentiall y untouched stands in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. In the northern range of this species, th ese two states were the last places with la rge E. angustifolia stands, and they becam e the cente r of the digging and buying frenzy. The Fort Peck Reservation in northeast Mont ana is a good exam ple of the influence of the expansion of co mmercial m arkets. In 1995, tw o herbal brokerage com panies approached the tribes and offered m oney for the root of a plan t that was being studied for AIDS research and other uses (Kolster 1998). The Fort Peck Reserva tion was the third reservation to be approached after Turtle Mountain and Fort Bert hold Reservations (Kolster 1998). Local roo t buyers aroun d the Ft. Peck Reservat ion held conte sts to f ind th e larg est roo t, and in one com petition, the winner was awarded a $100 prize, second place going to a 6-year-old who claim ed to \"be heavily into rooting\" (Ste wart 1999). The Fort Peck tribal newspaper, 141Wotanin Wowapi , published a picture of a 38-inch echinac ea root th at was pa rt of the contest (Kolster 1998; Stewart 1999). It was estim ated that about 350-400 people were harvesting E. angustifolia on native prairie lands in the Ft. Peck Reservation area in the spring of 1998 (Kolster 1998). They would harvest any where from a couple of hours to ov er 40 hours p er week. Echinacea root harvesting was a fam ily event, and in m any respects it is a traditional p ractice of Native Am erica ns, so many peopl e on the Reservation initially endorsed the activity but becam e concerned when root- harvesting continued over several ye ars, caus ing stands to d ecline. I was told by an elder that at the height of the harvest on the Reservation, th e pickup trucks lights were som etimes used at night to illu minate the last rem aining flowering cones could be seen and the roots harvested. One local person predicted that echinacea would be gone from the Reservation in another 2-3 years (Kolster 1998). Digging was not just a Native Am erican or Indian Reservation phenom ena. By 1999, coneflower digging was reported in 14 counties in North Dakota, and U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service workers there reported cases of po aching in both W ells and Stutsm an Counties (Torkelson 1999). Montana also had significant activity, and it was estim ated that 100,000 pounds\u2014at least 700,000 live roots\u2014 were harvested during this period (Crawford 1998). One company with a Fort Peck, Montana, address bou ght as m uch as 1,200 pounds of root a day and paid out over $1.1 m illion to coneflo wer diggers in 1998 (Solberg The t, and espec ially th e illega l harves t of Echinacea a ngustifo lia on U.S. Forest Service land s, becam e a problem . When the de mand for echinacea reach ed its h ighest level of activity in Montana in 1998, commercial ha rvesters from Texas\u2014who had requested a commercial perm it the previous day but had not yet received it\u2014were arrested in the Ashland 142District of the Custer National Forest with 84 pounds of roots in gunny sacks that they said were for \"personal use.\" They had dug an estim ated 6, 000 roots and left shovel holes about 6-8 inches deep throughout the area that they harv ested (Stewart 1999; Scott Studiner, Custer National Forest Service ranger, pers. com ., July 2 002). The holes from the harvest were still visible when I visited the sites in July 2002, 4 years after the harves t. Fortunately, the site still had flowerin g echinacea because sm all plants had not been harvested and were still p resent, and a few harvested roots had re-sprouted and were no ticeable squarely in the m iddle of the holes. Echinacea h arvest du ring this peak tim e was not lim ited to Montana, North Dakota, Wyom ing, or Kansas. I received a call from Dave Ode, a botanist with the Natural Heritage Program in South Dakota, asking m e why \" my people\" (people from Kansas, or, m ore technically, vehicles with Kansas license plates ) were in Buffalo Gap National Grasslands and elsewhere in South Dakota harvesting E. angustifolia roots. I later found out that at least som e of the Kansas \"diggers\" were harvesting roots on their way to th e Black Hills Motorcy cle Rally held every July in Sturgis, South Dakota, to pay for the trip. Root diggers were observed in other areas, harvesting other Echinacea species. Durin g a previous upswing in the echinacea market in 198 7, about 7,000 yellow coneflower plants ( E. paradoxa var. paradoxa ) were poached fro m Ha Ha Tonka St ate Park in Missouri. T his variety is known only from thirteen counties in Missouri and four in Arkansas. (The other variety of E. paradoxa [var. neglecta ] is known only from four countie s in the Arbuckle Mountains of Oklahom a.) There were at le ast two or thre e cas es in the Oua chita Na tional Fores t in Arkansas in 1997 and 1998, where diggers were charged for il legal harvest and roots were confiscated (J. Hicks, patro l office, Ouachita Na tional Fores t, pers. com . 2002). W ell outside the range of E. angustifo lia, the harvested roots of several Echinacea species were sold to buyers as \"snakeroot\" 143and then sold to som e herbal product com pany as E. angustifo lia becaus e that is what the m arket wanted. It should be noted that for the last decade, only E. angustifo lia and E. pallid a have had a market for wild-harv ested roots. The initial threats du e to wild harves ting we re caused by the sheer number of lost plants. Considering that over 145,000 kg (320,000 lbs) of dried roots of Echinacea angustifolia were wild-harvested during the four years of harvest from 1998 to 2001 inclusive (Am erican Herbal Products Association 2000, 2003), and that it m ay take over 100 plants to m ake 1 pound (0.45 kg) of dried Echinacea root (determ ined from roots that we h ave weighed that were wild- harvested in western Kansas by harvesters ), we be lieve that ov er thr ee m illion E. angustifo lia plants were harvested. But m ore than just the loss of plants, the threat to echinacea populations is that the largest plants (with the la rgest roots) a re the ones tha t flower and make the m ost seed, and th ese plan ts are harvested first. Digg ers select for these p lants, and if the h arvest p ressure is su stained, the reproductive class of plants can be reduced, or in some cases, elim inated, at least for a while. The loss of flowers could also negatively aff ect the rare Dakota skipper bu tterfly (Hesperia dacotae ), which finds a m ajor source of nectar from these flowers. Where shovels are used to dig (prim arily in areas where there is a frenzy of activity), 6- 8-inch holes are often created, and w e could stil l observe th ese years af ter harvest (on both the Ft. Peck Reservation and the Custer National Forest in Montana, and on so me harvested rangeland in north-central Kansas). These holes m ay cause rot in any rem aining roots in the hole (Kolster 1998), thus elim inating the chance of root re-sprouting. In addition, disturbance by vehicle ruts and other hum an harvesting activity provides an opportunity for noxious weeds, such as musk spurge, Euphorbia establish on the se are as. 144The presence of weeds, even a few, can resu lt in herbicides being applied to rid pastures of all weeds, which further endangers th e health of native ech inacea stands because m ost herbicides used in rangeland will kill all br oad-leafed plants. In addition, a ll these d isturbances can locally degrade the prairie ecos ystem . The m ore intensely an area has been harvested, however, the less like ly \"diggers\" are to scour that area again for rem aining plants be cause the re turns f or tim e inve sted and the likelihood of finding large roots diminish (Hurlb urt 1999). T his may provide inherent protection for wild stands, just as rocky, dry prairies es cape the plow. This econom y of diminishing returns will likely s pare th e spe cies from extinc tion, but the ef fect of such intense harvesting c ould be deleterious to the local gene pool. I have found th at skilled \"diggers\" in north-central Kansas visit favo rite areas to dig about once every 3 years because it then becom es easier and more worthwhile tim e-wise to harvest. They also know by looking at the tops which roots they can harvest, and they tend to harvest m oderately because they will be com ing back som etime. Hurlburt (1999) determ ined fro m these stands that there is a s ustain able rate of harves t: when 6%-7% percent of edium- to large-sized r oots are harvested, popul ations can sustain them selves. Many experienced diggers are sustaina bly harvesting. Educating diggers and brokers about sustainable rates of harvest co uld be good inform ation to share. Since 2000, dem and for wild-harvested echin acea root has decreased dram atically (American Herbal Prod ucts Association 2003). Follo wing p ast cycles, it will rise ag ain and will serve as a catalyst for wild harvest. D uring the summers of 20 01-2003, I m ade reconnaissance trips to a reas with the m ost intense wild harves t of E. angustifo lia, areas described as being over- harvested (Kolster 1998). These areas included site s at Fort Peck Indian Reservation and Custer National Forest in Montana, the Missouri Nati onal Grasslands in Nort h Dakota, and the Sm oky 145Hills of north-central Ka nsas. I look ed for echina cea stands d uring th e growing seaso n but after the m ost recent harvest (except in Kansas, wher e the harvest season was ongoing but uneven). At all sites, I lo oked for areas where echinacea wa s known to have been m ade locally ex tinct by over-harvesting. I found no local extinction ; at all sites I saw flowering echinacea p lants. At some sites (areas of harvested populations in nor th-central Kansas), stands appeared robust and plentiful, even though evidence of pa st harvest could be observed. At other sites, stands persisted where they were unlik ely to be overgrazed o r plowed. At a few sites, su ch as those o n the Ft. Peck Reserv ation, echinacea stands were very thin and sparsely populated. One could only guess how large or robust any of these populations ha d been prior to repeated harvesting. I w as encouraged to find echin acea plants rem aining at a ll harvested sites v isited; it provides hope that the potentially im portant geneti c diversity of these populations has persisted despite over- harvesting. Conservation Status and Rankings One good way to ascertain threats to species is to look at the conser vation status rankings by Natural Heritag e Programs. Thes e rankings indicate that various Echinacea species are imperiled in their sta tes (Table 1). In most cases these are Echinacea species that have never been abundant or that are at the edge of their ranges in the st ates in which they have been evalua ted. S till, the se populations could be very significant for th eir genetic diversity, or for the divers ity of their ch emical cons tituent makeup, and so these r ankings e instruc tive a nd could certainly ch ange in a negative direction if the dem and for wi ld echin acea were to in crease significantly. 146Table 1.

States and Provinces th at have no t ranked Echinacea species or th at are reviewing the ir rankings are not inclu ded in Imperiled ; Apparently Secure. 147Mitigation of Threats Because res earch on the efficacy of E. angustifo lia, E. purpurea , E. pallida, and the other echinacea species for the treatm ent of hu man dise ase is ongoing but not conclusive, the m arket demand for wild-harv ested echinacea has not ex ceeded th e apparent sup ply. Nor hav e wild stands of echinacea sho wn much vuln erability to m assive p infes tation, disease, o r invas ion by noxious weeds. Destruction of habitat is still slow ly growing, owing to conversion of habitat to agricu ltural lands, hom e building, an d other developm ent, but is not am eminent threat for m ost remaining stands, which are usually now in rem ote habitats. Based on current threats, evidence is not sufficien t to sugges t listing any ad dition al Echinacea species und er the federal Endangered Species Act or th e Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of W ild Fauna and Flora (CIT ES), even though the greatest wild- harvest demand is on E. angustifo lia and, to a m uch lesser degree, on E. pallida. These two species h ave large ranges , and there are num erous large s tands of E. angustifolia and num erous populations of both species. The two least-common species, E. tennesseensis and E. laevigata, are protected by the Endangered Species Act. It is the other so mewhat uncommon species, E. atrorubens , , , that need to be w atched, no t so much for the threat of m edicin al trade harv est, but for the variety of threats that affect their h abitats, which are of ten sm all an d could be lo st becaus e of com peting land uses. The statu s of all Echinacea species will n eed to b e reeva luated if their po pular ity boo ms again as a result of new research findings or great ly increased use of m edicinal plants and herbal products. Som e future problem s could be elim inated or reduced if both diggers and consum ers are educated about sustainable harvest practices. Grow ers could be encouraged to cultivate echinacea if dem and increases beyond a sustaina ble level. O ngoing m onitoring program s should 148be in place to observe population changes for both less common species and for the more common E. angustifo lia and E. pallida , especially in years w hen buyers are advertising for echinacea ro ots.

Although echinacea sales have been flat or in decline since 2002, another upswing in dem and is inevitable and expected. W hen it oc curs, pressure on native echin acea s tands will in crease. Even during a downturn in dem and, echinacea is one of the most sought-after herbal remedies. In 2002, a lower-dem and year (and the last year for which detailed data are available), echinacea resulted in almost $140 million in sales and rank ed behind o nly ginkgo as the leading medicinal herbal product (Blum enthal 2002). Earlie r in the last dem and cycle, in 1996, sales accounted f or 9.6% of the total sa les of herbs in health food stor es, m aking it the number 1 best- selling herb in Am erica. One year later, ech inacea products h ad garnered about $325 m illion in sales, 9% of the $3.6 billion in U.S. consum er sales (Blum enthal 1997). T he year 1998 brought 151% sales growth in echinacea p roducts (Blum enthal 1998 ). Sales fell o ff sharply across the industry in 2 001, but ech inacea rem ained the top selle r of the twenty best-selling herbs, together they accounted for 62% of sales in U .S. natural food stores (Richter 2003). Herbal product use continues to be important worldwide. Recent trends show dietary supplem ent usage has continued to increase fr om 14.2% of U.S. households in 1998-1999 to 18.8% of households in 2002 (Kelly et al. 2005; s ee Table 1 f or a list of currently available echinacea products found in the United States). In China alone, traditiona l herbal preparations account for 30%-50% of total m edicinal produc t consum ption, and the World Health Organization (2003) predicts that at som e time during their lives, 70% of the population in Canada and 90% of the population in Germ any will have u sed a natu ral rem edy. 152Table 1: A Sa mple of Commonly Available Echinacea Products Brand Na me Echinacea Specie s Plant Par ts Used Amount Reco Type Alvita E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea root, herb not specified tea bag Celestial Seasonings E. purpurea root, herb 775 mg tea bag Frontier E. purpurea herb 788 mg bulk tea* Frontier E. purpurea root angustifolia, E. purpu rea, E. pallida root, herb, seeds 40 dr ops alcohol tinctur e* Herb s for Kid s E. purpurea root 1 mL non-alcohol tinctur e Hy-Vee E. root, mg gummy bear Naturade E. angustifolia root not specified drink form ula Natur e Made not specified root 180 m g capsule Natur e's Bounty E. purpurea aerial par ts 400 mg capsule Natur e's Bounty E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea root, herb not specified capsule Nature's Resource E. purpurea aerial par ts 350 mg capsule Nature's Resource E. purpurea aerial par ts 125 mg capsule Nature's Resource E. purpurea aerial par ts 510 mg capsule Nature's Resource E. purpurea aerial par ts 100 mg capsule Natur e's Resour ce not specified root 35 mg lozenge wa y E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea stem , leaf, flower , root 2 mL alcohol tinctur e Nature's wa y E. purpurea stem , leaf, flower 2 mL alcohol tinctur e Nature's wa y E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea stem , leaf, flower , root 1 mL alcohol tinctur e Nature's wa y E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea , flower , root mL tinctur e Nature's wa y E. purpurea stem , leaf, flower 400 m g tablet Now Foods E. purpurea root 1.6 mL non-alcohol tinctur e Now Foods E. angustifolia root 1.2 mL alcohol tinctur e Now Foods E. purpurea root 1.6 mL alcohol tinctur e Now Foods E. purpurea root 125 mg2tablet Now Foods E. purpurea root 400 mg tablet Nutrition Now E. purpurea root, aerial par ts 50 mg tablet Olympian L abs E. purpurea not specified 400 mg capsule Quantu m E. purpurea whole plant 100 mg tablet Solar Ra y E. purpurea aerial par ts 380 mg tablet Solar Ra y E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea root 460 mg tablet Spring Valley E. purpurea aerial par ts 700 mg capsule Spring Valley E. purpurea aerial par ts 1,140 mg capsule Spring Valley E. purpurea aerial pa rts not specif ied capsule Sundown E. purpurea aerial par ts 400 mg capsule Traditional Medicinals E. angustifolia, E. purpu rea root, herb 1,132.5 mg tea bag Traditional Medicinals E. purpurea root 600 mg tea bag Walgreens Finest Natural E. purpurea leaf 125 mg tablet Yogi T ea E. angustifolia, E. pallida, E. purpure a root 326 tea Yogi ea E. angustifolia, E. pallida, E. purpure a root 26 mg tea bag* Source: Thes e dat a were gathered f rom a large groce ry store, a food co-op, a discount retail store, and a drug store in Law renc e, KS , during t he week of 2/13/200 5, compiled by Scott Howell. 1 Standar dized to 4% echinacosides and 4% phenol s. to 4% echinacosides. * Organic.

Echinacea purpurea is relatively easy to grow in both the United States and Europe, and m ost of its dem and has been m et by growers. There is a potential market for E. angustifolia , but it is dif ficult to gro w. It take s 2-3 years after planting before E. angustifo lia can be harvested, and the lag tim e between dem and and harves t can create unanticipated surpluses. An excess o f cultivated product beg an to accum ulate in 199 7, at the peak of consu mer concern over harvesting pressures on wild stands. By 1998 and 1999, consum ers were asking for products m ade from cultivated roo ts, and th e harvest of cu ltivated E. angustifo lia doubled both years. By 2001, the bulk m arket for raw m aterials was flooded with cultivated E. angustifo lia, markets were few, prices were lower, and a few large growers and many small growers were forced to pl ow under crops they couldn't sell. About this tim e, demand for wild roots bega n to increase after European m anufacturers discovered that cultivated roots tested m uch lower for desired secondary com pounds than wild ones, and they refused to buy cultivated E. angu stifolia (Steven Foster, pers. com ., Septem ber 2002). It is h ard to predic t the m arket price for wild -harvested roo ts, but certain ly it is affected by the quantity and quality of the roo ts collected throughout the country. In 1998, the price paid for a pound of dried E. angustifo lia varied between $19 and $93 for organic and $16 and $56 for nonorganic roots (Dey 1999; Falk et al. 1999) , suggesting a variance in root quality. Owing to the m ultitude of individual collecto rs and rem ote methods of collection of wild E. angustifo lia roots, it is hard to quantify how much E. angustifo lia root is extracted fro m native stands annu ally, a s well as the pr ice paid f or it (see Figure 1 f or an exam ple of the nu mber of roots per weight class in a harves t). In an attem pt to quantif y wild medicinal plants harvested for 154commerce, the Am erican Herbal Products A ssociation (AHPA 2000, 2003) conducted a survey of regional buyers. These are the people who purchase roots directly from nu merous wild crafters and sell them in large qu antities to com panies that distribute bulk raw herbs to manufacturers of various product lines. Although the studies were not scientifically controlled, they are the best ind icators we have to date.

Note that the m ajority of harvested roots are in the sm aller weight categories. 155 Table 2 Dried Echinacea Traded by Regional Buyers (in lbs), 1997-2001 1997 1998 1999 2000 pallida: Root: Cultiv ated 18,350 45,896 3,100 0 11,000 14,092 Herb: Cultiv ated 0 0 0 0 0 W ild 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Source: American Herbal Pr oducts Association (2000, 2003). The results of three consecutive tonnag e surveys conducted by the AHPA between 1998 and 2001 provide a rough estim ate of the com bined tonnage of wild-crafted E. angustifolia , E. purpurea , and E. pallid a commercially so ld dur ing those y ears. Ther e was a rad ical shif t in preferences in 1998, for cultivat ed roots rather than wild harvested. By 2000-2001, the m arkets dropped dram atically a cultiv ated roo ts had been saturated. T he tonnage s urvey ind icates th at the market for wild-craft ed E. angustifo lia root was robust in 1998 but crashed by 80% in 1999 when cultivated E. angustifo lia peaked in popularity (see Table 2). 156 By 2000, however, sales of cultivated roots fell 8 5% from the peak of 219,000 pounds of dry cultivated root in 19 99. Cultivated dried l eaf sales peaked in 1998 at over 1,300 tons and fell in 2001 to less than 1% of the volum e reporte d 3 years earlier (AHP A 2003). This boom -and- bust trend has had an almost 100-year history (see th e History of Harvest chapter, in this volum e) and, unfortunately, wi ll likely con tinue. One of the most com pelling reason s for th e rapid growth in the herbal market, particula rly in the m ass-market channels, has b een the substantial investm ent in advertising dollars by large com panies entering the m arket. Bl umenthal (1998) rces and accu stom ed to large advertising budgets for m ass market laun ch have changed the industry because they have brought an increased awareness of these products to the average American.\" Increased m arket awarenes s has brought free advertising in the form of magazine cover stories (such as \"The Herbal Med icine Boom ,\" featured on Time Magazine 's cover on Novem ber 23, 1998) and seg ments on prim e-tim e television shows like 20/20. Since the m ajority of consum ers using botanical s are self-m edicating, what they read in the popular press has a significan t influence on their herbal buying habits. Unfortunately, journa lists, rather than sc ientists o r medica l prof essionals, write m uch of what the con sumer reads, and \"their ab ility to inte rpret studies is lim ited and the inf ormation the y provide is frequently not cited. T hese publications are not peer review ed and are barely m onitored by the FDA or the scien tific or m edical communities,\" observes R owena K. Richter (2003), in her book , Herbal Medicine: Chaos in the Marketplace . Much of the popular literature on herbal treatm ents im plies claim s that lead consum ers to high expectations. W ithout understanding m uch, if anything, about the m echanism s of various herbal treatm ents, consu mers can be let down wh en results are less than expected. Although an 157inadequate outcom e could well be related to the quality of the product, dosage, or tim e of day taken, a disappointed consum er generally dism isses the herb as not efficacious. Negative publicity\u2014in reports of ineffective or m ixed resu lts, or in th e publica tion of adulteran ts\u2014has hurt the m arket, and som e issues could potential ly be used by the m edical establishm ent to deliberately hurt th e herb al products m arket by discrediting th e efficacy of herbal use (Blum enthal 2003). It is hard to predict what tr ends the popular m agazines and talk shows will launch. Just announcing sales figures can drive the m arket, such as when the New York Times referred to St. John's wort as the herbal rival to Pro zac, noting that in Germ any it ou tsells Prozac fo ur to one (Richte r 2003). But the b est poss ible public ity is positiv e results from clinical tr ials. If the research is d one at a p restigious institution, all th e better. Alth ough echinacea has con sisten tly led herbal sales since 1995, it was not until 2003 that it becam e the subject of clinical trials funded by the National Institu tes of Health (N IH; Richter 20 03). The Center for Dietary Supplem ents Research at the University of Ca lifornia, Los A ngeles, received NIH support to conduct pilo t research on specific immune-enha ncing actions of echinacea, and Iowa State University, in collabo ration with the University of Iowa, received a 5-year NIH-funded grant to establish a botanical center to study both echinacea and St. John's wort. This and other research results, some of which is repor ted in the A ppendix to this volu me, provide both positive and negativ e findings on the efficacy of the use of echinacea p roducts. The ef fect of publicity r esulting f rom positive results of clinical tr ials on echinac ea sales could be profound. It is important to stay in form ed about any ongoing or planned research or clinical trials involving wild-harvested E. angustifolia root or other wild echinacea species 158because pos itive results could lead to increase d dem and and increas ed price, thereby causing wild harvesting to sharply increase. Another con sidera tion re lated to the f uture m arket is the incr easing intere st of insurance companies and m anaged-care organ ization s in reimbursing use of herbal products. Th is will probably be key to widespread use an d acceptance of herbal p roducts. Richter (2003 ) notes th at \"health insurance rarely covers consultations on herbal m edicines or the products them selves. Even individuals who are aware of botanical treatm ents m ay not be able to afford to pay out of pocket f or them.\" At a tim e when so m any Am ericans canno t afford health insurance, the lower- cost botanical treatm ent alternat ive m ay beco me increasing releva nt. If major m edical insuranc e companies acknowledge the savings and begin to c over visits to naturopaths and other herbal consultants as well as reim bursem ents for the he rbs they pres cribe, the market for ech inacea products would likely significantly increase. In 1997, Dr. Larry Kincheloe in Oklahom a City did a sm all survey of the cost savings associated w ith usag e of botanical medicin e instead of pharmaceuticals in his clinic. H is conservative estim ate showed a savings in di rect yearly drug costs of between $500,000 and $750,000 fo r his clinic, which cont racts to cover 60,000 m embers of an HMO (Kincheloe 1999). As of 1998, a few of the com panies covering ac upuncture, naturopathy, and chiropractic care also covered reim bursement for doctor-prescribe d nutritional supplem ents, including botanicals. American Specialty Health Plans of San Diego, CA, for example, covers a com plete line of Chinese herbal form ulas. In great part, it was consu mers dem anding unr estricted access to botan icals that sh aped the Dietary Supplem ent Health and Education A ct of 1994 (DSHEA). That sam e political force 159may drive major insuran ce com panies to provi de coverage for herbal and ho meopathic consultations and products. It is clear that the m arket and the influe nces of research findings and publicity on the market will determ ine th e future demand for echin acea. Because there is a long his tory of safe use of echin acea, becaus e som e research does sho w effectiveness, becaus e there is cu rrent NIH research on its efficacy, and because there is already an industry built on wild harvest and cultivation, it is hard to im agine a fut ure marketin g scenario th at would not include echinacea in it.

Available online at http://www.who.int/m ediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/ , accessed March 14, olia and and Maggie Riggs Although Echinacea purpurea is easily grown from seed, and m any gardeners grow it, E. angustifo lia is notoriously hard to germ inate and labor intensive to cultiva te. For th ese reasons, cultivation o f E. angustifolia has h istorica lly and prim arily be en lim ited to colle ctors of medicinal plants on a very sm all scale. However, by 1991, a handful of co mmercial plantings were in place (Foster 1991 ), but th e suitability of cu ltivated E. angustifo lia to replace wild-harv ested roots of the same species had not been established. Many peopl e believed that the wild-harv ested roots were better. As we learned fro m an Echinacea roo t broker, one buy er of roots recently cancelled an order for 40, 000 pounds of cultivated E. angustifo lia, asserting that it takes f ive tim es more of the cultivated ro ots than wild root s to supply the de sired resu lts. Although E. angustifo lia and E. purpurea both have a well-docum ented history of use for a variety of medicin al protocols, no co nsensus exis ts about which active co nstitu ents are respons ible for their efficacy. Som e secondary com pounds can be increased by certain agricu ltural practices (El-Gangaihi et al 1998, Berbec et al 1998), yet the m edical co mmunity does not know of any compound o r group of co mpounds for which selec tion is a known bene fit. Adding to the difficulties o f supplying cultivated ro ots for co mmerce, m edicinal com ponents of cultivated E. angustifo lia roots vary considerably fro m harvest to harvest. Depending on seed stock, soil type, time of planting, viab ility of seed, m oisture st-ha rvest h andling, cons tituent levels rise and fall. Additionally, it takes 3-4 years before E. angustifo lia roots can be harvested, during which time the m arket and goin g price can change rad ically. Several large comm ercial growers have shied away from future plantings of E. angustifolia and pref er to stick with the cultiva tion of E. 162purpurea , which is m uch easie r to g row, consider ably le ss lab or intensive, and has no commercially significan t wild-harv ested equiv alent. By analyzing the natural growing conditions of E. angustifo lia, we m ay learn what ef fect surviving in rocky lim estone soils through persis tent drought and long, to ugh winters play in the chem ical composition of wild Echina cea. Growers typic ally try to em ulate natura l con ditions in their planting schem es, so how does one duplicate the qualities of the wild-harves ted roots in cultivation ? The f ollowing overview of cultiva ting techniqu es for E. purpurea and E. angustifo lia, the m ain species of comm erce, is intended to s timulate dialo gue and further res earch. Perhaps, in the future, c ultivated E. angustifo lia will satisfy a portion of the m arket dem ands for this popular medicinal plant. Seed Choice It is im portant to beg in with pure liv e seed . If you gather your ow n seed, collect cone heads that easily release their achenes or seeds. If the achen es are difficult to dislod ge from the head, the s eeds are p robably imm ature. The ideal time for collecting seed s in north ern states is a week or two before or after the first hard f rost. S eed m aturation in Kansas and Nebraska tends to be a f ew weeks la ter tha n in the no rthern sta tes. If seeds are h arvested prem aturely, it is lik ely that none will be viable. Check som e of th e seeds you are collecting by breaking open the achenes and exam ining the seeds. If most of th e achenes are em pty or the seeds look shriveled, they are probably not viable and will not germ inate. Another reason to delay seed harvesting is to collect less debris. The brown floret s that are attached to each seed will wither and f all off the head if harv est is d elayed. The seeds are also rele ased as th e cones dry, so harvest in dry weather, or collect th e head and s hake them when dry. 163Collect your seeds from several different plants, as viab ility varies f rom plant to plan t. If possible, collect from different sites of the sam e species to increase the genetic diversity of your future stand (Cech 2002). You m ust be sure that you are harvesting the sa me species and also that there are no stands of other Echinacea species in th e vicinity. Store y our seeds in a cool dry place, p referably not for more than 6 months. Howe ver, if placed in co ld storage, seed s should remain viable for about 60 m onths (Foster 1991). If you are p urchasing seeds, first decide if you want seeds fro m wild or cu ltivated sources. Co mmercial seed has his torically been co llected fro m wild stan ds, but cultivated seed sources are readily available. (See Table 1). Depending on growing conditions, wild seeds m ay reflect the dry conditions typical in J uly and A ugust, lik ely resulting in more dried or shriveled seeds or em pty achene s. Seeds f rom cultivated sta nds are m ore likely to b e filled ou t, ref lecting adequate m oisture and nutrients during the ti me they were developing. If you choose wild- harvested seeds, try to make sure that the seeds w ere harvested in a sustainable m anner. When purchasing seeds, the buyer should establ ish that s eeds have been tested for purity and viability. Require 90% or be tter pure live seed, a precise id entification of seed source, and certified verification of species. The buyer can eas ily test for em pty achenes by crushing seeds of a representative sam ple with a fingernail and looking for live m oist endosperm . The b uyer m ight ask if the seller is aware of the South Dakota State University germ ination protocol, which is described below. Find a seed com pany that has expertise in working with wild species and experience cleaning seed s. Ask when the seeds w ere harvested and how they have been stored. Suggestions for seed sources are also listed at the end of this chapter. W holesale seed prices for E. angustifo lia have ranged fro m $170 to $750 per pound. The price of seed for E. purpurea is considerably less, available for around $24/pound. There are approxim ately 145,000 seeds in 1 164pound of E. angustifo lia seeds, and approxim ately 117,000 seeds in 1 pound of E. pur purea seeds. Seed Germination and Stratifica tion One basic obstacle facing fiel d cultivation is poor and errati c seed germ ination. In order to germ inate, seeds m ust be viable. Research conducted by Richard Littl e (1998) at South Dakota State Unive rsity on se ed viability ind icates tha t low test-weig ht seed m ight indicate th at seeds within the achenes are undeveloped or m issing altogether. Test weights above 200 g-cm-3 should be fairly free of em pty achenes. In early ex periments it was o bserved th at heavier seed germ inated at a greater rate th an ligh t seed. Em pty achenes w ere an obv ious cause of the low germ ination rate of lighter seed. Damaged or und eveloped em bryos could also contribute to the lower germ ination rate s of lighter se ed. Little also observed during his research on germ ination of E. angustifolia seed that there is evidence that so me populations have inherently low er germ ination rates. Ge rmination of seeds from one South Dakota location has been consistently 30% lower than seeds fro m a second South Dakota location (Little1998). Germ ination also varies by species. For exam ple, the percentage a nd speed of ger mination of six lots of E. purpurea were unaffected by seed weight or light (W artidiningsih and Geneve 1994a, 1994b). Because Echinacea seed s are em bryo dorm ant, they require a period of cold, m oist stratification for optim um germ ination. In the wild, seeds would be exposed to tem perature extrem es and varying m oisture conditions. Th ere are several m ethods of s imulating the conditions of winter and spring th at cause the seed covering to break open in the wild. Several varia tions w ill be pres ented in this s ection, beginning with th e recomm endations f rom South Dakota State University (SDSU). 165 The protocol established at SDSU descri bes placing seeds on blotter paper m oistened with a solution m ade from 3 gram s Ethrel per ga llon of distille d water. The moistened b lotter paper is placed in covered plastic seed boxes w ith transparent friction t ops. The boxes are placed under continuous light (75-200 foot candles, co ol-white fluorescent lam ps) in a cold environm ent (2-6\u00baC) for 14 days followed by placing the seed boxes under continuous light (400-700 foot candles, warm and c ool fluorescent lamps) at 25\u00baC. Using this protocol, researchers found that seedlings we re ready to transplant to the field within 9 weeks after placing them on blotter paper; over 95% of viable seeds germ inated. An advantage of this protocol was that a ll seedlings were th e sam e size when transp lanted to the field. A detailed accoun t of this protocol is described in Feghahati and Reese (1994). Foster (1991) describes a m ethod that entails placing seeds in a m ix of san d and peat and placing them outdoors (covered with a m esh screen to keep critters out) and left over the winter. Another m ethod described by Foster is to place seeds in m oist but not wet sand (or peat) in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 60-90 days, which he finds is adequate under household rather than laboratory conditions. Then rinse the sand o ff the seeds in a strainer with fine enough m esh to retain the seeds, but large e nough to let the sand pass through. In a study done as part of a doctoral disserta tion at Vanderbilt University in 1976 (cited in Foster 1991), Tho mas E. He mmerly showed that the longer the st ratification period w as (up to 4 months), the less im portant tem peratu re becam e as a factor in seed germ ination. Ligh t was found to stim ulate germ ination, but it was le ss signif icant than tem peratur e or s tratification. H emmerly determ ined that the op timum temperature for germ inating Echinacea seed under light is around 20-25\u00baC (about 68-79\u00baF ). 166 Smith-Jochum (1987) showed that 1-month st ratification in peat m oss or sand, followed by soaking for 24 hours in water, showed signifi cantly higher germ ination rates than 2-month stratification in sand or peat m oss followed by soaking for 24 hours in potassium nitrate or treatm ent with gibberelic acid. Th ere is a th eory that the Ech inacea seed h arbors a water-so luble germ ination inhibitor that natura lly leaches out during the winter snow-and-thaw cycles and that soaking th e seeds until a certain osm otic pressur e is ach ieved, then redu a predeterm ined level, m germ ination. However, Little (1998) at SDSU fou no evidence of this water-s oluble germ ination inhibitor in his research. Higher germ ination rates were also achieved simply by soaking the seeds in water p rior to stratification. Presoaking the seeds fo r 24 hours im proved germ ination com pared to moistening the seeds only at the tim e of stratifi cation, presum ably allowin g increased water imbibitions (Sari, 1999).For a recent review of stra tification requirem ents without the use of ethylene, see Parm enter et al. (1996). Direct Seed ing of Unstratified Seed s Unstratified seeds are best sown directly into th e field or ga rden in the f all, allowing f or a period of exposure to cold, m oist outdoor conditions to naturally break seed dorm ancy. A fine seedbed along with a dressing of ground lim estone directly under the row enhances chances of germ ination. Bed prepara tion and s eed sowing is of ten easie r in the au tumn when the s oils are relatively dry. Be advised though: direct seeding is a challenge, even to the m ost experienced grower, owing to fluctuations in weather and other factors. Alterna tively, unstra tified seeds can be sown into flats or p lug trays in an unheated greenhouse (or outdoors in the shade protected by screen) in Februa ry, the ideal soil tem perature 167being a cool 55-60\u00baF. E. angustifo lia and other species with taproots m ust be planted in deep pots or \"con etainers\" so that the roo t will not touc h the bottom of the conta iner bef ore transp lantin g. b est to transp lant tap-rooted species in the fledgling s tage. These plants should be ready to transplant into th e field by May (Cech 2003). Most germ ination failures can be trace d to plan ting in soils tha t are too wa rm, which lowers the ge rmination rate even when the seeds h ave been ar tificially stratified (Cech 20 03). E. purpurea germ inates readily in a cool greenhouse without stratification, but germ ination of the other species is improved by at least 30 days of freezing conditions. Planting seeds on top of the soil and tam ping them down ont o the surface without soil cover will generally yield the best germ ination, as light m ay aid the germination process. Seeds tamped into the soil will germ inate in approxi mately 5 days, but when covered with only 1/8 inch of soil, germ ination can take between 2-4 weeks (Foster 1991). Space seeds 2 inches apart in rows 18- 24 inches ap art. E. angus tifolia are best thinn ed to 8 inches ap art, while sp ecies with a fibrous roo t, such as E. purpurea, are optim ally placed 1-2 f eet apart in the row. By the autum n of the first y ear, plants b ecom e self-mulching. It is possible to propagate Echinacea by di viding and transplanting the cro wns, but sin ce this is not feasible for a field -scale op eration, it will not be discussed here. . Transplanting Echinacea p refers to g row in full or part sun, bu t E. purpurea is som etimes found in lowland, rip arian areas, which are of ten par tially shaded. There are several advantages to transplanting seedlings over direct s eeding . E. a ngustifo lia seed is exp ensive and is u sed m ore efficiently by transplanting. Slow-growing E. angustifo lia will not com pete well with weeds, and solid-seeded beds m ay be m ore diffi cult to weed . It is eas ier to m ulch a space-p lanted crop than a 168direct-seeded one, as placing straw or m ulch around uniform ly emerging plants is m uch easier than m ulching around rando m, direct-seeded plants. If you choose to transplant, do as m uch soil preparation in the fall as possible to be prepared for transp lantin g the ne xt spring. Building beds or ri dges, laying landscape fabric, and seeding a p erennial cover crop in wh eel tracks can all be acco mplished in August or Septem ber (Cech 2003). Soils Ideal so ils for E. purpurea have a pH value between 6 and 7. E. angustifolia prefers more alkaline conditions with a pH value between 6.5 and 8. Although sandy loam, rocky clay, and limestone su bstrates hav e all b een kn own to support healthy p opulations o f Echinacea (Cech 2003), it is imperative that E. angustifolia be grown in well-drained so ils. Species with fibrous roots, such as E. purpurea , are be tter adapted to g rowing in po orly drained situations. G iven that the soil is w ell drained, abundant moisture improves overall plant si ze, health, and seed production, but there are questions as to whether drought cycles increase levels of beneficial constituents in the roots. Generally, dry, low- nitrogen soils produce hi gher concentrations of essential oils, while m oist, nitrogen-rich soils produce high levels of alkaloids (Foster 1991). Fertiliz ation Side dressing with organic com post and co mposted m anures increases drought tolerance and overa ll health of the plant. Dilute f oliar f eeds, manure tea, and seaweed tea also improve plant health and yield (Cech 2003) . Since fertilization and time of harvest appear to have the greatest effect on the che mical com position of cu ltivated Ech inacea, howe ver, it is im portan t to keep accu rate reco rds of all app lications when marketing to m edicinal manufacturers . There are severa l interesting examples of specif ic fertiliz ation regim es affecting a particular chem ical 169constituent. When Dr. Rudolf Bauer tested sa mples of both wild-harvested and cultivated E. angustifo lia from several locations in Kansas, which were collected in March 1998, he found that the application of biodynam ic compost resulted in isobutylam ide leve chart\" (pers. comm., Terry Pitts, Sterling, KS, far October 1998). There was a variance fro m .2% in the wild -harvested E. an gustifo lia root to >2.3 % in the s ample root f rom cultivated E. angustifo lia, which had been fertilized with biodyna mic compost. The plants treated with biodynam ic com post also had a m ore balanced pH of 7.2, wh ich was attr ibuted to the buffering of the com post. Com pared to wild -harvested plants, the cultivated E. ang ustifo lia plants fertilized with biodynam ic com post also had the lowe st levels of echinacosides. In other analysis, El-Gangaih i et al. (1998) found that increas ing ni trogen and p otassium via fertilization will alter alkyl am ides. Berbec et al. (1998) reported that differences in soil type (sandy vs. loamy) and fertilization also had an im pact on the presence and am ounts of phenolic acid com pounds. This study looked at the composition of chlor ogen ic, caffeic, and ferulic acids . Mulching If you are direct seeding E. angustifo lia, it is im portan t to keep mulch light and loose since E. ang ustifo lia requires light for germ ination. One suggested m ethod is to sow seed into wheat stubble in the fall and to flai l-chop the stubble to provide m ulch. Disease and Insect Pro blems Bringing Echinacea into production h as resu lted in increased disease and plant p roblem s, compared to wild stands. Although mulches will help retain m oisture and reduce weeds, they might cause insect and disease problem s. One gr ower has reported aphid problem s whe re wheat sprang up us ing wheat s traw m ulch. A grower in British Co lumbia noted a high inc idence of cutworm s only where n ewspapers were used as mulch. A grower in Iow a used black plastic 170mulch that he claim ed caused roots to rot while nearby plants without plas tic were rot-free. Air circulation under landscape fabric should prevent this problem. E. purpurea appears to b e the m ost susceptible o f all Echinac ea spec ies to aster y ellows, causing the stem to becom e yellow to red in co lor. As the dis ease prog resses, the flow ers stop producing seeds and beco me leafy. This disease is spread by leafhoppers and appears to develop over a year or two. W here som e growers have controlled dis ease spread by rem oving infected plants as soo n as they are identified to prevent spread of the disease, oth er growers hav e reported near com plete loss es in a reas of heav y infestation . Resistan t cultivars are not available, and control of the diseases can onl y be achieved by controlling le afhoppers (Sari et al. 1999). Wilt, or blig ht (Fusarium oxysporum ), causes the for mation of dark tissues along the leaf edges that eventually die. W ilting of the shoots is also ev ident. If you cut through the stem s or roots near their base, the tissues contain dark blotches in and around the vascular system . This has been observed only in wetter soils or during wet years. Weed Control Weeds can be controlled by m ulching, hand pul ling, and hoeing and cultivation. Attempts to cultivate with a tracto r and row-crop cultiv ator are often un successful b ecause s tems easily break off at the base. Herbicides are not labeled for use on E. angustifo lia, nor do organic certifiers ap prove them . Harvest an d Storage When plants are grown from seeds, it m ay take 3-4 years for roots to reach harvestable size (Foster 1991). Som e growers obs erve that older cultivated E. purpurea roots m ay becom e pithy and w oody, but the taproots of E. angustifo lia grow larger and deeper the longer they are in the ground. Tops of flo wering E. purpurea can be harvested the second year. 171 Fall is the b est tim e to harvest roots when the moistur e content is lower. A sturdy sp ade, pick ax, or modified potato digger are a few of th e tools developed to lift the roots. Roots should be cleaned with water and a brus h or a power hose and piled in the shade. Large crow ns should be broken apart in order to allow access to dirt. The roots can be dried in open air under sh ade or under low forced heat or fans (Cech 2003). An herb dryer set at 110\u00b0 F degrees is also effective, and faster. T aproots are usually dried whole, but the fibrous roots ( E. purpurea ) are best dried in p ieces. Dry th e roots un til they snap, and store the roots in plastic ba gs in a cool, dark location. There is a growing dem and for the tops of flowering E. purpurea . Echinacea leaf and flower are b est harv ested at the p eak of floweri ng, which is usually in m idsummer. The stem s are cut jus t abov e the firs t discolored leaves of the rosette, and th e leaf and flower are s tripped from stem and used fresh or dehydrated. The flowers must be split at least once before drying, or they will rehydrate from internal m oisture once put in to storage (Cech 2003). It is known that tim e of harvest (season) affects alkam ide levels. Sam ples collected in June will b e different f rom sam ples collec ted in October or Novem ber. Fall ha rvest seem s to produce both greater quantity and quality of essen tial oil (se e Smith and Jochum 's studies, c ited in -Foster [1991],p. 78). The tim e of day a plant is harvested can also affect the quality of chem ical constitu ents an d concentrations in vario us plant p arts, as can we ather conditions (Foster 1991). In his notes reg arding chem ical tests on cultiv ated angus roots, Bauer (1999) reco rds that, in o rder to d raw general con clusions, it would be necessary to exam ine samples of plants that were harvested in the sam e year of gr owth, dried by the sam e process, using uniform mode and length of storage. 172 Not only does cultivatio n affect chem ical cons tituents, bu t so does tre atment of harvested material. Fo r exam ple, E. angustifolia contain s a glucosid e and an e ssential oil, both of potential pharm acological signif icance. Slow drying will r etain the es sential oil, bu t quick d rying will he lp retain higher quantities o f the glucoside since en zymes presen t in th e plan t will rapidly hydrolyze them . Conclusion In spite of th e fact that th ere is consid erably more practica l information availab le in 20 03 than a decade ago, growing E. angustifolia remains a challen ge. Growers cultivating for commerce should research m arkets well (see the Ma rkets chapter, in this volum e), be critical when choosing seeds, and take care with harves ting procedures. It is also a good idea to becom e \"certified organic\" before planting in order to assure your harvested E. angustifo lia roots are suitable for the health food m arket. Begin slowly when growing E. angustifo lia, learn from your mistakes, and then expand your operations. Keep detailed growing and ha rvest records and, if possible, have harvested roots and flowers test ed for pharm acologically active constituents. In this way, gr owers will c ontinue to c orrelate p rocess with r esults and s ecure the f uture market f or cultivated E chinacea.

Price No com prehensive long-term data ex ists on wild populations of ech inacea. The effects of harvesting are not fully understood. We have set up a m odel for m onitoring wild echinacea populations. This m onitoring will help to determ ine the im pact future wild harvesting has on Echinacea populations. We present an overview of the first year's survey of Echinacea angustifo lia stands on private lands in Kansas and on the Little Missour i Nationa l Gras slands in North Dakota as an example of a monitoring program . Echinacea a ngustifo lia was a natural choice for this in itial study because it is the m ost widely harvested wild echinacea species and the most econo mically im portan t.. Its wide distribution throughout the Gr eat Plains allows for a larger sa mple size than is possible with other species of wild echinacea such as E. tennesseensis or E. atrorubens . Monitoring echinacea h arvesters ' work is im practical because the region of harvest is large and harvesters are num erous when the price for echinacea roo ts is high. Theref ore, we m ust rely on population surveys and reported sales of ech inacea roots to estim ate harvest activity. The study requ ires data d enough to reliably m easure popu lation ch anges for each plant size class, and for the entire populat ion. This inform ation can be useful for estim ating the total population size, estim ating the su stainable yield of the roots, and com paring responses of different populations to cha nging environm ental conditions. In order to monitor pop ulations of echinacea species, the study em ploye d a sim ple monitoring schem e that involved team s of two p eople who counted plants in perm anent m arked plots. W ith som e flexibility, th is plan can be easily applied to m onitoring the other eight echinacea sp ecies as well. 177Terms Site: A stud y area in the field that in cludes a pop ulation of echinacea. The 20 sm all plots at a site are used to estim ate infor mation about the population at th e site as a whole. Plot: The sm all, 1 m x 1m study area in which all echinacea plants are counted. There are 20 plots located at each s ite. Population : The assemblage of individual echin acea plants f ound at a site. These plants may or m ay not be genetically isol ated fro m other nearby populations. Patch: The area at a s ite on which a chosen dense stand of echinacea p lants grows. Methodology During the su mmer of 2 002, team s of workers from the University of Kansas established plots a t four dif ferent site s in north -central Kansas and f our addition al sites in southwes t North Dakota. These eigh t sites were selected because th ey have a h istory of wild harvest on private land in Kansas, and on federal land in North Da kota--the Little Missour i Nationa l Gras slands) . In North Dakota, three sites were chosen in the v icinity of Medora and Stony Butte. In Kansas, the sites chosen were in th e vicin ity of Plainsville, Codell, and N atoma. Specific site selection w as based on density of echinacea pop ulations and ease of access. Proxim ity to perm anent, m an-made structures (e.g., fence lines, telephon e poles, road signs) was also considered as it m ade m arking and relocating plots easier. For each ech inacea p atch, the observ ers reco rded s igns of harv est or o ther disturb ance, a description of the soil, the slope and aspect of the patch, a notati on of surrounding dom inant vegetation, and a clear descri ption of the site location re ferencing GPS and triangulation readings. A sam ple data sheet has b een includ ed as a m odel (see Table 1 ). Sites were also marked on a topographic m ap. All project notes we re typed soon after fieldwork. Twenty plots 178per site were established. Based on Kansas Echinacea angustifolia data co llected by D ana Pric e Hurlburt in 1996-1998 for her dissertation (Hurl burt, 1999), twenty plots per site were determ ined suf ficient as suf ficient sa mple size. This num ber of plots will allow res earchers to detect a change in population size fro m one year to the next of 10% or great er, with greater than 90% certainty and a less than 10% fals e-chang e error rate (see Table 2). Plot size was 1m2, and m etric units were used for m easurement as they are consid ered the scientific and internationa l standard. This size is large enough so that m ost plots will include at least som e plants. At each site these plots were p laced at 5m intervals alo ng a 100m measuring tape so that they can easily be found again. For o dd-shaped p opulations o f echinacea, two or three sho rter-leng th trans ects were us ed. To determ ine the starting point for each tr ansect, field surveyors observed the population to assess the general shape of the patch, choosin g a line through it. Starting points were located a random distance and a f ew meters away fro m a fen ce or perm anent post to avoid cattle trails and overgrazing, which are comm on adjacent to fenc es. Having decided on th e starting po int, surveyors th en identified two perm anent fixed objects nearby to use as the other two points for triangulation . I recomm end using points on a fence line b ecause they are easy to lo cate, but any obvious lan dmark is suitable. S teel posts are al so recomm ended because they do not rot and can be added if other obvious landm arks are not available. I sugg est m arking both triangulation points with spray paint for easy relocation. W e spray painted the top 1/3 of the steel posts. For a full list of supplies n eeded for the work, see Tab le 3. Surveyors th en ran sep arate m easurin g tapes from each of the two fixed objects to th e starting po int. The exac t star ting po int is where th ese two tap es met to f orm a triang le. At that point, a piece of steel rebar, about 1 foot long with a brightly colo red plastic tape tied to its top 179end, was hammered into the ground, designating th e exact starting point. This can be located with a m etal detec tor up on return to the site, pr oviding definite confirm ation of the starting point. Clear descriptions of the fixed triang ulation point s, distan ces from each tr iangulation point to the starting point, a m ap showing thes e three points and their relationshi p to the road, or th e feature, and GPS (Global Positioning System ) coordinates were recorded in the field notes. Although the resea rch tea m recorded GPS data, most globa l position ing system units do not curr ently of fer the accuracy needed to lo cate a plot with in inches or centim eters. Hopefully th at will chan ge in the near future, and GPS data can then b e used to easily es tablish and re locate plots. This GPS location inf ormation was late r transf erred to a f ield data f ile. (The reason a tall ste el post is no t just pounded in at the starting point is because ca ttle tend to rub against the post and disturb the site. Also steel rebar is pounded flush with the ground so that it is no t tripped on and m oved by cattle or v ehicles.). From this starting point, a 100m tape measure was laid out in the direction that passes through m ost of the patch (Note: the aim is to sample the population by random ly locating plots in the population. ). A compass was used to dete rmine the direction of the line, and this was record ed in the field notes. Flags were placed alo ng the 100m tape at 5m intervals, th e first being the starting point. At each flag, a 1m x 1 m plot frame, made of 1 inch PVC pipe held together with elbow joints and glue, was placed alongs ide and on the right side of the tape. Field surveyors w alked along the left side of the tape to avoid trampling vegetation in the study plots. At every plo t, a GPS m easurem ent was taken and record ed. A 10\" long piece of \u00bd\" diam eter rebar with plastic flagging tape tied to its top was pounded into the ground. The ends of the plastic tape and a centim eter of the steel rebar were left sticking out of the ground. This 180system , used in conjunc tion with a metal (an inexp ensive m odel is suf ficient) will a llow for locating plots m ore easily in f uture years. One team mem ber walked the perimeter of each patch taking GPS m easurem ents. These measure ments were later used in conjunction wi th mapping software to determ ine the size and location of the patch. Where th ere w as a dis tinct line a t the e dge of the echinacea patch, the surveyor followed it. In areas where there was no clear line, the surve yor m ade a judgm ent call and walked along the edge of the pa tch encircling the vast majority of plants and the entire dense patch. For the actual process of r ecording data, we found that two people working together improved the quality of work. W hen available, a third and fourth team mem ber increased efficiency, p articularly in laying out the plo ts. Of ten the se extra te am members were in charg e of laying tapes, taking GPS read ings, and m arking plots. Plants were divided into five size classes using calipers, as per Dana Price's dissertation (Hurlburt,1999), and plant sizes were recorded on data sheets . The size of the roo t crown was measured for each echin acea plant u sing caliper s and reco rded on data sh eets as well. Size classe s were determ ined as f ollows: Seedlings: Small, identified by cotyledons , which persist into summer. Small : Pre-productive plants with root crown le ss than 3 mm diam eters, rarely having multiple ste ms per crown, and not f lowering. Medium: Root crown measuring 3-5 mm diameters. Large: Root crown greater than 5 m m diam eters. Dormant or dead plants: can be recorded when re-sam pling occurs. 181Data sheets were prepared in advance. A copy of the sheet used to record data has been included (Table 4). The n umber of plants in each o f the size classes and th e num ber of fl owering individu als in each plo t were tallied. Plants ro oted in the p lot, whether or not the tops lie completely in the plo t, were coun ted \"in,\" whereas all those rooted outside the plo t, eve n if they overhung th e plot, were considered \"out\" and not counted. In som e cases a single echinacea plant will occasio nally fork from its underground caud ex, and it was counted \"in\" if the m ajority of the crown was in the plo t. In these cases, where separa te individuals grew very close to one another, underground probing revealed whether the stem s were connected to one root or two, and thus were counted by the nu mber of roots. In additio n, for each p lot, plant co ver estim ates up to 100 % were taken f or the following categories: bare ground, grass, forbs, woody plants, and echinacea plants. Species other than echin acea were listed individually. Results Results f rom our baseline data co llection in Kansas and North Dakota in the summ er of 2002 show an average density of 11.05 E. angustifolia plants per square m eter in North Dakota (Table 5) to 12.59 E. angustifo lia plants per squ are meter in Kansas (Tab le 6), with den sity as high as 20 p lants p er meter. The ratio of sm all to large p lants is noticeab ly high, approxim ately 6:1. W e do not know if this is do to the fact that most sm all plants never m ake it to maturity or whether past harvests are having an effect on popul ation. Data for species cover of echinacea and all other sp ecies are in T able 7 f or North Dakota and Table 8 for Kansas. Continued sam pling over the next few years would help clarify the population dynam ics of echinacea species at this site or an y other. Id eally, every plot should be sam pled every year as this would m ake it easier to identify signs of current harvesting, but even periodic sampling would be useful. Sites should be inf ormally m onitored on a more frequent basis so m easure ments 182can be tak en after yea rs of particu larly heavy ha rvest It is importan t to create da ta she ets with species previously observed and m aps before one return s to th e field for u nexpected s ampling. Since our initial observations are the only firm data we currently have, we need repeated measurem ents to be able to dete rmine what sustainable harvesting param eters m ight be. W e believe these observations should be applied to all species of Echinacea , even those without the econom ic importance and harvest pressure of E. angustifo lia, since m any species of echinacea are confused with E. angustifo lia and harvested mistak enly.

To do this, we f irst used th e statistica l figures: 1-B = .90: 90% sure of m issing a false change a = .10: 10% chance of m issing a change that happens Using the most reasonable of possible standard deviations from Price's data, we need 11 plots in order to detect the cha nge. With 20 plots we would be ab le to sta tistically d etect an average change of 1.16 plants per square m eter, which is about 7% in Price's study. Permutations Using the best of the standa rd deviations, we would tech nically need only 4 plots. 20 plots allow us to detect a change of .2 plants per plot (about 2% in Pri ce's data, but 4% if we only averag e 5 plants/m2). Using the \"worst\" of the standard deviations (which includes som e incom plete data and seedling data and were not a pplicable), we would need 53 plots. Using this standard deviation, however, we would need only 14 plots to note a 20% ch ange, so 20 plots was deem ed to be the m ost useful. Using the \"reasonable\" standard deviation value, we would need 17 plots to increase our power to .95 and decrease alpha to .05.

Many of these co llectors ha rvest f rom the wild in la rge qu antities (hundreds of thousands of plants) for commercial markets in the United States and abroad. For exam ple, during th e last few years, about 65 million goldens eal plan ts and 34 m illion ginseng plants have been harvested fro m the wild in the forests of the eastern United States on an annual basis (Robbins 1999). The sale of low er pine branch es to form rope for wreaths and garlands has been estim ated at $1.5 million, black walnut at $2.5 million, and ginseng at $18.5 m illion dollars a year (Chamberlain et al. 2002). T he comm ercial value of special forest products in the Pacific Northwest m ay be in excess of $190 m illion (Vance et al. 2001). Black cohosh was identified in 1998 as one of the fastest growing herbal products with an annual increase of over 511 percent from sales in 1997. Between 300,000 and 500,000 pounds of black cohosh root were wild collected in 2001 (Schlosser 2002). Over 85,000 people en ter the pub lic forest each y ear to collect plan t material and mushroom s for their ow n personal u se (Vance et al. 2001). Considering the high level of harvesting that occu rs on public lan ds, especia lly in the na tional f orests, it is im portant to maintain f orest com plexity, ecosys tem health, and species diversity by protecting plants and fungi fro m over-harvest. Not only does such protecti on help m aintain healthy, usable forests, but it also engages m embers of the public who repres ent all of the values for which public forest lands are m anaged. The harvest of Echinacea species and legal efforts to protect them provide a case study f or such involvem ent. 195 Millions of echinacea ro ots have been wild harvested over the last d ecade. The averag e harvest of Echinacea an gustifo lia alone was 155,000 pounds per year from 1997 to 2001 (American Herbal Products Associati on 2003), and this does not include other Echinacea species that we know have been wild harvested. W e know fro m weighing echinacea roots in the field that there are about 100 roots in a pound of dried echinacea root , which would m ean that an average of 15.5 million E. angustifo lia roots have been harvested per year fro m 1997 to 2001, and that's ju st one spec ies. It is this v ery high dem and and ha rvest that has driven the discussion of the need for laws to p rotect agai nst the over-harvest of wild echinacea. The Need for Law s to Protect Medicinal Plan ts Almost every country in the world is expe riencing increasing popul ation and agricultural expansion, resulting in h abitat degradati on and d eforestation (Ham ilton and Schm itt 2000). Poverty places further pressure on na tural resou rces. Inadequ ate land-use planning and law enforcem ent are prob lems for all nations trying to preserve native pl ants. O ver-harvest of medicinal plants sign ificantly af fects plant diversity and conservation. Wild ginseng was once naturally abundant in hard m aple forests throughout southern Ontario and Quebec. The entire population of wild ginseng is now greatly reduced owing to both poaching and wildcrafting. The same is true fo r the wild leek population. In Quebec, it is difficult to find either wild ginseng or wild l eeks in m ost forests, and both species are n ow considered threatened or endangered (Ontar io Ministry of Agriculture and Food 2000). In the Unite d States, h abitat loss and f ragmentation lead th e list of obstruc tions to plan t conservation. For Echinacea angustifolia , the most widely h arvested echinacea species in the wild, private land ownership is th e prim ary protection offered this species. But in its no rthern 196range, huge tracts of private and public lands becam e easy targets for over-harvesting in the late 1990s becau se of lack of fencing, lack of m onitoring, and low law-enforcem ent capability. A concern for the adv erse influences on the ecological functions of our medicinal plant resources\u2014such as interactions betw een polli nators and plant populations, or am ong wildlife, food, and habitat\u2014and prom otion of sustainabl e harvest practices and techniques can im bue persons with an attitude of stew ardship. General harvest guidelines that take into account proper plant identification, harvester responsibiliti es, techniques that m inimize disturbance, and observation im pacts over tim e can all work to protect these resources. U nfortunately , stewardsh ip of echinacea is probl ematic in that harvest details and sustainable am ounts of echinacea harvest are not fully known, which is why legal protection has been suggested. Federal Regulation an d La ws Related to Plan t Species In the United States, m ost governm ent landow ners (U.S. Forest Serv ice, and Bureau of Land Managem ent and the state) require both commercial and noncommercia l harvesters to ask for perm ission to dig, collect, or harvest plant material, with so me exceptions given for personal use. That is, perm its are needed for comm ercial h arvest, and p ersonal u se perm its are technically for personal use. W ithin the US Forest Service, echinacea would be cons idered an \"o ther forest product\" or \"non-tim ber forest product\" and woul d require a perm it for commercial collection. U.S. Forest Service po licies and p lans, includ ing those spec ified in th is chapte r, are m eant to be cons istent with a ll state or triba l laws, treaties, and regulations th at influence m anagem ent of special forest product resources. T hat is, the intention is to ensure that policies on special forest products are developed in complianc e with all app licable laws and r egulations. There is as well a concern for perso nal, subsistence, comm ercial, scientif ic, and rec reation al use of National Forest System lands. 197U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service The U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service is th e principal federal agency responsible for conserving, protecting, and enha ncing fish, wildlif e, and plants and the ir habitats for the continu ing benefit of the Am erican p eople. In addition to m anaging the 9 5-million-ac re Nation al Wildlife Refuge System , which encompasses near ly 540 national w ildlife refuges, thousands of small wetlands, and other special m anagem ent areas, the service also operates 70 national fish hatcheries, 64 fishery resource offices, and 78 ecological services field stations. The agency enforces federal wildlife laws, adm inisters the Endangered Species Act, manages m igratory bird populations, restores nationally signif icant fisheries, conserves and restores wildlife habitat such as wetlands, and helps foreign govern ments with their conservation efforts. The key to protecting endangered and threatened plant sp ecies, includ ing Echinacea species, is the federal Endangere d Species Act of 1973 (U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service 1973). In Section 2 (b ) it states that the purposes of this Act a re to provide a means w hereby the ecosyste ms upon whic h endange red species and t hreatene d species depend may be conserved, to provide a pr ogram for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve t he purposes of the treaties and c onventions set forth in subsection (a) of this se ction. The U.S. Fish & W ildlif e Service (20 04) recogn izes the value of plants: Native pl ants are important for their ecological, economic, and aesthetic values. Plants play an important r ole in devel opme nt of cr ops that r esist di sease , insects, and drought. At least 25 perce nt of prescri ption drugs contain ingredients derived from plant compounds, including medicine to treat cance r, heart disease, j uvenile leukemi a, and malaria, as we ll as those used to assist in organ trans plants. Plants are also used t o develop natural pestici des. The threatened and endangered Echinacea species lis ted und er the Endan gered Species Program s of the U.S. Fish & W ildlife Service (2005) are: 198Scientific Na me Commo n Name Listing Statu s Current Range Echinacea laevigata Smooth coneflower Endangered GA, NC, SC , VA Echinace a tennessee nsis Tennessee purple cone flower Endangere d TN Recovery plans are created after species ar e federally lis ted an d provide th e steps that need to be taken in order so those species can be rem oved from the endangered species list. For E. tennesseensis , the recovery goal is for 15 protected popu lations in natural habitats that are determ ined to be healthy, self-sustaining, and eac h containing three colonies of plants (U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service 1989). For E. la evigata , the recovery go al is fo r 12 geographically distinct self-sustaining populations in natural habitats in at least two counties in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and in one county in Ge orgia (U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service 1995). U.S. Forest Service The U.S. Fo rest Service is responsible for m aintaining viab le populations of plants and anim als on the 191 m illion acres of national forests and natio nal gras slands in 43 states and for developing and dissem inating up-to-date informati on on the status, distribu tion, stewardship, and biology on threatened, endangered and sensitive sp ecies. This inform ation is essential for the Forest Serv ice to f oster wise m anagem ent of these grea t natu ral resources. Utilizing th e vast and up-to-date national and international im periled species data m aintained by cooperators is imperative for im plementing adequate m anage ment of National Forests and Grasslands. The Forest Serv ice strives to enhan ce populations and habitats for plants and anim als officially designated as being threatened or endangere d with extinction, and it provides special manage ment for the 3,250 plant and anim al speci es on its 2005 Regional sensitive species lists. The m anage ment of thes e vulnerable links in th e biodiversity chain is crucial to im plem enting the Forest Service vision of ecosystem managem ent. 199 There ar e four laws tha t particula rly address non -timber harve sting a ctivities in th e national forests: The Organic Act of 1897, the Multip le-Use Sustained Y ield Act of 1 960, The Forest Rangeland Renewable Resources Plan ning Act of 1974, and the National Forest Managem ent Act of 1976 (Cham berlain et al. 2002). Though these laws imply that national forests will m anage non -timber forest products, there is \"no explicit m andate to include these products in forest m anagem ent plans and activities.\" Chamberlain and his colleagues determ ined the extent to which non-tim ber forest products were addressed in national f orest m anage ment plans. They recognized that ecological and economical effects need to be significant in order to justify allocating resources for managing non-tim ber forest p roducts. Additionally, th ey identified issues that h inder efforts to manage these products: \"lack of knowledge about the biology and ecology of the flora fro m which these products originate; diverse nature of the products and the collect ors; lack of m arket knowledge; and insufficient personnel and fiscal resources to assign non-tim ber forest products manage ment\" (Cham berlain et al. 2002). In March 2001, the Forest Service publishe d an executive su mmary entitled, \"Nation al Strategy for Special Forest Products\" (USDA, Forest Service 2001) to encourage im proved manage ment. Recently the Pacific N orthwest Res earch Station published a guide detailing wild harvest m ethods, alternatives to wild harvest, and uses for over 60 plants and fungi (Vance et al. 2001). In 2002, the Forest Service Handbook (24 09.18 Chapter 18) added new direction for non- timber forest products by including requirem ents th at they be m anaged sustainably, incorporated into f orest plans, and tha t their harve sting ac tivities by subjec ted to Nation al Environm ental Policy Analysis (McLain and Jones 2005). It de fined non-timber forest products as: \"Non- timber vegetative products, such salal, ferns, and transplants (USDA 2005). It also encouraged forests to assess im pacts of m anagement activities on non-timber forest products (McLain and Jones 2005). Tribal Laws Tribes rank above states but below the federa l governm ent in legal jurisdiction. In m any respects th ey are legally sovereign. Each tribe has its own unique laws concerning the harvest of medicinal and edible p lants. For ex ample, harvesting m edicinal p lants is a seriou s concern to both the Salish Kootenai and Northern Cheyenne tr ibes in Mo ntana. In fact, the Salish Kootenai have a written record of plant use in Salish. La ws on both of these reservations are not favorable to comm ercial harv estin g even by tribal m of concerns abo ut echin acea harvesti ng, the Fort Berthold Reserv ation in North Dakota passed a resolution in the late 1990s that prohibited echinacea digging on their reservation (Crawford 1998). The Rosebud Sioux Tr ibal Council also has m ade a law that harvesting m edicinal plants on their reservation in South Da kota is allow ed only under the supervision of an elder. The m ass ha rvesting of Echinacea a ngustifo lia in the m id to late 1990 s, however, occurred witho ut thes e restrictions on th e Fort Peck Reservation in northwest Montana, where over-harvesting has been cite d as a significant problem. State Law s In the United States, fifteen states have no laws regarding harvesting or protection of native plants. Twenty-one states have laws regard ing the wild harvest and cultivation of ginseng (Panax quiquefolium, Araliaceae). Missouri's s tate law was written partially onse to ech inacea digg ing. It proh ibits the harvesting of the underground parts of wildfl owers from highway rights-of-way. Collecting 201is also illega l in state p arks, nation al forests, and conservation areas. On private lands, colle cting is prohibited without landowner perm ission (C lubine Dietrich and Colo mbini 2000). Florida law protec fruit of in its agricu it is a valu able produ ct on the m edicinal p roduct m arket. Florida law also protects other native plants th at are comm ercially exp loited. Many states have laws concerning the transpor ting and ownership of forest products such as coniferous trees, Christm as trees, saw logs , poles, cedar products, pulp logs, and fuelwood. But these do not specific ally target other forest products such as wild plants harvested for the culinary, m edicinal, or floral m arkets . For exam ple, in Kentucky, with the exception of a ginseng law, collecting perm its for wild plants are f or approved research and volunteer projects only (pers. comm., Bree K. McMurray, Kentucky St ate Nature Preserves Commission, November 2001). North Dakota responded to the poaching of Echinacea angustifolia by passing a law that makes it ille gal to ga ther it on state la nds. Th e North Dakota S tate Leg islature signed the emergency m easure, House Bill 120 0, into law on March 23, 1999. Idaho, W ashington, and Montana require co mmercial h arvesters to have w ritten perm ission to harvest all wild plants. Ten states ha ve laws spe cific to the r emoval of forest o r native plant products. For exam ple, Michigan la w protects all \"m edicinal and native plants. \" Laws in Maine, Michigan, and South Carolina law are concerned with trespass in connection with native plant collection. Thus, many states se em to be aware of the in terest in wild crafting and harvesting of wild native plants. The state prosecutor, u sually located in the state capito l, tries state civ il cases. The local county prosecutor tries state crim inal cases. The problem with civil law cases is that they cannot 202be prosecu ted at the cou nty leve l, which m akes it difficult to bring vio lators to ju stice. This is one reason that the Montana Governor's Task Force on W ild Medicinal P lants (established prim arily du e to the ov er-harves t of Echinacea a ngustifo lia and other m edicinal plants) suggested that a wildcraf ting law be crim inal, not civil. The ot her im portant reason is that the value of wild plant m aterial can be in the thous ands of dollars. Such a law is not directed at personal use of plant m aterial but , rather, at comm ercial use. In 1999, the Montana State Legislature passed Senate Bill 178, which placed a moratorium on the harvesting of Echinacea angus tifolia and six other m edicinal wild plants, and Regions 1 and 4 of the Forest Service (Norther n and Inter-Mountain regi ons) issu ed an inte rim policy m irroring the state's m oratoriu m. No persona l or com mercial perm its have been given out for Echinacea angustifolia in these regions. Senate Bill 178 also set up a volunteer task force that reported back to the Montana governor and legislature. Task force m embers spent a year edu cating them selves about issues related to wildcraf ting. They then r ecommended that the legislature p ass Senate Bill 19 7, which requires co mmercial wildcrafters an d harvesters to obtain written perm ission prior to harvest. Twenty-two states have laws regarding prot ectio n of native p lants (see Table 1). Twen ty- one states specifically m ention ginseng in their legi slation : Alabam a, Arkansas, Illino is, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Ha mpshire, New York, North Carolina, N orth Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, W est Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Washington. Three states , Maine, Michigan, and South Carolina, have trespass laws in connection with native plants. 204 Of the 22 states that hav e laws concer ning native plant protection, only North Dakota specif ically lists Echinacea angustifolia . This law includes the non-native E. purpurea species because its f ocus is on th e theft of cultivated pr operty; native plant p rotection is secon dary. So while there are 22 states that p rotect native p lants in general, and 29 states that are concerned with the removal of nativ e plants f or prof it, the rem aining states have no law addressing native plant harvest problem s. Privately Owned Land Any proposed laws relating to native wild pl ant harvest m ust consider private property rights thoroughly, as well as the likely outcom es of the law and its effectiveness. Both Montana and North Dakota have passed laws aim ed at cu rbing illega l harvest of wild native p lants. Private landowners have vigorously defe nded their rights to m anage their own lands, despite federal laws protecting rare species. Mo ntana serves as a good state to discuss private property rig hts related to echinac ea because of the attention this issue received in the late 1990 s. In Montana, som e landowners saw the proposed stat e law to require comm ercial wildcrafters to attain a perm it fro m private landowners as a breach of their rights and interference by governm ent, while other landowners were relieve d to have a law with which they could prosecute lawbreakers more strong ly than for simple tresp ass. It is im portant to note th at the Fed eral Endangered Species Act does not prohibit the \"take\" of listed plants on private lands, but la ndowners m ust com ply with state laws p rotecting imperiled plants. Consultations with the Fish an d Wildlife Service are n ecessary for private and other landowners only when federal funding or perm its are required for activ ities that m ay affect listed spec ies. Theref ore, the f ederally listed Echinacea laevigata and E. tennesseensis are technically allowed to be harvested on private lands. 205 The Montana law concerning perm it requirem ents for commercia l wildc rafters (76-10 - 101) placed a restriction on the liability of the landowner in order to encourage the harvest industry. L andowners would be hesitant to allo w wildcrafting activitie s on their property if wildcrafters were injured in th e activity and chose to sue the la ndowner. Therefore, the following section of the state code pertains to liability reli ef for landowners: o f landown er. (1) A person who uses private property fo r wild crafting purposes, with o r with out permission , does so with out any assurance from the land owner th at the property is safe for any purpose. Th e landowner owes th e person no duty of care with resp ect to th e condition of the property, exce pt that the landowner is liable to the person for any injury to pers on or pr operty for an act or omission that constitutes willfu l or wanton misconduct. (2) A p erson who uses pu blic p roperty fo r wildcrafting purposes, with or witho ut permission , does so witho ut any assurance from the lan downer tha t the propert y is safe for any purpose. The l andowner owes the perso n no duty of care with respect to the condition of the p roperty, excep t that the landowner is lia ble to the person for any injury to person or property f or an act or omission that constitu tes willfu l or wanton misconduct. North Dakota passed a law in 1999 especially with landowners in m ind, since poaching was serious ly affecting their prop erties. Theref ore, it was supported by private lando wners. Enforcement Illegal wildcrafting is a m inor concern for law enforcem ent agencies, which are staf fed by too few personnel and too m any other, and m ore im portant or serious, crim es and other issues. There has been an attem pt, though, to ed ucate all law enforcem ent personnel, f rom state troopers to federal national forest employees , about poaching of wild plant m aterial. One particular problem is that officials generally ha ve little bo tanical train ing. Additiona lly, it is no t clear how much plant m aterial constitutes \"com mercial use\" versus \"personal use.\" These are challenges that can be m et with som e basic gu idelines. 206 Perhaps the most im portant factor affecting the efficacy and streng th of a wild-harv esting law is wheth er lo cally . For instan ce, the s tate land laws are enforced by gam e wardens, and the prosecution of violators is the re sponsibility of the state a ttorney's office. Since the state attorney, located at th e state capitol and away from national and state wildlands, is the only ag ent who can prosecute violation of stat e civil law s, prosecu tion rare ly occurs for minor violations like plant poaching. The only way county law enforcem ent officials will be ab le to prosecu te illegal wildc rafting is to make relevant sta te laws crim inal, no t civil. In Montana, efforts were focused on a law th at would crim inalize comm ercial v iolators, who then could be prosecuted locally and with severe consequences in order to deter poaching and encourage fair and sustainable industry practices; citizens harvesting for personal consum ption are not the target of the law. Generally, law enforcem ent agencies are e ither unaware of the problem s of poaching wild plants or do not have the budget or pers onnel to address these problem s, except when requested. A m ajor consideration for law enforcem ent staf f is the lev el of impact or dam age to property, and harvested roots do not look like item s of significan t value to m ost officials. There are several im pedim ents to appreh ending p oachers. Firs t, law enforcem ent personnel m ust know on which property violat ors are harvesting. Second, the question of whether the purpose of the harv est is commercial or personal cannot easily be determ ined. Violators often m ust be caught in the act of selling before they can be charged. If poachers leave federal lands, law enforcem ent officials m ay not be able to chase after th em. This is one reason that the Mon tana law m ade illegal h arvesting a cr iminal offense, so law en forcem ent officials from all agencies (state and federa l) could apprehend violators. 207Experienced commercial harvesters are ve ry savvy and have been known to set up lookouts in order to evade law enforcem ent. Both buyers and harvesters m ay carry guns. Perm it compliance is very difficult to figure out . Only one huckleberry harvester was known to have purchased a perm it in the Flathead Valley in Montana one year, despite an estimated 8,700 pounds being harvested that summ er by local busi nesses (Klein 2000). Most wildcrafters chaff at regulations, especially concerni ng products on public lands they believe to be their property since no one else is exploiting them , but seve ral laws m ay be broken if poaching occurs on federal land s. The U.S. Forest Serv ice, Bureau of Land Managem ent, and state lands all have perm it system s in place. The U.S. Forest Se rvice penalties f or lack of permits start with a warning . If a perm itless and previously warned harvester is caught again, or a large quantity of harvested m aterial is confiscated, this can be considered a federal o ffense. But violators are not usually fined, and penalties for commercial use violation are often no more seve re than p enalties for personal use violation. For instance, the Fo rest Service personal use (firew ood) perm it specifies that \"violation m ay result in the forf eiture of all perm itted p roduct, issuance of Notice of Violation, termination of the perm it, and/or crim inal prosecu tion with a fine of not more than $5,000, or imprison ment for not more than six months, or both.\" Violation of the co mmercial pe rmit may carry the sam e penalties (Klein 2000 ). It is po ssible that bo th state and federal charges could be brought against a violating harvester. B ut this depends on the state laws. Fe deral enforcem ent agencies support state laws, so if a state law is violated, federal and s tate law enforcem ent agencies can work together. 208Recommen dations for Legal Protection Legal protection of native plants is extrem ely difficult to enforce sin ce plants are eas ily taken, but it helps that state and federal laws sup port ea ch other. The presence of a state law sets the in tent of the state with regard to h ow valuab le it cons iders its wild na tive plants. It inf orms would-be harvesters that these resources are valu able and that atten tion is paid to them. Conversely, the absence of a stat e law protecting native wild plants sends a m essage to potential harvesters th at the state is not concerned and places a low value on plant resources. W ild ginseng and echinacea both provide exam ples of wild nati ve plan ts that are st ressed by overharvesting and m ay nee d legal protection. Because of the consis tent high value of wild ginseng, there is constan t pressure on wild populations. The fierce dem and for wild ginseng roots has led to laws in 21 states regarding its harvest and sale. Echinacea angustifolia, however, is under intense harvest pressure f or a few years at a tim e before the m arket is flooded and pr ices drop, discouraging ha rvest. It seem s that laws and regulations beco me necessary when harv ested p lant m aterial bec omes so valuable th at significan t other illegal activ ity (t respass, theft, etc.) accom panies harvest. Legislation that lim its property rights, including the right to harvest, is typically not very popul ar and difficult to get passed. In m any respects , educational efforts m ay be the bes t way to help conserve echinacea on priva te land s where the m ajority of plants o ccur.

A sizab le portion of the dem and for echinacea roots is for wild-harvest ed plant m aterial, especially roots of Echinacea angu stifolia and to a lesser ex tent, E. pallida . Because of the large quantities harvested, the conservation status of Echinacea species has been of concern. Owing to a lack of quality standards and quality controls, m ost Echinacea species have been harvested and sold as echinacea, or \"snakeroot,\" to som e buyers and medicinal plant brokers and then resold as E. angustifo lia. Some of the less-comm on species that ha ve been harvested do not have large geographical ranges, which m eans that overharve sting is possible and can create concern for their conservation status. With the exception of the two federally protected species, E. tennesseenis and E. laeviga ta, there is little scientific information availab le related to the actual am ount of echinacea in the wild. I t really is dif ficult to d etermine to what extent th e harvest of echinace a has affected its conservation status. C oncern by the U.S. Forest Service, other agencies , and the pu blic for th e status of Echinacea species in light of m arket-driven ha rvesting has prompted funding of this study. In our analysis of the status of Echin acea species, we have uncovered several im portant points relev ant to the co ntinued health of echinacea populations, and we have several recomm endations to m ake. Improved maps of Echinacea species ranges. We have surveyed for echinacea thro ughout its known ranges. W hile we have found no m ajor range extensions for any species, we have m ore 212thoroughly docum ented actual ranges by studying collections of herbarium specim ens and reevaluating species d eterminations for locations that app eared to have un expected sp ecies of echinacea. We have produced accu rate m aps with county distribu tions fo r all states and provinces fo r which thes e species occur. These m aps are availab le onlin e (at http://www.kbs.ku.edu/p eople/staff_www/kindscher/echinacea/m aps2.htm )and will be updated when new infor mation is available; they are al so cited in volum e 21 (2005 , in press) of the Flora of North America, which covers echinacea. Recommend ation 1 . Based on our study, we reco mmend that m ore surveys be conducted and collections m ade to aid in the study of Echinacea species ranges, es pecially in s ome undercollected areas where several species co-occ ur, as in central and southeastern T exas and throughout the Southeast. The need for ecolog ical research. After reviewing the literatu re on the biology, ecology, and conserv ation s tatus of echinacea, m y colleag ues and I are concerned b y the lack of data and studies. W hile the re has been som e resear ch, it is prim arily re lated to whe ther Echinacea species have been placed on the endangered species list. There have been few ecological stu dies, and consequently there is little understanding of how Echinacea species su rvive in their environm ent. Recommend ation 2 . Clearly m ore research is needed , especially on the plant population dynam ics related to wild harvest, sustainability, and rates of recovery by seeds and root resprouts for all spe cies in dif ferent habitats. The Natural Heritag e Programs will continue to c ompile data on state and province distributions of all s tate or f ederally cited Echinacea species. Th ese data will con tinue to be usefu l for trackin g the species ' health, but without further eco logical investigatio n, we will n ot know how to im prove species health when p opulations are overharv ested or otherwise in dec line. In addi tion, there will s till be a need f or track ing the 213marketable E. angustifo lia and E. pallida species, which are relatively common throughout m uch of their ranges. The need for population monitoring and specimen collection. Perhaps our greatest understanding of the status of Echin acea species in the wild has com e from our research opportunities to collect and m onitor them . One of our m ost compelli ng fin dings is that historic populations continue to exist as long as land use does not change significantly. W e were able to find populations of E. angustifo lia, E . pallida, E. atrorubens, and E. paradoxa at sites previous ly identified by older herbarium collect ions at th e Univers ity of Kansas. Much of our work has focused on E. angustifo lia because it h as supplied 80%-90% o f the wild -harvested roo ts on the natio nal and in ternationa l market. Our m onitor ing data from North Dakota, Montana, and Kansas show us that echinacea p lants are abu ndant in areas where their populations are healthy, and we ha ve seen m any healthy populations of E. angustifolia, especially in north-central Kansas, eastern Montana, and western North Dakota. W e have collected plot data and m ade plots perm anent w ith buried steel m arkers at sites in North Dakota and Kansas. We are confident that th ese stand s can be m onitored again in the future. In addition, recen t data that we have collected, su pported by statistical analysis (K indscher et al. in preparation) dem onstrates that 50% of m onitore d wild-harvested roots re-sprouted at our study sites in both Kansas and Montana. T hese results are im portant and need to be verified and studied under other conditions, we ather patterns and locations to see if they are typical. Recommend ation 3 . We have developed a m onitoring protocol that can be used for all species (see \"Establishment of Baseline Monito ring,\" in this volum e). It is a suitable tool for monitoring use in federal and state lands and in p rivate re serves held by conservation organization s. We especially en courage its us e for E. angustifolia, E. pallida, and the less 214common Echinacea species as a way of m onitoring the health of those populations. We also encourage continued m onitoring of echinacea sampling sites we have established and the sharing of echinacea data. In that respec t, we will gladly s hare our ech inacea d ata with othe r research ers upon request. Ethnobotanical information. There is at present strong in terest in the ethnobotany of echinacea, and m uch is known, especially about the m ost widely studied species, Echinacea angustifo lia. The ethnob otanical kno wledge of other specie s is weak or lacking, in part because Native Am ericans were rem oved fro m many of their hom elands in the lo wer Midwes t, Southeast, and Texas before anthropologists a nd scien tists could reco rd infor was used. Recommend ation 4 . There should be further ethnobotan ical studies of less common Echinacea species, as well as continued study into the ethnobotan ical uses of E. angustifo lia. These ethno botanical us es are no t just historical; I have observed E. angustifo lia being used on the Rosebud, Ft. Peck, and Crow Re servations . We need further research on contemporary Native Am erican h arvest use and preparation of E. angustifo lia in add ition to studies of the use of other Echinacea species, as well as furt her conservation studies. Sustainability of wild harvest. In docum enting th e comm ercial harv est of wild E. angustifo lia in Kansas for the past 100 years, we have shown that wild harvest can b e sustain able and that there are at least som e areas that ha ve robust populations that can be periodically intensively harvested. In addition, the culture and econom ics that surrounds wild harvest are important in som e rural communities. Histor ic and ongoing m arket cycles of de mand\u2014high prices follo wed by m arket collapse\u2014also affect wild harvest. 215Recommend ation 5 . We encourage the production of educational m aterial for wild harvesters, brokers, businesses, and especially c onsum ers that encou rages the sus tainability of wild harves t. Effectivenes s of med ical treatment. Much of the future interest in echinacea will be related to w hat is discovered in m edical research about its effectiveness in treating a variety of disease s and ailm ents. Current res earch is som ewhat m its r esults, b ut many applica tions appear promising, and the quality of the plant m aterial tested h as been raised as a res earch issue that m ust be addressed by researchers a nd industry. A conservation perspective on how echinacea is used as a m edicine could help m aintain wild stan ds. Most of the potentially activ e compounds in the echinacea plan t are not only in th e root bu t also in th e aboveground p ortion of the plants, especially in the flowers and seed. The yield of these com poun ds fro m leaves and stem s is slig htly less th an that f rom the roots, an d it takes a little m ore weight to g et the sam e desired result, but if m anufacturers of echinacea products coul d be influenced to use the abovegroun d portion of the plan ts, the resulti ng nature of echinacea m arket dem and would change, and harvesting would leave roots to continually resprout wh ile ta king the p lant tops th at are now discarded. These long-lived plants coul d resprout throughout thei r 10-30-year life spans. Recommend ation 6 . We encourage the continued study of echinacea's active m edicinal compounds and efficacy, and we further encou rage using th at inform ation to influence the sustainability of its harvest. The market for Echinacea. Market cycles and d emand for echinacea h ave fluctuated in recen t years, caused by b oth cycling in the he rbal products ind ustry and reaction to stu dies relating the efficacy of echinacea use to fighti ng the common cold and oth er ailm ents. Market cycling is likely to con tinue, and it will gr eatly affect of dem and, we commend the Am erican Herbal Products Association for tracking the am ount of echinacea harvested and used by at least a significant portion of the herbal products industr y, and we strongly encourage that such tracking be continued. Legal protection. The legal status of echin acea is m ixed. Due to their truly threatened condition, the rarest two species, E. tennesseensis and E. laevigata , are fed erally listed as endangered. Three states, Missouri, No rth Dakota, and Montana, have given Echinacea species in their s tates som e degree of protection on st ate-contro lled lands. There h ave been no recen t proposals for further state protection. Recommend ation 8 . We do not think that it is necessa ry to propose listing any other species at this tim e, either fe derally or in the Convention on In ternational Trade in Endangered Species of W ild Fauna and Flora (C ITES). Fu rther educa tional efforts\u2014o n wild-harv esting ethics and sustainability and on the threats and harm caused by overgrazing and broad-scale herbicide us e\u2014m ight be m ore productive than ad dition al legislation, unless dem and skyrockets. If new m edicinal or herbal res earch findings r esult in a substa ntial increase in dem and, the leg al status of Echinacea species m ight need to be reevaluated. Cultivation of Echinace a. Cultiva in plac wild harves ting cou ld provide re lief to wild stands, but the difficulty of cultivating Echinacea angustifolia, coupled with a very uncertain market and a recent h istory of inability to m arket cultivated crops when the m arket crashes, m akes it difficult for growers to be very enthusiastic about grow ing a crop that ties up land for m ore than one year and m ay or m ay not ha ve a m arket when it is ready to h arvest. W ild stands of echinacea will continue to be used until there is a h igher and m ore stab le price for cultivated Echinacea angustifo lia. Fortuna tely, we have co me to believe that som e wild- 217harvesting practices (such as thos e in north-central Kansas, w here harvest has occurred for over 100 years) m ay be relatively sustainable. Recommend ation 9 . We encourage b oth the cu ltivation of Echinacea species and the continuation of sustainably harvested wild echin acea to m eet future m arket dem and. Species na mes. The taxono my of echinacea and delin eation of valid species nam es are matters of much discussion, but the general ta xono my of the species will not be substantially changed until add itional molecular g enetic data support sugg ested revis ions that lum p the majority of species. W e have f ollowed the cu rrent nom enclature in our work, which will likely be in use for som e time, as volum e 21 of th e Flora of North Am erica upholds the taxono mic status of all nine currently valid sp ecies. Recommend ation 10 . To avoid confusion in the academ ic arena, the m arketplace, and the public, we encourage the conservation of th e current taxonomy unless it is very clearly determ ined to be incorrect. W e also encourage addition al studies on th e taxonom ic relations of Echinacea species. Conservation of habitat . Wild stands of echinacea have not shown m uch vulnerab ility to pests or disease. Invasion by noxious weeds is ty pically not a m ajor thr eat to echinacea stands, but broad-spectrum herbicides to control noxious and other w eeds is a cause of concern in som e areas. Destruction of habitat is still slowly occurring, due to conversion of rangeland with echinacea to crop fields, houses, and other develop ment, but it is not an eminent threat for the majority of remaining sta nds, which a re usually n ow in f airly rem ote habitats. Som e habita t is being degraded slowly by overgrazing, or by en croachm ent of brush and trees, but these trends are likely to decrease as they are not profitable long-term grazing pra ctices. All th ese pressur es could tu rn into thr eats, h owever, if circum stances change, esp ecially if po pularity of echinacea 218booms again due to new research findings or grea tly increased use of m edicinal plants and herbal products. Recommend ation 11 . We recomm end the conservation of echinacea h abitats through land protection ef forts, especially through the use of conservation easem ents, which allow private property to be privately owned a nd yet protected as native prairi e or oth er echinacea h abitat. All conservation easem ents should be voluntary, but st ate federal f unds for conservation efforts to protect prairie and other echinac ea habitat should be encouraged. *** Echinacea w ill probably continue to be an im portant m edicinal plan t that has a substa ntial wild-harvested supply. E ducating diggers and co nsum ers on sustainable harvest strategies for echinacea harvest could be very usef ul and would probably be m ore effective than regulation of harvest in th e short term . Ongoing monitoring sh ould be in p lace to observe populatio n changes for both widespread and rare sp ecies, especially in years when buyers are posting want ads for buying echinacea roo ts. When these want ads ap pear, th ey are a signal th at the d emand for echinac ea ro ot is on th e upswing, and it is tim e to monitor an d reexam ine the im pact of wild harvesting on echinacea populations. 219Acknowledgemen ts The Echinacea Conservation Status project was a collabo rative effort , with contributions made by co-authors of the chapters and there were num erous people who m ade this project possible by providing useful inform ation, da ta, id eas, and ed its to us. The staff and students at the Kansas Biologica l Survey help ed in the f ield, lab, and office with the project and included: Jennifer Delisle, L isa Castle, Suneeti Jog, Crai g Brandy Hildreth. Inform ation that was used to determ ine county distributions of Echinacea species with in various states cam e from botanists and herbar ium curato rs, in cluding Ma rk W idrlechner, Deb Lewis, Larr y McGrath, Bruce Hoagland, Ken Richards, Ber t Pittm an, Tim Lowry, George Yatshievych, W endy Ap plequist, and Tim Smith. Other Echin acea experts consulted o r provid ing field help during this p roject in cluded : Dana Price, Hilla ry Loring, Kathy McKeown, Tr ish Flaste r, Larry Mo rse, Mecca Rigg s, Laura Brook Fox, Kay Fox, Rich Little, Shannon Binns , Steven Foster, Michael McGuffin, Kelly McConnell, Jim Miller, J ulie Lyke, Monique Kolste r, and M ary Maru ca. W e learned considerably by working with Pam and John Luna and Terry F ox, who professionally harvest Echinacea a ngustifo lia in Kansas an d Montana respectively. Numerous US Forest Service em ployees we re extrem ely helpful and they supplied inform ation or edited parts of the m anuscript, including: W ayne Owen, Phil Hyatt, David Taylor, Susan Hooks, Darla Lenz, Levester Pendergrass, Jim Chamberlin, Scott Studiner, Nancy Berlin, Elizabeth p, Larry Stritch, Fred Huber, Guy Anglin, Robin Roecker, and Steve B est.
