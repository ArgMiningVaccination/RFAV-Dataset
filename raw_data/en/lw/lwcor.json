Background Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center (Laguna Honda or LHH) is a general acute care hospital (licensed capacity, 780 beds) providing acute medical and rehabilitation services (capacity, 11 beds), and skilled nursing services (total SNF capacity, 769 beds). The following table shows a breakdown of bed capacity by neighborhood/unit. Laguna Honda is California's first green-certified hospital, and the 62-acre campus is designed to offer choices for living, to encourage community involvement and to provide a therapeutic environment for its residents. Our mission is to provide a welcoming, therapeutic, and healing environment that promotes the individual's health and well-being. Our vision is building healthier lives as the leader in post-acute care. Laguna Honda is part of the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN), the San Francisco Department of Public Health's (SFDPH) integrated delivery system of care. SFHN is San Francisco's first complete system of care with the goal of improving value of services provided to patients, staff and all San Franciscans.

Admissions and Discharges Laguna Honda complies with California and federal laws pertaining to nondiscrimination. Residents are welcome to LHH regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, disability, HIV status or related condition, marital status, political affiliation, or age if over 16 years old. Applicants to LHH are screened for medical necessity and level of care prior to any admission processing. Laguna Honda is an integral part of the San Francisco Health Network's (SFHN) continuum of care to a safety-net population and every one of our residents has an active discharge plan. With support and advice from their care team, residents may choose to move to board and care homes, assisted living facilities, or accessible apartments that have support services on-site or provided by community-based organizations in collaboration with the City. And for some, the City's medical respite and shelter programs are available as discharge disposition options for LHH residents. There was an overall 4% decrease in admissions and 26% increase in discharges from the previous fiscal year. From May 14 to June 30 the facility had 35 discharges and transfers related to the required facility closure, transfer, and relocation plan. The following table shows the number of first-time admissions and discharges for FY 21-22. # of patients/residents First-time admissions 158 Discharges* 206 (* Discharges include deaths, discharges to the community, and transfers to acute, and/or other facilities) Page 4 4. Resident Profile Principal hospital problem for fiscal year 2021-2022 describes the underlying cause behind a patient's initial hospital admission and is assigned by a physician. Laguna Honda Hospital Top 10 Principal Hospital Problem FY 21 -22 Dementia without behavioral disturbance Dementia with behavioral disturbance CVA (cerebral vascular accident) Dementia Multifactorial dementia TBI (traumatic brain injury) Aspiration pneumonia Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease Quadriplegia Multiple sclerosis Laguna Honda has policies and procedures on certain medical conditions that we are unable to care for at LHH (e.g., patients on ventilators, patients requiring very frequent suctioning, unstable cardiac conditions, etc.). We look at each referral for admission in the admission screening committee to see if we have the expertise and ability to meet the needs of the person being referred. The screening committee consists of physicians, clinical nurse specialists, and infection control nurses/physicians. If it is a person with a new diagnosis to us, we evaluate if the medical staff is qualified to care for that person/diagnosis. In addition, our staff can also request additional training from specialists to ensure that appropriate care is provided. If the person is already a resident at LHH and develops a new diagnosis that is less familiar to us, we have a full range of subspecialty physicians in our outpatient clinic who can partner with us in the care of that resident. Effective October 1, 2019, there was a transition from the SNF Prospective Payment System to the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM). PDPM replaces the current RUG-IV system with a completely new way of calculating reimbursement. Under PDPM, therapy minutes are removed as the basis for payment in favor of resident classifications and anticipated resource needs during a patient's stay. PDPM assigns every resident a case-mix classification that drives the daily reimbursement rate for that individual.

Cognitive/memory care enrichment activities Psychiatry Services LHH Psychiatry provides outpatient level behavioral health services to residents with comorbid mental health, substance use and other behavioral conditions that interfere with their care and recovery and require specialized treatment in addition to SNF services. Clinical conditions treated by LHH Psychiatry providers include but are not limited to: mental illness (including anxiety, depression, trauma/PTSD, other psychiatric diagnoses, with functional impairment ranging from mild to severe), substance use disorders, difficulties adjusting to major health changes, behavioral issues interfering with their care. For more details of LHH Psychiatry Scope of Service and medical necessity for services, see policy MSPP D08-02. Residents with potential service needs for specialized behavioral health treatment are referred by their primary physician to LHH Psychiatry through the E-Consult system after the physician assessment. The referrals are then triaged and screened by LHH Psychiatry for the following specialty behavioral health services (see policies listed after each for details): Psychiatric Medication Management (MSPP D01-05) Mental Health Services (MSPP D08-09) Neuropsychological and Psychological (MSPP D08-08) Substance Services (MSPP D08-07) Behavioral Management (MSPP D08-10) LHH Psychiatry is a multidisciplinary behavioral health service team under LHH Medical Services.

Mobility and fall/fall with injury prevention Transfers, ambulation, restorative nursin g, contracture prevention/care Promoting resident independence in doing as much of these activities by himself/herself Assessment for, and provision of, mobility aids to promote safe functioning in ADLs/IADLs Enhancement of sensory impairments for low vision and hearing loss Skin Integrity Pressure injury prevention and care, skin care, woun d care (surgical, other skin wounds) All residents admitted to LHH are screened by Licensed Nurses (LNs) for pressure injury/ulcer risk using the Braden Scale, which consists of six categories: sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction/shear. The total score can range from 6 to 23 with a lower score indicating a higher risk. Any resident with Braden score of < 18 is considered at risk for pressure injury/ulcer and prevention strategies, including repositioning, use of pressure redistribution support surfaces, offloading devices, and skin protectant are implemented. Nutrition consult is initiated as clinically indicated. After initial assessment, residents' pressure ulcer risks are reevaluated quarterly, annually, and/or following a significant clinical change in condition. Resident Care Team (RCT) reviews plan of care and collaborates with the resident to work in alignment with his/her goals of care and revises interventions/goals as warranted. Page 9 Residents admitted with and/or h ave surgical/complex wounds, including stage 4 pressure injury are referred to LHH Plastic Clinic. Wounds are assessed and documented at each dressing change as ordered by the Physician. Residents with non-healing wounds and not showing improvement within 14 days are reviewed promptly by RCT as well as residents with chronic stage 4 pressure injury are reviewed monthly. In addition, LHH utilizes latest evidenced based and advanced wound dressings to promote wound healing.

Resident and Family Satisfaction Laguna Honda conducts a Resident and Family Satisfaction Survey every two years to gather feedback and identify areas of improvement concerning healthcare services provided. There was no resident satisfaction survey conducted in FY 21-22. The next survey date is tentative per the SFDPH contract with the external vendor. This will be targeted to occur upon completion of Medicare certification process given the initial Medicare decertification in April 2022 required a facility closure plan. The impact of the initial facility closure plan could introduce a bias in the results of a satisfaction survey. 8.

LHH's nursing hours per patient day (HPPD) is above and beyond Federal and State requirements. The staffing is regularly reviewed by Nursing Management to ensure consistency of staffing assignment to promote safe quality care. During each shift, the Charge Nurse and/or Nursing Operations Supervisor reviews the staffing to determine the appropriate staff assignment for residents. Some additional factors/considerations for staffing include: 1. Resident Acuity - level of sickness; intensity of care (e.g., needing IV, suctioning, wound care, tracheostomy care); level and frequency of monitoring needed (i.e.: every 30 minutes vital signs, every hour blood sugar check, etc.); stability of the resident; and medications (i.e.: HIV clients have more medications so will need more LN's vs Nursing Assistants). 2. Shift Activity - the number of admissions and discharges for the shift. 3. Infection Control Issues - whether there are any outbreaks or quarantines on the neighborhoods. 4.

Employee Satisfaction For fiscal year 2021-2022, Laguna Honda did not conduct an Employee Satisfaction Survey. The San Francisco Department of Public will administer a department-wide survey to staff. The facility conducted a pulse survey focused on culture of safety in July 2021. Survey results were disseminated to department managers and the governing body. 11. Working with Medical Practitioners Laguna Honda Medical Services recruits new physician hires from a variety of sources, including DPH, SFHN, local residency training programs and a continuous job posting on the DPH employment opportunities website. This ensures we can attract the largest possible number of highly qualified applicants. The applicants are reviewed and invited for an interview if qualified, and the best qualified candidates are offered a position. Physician candidates must hold an M.D. or D.O. degree and have completed residency at an accredited training program. They must hold an unrestricted license to practice medicine issued by the Medical Board of California or the Osteopathic Medical Board and be Board certified or eligible to take the board certification exam of a board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association. When our medical providers are hired, they have a proctor for the first few months to ensure they are aware of the standards of care expected. They also are responsible to read and understand all the policies and procedures of the medical staff. We have a daily sign out in the morning and in the evening for medical staff to discuss what clinical problems have occurred and what is the appropriate follow up. We also have monthly medical staff meetings to discuss updates and any new policies and procedures. In addition to this, we have a meeting for the primary care physician at least quarterly to discuss similar issues. We also have educational conferences throughout the year on topics that are relevant. 12. Infection Control Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation has established a facility wide Infection Control Program, implemented through the Infection Control Function of the overall Quality Management program. The IPC program complies with regulations and recommendations from the Centers for Medicare and Page 26 Medicaid Services (CMS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Hospital Association (AHA), Association of Professionals in Infection Control (APIC), and mandates of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH.) The annual scope of services document outlines departmental and individual responsibilities in implementing and enforcing proper infection prevention practices to prevent the transmission of infectious microorganisms to patients, visitors, staff and our community. The FY 22-23 Annual Scope of Services document is attachment 1A. The FY 21-22 Annual Infection Control Report evaluates the previous year's performance and is attachment 1B. The FY 22-23 Annual Risk Assessment utilizes the plan evaluation and upcoming state, federal and local requirements to assess unique geographic, demographic, internal, external, and regulatory needs, and identified risks to the organization. This report is enclosed as attachment 1B. The FY 22-23 Annual Risk Assessment is attachment 1C. The FY Annual Infection Control Plan summarizes the identified priorities for the organization and outlines the steps that the organization will take to improve the care provided to residents, staff, and the community served. The plan is a working document and is assessed on an ongoing basis by the infection control team and at a minimum of quarterly by the Infection Control Committee. The FY 22-23 Annual Infection Control Plan for the organization is attachment 1D. 13.

Non-medical supplies (if applicable) Soaps, body cleansing products, incontinence supplies, waste baskets, bed and bath linens, individual communication devices, computers Soaps, body cleansing products, and incontinence supplies are maintained on the Nursing units by CPD staff and in CPD for backup inventory. 15. Facility-Based and Community-Based Risk Assessment LHH's Emergency Management Program is based on an all-hazards approach such that we prepare for continuity of operations in the event of any type of emergency that leads to a loss of or shortage of resources normally required to provide our essential services. Our Continuity of Operations Plan prioritizes these essential services and the resources required to provide them. In addition, our annual Hazards and Vulnerability Assessment prioritizes the types of emergency events that pose the greatest risk to our facility, with earthquake, communications failure, information systems failure, and infectious disease epidemic consistently in our top five risks. Therefore, these are the areas around which we focus most of our emergency planning. Please review enclosed \"Continuity of Operations Plan\" (COOP). The \"2022 LHH Hazard and Vulnerability Assessment (HVA) Tool\" is enclosed. LHH holds monthly meetings with the DPH Security Director; there is an annual security risk assessment and an approved security management plan for each fiscal year. 16. Policies and Procedures for Provision of Care Policies and procedures (P&P) are reviewed annually and updated as processes are revised for performance improvement; new P&Ps are developed as new processes are implemented to meet new regulatory requirements or for performance improvement. Please refer to enclosed \"Approval and Format of Hospital-wide and Departmental Policies and Procedures.\" 17. Contracts and Vendors Laguna Honda has assigned contract managers for each third-party vendor. It is the contract manager's responsibility to make sure they are communicating with vendors to ensure that their service/products are meeting standards and expectations. Contract managers are required to submit a contract monitoring report each calendar year to rate the performance of the vendors. If performance requires improvement, the managers must develop a Performance Improvement Plan with vendors to improve performance. The list of \"Third Party Agreements\" and \"CY 2022 Contract Monitoring Report\" are enclosed. 18. Preparing for CMS Phase 3 Requirements Page 30 CMS has released new and updated Phase 3 requirements to which LHH is expected to be in compliance with as of October 24, 2022. The areas impacted are as follows: a. Visitation - Guidance has been updated to provide a variety of options for visitation during a disease outbreak. In an effort to support the emotional wellbeing of the residents at LHH and in support of their quality of life, visitation is permitted throughout the facility with adherence to appropriate PPE protocols. In accordance to CMS guidelines, vaccination and testing are no longer monitored for visitors. The facility has a greater than 90% compliance rate for residents and staff for COVID-19 immunization requirements. b. Freedom from Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation - The facility has updated its policy (LHHPP 22- 12 Abuse and Neglect Prevention, Identification, Investigation, Protection, Reporting and Response) to reflect the new requirements of the facility's obligation to report a reasonable suspicion of a crime. Additionally, LHH will re-educate staff on reporting requirements and timelines to be in line with CMS requirements. The facility will provide training for staff to assess the situation for appropriate reporting within the 2-hour and 24-hour windows to ensure LHH is addressing each instance within the requirements. c. Restraints - Nursing and Medicine have come together to address the appropriate documentation of assessments and orders of devices which may be constituted as a restraint. The facility has updated its policy (LHHPP 22-07 Physical Restraints) to reflect the changes for bedrail use. In particular the notation that although potentially helpful in limited circumstances, bed rails can act as a physical restraint that prevents residents from independently getting out of bed or result in harm to residents when a part of a resident's body becomes stuck in the bed rail. d. Transfer and Discharge - The Department of Care Coordination has begun implementing the following workflows: i. A Notice of Medicare Non-Coverage (NOMNC) to be given to all Medicare beneficiaries at least two days prior to the end of a Medicare Part A covered stay or when all Part B therapies are ending. ii. A Skilled Nursing Facility Advanced Beneficiary Notice of Non-Coverage to be given to a Medicare beneficiary who intends to continue services, but LHH believes the services may not be covered under Medicare. Additionally, the Department of Care Coordination has implemented new workflows to ensure residents received appropriate and timely notifications of transfer, discharge, and or bed holds. e. Assessments - The Department of Care Coordination is collaborating with the MDS team and Nursing staff to ensure the facility is instituting accurate resident assessments, comprehensive care plans, and culturally competent care. Page 31 f. Trauma Informed Care - a new facility policy and education have been developed to reflect the requirements to provide residents with person-centered care that encompasses respect and dignity. Resident Care Teams will identify residents with a history of trauma and develop care plans that are person-centered and conscious of potential triggers for residents. g. Staffing - LHH has developed a new standard work and tool requiring all units to post information on staffing daily. The unit postings will reflect staff assignments and be unique to each unit. Additionally, there will continue to be posting of total number of actual hours worked for licensed and unlicensed nursing staff, along with resident census. h. Behavioral Health Services - The LHH Behavioral Health Services team has developed a training on Substance Use Disorder and Behavioral Health Services to provide staff with the knowledge of signs and symptoms of the disorder. Additionally, all facility policies have been updated in accordance with the following CMS requirements: i. Identifying residents with substance use disorder. ii. Developing care plans that reflect treatment and intervention with residents who have substance use disorder. 19. Assessment Findings This fiscal year 2021-2022 Facility Assessment is a review for the hospital under CMS Phase 2 requirements. Based on the report, these are areas that the facility assessment identified for improvement opportunities. Areas Facility Assessment Informed Action to Be Taken/Already Taken This Year Nursing Staffing FY 21-22 Just in Time bidding was implemented. This led to immediate replacement of vacant positions, thereby promoting consistent assignments in neighborhoods; Enhanced weekly Nursing/HR recruitment meetings by including Finance department for timely discussion of approval of vacant positions; report on hiring process for vacant positions; Designated a specific Covid-19 unit with sufficient staffing ratio (1:5 nurse to resident ratio); implemented specific staffing ratio of 1:5 nurse to resident); Hired 2 Float Nurse Managers to support leadership with unit coverage, provide regulatory and quality assurance assistance and help with oversight of staff during off hours in PM and AM shifts; Behavioral Response Team (BRT) program was launched to help support neighborhood teams in providing high-quality care to residents, BRT hired 1 FT RN; Page 32 Float Nurse Manager was hired to cover Day shift and AM shift for leadership and staff support and oversight; Resume hiring responsibilities from DHR for better control and improve efficiency of on-boarding of frontline staff (RNs, LVNs, PCAs); New Grad RN program was implemented and facility was able to hire eight (8) \"new grad\" RNs to fill in our vacant positions, along with this program is the enhancement of LHH Preceptorship Program. The New Grad RN program is an intensive 10 week-duration design to provide new RNs comprehensive learning and education experience to promote a successful nursing career in LHH. FY 22- 23 Plans Nursing Leadership will undergo reorganization to support the organization's goal and vision, support both residents and staff in the neighborhood. BRT will be hiring additional 2 RNs and 3 LPT; Staffing ratio in Covid- 19 unit will be reassessed (plan to increase ratio to 1:7) as we have more covid support in terms of vaccination and treatments. Infection Prevention/Control In FY 21-22, LHH infection control continued supporting COVID -19 pandemic response, facility wide education related to COVID-19, unit based audits (PPE compliance, hand hygiene, environmental cleaning & disinfection) and maintained COVID19 facility mitigation plan and support documents. For FY 22-23, LHH infection control continues COVID-19 pandemic operations and response as the pandemic transitions into its third & fourth year. Continuing IC related efforts outside of pandemic work includes targeted surveillance, environmental cleanliness, increase vaccine uptake by residents & staff, and device associated infection reductions. Behavioral Healthcare In FY 21-22 a new report was created in Epic to identify residents who are coded for Refusal of Care, a subcategory of Behavior Affecting Others. Names of residents who triggered only for the subcategory of rejection of care in subsequent past months were identified. For FY 22-23, countermeasures for areas of improvement include targeting the new care plan optimization date in Epic, educating Nursing and MDS on the availability of individualized care plans in Epic, designing curriculum and educating licensed staff on details coding Rejection of Care via ELM, developing an EPIC report to track LHH inpatient assessment of residents who triggered for Rejection of Care in BAO, encouraging MDS coordinators to be the gate keepers of the information provided, and continuing to track progress at and ensure numbers are accurately reflecting the work we do at LHH.

QAPI Initiatives/Performance Improvement Projects For FY 21 -22 the focus was on restructuring the Performance Improvement and Patient Safety (PIPS) Committee. The goal of the QAPI program is to provide a systematic, comprehensive, and data-driven to maintain and improve safety and quality in care. PIPS is a vital element of the program. Teams focused on gathering information systematically to clarify gaps or barriers and working toward process improvements. The goal was to examine and improve care or services in areas that the PIPS Committee identifies as needing attention. Areas that need attention will vary depending on the need. For FY 22-23, this work will continue with an effort to distinguish between the work that impacts the skilled nursing facility and that which impacts the acute care portion of the facility. The QAPI program will rollout unit- based meetings on the 13-neighborhoods. This work will be done to ensure frontline staff and middle management are engaged in the QAPI process and feedback loop. The unit-based QAPI meetings will focus on high-risk, high-volume, and problem prone areas for the facility. For FY 22- 23 this will be: 1. Wound and Nutrition 2. Infection Prevention and Control and Antibiotic Stewardship 3. Psychotropic Medication and Behavior Monitoring 4. Falls and Restraints These unit-based committees will report up to Nursing Quality and PIPS Committee. This Facility Assessment report contains topics included in the FY 21-22 LHH Evaluation\" for an assessment of the SNF QAPI performance. Environment of Care (EOC) Committee Page 36 The EOC Committee is a multi-disciplinary group focused on the continuous improvement of the Environment of Care and takes a collaborative approach to providing a safe, secure and comfortable environment to facilitate patient care. Committee members represent the following areas: Nursing Clinical Labs Security Management Infection Control and Prevention Pharmacy Services Facility Services Employee Health and Safety Quality Management Environmental Services Patient Safety Department of Education and Training Workplace Safety and Emergency Management Activities of the EOC Committee include: Plan, direct, implement, and improve the organization's performance of EOC activities. Evaluate and assess existing conditions, operations, and practices to determine impact and general regulatory compliance. Identify and implement improvement opportunities and process change to facilitate safety, security, and comfort of patients, staff, and visitors. Establish and maintain risk assessments and evaluation criteria to prioritize performance improvements and process changes. Work to ensure that LHH staff are trained to identify, report, and take action on environmental risks and hazards. Reports to LHH departments and committees to communicate progress. Conduct scheduled EOC rounds to identify potential risks; scheduled to cover all patient care areas on a quarterly basis. For fiscal year 22-23, the EOC Committee will have monthly reporting meetings.

Plan for FY 2022-23 Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Laguna Honda Lean Transformation has been on hold; Hoshin Kanri planning for fiscal year 2022-20223 was put on hold until further notice. Equity and Culture In fiscal year 21-22, the Laguna Honda Department of Equity and Culture (DEC) continued integrating Equity, Trauma Informed Systems, and Wellness to comprehensively address care experience for residents and staff. The department contributed towards the stated goals in the DPH Racial Equity Action Plan and the Laguna Honda Equity A3. We partnered with Quality Management to improve and increase collection and analysis of equity data metrics for quality improvement, continued to strengthen the Equity Action Council, performed targeted coaching, support, and technical assistance with nine departments to help them integrate equity into their work. We also launched our communication plan, which includes a quarterly newsletter and regular hospital-wide communications and built out our equity library with 26 new titles. Page 40 In fiscal year 22-23, the Laguna Honda DEC will continue integrating Equity, Trauma Informed Systems, and Wellness to comprehensively address care experience for residents and staff. We are now part of the Care Experience Team, which includes Human Resources, DEC, Communications, and other partners all committed to improving the experience of our residents, their families, and our staff. We will integrate recommendations from our assessment of LGBTQ+ resident needs, develop a plan from the results of the Employee Engagement survey, and continue to support the implementation of equity practices and strategies throughout the hospital. Campus Safety: For the fiscal year 2021-2022 Laguna Honda increased our security on campus with additional post. With the additional post, there was a need of increased rounding and security as Laguna Honda contracted with a 24/7 security service that covers inside the hospital and the grounds. In the entry of the hospital, we enhanced our security and made changes to our visitors' policy. Our new procedures for visits added lockers for personal belongings, as visitors are not allowed to bring personal belongings into the hospital. For 22-23 Laguna Honda has added SFSO to multidisciplinary rounds. SFSO will round and educate staff on hospital policies such as code green, code silver, etc. There are also plans to implement package scanners in our pavilion lobby and receiving areas of the hospital. These scanners will help Laguna Honda keep residents, staff and visitors safe. These scanners will help prevent contraband, and other unsafe items out of the hospital. Employee Safety: For 21-22 we have revamped emergency preparedness with a strong focus on revising our policies, Hazard Vulnerability Assessment and planning to bring back our Everbridge communication to staff when HICS is activated. Laguna Honda's COVID response has also included fit testing for staff, and screening staff We look forward to 22-23 as we begin to reach out to city partners for collaboration with fire and life safety and emergency preparedness and becoming a member of CAHF ( California Association of Health Facilities). Epic Electronic Health Record Page 41 Epic EHR go live occurred on August 3, 2019, for Zuckerberg San Francisco General, the Behavioral Health Center, LHH, and Primary Care. We continue to be in Phase 5 - Stabilization and Optimization at LHH. Significant expansion in the fiscal year: the Occupational Health Service completed their transition to Epic in July of 2021 and resident trust accounting transitioned to Epic October 2021 allowing us to retire ADL system. Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Projects Page 42 The fiscal year 2018-2019 approved projects by Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) included: 1. The Information Technology (IT) Fire Suppression Dry System : The project was scheduled to provide a dry system (gas discharge) fire suppression system in six (6) existing server and IDF rooms. The wet system was modified to allow a dry system to address immediate space events affecting critical electronic systems while the wet system addresses larger building events. This work required architectural and engineering services to modify the existing HVAC, fire alarm, smoke containment and other related building systems. The six (6) rooms impacted are located at various floor levels of the North and South Resident Towers. As of August 23, 2021, the project is complete and fully operational with only a few corrections needed before OSHPD will sign-off and start project close-out. The contractor was on site 08/31/21 to start repairs. The effort is expected to be resolved in 2-3 weeks. As of July 14, 2022, the project has been fully completed and closed with OSHPD. The contractor contract with DPW has also been completed. The fiscal year 2019-2020 approved projects by OSHPD include: 1. Pharmacy Code Compliance Upgrade : This project involves an upgrade in the pharmacy compounding rooms required to comply with current code. The project went through an assessment and a preliminary study to understand all the code requirements and the impact to the current space operations. The project was given the green light as funds became available in August of 2019. The design team was been identified and the design documents kicked off in September 2019. As of August 03, 2021, OSHPD identified a required ADA sink. A request to add a compliant sink as part of the project has been resolved along with a few other required modifications. All issues have been resolved and resubmitted to OSHPD for final approval and permit issue. As of July 14, 2022, OSHPD (now called HCAi) has completed their code compliance document review. This allows the design team to move forward with submitting permit application, IOR & TIO forms that are required to begin construction. DPW is in the process of completing bid documents to select a contractor. Contract award and construction follow. 2. Fuel Line Monitoring : This project involves an upgrade in fuel monitoring as a regulatory requirement. The project went through an assessment and a preliminary study to understand all the code requirements and the impact to the current operations. The project was given the green light as funds became available August 2019. Page 43 Contract documents were accepted at OSHPD for review/permit on August 12, 2020. Once permit is secured, LHH would start bidding effort to secure a contractor. However, the project went on hold due to cost increases and unsecured funds. In June of 2021, funds were finally secured and on July 19, 2021 a pre-con meeting took place to kick project off. On August 24, 2021, the project team met on site to review the possibility of compressing the construction schedule as completion was now estimated to be December 2021. As of July 14, 2022, the project is complete and waiting for a repair by LHH Facilities to get final sign off. All tests and inspections passed, but while performing it tests, the system worked as it was designed and detected a leak. Until the leak is repaired, the project cannot formally be closed out. 3. Water Tank Replacement : This project involves replacement of one of two 300,000-gallon water tanks that is pre-1950's construction. The tank is one of two that act as redundant water supply to both the new campus and the old. The older tank was assessed and found to have corrosion levels that far exceed a simple repair effort. The project has been reviewed by several design teams while funding was secured. This is an OSHPD project that will require close coordination with LHH operations. The project was given the green light as funds became available August 2019. As of August 27, 2021, 100% of the Construction Documents were completed and set for submission to OSHPD. LHH and the design team will soon begin working with DPW to prepare the RFQ/RFP for contractors to bid on the project. As of July 14, 2022, the construction documents are still being reviewed by OSHPD (HCAi). Once that process is completed, we will begin bidding and contract award before starting construction. The RFQ/RFP process described above has been delayed. 4. Server Room UPS Replacement: This project involves the replacement of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) unit that has exceeded its life expectancy and that is placing LHH servers at risk of power loss should the unit fail. This is an OSHPD project, and an MOU has been submitted and approved to release the design team to begin construction documents. The Notice to Proceed (NTP) is pending. Close coordination will be required with both IT Dept and Facilities when the old unit is taken offline, and the new unit is brought online. As of August 24, 2021, the first back check (OSHPD comments) was received, followed by the design team response. On August 27, 2021 OSHPD back check comments were received. The design team is formulating response to OSHPD comments and will submit within 2-3 weeks. As of July 14, 2022, We have now lost the 4th contractor due to contract issues related to their dollar cap with the City. We are working with the 5th contractor but have had to start the process over. Construction has been revised to possibly Spring of 2023. Page 44 The fiscal year 2020-2021 approved projects by OSHPD include: 1. Nursing Office Emergency Power: This project involves the extension of emergency power to the Nursing Office to allow for operation during emergencies should power fail. The new hospital, an OSHPD project, was designed to code minimum in a cost savings effort in 2010. Since then, there have been two major power outages that limited the hospitals' ability to issue emergency announcements. This project will correct this deficiency by extending emergency power to this important office. The project began construction in June 2021 and was completed 6 weeks later. The project is in the process of being closed out. As of July 14, 2022, the project has been closed out for about a year. 2. Pharmacy Automated Medicinal Dispensing Cabinets: The Department of Public Health lease on automated medicinal dispensers will elapse in December of 2021 and this project will secure a new lease while simultaneously issue an RFP to secure a contractor to remove the old units and install the new units. The aging units cannot support the new software applications needed to properly run the medicinal dispensing. As of August 09, 2021, the vendor had been selected and scope of work and cost negotiations started and are ongoing. Once a contract is signed, it will take 6-9 months to fabricate and program the new units and installation can begin. It is anticipated that all units will be operational by Fall 2022. As of July 14, 2022, the project is still on hold pending legal departments of both the City and the contractor agreeing on contract language. DPH was able to get funding for construction in the amount of $700K but are short approximately $200K for soft cost (DPW design & construction team fees). We patiently wait for contract to be completed and for DPH Accounting/Financing to secure the fund shortage. 3. Hospital Emergency Power: This project is similar to the Nursing Office Emergency Power above but encompasses the entire new hospital. The construction documents are currently being resubmitted to OSHPD (HCAi) after their initial review and comments. Once HCAi completes their review, bidding, contract award and construction will follow. The fiscal year 2021-2022 approved projects by OSHPD (HCAi) include: 1. Kitchen Floor Damage Phase 2: The Hospital was recently decertified and is now in the process of recertification. A requirement of recertification is to correct the floor damage. This work has been in place as a maintenance project for over 3 years, assuming 3 different approaches to keep meals available while closing the kitchen. The gravity of the situation has made this a critical project and one that is now under OSHPD (HCAi) jurisdiction. LHH is Page 45 working with both HCAi and CDPH to find a way to complete this project before recertification scheduled for September 2022. The project is ongoing. 2. Three-bedroom Resident Suites - Conversion from 3 rooms to 2 : To renew recertification, LHH must comply with new CDPH and HCAi regulations that no longer allow 3 bedroom suites. The conversion consists of removing the bed, capping the medical gases, and permanently removing the bedroom door. LHH is in the process of organizing the project as it will entail removing approximately 120 beds. 3. Pharmacy Automated Packagers : Two packagers in Pharmacy have reached their end of life and need to be replaced as these are now requiring frequent repair to be maintained in operation. The pharmacy is dependent upon this equipment to provide medications on a daily basis and the units staying operational is critical to the pharmacy operation. As of July 14, 2022, the design team has been authorized to move forward with contract documents. 4. Medical Clinic Sterilizer: The sterilizer has started to fail as is past its useful life, requiring frequent repairs. It is critical to the medical clinic's operations. LHH has funded the equipment replacement and the unit replacement has been ordered. A request for capital funds has been submitted for FY 2023 . 5. Security Scanners : Security scanners are to be located at three entrances to the LHH Campus; Pavilion Main entrance, Administration Lobby, and the Materials Management receiving office. A fourth station is being considered at the 5th Floor Employee Parking Entrance. These have been granted emergency status by HCAi due to the hospital recertification situation. The stations consist of a package scanner and a body scanner, which are powered and require seismic anchorage due to their size and weight. The project requires addition of electrical power outlets that are currently underway. Also, part of the security equipment are hand held narcotics trace detectors and a manual x-ray tool.
