Stange, PhD,6 Steven H. Woolf, MD, MPH,7Brian M. Berman, MD1,3 INTRODUCTION Despite investments in health care, good health remains elusive for many people. Healthcare systems generally are disease-focused and con- centrate resources on treatment modalities that oftenwork well for acute or life-threatening illnesses such as physical trauma or infectious disease, but sometimes are poorly suited to the management of chronic illness. 1-3 Modifying the healthcare system to recognize the impor-tance of social, behavioral, economic, and environmental determinants of health might better address current population needs. 4-6Such changes face many challenges, but a fundamental step is to incorporate emergingconcepts such as integrative medicine and social deter- minants of health in order to create a working de nition of integrative health. Creating a more inclusive de nition could support strategic planning of initiatives promoting health across multiple sectors of daily life, not just theclinic. In 1948, WHO de ned health as: \"...a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or in rmity. \" 7 Although this de nition has positive elements that have kept it in active use for decades, it has signi cant shortcomings that limit its usefulness. For example,Huber et al. 8noted that WHO 's emphasis on \"complete \" well-being fails to capture the longevity and highfunctioning of many individuals living with chronic conditions and disabilities. With the contemporary shifts in health care that focus increasingly on wellness, health management across the lifespan, patient-centeredness, evidence-based medicine, and the integration of complementary medicine, \"inte- grative medicine\" is a term that is increasingly used to describe healthcare interventions. 9For example, integra- tive medicine has been de ned by the Academic Con- sortium for Integrative Medicine and Health (previously named the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine) as, \"the practice of medicine that reafrms the importance of the relationship betweenpractitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person,is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appro- priate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing. \" 10 Though care delivered in the clinical setting is impor- tant to health and wellness, it is only one factor among multiple determinants of health \u2014for individuals, com- munities, or populations.11Thus, it is helpful to differ- entiate between integrative medicine and integrative health. A broader notion of health that expands \"beyond the clinic\" is establishing itself not only in medicine but in society at large. For example, HRH The Prince of Wales recently wrote about integrative health, adding that it \"represents an approach to individual and population health which respects and includes all healthrelated areas, such as the physical and social environ- ment, education, agriculture and architecture. \" 12This expanded de nition parallels recent interest in the social and environmental determinants of health, and in linking health care with public health.5,13In the U.S., NIH 's National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine recently changed its name to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. 14 Thus, although the term \"integrative medicine \"has a well-established de nition,10the term \"integrative From the1University of Maryland School of Medicine, Center for Integrative Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland;2Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;3The Institute for Integrative Health, Baltimore, Maryland;4Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, California;5Center for Social Epide- miology and Population Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan;6Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Sociology, Case ComprehensiveCancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio; and 7Department of Family Medicine and Population Health and Center on Human Needs, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia Address correspondence to: Claudia M.

The growing popularity of the term makes it critical to adopt a common de nition than can better facilitate discourse and be used to design relevant research, create metrics, and effectively advance the eld. METHODS Ad enition was developed using a systematic, stepwise approach. A group of public health and medical experts \u2014including several with established backgrounds in integrative medicine\u2014 developed a preliminary draft de nition after reviewing existing de ni- tions.8,12,15,16The preliminary draft de nition was circulated as an online survey to the Scholars of The Institute for Integrative Health17(n\u00bc10), researchers and clinicians at the University of Maryland School of Medicine 's Center for Integrative Medicine (n\u00bc8), and the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics at the Charite Medical School in Berlin ( n\u00bc10). Therst version of the de nition was based on those survey results and the input of a focus group involving senior scholars at The Institute for Integrative Health. For broader input, the rst version was highlighted in news- letters of the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine andHealth (1,704 subscribers) and the International Society forComplementary Medicine Research (105 members) and linkedwith an online survey. Quantitative responses were analyzed usingSPSS, version 22.0, and free-text answers were analyzed accordingto Mayring 18using MAXQDA, version 10. The survey results were discussed in a Scholars focus group, and the de nition was further modi ed based on two conference calls and two written Delphi rounds. RESULTS Therst version of the de nition contained 145 words: Integrative health is an approach to individual, com- munity, and population health across the lifespan that respects the inter-relationships among all health-related domains including body, mind, and spirit. It recognizes that health is shaped not only by health care, but by personal behaviors, genetics, and protective and risk factors (e.g., economic status, stress response, working conditions). Integrative health also recognizes that these health-impacting factors, in turn, are shaped by the physical, social, and economic environments, as well as by neighborhood and community conditions, public policy, and social values. Integrative health empowers individuals, social groups, and communities to achieve ways of living that promote health, resilience, and well- being, and prevent disease. It advocates for person-centered healthcare that is informed by evidence and makes use of appropriate healthcare professionals, dis- ciplines, healing traditions, and therapeutic approaches. Integrative health leverages community- and population- based strategies to improve health and prevent disease. This de nition covered eight domains:1. inter-relationships among all health-related domains;2. the role of health determinants outside of health care (e.g., personal behaviors, genetics); 3. the role of upstream determinants (e.g., physical and social environment); 4. empowerment of individuals, groups, and communities; 5. the value of person-centered, evidence-based care; appropriate services; 7. community-based and8. population-based strategies. The newsletters were sent to 1,809 e-mail addresses, with 188 (10.0%) responses (72.3% from North Amer-ica). Respondents had clinical (40.4%), research (22.3%), and teaching (22.9%) backgrounds. Nearly three quarters (73.9%) of participants acknowledged a difference between integrative medicine and integrative health. On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 \u00bcnot at all and 10 \u00bcfully), respondents expressed agreement (median, 7.0; mean, 6.5; SD \u00b12.6) that the de nition captured the difference between integrative medicine and integrativehealth. There was even greater agreement (median, 8.0; mean, 7.7; SD \u00b12.2) that the de nition helped clarify the meaning of integrative health. There was480% support for the eight elements of the de nition, with the exception of social groups (73.9%), neighbor-hood conditions (79.8%), and care informed by evidence (79.3%). Two thirds of participants (68.6%) agreed that the de nition encompassed all relevant aspects of inte- grative health. In qualitative data, the most commonlymentioned omissions from the de nition included a patient-centered approach in which the patient isdescribed as an engaged partner in health care and the importance of emotions, relationships, and environmen- tal factors. The strongest criticism, cited by many survey respond- ents, was the length and complexity of the de nition. In addition, the de nition was criticized as being dif cult to read, overly academic, and more oriented to an academic Figure 1. Final de nition for integrative health.Witt et al / Am J Prev Med 2016; ](]):]]]-]]] 2 www.ajpmonline.orgaudience than to patients, healthcare providers, or the public. There were strong suggestions to simplify the de ni- tion, but also to retain the components that distinguish integrative health from integrative medicine. Some respondents were concerned that the phrase, \"person- centered healthcare that is informed by evidence, \"would marginalize helpful therapies that have not yet been researched thoroughly. Some suggested that the phrase could imply that integrative health only includes thera-pies veri ed in RCTs. Other classes of evidence can be also useful and are often pursued for interventions in thecommunity. 19 Based on the results of the survey and the systematic consensus of the working group, a revised version of shorter length (96 words) was proposed and the reference to evidence was removed ( Figure 1 ). DISCUSSION The term \"integrative health, \"though gaining popularity, requires an accepted de nition to reduce confusion about its meaning. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, for example, uses the term integrative health for \"incorporating complementary approaches into mainstream health care. \"20The de ni- tion suggested here is de ning health plus acknowledging its social determinants. In fact, confusion already sur-rounds the term \"integrative medicine, \"and both terms interchangeably \u2014an imprecision that this denition will hopefully remedy. Despite other common themes for both terms, such as a commitment to whole- person health, integrative medicine and integrative health are discrete concepts with distinctly different applications. Integrative medicine, as de ned by the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine andHealth, 10is clearly a subtype of the practice of medicine, whereas integrative health is a much broader state.Integrative medicine, which includes conventional treat- ment approaches such as surgery, can be considered a component of integrative health. It is noteworthy that the Academic Consortium changed its of cial name to include both integrative medicine and health andexpanded its vision to include promoting health in every individual and community. Survey methods were used to get the feedback from a broader audience. However, it isunclear if those who did not respond would have had a similar opinion. Integrative health, as de ned here, takes the discussion of health and well-being beyond what occurs in the ofces of health professionals to include the work of self- empowered individuals within their communities.Integrative health incorporates concepts such as resil-ience, active participation of the individual, a focus on prevention, and the effect of public policy on health. When considering a patient with asthma, the integrative medicine approach might include additions to conven- tional care such as anti-in flammatory diet and testing for food sensitivity, whereas the integrative health approachmight add community educational programs on proper use of inhaled beta agonists and housing interventions to control cockroach infestations in sub sidized housing units. In the case of diabetes management, the integrative medicine approach would include nutritional counseling, stress man- agement to modulate cortisol secretion, and exercise pre- scriptions. Integrative health interventions might add a focus on ensuring availability of fresh vegetables in economicallydisadvantaged communities and organizing community- based groups, such as churches, to engage members inweight loss competitions. Key components of the de nition include the con- cepts of well-being in body, mind, and spirit of individuals, communities, and populations, as well as the physical, social, and economic environments in which people live, study, and work. This is consistent with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 'sn e w vision for a \"Culture of Health,\" which they describe as\"a culture that empowers everyone to live the healthiest lives that they can, even when they aredealing with chronic illness or other constraints ...a health care system that couples treatment with care,and considers the life needs of patients, families, and caregivers, inside and outside the clinic. \" 21Dening integrative health is an obvious rst step toward creating a culture of integrative health, but there is more to do: Creative innovation is required to achieve this lofty goal. Examples of next steps include mod- ications in public policy, reassessment of funding priorities, nancing reforms, enhancement of community-based programs, and the creative use of social media. Emerging technologies, such as applica- tions for handheld devices, are already being harnessed in the service of integrative health by providing users valuable feedback about their health behaviors, such as steps taken each day or physiologic responses to thenatural environment. CONCLUSIONS A broader vision of health is emerging under the term \"integrative health, \"but until now an accepted de nition of this term has been lacking. This paper proposes adenition developed by experts with stakeholder support, which hopefully will facilitate the work of society toachieve greater integrative health.Witt et al / Am J Prev Med 2016; ](]):]]]-]]] 3 ]2016ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by The Institute for Integrative Health in Baltimore, Maryland.
