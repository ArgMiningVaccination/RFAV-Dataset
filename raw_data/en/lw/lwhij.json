There now is a new treatment option that may restore these patients to fuller lives. In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of a valve repair device, called MitraClip, for patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation and symptoms of heart failure. MitraClip has been on the market since 2013 for patients with abnormalities in the mitral valve (the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle) who cannot tolerate surgery. That condition is known as primary or degenerative mitral regurgitation.

The 14-year-old patient suffered from multiple complex cardiovascular issues. Launched in 1984, UCLA's program has grown to become one of busiest and most-referred pediatric heart transplantation centers in the western United States. \"I am very proud of the program and the teamwork needed for such success,\" says Juan Alejos, MD, director of the UCLA Pediatric Heart Transplant Program. \"This achievement goes beyond the transplant program; it extends to the entire health care team involved in every step of the process.\" 450 Vital Signs Fall 2019 Vol. 84 3The ongoing outbreak of measles has raised serious concern among health care experts nationwide. The disease is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. Before development of the measles vaccine, the disease infected an estimated 3 million-to-4 million people in the United States, leading to the hospitalization of around 48,000 patients and the deaths of more than 400 people annually. While measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, as of late August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,234 cases nationwide, with 67 of those in California, according to the California Department of Public Health. Daniel Uslan, MD, a UCLA infectious diseases physician in Westwood, and Siyi Yung, MD, a UCLA pediatrician in Santa Monica, discuss the nature of measles and the importance of the measles vaccine. Why is measles dangerous? For most people, measles typically involves a fever accompanied by a cough, runny nose, watery eyes and skin rash. But, in some cases, Dr. Uslan notes, measles can cause complications such as pneumonia, hearing loss or encephalitis (brain swelling). Measles may also cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely or to low-birth-weight babies. \"Measles, which is spread through the air, is among the most contagious infectious diseases,\" he says. \"On average, if you had a room of 100 unvaccinated people and someone with measles walked into that room, around 90 of them would come down with measles.\" What is the benefit of the measles vaccine? Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing measles. \"One dose of vaccine is about 93 percent effective and two doses are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles,\" Dr. Yung says. The measles vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Since the vaccine contains live virus, it should not be given to people with weakened immune systems or to pregnant women. When should vaccination be administered? A first dose is recommended for children between 12-to-15 months of age, and a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. \"If families are traveling internationally, the CDC recommends giving an early dose to infants over 6 months of age and a second dose to children over 1 year, with doses given at least 28 days apart,\" Dr. Yung says. What about adults who don't know if they've been vaccinated? \"They should discuss this with their primary care doctor,\" Dr. Uslan says. \"The physician may recommend having the patient's blood tested to see if he or she is immune, or the doctor may recommend an MMR booster, especially if the patient will be traveling internationally or works in child care or health care settings.\" If measles was declared eliminated in 2000, why are we now seeing so many cases? \"While measles may have been eliminated in the United States, there are other countries where the disease has been ongoing,\" Dr. Uslan says. \"Unvaccinated travelers may acquire measles in a foreign country and bring it back to the United States.\" Also, the CDC estimates that a vaccination rate of around 95 percent is required to prevent measles from being transmitted. However, that rate is lower in some communities due to hesitancy about having their children vaccinated, Dr. Yung notes. \"Families may have heard rumors about the measles vaccine being associated with certain conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, but science has disproved that,\" Dr. Yung says. \"They should know that the measles vaccine is very safe and very effective.\" LAWLAWMEASLES VACCINE Daniel Uslan, MD Siyi Yung, MDAnswering your questions about the measles vaccine For a complete list of UCLA primary care offices in your area, go to: uclahealth.org/primary-care Photos: UCLA HealthJohnese Spisso, MPA, president of UCLA Health and CEO of UCLA Hospital System, and Ronald Karzel, MD, managing partner of Southern California Orthopedic Institute, at a signing ceremony in February. Photos: Thomas Neerken Photo: SuperstockUCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of a procedure that is highly beneficial for people with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease to treat some patients with severe epilepsy. The procedure, deep brain stimulation (DBS), involves implantation of a \"brain pacemaker\" to send electrical impulses to targeted areas of the brain to relieve symptoms and reduce seizures. The FDA approved the procedure in the fall as adjunctive therapy for patients ages 18 and above with severe epilepsy in which multiple medications have failed to provide relief from their debilitating seizures. Last November, the UCLA Seizure Disorder Center and Department of Neurosurgery performed California's first DBS procedure for epilepsy following the FDA approval. DBS is analogous to a cardiac pacemaker, but instead of correcting abnormal heart rhythms, it corrects abnormal brain rhythms that spread through the brain to cause seizures. Ausaf Bari, MD, PhD, a UCLA neurosurgeon who specializes in DBS procedures, explains that, in this procedure, the surgeon makes two small openings in the skull, through which a sophisticated computer navigation system guides the placement of two electrodes, one on each side of the brain. A battery-operated device implanted under the skin below the collar bone is then used to send continuous electrical signals to an area of the brain that can control the seizures. More than 3 million people in the U.S. have active epilepsy. Some two-dozen antiseizure drugs have been introduced in recent decades, but as many as one-third of individuals with the disorder continue to experience seizures regardless of what drug they are prescribed. For these patients, the best hope for a cure has been surgery to remove tissue in the area of the brain where the seizures originate. Dr. Bari notes, however, that an estimated 80-to-90 percent of patients with intractable epilepsy are not candidates for resective surgery \u2014 in many cases because their seizures originate from areas of the brain that serve critical functions such as memory or language and can't be removed. Without the ability to control their seizures, these individuals have experienced significant compromises to their quality of life, along with the potential for cognitive impairment and sudden death from epilepsy. \"It can be extremely debilitating, to the point of interfering with people's ability to have a normal social life and perform at a high level at school or work,\" Dr. Bari says. \"With DBS, we can finally offer something that can provide these individuals with a chance for some level of relief from their seizures.\" Having an effective treatment option for patients with intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for traditional surgery is a particularly welcomed development for the pediatric population, adds Aria Fallah, MD, a UCLA pediatric epilepsy surgeon. While the procedure currently is approved for patients 18 years of age and older, \"we are carefully studying its use in the pediatric population by considering it for our patients who have continued debilitating seizures and have exhausted all other standard surgical options,\" Dr. Fallah says. \"Epilepsy can interfere with a child's brain development, so stopping the seizures at an earlier age is extremely important to preserve their brain function.\" Being able to utilize DBS to help these patients \"can significantly affect their life trajectory,\" he says. UCLA's epilepsy surgeons have been performing DBS for more than two decades. \"This is a therapy that has been shown to be safe for conditions such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor,\" Dr. Bari says. \"We are using the same technology for epilepsy, but in a different part of the brain.\" The DBS neurosurgeons work closely with neurologists at the UCLA Epilepsy Center, who play a critical role in selecting the appropriate surgical candidates, fine-tuning the therapy and managing the patient's medication after the device is implanted, Dr. Bari notes. Long-term results from the large clinical trial that led to the FDA's approval of DBS for epilepsy patients show that patients can experience up to a 70 percent reduction in seizure frequency, Dr. Bari adds. DBS has the advantage of minimal side effects compared to antiseizure medicines, Dr. Fallah says. DBS is considered to be a palliative treatment \u2014 it lowers the seizure frequency and burden \u2014 and not a cure for epilepsy. Dr. Fallah notes that \"this is a reversible operation, so if there is a better option in the future, we can remove the DBS device.\"FDA approves deep brain stimulation for treatment of severe epilepsy EPILEPSY Vital Signs Fall 2019 Vol. 84 5 Continued from cov er MitraClip approved for some heart failure patients HEART Photo: Science SourcePhoto: Courtesy of abbott.com The FDA is now permitting MitraClip for patients with a normal mitral valve who develop heart failure along with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation because the left heart chamber is no longer functioning properly \u2014 a condition known as functional regurgitation. \"The MitraClip was developed as an alternative to surgery if the valve is leaky because regurgitation is from a degenerative problem,\" says Marcella Calfon Press, MD, an interventional cardiologist. \"The exciting development is there is this whole other group of people with functional regurgitation who now can be helped by use of the MitraClip device.\" Mitral regurgitation occurs when blood leaks backward through the mitral valve into the heart's left atrium. In patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the valve is not damaged, but the left heart chamber does not function properly, interfering with blood flow through the valve and worsening the symptoms of heart failure. Cardiologists typically try various medications to treat the condition or may use cardiac synchronization, which involves implanting a pacemaker in the heart to improve heart rhythm. But those options may not be enough. \"There are so many patients who have heart failure and are on medication who remain symptomatic,\" Dr. Press says. \"We can now offer them another therapy that could make a big difference in their quality of life.\" The MitraClip treatment is a minimally invasive procedure performed by an interventional cardiologist. The physician threads a thin catheter through the femoral vein in the groin and guides it to the heart's left atrium through a small puncture. The MitraClip is guided toward the mitral valve using ultrasound. The device is deployed and attaches to the two leaflets of the valve to clip them together and reduce the backflow of blood. Dr. Press says that Mitraclip implantation is a safe treatment option with low rates of procedural-related complications. A study of 614 patients with functional mitral regurgitation published late last year in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that the risk of being rehospitalized for heart failure symptoms was reduced by about 47 percent in people who received the MitraClip compared to those who continued medication therapy. The risk of death within two years was reduced by about 37 percent. \"We've seen how much better patients feel after this,\" Dr. Press says. \"One of the most gratifying things is how the quality of life of our patients improves. They are able to walk longer, and they feel better and come to the hospital less often. For some patients, it is life changing.\" A growing number of patients with a heart valve condition known as aortic stenosis can avoid open-heart surgery and opt for a minimally invasive procedure known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Two studies published earlier this year showed that TAVR is safe and effective for younger and healthier patients. Previously, the procedure to replace a faulty heart valve was reserved for frail patients who are at higher risk from open-heart surgery. In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved TAVR for lower risk patients, making it the procedure-of-choice for aortic stenosis patients who are experiencing symptoms, says cardiologist Olcay Aksoy, MD, a leader of the TAVR program at UCLA. \"For our patients with aortic stenosis, this will increase access to TAVR, improve outcomes and enable quicker recovery,\" Dr. Aksoy says. Aortic stenosis is a condition in which the opening of the aortic valve narrows and restricts blood flow. As the condition worsens and more blood flow is blocked, people begin to experience fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pains and dizziness. Left untreated, the condition can lead to heart failure. Prior to 2011, the faulty valve was replaced during open-heart surgery. With TAVR, the valve is replaced by inserting a catheter into the heart from a small opening in the chest or groin. \"Patients with a severe degree of narrowing have a shorter lifespan,\" Dr. Aksoy says. \"This is a disease that we take very seriously and treat aggressively as much as possible. TAVR will make patients feel better, improve quality of life and help them live longer.\" TAVR has been available since 2016 for moderate-risk patients. The latest research supports recommending the procedure for a majority of aortic stenosis patients who are experiencing symptoms, Dr. Aksoy says. One study showed the rate of complications in low-risk patients, such as death, stroke or rehospitalization, was 8.5 percent in the TAVR group compared to 15.1 percent in the surgery group. The second study of low-risk patients found UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)HEART minimally invasive Stenosis Closed Aortic ValveTranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) The TAVR procedure resembles a balloon angioplasty, in which a catheter \u2014 a long, flexible tube \u2014 is threaded through an artery and a balloon device on the end inflates to help open up a narrowing in a valve in the heart. Vital Signs Fall 2019 Vol. 84 7lower rates of complications, death, rehospitalization and the onset of atrial fibrillation in the TAVR patients compared to surgery patients. \"Surgery is a great option and fixes the problem, but cardiac surgery is associated with a long recovery time,\" Dr. Aksoy says. For patients who are eligible for the procedure, TAVR is as effective and \"a lot less invasive. Patients often go home the next day. They are back to their normal lives in three-to-four days.\" Another recent study found that medical centers that do a higher volume of TAVR procedures have significantly lower death rates. \"We are a high-volume center,\" Dr. Aksoy says. \"At UCLA, we have a heart team consisting of doctors from several disciplines, and we evaluate our patients carefully to decide how best to treat them after a thorough investigation. While there are some limitations to the TAVR procedure, and surgery may remain a better option for some of our patients, I expect that TAVR will and should be a first-line therapy for most patients.\" minimally invasive aortic valve replacement Photo: Getty Images UCLA cardiologists and heart surgeons have been at the forefront of developing innovations to the procedure that have improved safety and outcomes while reducing the cost.

Established in 2001, the center is a collaborative effort of the UCLA Department of Neurology and the Southern California & Nevada Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, with support from the Hilton Foundation. It offers wellness interventions that complement the medical treatment participants receive for the disease. It is open to all patients with MS, regardless of where they receive their medical care. Executive director Elise Herlihy, RN, MSN, and medical director Barbara Giesser, MD, talked about the center and its approach to promoting wellness.Broad array of wellness programs and services available to patients with MS How is the Marilyn Hilton MS Achievement Center different from other programs for people living with MS? Elise Herlihy: Traditionally, adult day programs are available for people with MS to receive medication and nursing or custodial care with quality-of-life activities based on age and ability. That is not what our achievement center is about. Our center attracts and empowers those with MS who want to make substantive changes to improve their lives. We do not provide neurologic care; we are focused on strategies to enhance health and wellness for individuals all along the MS spectrum, from the newly diagnosed to people who have been living with MS for many years. We offer a variety of innovative MS-focused programs provided by a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced professionals from the Department of Neurology, Department of Clinical Nutrition, UCLA Rehabilitation Services, as well as yoga instructors, mental health professionals, speech and language pathologists and volunteers.How do lifestyle and wellness services benefit the overall well-being of people with MS? Dr. Barbara Giesser: When the center was established 18 years ago, medical professionals were just beginning to appreciate the importance of lifestyle and wellness strategies. That now is the standard of care, but back then it really wasn't, so the concept of this kind of a center was visionary. Today, we treat exercise as a therapeutic modality; we have data from clinical trials that it reduces many symptoms in MS, improves the ability to function and improves quality of life. We also are starting to get data on the importance of nutrition and a healthy diet. And, we now recognize from studies that smoking is probably the single worst thing for someone with MS. Herlihy: Social support also is very important. We offer art therapy sessions, which are led by a mental health professional, during which participants have a chance to discuss, in a safe and confidential environment, how they are coping with MS and any challenges they are facing. We also know that for people with MS, connecting with others who have MS and learning how others are coping is valuable. The center serves as a therapeutic community.

Photo: UCLA Health Vital Signs Fall 2019 Vol. 84 9What programs does the center offer? Herlihy: Our flagship program, REACH to Achieve, is a comprehensive health and wellness program for people who have been living with MS for some period of time and are experiencing challenges related to their symptoms. They come in once a week on an ongoing basis for wellness activities that include recreation, adaptive fitness, adaptive yoga, cognitive stimulation, emotional wellness, nutrition and health education. In addition, the center offers several multi- week programs, some on the weekends to make it easier for those who work during the week. Living Well is for people who have been diagnosed with MS within the last couple of years. It serves as an introductory course where they learn about MS, the medications to control the disease and other strategies to manage symptoms, as well as exercise, nutrition, stress management, employment and disclosure concerns and ways to optimize their well-being and restore balance in their lives. Our Exercise and MS program is offered for individuals who are mobile and want to work with a fitness specialist and recreation therapist to learn about the various components of exercise and how to use functional exercises to improve their wellness and manage their symptoms. CogniFitness, for people living with MS who are experiencing mild cognitive problems, provides strategies and tools for dealing with common memory and cognitive challenges. Free From Falls is a multi-week fall-prevention program for people with MS who are able to walk but might be at risk for falling. The center also links participants with the National MS Society's MS Navigator program, which connects them to other resources and support. How effective are these programs?Dr. Giesser: When the center was being developed, part of the idea was that it could serve as a place to pilot programs, with those that prove to be successful and beneficial then going nationwide. That is what has happened with many of our programs that now are being offered by the National MS Society chapters, and the Marilyn Hilton MS Achievement Center at UCLA achievement center as a whole has served as a national model. How has the outlook for individuals newly diagnosed with MS improved over the years? Dr. Giesser: The prognosis is so much more hopeful now. When I started working in the MS field almost 40 years ago, we didn't have any disease-modifying therapies and didn't appreciate the importance of wellness strategies. Today, when I talk to young, newly diagnosed patients, I tell them that while it is true that we cannot cure MS, we can control it. We have medications that will limit future nerve damage and limit attacks, medications and other treatments to ameliorate symptoms and improve function, and we have wellness strategies. With a combination of appropriate neurologic care, medication and healthy living and wellness strategies, we can make significant improvements in their lives.

But many women \u2014 whether out of embarrassment, a lack of awareness that their problem can be addressed or because their medical provider doesn't bring it up \u2014 suffer in silence. However, when brought to the attention of experts, such conditions as urinary incontinence, pelvic pain or pelvic organ prolapse can be treated successfully. To better address the needs of women with these disorders, subspecialists from UCLA's departments of urology and obstetrics and gynecology have established the UCLA Center for Women's Pelvic Health, which opened in June. \"Female pelvic medicine patients have traditionally been treated by either urologists or urogynecologists,\" explains Victor Nitti, MD, the Shlomo Raz Chair in urology and co-director of the new center. \"By combining the expertise of these two departments in a collaborative, multidisciplinary center, we can ensure that each patient receives optimal care for her condition.\" Dr. Nitti notes that approximately one-in- three women will at some point in their lives experience a pelvic floor disorder, and about one-in-nine women will need surgery. The pelvic dysfunction often is a delayed consequence of pregnancy and vaginal delivery, particularly in the case of stress urinary incontinence \u2014 the unintentional leaking of urine when physical movement or activity puts pressure on the bladder. Age is the most important risk factor for all conditions related to pelvic dysfunction. \"As the body gets older, the pelvic floor wears down, just as our knees tend to weaken as we age,\" says Christopher Tarnay, MD, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and urology and co-director of the center. \"As a result, many older women struggle with age-related declinations in function.\" Conditions such as urinary incontinence, overactive bladder (characterized by a frequent or sudden urge to urinate) or prolapse (in which the muscles and tissues surrounding the pelvic organs weaken or loosen, causing one or more of the organs to drop or protrude into or out of the vagina) can significantly affect a woman's quality of life. Many women will reduce or avoid exercise and social situations, as well as activities where they might not have access to a clean and accessible bathroom. Intimacy with partners often is affected. \"Women with these conditions may experience reduced self-esteem and are at higher risk for depression,\" Dr. Tarnay says. \"At our center we can offer treatments to restore that function.\" The center provides state-of-the-art care for women with the most common problems related to pelvic function, as well as women with less common conditions. The spectrum of treatments ranges from conservative, nonsurgical approaches to complex reconstructive surgeries. Many of the conditions can be managed with behavioral modifications, as well as pelvic floor exercises and physical therapy. Some can be treated with medication, or with innovative therapies such as neuromodulation, Botox injections and the use of a patient's own tissues or stem cells. Surgical options include minimally invasive laparoscopic, robotic and vaginal procedures, as well as major r econstructive surgeries. \"Our goal is to individualize therapies for patients according to their condition, lifestyle and treatment goals,\" Dr. Nitti says. Another important goal of the center is to raise awareness that pelvic floor disorders are both common and treatable, and to provide a compassionate space where women feel comfortable discussing sensitive issues.

Developed at UCLA in 2005, the program began with adolescents, but it has expanded to offer services for both young adults and preschoolers, as well as for those who are not on the autism spectrum but are motivated to overcome the social challenges associated with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression. The program imparts skills related to making and keeping friends, and counsels on handling conflict, rejection and bullying. A pair of additional programs are debuting this year \u2014 PEERS for Careers, which assists young adults on the autism spectrum as they transition from college to work; and PEERS for Dating, the first evidence-based dating intervention for young adults with ASD. A key feature of the PEERS programs, which run continuously as 16-week sessions in which groups meet weekly for 90 minutes, is the incorporation of parents or caregivers as \"social coaches\" who attend concurrent sessions, then help to generalize the newly learned skills to real-world settings. \"When you include parents and caregivers, the treatment never ends,\" says clinical psychologist and associate clinical professor Elizabeth Laugeson, PsyD, founder and director of the UCLA PEERS Clinic. \"Our research indicates that the gains made from this short-term intervention are maintained long after it ends, in part because it continues to be reinforced.\" PEERS, which now has been adopted in more than 70 countries and translated into more than a dozen languages, also emphasizes what Dr. Laugeson calls \"ecologically valid\" social skills. \"We study what socially successful people do and break that down into concrete rules and steps, rather than teaching what adults think young people should do in social situations,\" Dr. Laugeson says. As an example, when young people are struggling socially and trying to meet a new group of people, she notes, they often are advised to go up and introduce themselves \u2014 a strategy that can come across as awkward. PEERS teaches a more organic approach that starts with listening unobtrusively before taking advantage of a pause in the conversation to say something on the topic, then assessing the group's interest based on nonverbal cues. The introduction comes later, if at all. \"For children who struggle socially, the evidence shows that our approach of breaking down social interactions into concrete rules and steps, demonstrating what those skills look like, then having them practice the skills \u2014 reinforced by the parent or caregiver \u2014 is effective,\" Dr. Laugeson says. Her team has published more than two-dozen peer-reviewed studies documenting the program's efficacy. And, while the heart of PEERS continues to be the groups for young people on the autism spectrum, Dr. Laugeson and her colleagues discovered early on that the skills taught by PEERS could benefit anyone who is socially struggling and motivated to improve. \"Most social skills interventions tend to be ineffective, because they aren't evidence based,\" Dr. Laugeson says. \"PEERS is based on what works, and as a result, we see big improvements in overall social skills \u2014 particularly in areas such as cooperation, engagement and social responsiveness.\"PEERS aims to improve social skills for young people with autism spectrum disorderAUTISM \" We study what socially successful people do and break that down into concrete rules and steps, rather than teaching what adults think young people should do in social situations.\" Photo: Getty ImagesFor more information about PEERS, go to: semel.ucla.edu/peersUCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)AGING Fall Prevention Learn about common risk factors for falls and strategies to prevent falls and stay safe and steady as you age.
