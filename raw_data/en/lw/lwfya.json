Labor and delivery nurses enjoy the privilege of helping patients through one of the most profound and vulnerable experiences of their lives. Now a nurse in the [Rush Family Birth Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/family-birth-center), Sharon O'Brien, MSN, RN, knew she wanted to specialize in this area the first time she stepped into a [labor and delivery](https://www.rush.edu/services-treatments/family-birth-center/labor-and-delivery) unit. \"The energy was captivating,\" she remembers. \"The waves of calm followed by surges of chaos and emergency are what made me fall in love with labor and delivery. There are moments of extreme stress and tension, followed by moments of pure joy.\" Labor and delivery nurses spend their shifts working hard to protect the safety of mothers and infants. They manage a range of responsibilities, from monitoring fetal heart rates, managing pain and offering labor support to addressing high-risk situations and providing postpartum care, usually for multiple patients at a time. No two days, patients or situations are ever the same, according to Rush University College of Nursing GEM program graduate Amy Lang, MSN, RNC-OB. (GEM is the college's [Generalist Entry Master's program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/programs-admissions/direct-entry-master-science-nursing-msn-non-nurses) for non-nurses.) \"The fast pace of labor and delivery with a rewarding outcome can be refreshing,\" she says. As with all nursing specialties, labor and delivery involves working as part of a team to provide the best possible patient care. However, the specialty also offers inherent benefits and challenges all its own. \"It's a very specialized field that requires nurses to know about other medical/surgical conditions that can affect a patient's labor and delivery experience,\" says O'Brien, who also earned her master's degree at Rush. \"The labor and delivery unit at Rush functions as an emergency department/triage area, an operating room and a post-anesthesia recovery area.\" \"You're always dealing with someone in immense amounts of pain who needs support,\" she says. \"As a nurse, you get them through the labor, coach them through delivery and then teach them how to care for their baby.\" The job of a labor and delivery nurse can be personally and professionally satisfying, but, as Lang points out, it also requires a unique kind of compassion in the event things go wrong. \"It's an incredible honor to be part of new life, but it's not all about holding and rocking babies,\" Lang says. \"You also help in times of struggle. This time can be rewarding as well \u2014 helping families grieve in times of loss.\" \"I'm really able to connect with patients,\" Lang adds. \"I haven't had children of my own, but I can relate to them, being a woman who wants to be a mother someday.\" The Olympics have included legend-making performances. They also have included devastating injuries. By Kevin McKeough The 2016 Summer Olympics have included legend-making performances by athletes such as Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles. They also have included devastating injuries: French gymnast Samir Ait Said suffered a gruesome broken leg early in the games; crashes by cyclists Vincenzo Nibali of Italy and Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands left them with a broken collarbone and cracked vertebrae, respectively; and Armenian weightlifter Andranik Karapetyan dislocated his elbow while trying to lift 195 kilograms (about 430 pounds). \"No matter how many rules and regulations, how much safety equipment and caution you have in the situation, you have powerful, athletic individuals trying their hardest to move a ball or jump their highest,\" says Joel Williams, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedics and a specialist in orthopedic trauma and hip preservation at Rush. \"It's a lot of mass and a lot of velocity, and these sorts of injuries are a risk of being active in these sort of sports.\" Fortunately, medicine and the body's own healing power in most cases can heal even the most dramatic injuries. Here, Williams answers questions about what doctors do to mend the broken bones of both Olympic athletes and the ordinary patients he sees in his practice, where he treats broken arms and legs. Williams: The two most common demographics of trauma are young men with too much testosterone who engage in dangerous behaviors that result in an accident, and elderly folks who have a ground-level fall. If these patients were 20 years old, they would get right up, but now they wind up with a fracture. A close third subset is athletes that are mid-sport or mid-practice and end up with a real traumatic injury like the ones we're seeing in the Olympics. Just this week I cared for a 14-year-old eighth-grader throwing 80 miles-an-hour fastballs. He was able to generate enough force with his momentum and his muscles that he twisted his humerus (upper arm bone) in such a way that it caused a fracture. Surgery is not necessary for every patient. Some can be treated with immobilization, like a splint, cast or brace. The next modality of treatment is a device called an external fixator. They have metal pins that go through the skin and into the bone above and below the injury. The pins are connected to each other with carbon fiber rods. Sometimes they're used as the patient's definitive treatment \u2014 the device is put on and kept on until the fracture heals \u2014 but most of the time we'll put it on as a temporary measure until another operation at a later date. The two most common reasons to use them are if somebody comes in and they're too sick for surgery, or if there's a large amount of swelling and it's not safe to make an incision. The last two options are internal fixation with a plate or a rod. Plates come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they're applied to the bone with screws. Typically, the fracture is aligned to its correct position using X-rays before the application of internal fixation. Sometimes we put them on while we're looking directly at the entire bone and plate and do not rely heavily on X-rays. Alternatively, we'll make small incisions and slide the plate under the skin and muscle and use X-rays to place the implant in the correct position. If we decide to use a rod, it goes inside the bone rather than on the surface of the bone. The decision to use a plate versus a rod is injury specific and surgeon preference. Especially with the rod, we use a lot of X-rays to make sure everything is lined up correctly before the implant goes in. They're all devices we use to hold things in the correct position. At some point, if the body doesn't heal, any of these devices will fail. Once the surgery is done, the patient needs to heal the fracture on his or her own. If you're fixing a broken chair or table, it doesn't have any healing capacity, so the fixation has to last. But the human skeleton is much cooler, because you align things back where they're supposed to be, and the body actually builds new bone. It fills in the broken pieces with new bone. From before you're born until the day you die, your entire skeleton is digested and rebuilt by very specific cells. Your skeleton remodels itself roughly every 15 years. It's a highly regulated system and breaks down bone at certain points and builds it back up at other points. A child's skeleton is very different. There are growth plates all over the skeleton that are responsible for increasing the length of your arms and legs. Once someone reaches skeletal maturity, the remodeling process still continues. The cells that break down bones are called osteoclasts and the ones that build bone are called osteoblasts, and they signal each other. The process is accelerated by a broken bone, which sets off all kinds of signals. There's a huge recruitment of osteoblasts and they gather to repair the broken bone. I was watching the French guy (gymnast Samir Ait Said) with a small group of people. Most people look away or have an audible reaction, and my fianc\u00e9 was teasing me because I was bringing my nose closer to the screen and trying to guess what the X-ray would look like. It just depends on the injury, people's age and their overall physical health. It's a factor in our decision-making and how we're going treat them, and it's a factor after surgery when they're going to go to physical therapy. Young people heal more quickly than older people. Olympic athletes, who are at the younger end of the age spectrum and are in fantastic shape, are going to heal more quickly. Whether they're going to return to the Olympics depends on the injury. The weight lifter probably is going to lose some extension of his elbow, which is a huge set back for a weightlifter. He's probably not going to be able to lift as much weight. For the French gymnast, there are plenty of athletes who have an injury like that and return to competitive sports, but there also are plenty of people for whom that's a career-ending injury. (Said, who was attempting an Olympics comeback after missing the 2012 Summer Olympics due to injury, has vowed to compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and to win a medal.) Most competitive cyclists have had a clavicle fracture at some point or another because it's so common. I just finished operating on a 40-year-old bicyclist with a collarbone injury an hour ago. Without surgery, patients with a broken collarbone do extremely well \u2014 85 to 90 percent of them heal and patients have no complaints long term without an operation. If you put them in a sling and let them be, they'll recover so why put them in the risk of surgery. This gentleman had an injury that almost was poking through his skin, so I realigned him so he wasn't at risk of the bone breaking the skin. Staying active with weight bearing activities. Walking, running if your knees and ankles and hips are in good shape, weightlifting are all great ways to increase bone formation and decrease your chance of getting osteoporosis. The other thing you can do later in life, after age 50 or 60, to increase your bone mass is to take calcium and vitamin D supplements, which are available over the counter. It's always better to do it under the supervision of a primary care doctor or an endocrinologist, but for calcium and vitamin D supplements there's not a whole lot of downside of taking them. A pioneer in Alzheimer's disease research, Denis Evans, MD, received a lifetime achievement award from the Alzheimer's Association. Denis Evans, MD, is unassuming about his research in [Alzheimer's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/alzheimers-disease). He allows that he has contributed a \"recognizable piece\" of what is known about Alzheimer's. In truth, his work has been foundational in the battle against the devastating neurological disease of aging, which is the most common cause of dementia. The director of the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging for two decades, Evans has tracked Alzheimer's for more than a quarter century through population studies \u2014 that is, studies of a group within the general population \u2014 that have revealed the disease's troubling prevalence among the elderly and illuminated some of the characteristics and behaviors that can influence who develops Alzheimer's, and who doesn't. \"He's a pioneer in community-based studies in Alzheimer's Bennett, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/david-bennett-md), director of the [Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/alzheimers-disease-center), who regards Evans as his mentor. Bennett adds that Evans' approximately 340 research publications are \"some of the most highly cited\" in field. Reflecting the importance of his contributions, Evans received the Bengt Winblad Lifetime Achievement Award in Alzheimer's Disease Research from the Alzheimer's Association in 2016. The Alla V. and Solomon Jesmer Professor of Medicine at Rush Medical College, Evans retired June 30 after 27 years at Rush and is being honored at a Sept. 5 celebration on the Rush campus. As a young researcher, Evans was part of the team from the Harvard University Medical School that showed in 1989 how widespread Alzheimer's is in the population \u2014 and how steeply its presence increases with age. Working through the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, the primary source of health care for the neighborhood around Boston's Logan Airport, the researchers found that Alzheimer's prevalence increased with age. The researchers interviewed 81 percent of East Boston's residents aged 65 and older, more than 3,623 in all, and made a detailed clinical evaluation of a random sample of nearly 467. They found that 3 percent of people ages 65 to 74, 19 percent of ages 75 to 84, and 47 percent of those older than 85 had the disease. \"The disease was a good deal more common than people thought,\" Evans says. What Evans understood from his beginnings at Harvard, Bennet says, is that studying demented people who showed up at health care facilities would not uncover the causes of Alzheimer's, while many others who had the disease remained out of sight in their communities. Instead, Evans identified risk factors among the population as a whole, went door-to-door in a confined area to find all the clinically normal people on the brink of old age who lived there, followed up to observe which ones eventually became demented, and focused on the risk factors that had been noted in individuals who later lost cognitive functioning. One of Evans' great talents, Bennett says, has been the ability to \"design the right study to answer the questions.\" Bennett also explains that Evans took an unusual approach to Alzheimer's for a 20th-century researcher: He treated the disease as if it were a spectrum disorder. \"Denis understood very early on that there is no magic cut point for Alzheimer's disease,\" Bennett says. He realized the disease's presentation is different in every person who has it. \"It's taken all these decades for the field to catch up to him,\" Bennett says. Born and raised in Detroit, Evans attended Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. He started his medical research career in infectious diseases at Harvard University Medical School in Boston. As a junior fellow there, he agreed to help his mentor, Edward H. Kass, MD, PhD, conduct a population study around treatments for urinary tract infections. \"He'd been very good to me, and he hadn't asked me to do much, so I agreed to do it. Well, I fell in love with population-based research. My interests began to switch,\" Evans recalls. It took Evans another decade to turn fully away from infectious diseases. He kept encountering patients who \"were telling me they would rather be dead than have what is now called Alzheimer's disease. I thought, 'Well, that's important!'\" He came to Rush in 1990, attracted by its research reputation, its established cohorts, and by the city of Chicago. It was one of perhaps four metropolitan areas, he figures, where he could conduct a population study he had in mind. In Chicago, Evans found the \"level of trust and cooperation\" and the diverse communities in close proximity to one another that made it possible to explore differences in how Alzheimer's affects different ethnic groups. That enterprise became the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a study of the chronic health problems of the elderly \u2014 especially of possible risk factors for Alzheimer's \u2014 in an area on the far South Side with both white and African-American residents. A longitudinal population study, meaning it observed the same subjects repeatedly over time, CHAP began in 1993 over the next 20 years canvassed about 70 percent of the people in the Mount Greenwood, Morgan Park and Washington Heights neighborhood \u2014 more than 10,000 people in all. \"The CHAP study has been important in estimating the number of people who have Alzheimer's disease in the general population, in energizing methodical investigation of the disease among African Americans, and in uncovering several factors that give rise to increased risk of the condition,\" Evans says. Evans' work with CHAP has continued since the study ended in 2012. He is the principal investigator of the Genetic Epidemiology of Cognitive Decline in an Aging Population Sample study, which is investigating the genetics of late-life cognitive decline using data from two large cohort studies \u2014 CHAP and the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project, a comparative study of African-Americans in Indianapolis and Yoruba in Nigeria. The study has helped delineate the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline among African Americans and in comparing these finding to those of European Americans. When Evans first came to Rush, Bennett recalls, \"there was very little research on Alzheimer's disease happening\" there. Thanks to his skill at writing successful grant applications to the National Institutes of Health and his willingness to share what he knew, Rush quickly became a major Alzheimer's research institution. \"By 1991, we had a center funded by the National Institute on Aging,\" Bennett says. \"By 1993, he had CHAP and other grants, and he had a big coattail effect on research across the institution.\" While understanding of Alzheimer's disease has increased exponentially during Evans' career, a cure for it still remains elusive. Whatever progress will be made in conquering Alzheimer's disease in the near future will likely come from prevention rather than a cure. Otherwise, if we live long enough, \"most of us will develop Alzheimer's disease,\" Evans says, since medical science is extending lifespans in developed countries. \"There's more frustration than good news,\" Evans acknowledges. \"It would help if there were only a few factors that account for a lot of the disease, but Alzheimer's is turning out to be very complex, and complexity is the enemy. \"We will eventually have success, but it won't be tomorrow,\" he says. As Evans' own achievements have shown, a solution to the disease requires being in the fight for the long term. For media inquries, please contact [deb_song@rush.edu](mailto:deb_song@rush.edu). The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program announced its first chaplain research fellows and curriculum development grant recipients (Chicago) The Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program announced the selection of its first cohort of chaplain research fellows and of the first recipients of the program's clinical pastoral education curriculum development grants. The fellowships and grants are part of Training Research-Literate Chaplains' efforts to advance knowledge about religion and health in health care organizations and among the public. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is a joint effort by the Department of Health, Religion and Human Values at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the Department of Sociology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The project seeks to close the gap between hospital chaplains' current limited research literacy and the importance of evidence-based care for all members of the health care team. \"Health care chaplains have embraced the importance of evidence-based practice but lack the training to realize it,\" said program co-leader [George Fitchett, DMin, PhD](http://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/george-fitchett-dmin-phd), professor and director of research in the Rush Department of Religion, Health and Human Values. \"More interdisciplinary collaboration and a growing understanding of how religion and spirituality can positively affect patient health means hospital chaplains are increasingly important members of a patient's care team.\" The fellowships will pay for 16 board-certified chaplains to complete a two-year, research-focused Master of Science or Master of Public Health degree in epidemiology, biostatistics or public health at an accredited school of public health. Selected from among a competitive pool, the first cohort of eight fellows are gathering for a kickoff conference from July 27 to 29 at Rush. The conference will bring together the fellows and members of the Training Research-Literate Chaplains' leadership and advisory committees to open the conversations on chaplaincy research. The clinical pastoral education (CPE) grants will be given to 70 CPE programs - which provide the training required to be a hospital chaplain \u2014 to incorporate research literacy into their curricula. The first cohort consists of 38 centers and will reach 237 student health care chaplains. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains' third initiative, a free, online education for chaplains entitled \"Religion, Spirituality and Health: An Introduction to Research,\" will be made available in 2017 at no cost to practicing chaplains who are members of the supporting professional chaplaincy organizations. \"We are thrilled with the opportunities this program is offering to chaplains with a range of backgrounds and experiences,\" said Wendy Cadge, PhD, program co-leader and professor of sociology at Brandeis. \"The first group of fellows and CPE centers will do much to bridge the gaps between chaplains and other members of the healthcare team. We are grateful to the John Templeton Foundation and the sponsoring chaplaincy organizations for giving all of us this opportunity.\" The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is funded by $4.5 million in grants from the John Templeton Foundation with additional support from the Association of Professional Chaplains, the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education, the National Association of Catholic Chaplains, and Neshama - Association of Jewish Chaplains. The first cohort of chaplain research fellows includes the following members: The CPE programs at the following institutions are the recipients of the first round of clinical pastoral education grants: For more information about the Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program, please contact [kathryn_lyndes@rush.edu](mailto:Kathryn_Lyndes@rush.edu).

Eating cinnamon might improve learning ability, according to a new study by Rush University Medical Center neuroscientists. By Deb Song Cinnamon is a delicious addition to toast, coffee and breakfast rolls. Eating the tasty household spice also might improve learning ability, according to new study results published online in the July issue of the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. The study by neurological scientists at Rush University Medical Center found that feeding cinnamon to laboratory mice determined to have poor learning ability made the mice better learners. \"This would be one of the safest and the easiest approaches to convert poor learners to good learners,\" said [Kalipada Pahan, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/kalipada-pahan-phd), the lead researcher of the study and the Floyd A. Davis Professor of Neurology at Rush. Some people are born naturally good learners, some become good learners by effort, and some find it hard to learn new tasks even with effort. Little is known about the neurological processes that cause someone to be a poor learner and how to improve performance in poor learners. \"Understanding brain mechanisms that lead to poor learning is important to developing effective strategies to improve memory and learning ability,\" Pahan said. The key to gaining that understanding lies in the hippocampus, a small part in the brain that generates, organizes and stores memory. Researchers have found that the hippocampus of poor learners has less CREB (a protein involved in memory and learning) and more alpha5 subunit of GABAA receptor or GABRA5 (a protein that generates tonic inhibitory conductance in the brain) than good learners. The mice in the study received oral feedings of ground cinnamon, which their bodies metabolized into sodium benzoate, a chemical used as a drug treatment for brain damage. When the sodium benzoate entered the mice's brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated the plasticity (ability to change) of hippocampal neurons. These changes in turn led to improved memory and learning among the mice. \"We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,\" Pahan said. The researchers used a Barnes maze, a standard elevated circular maze consisting of 20 holes, to identify mice with good and bad learning abilities. After two days of training, the mice were examined for their ability to find the target hole. They tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding. The researchers found that after eating their cinnamon, the poor learning mice had improved memory and learning at a level found in good learning mice. However, they did not find any significant improvement among good learners by cinnamon. \"Individual difference in learning and educational performance is a global issue,\" Pahan said. \"We need to further test this approach in poor learners. If these results are replicated in poor learning students, it would be a remarkable advance.\" Cinnamon has been a sweet spot for Pahan's research. He and his colleagues previously that [cinnamon](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/cinnamon-may-help-halt-parkinsons-disease-progression) can reverse changes in the brains of mice with [Parkinson's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/parkinsons-disease). These studies have made the researchers spice connoisseurs: They used mass spectrometric analysis to identify the purer of the two major types of cinnamon widely available in the United States \u2014 Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamonum cassia) and original Ceylon cinnamon. \"Although both types of cinnamon are metabolized into sodium benzoate, we have seen that Ceylon cinnamon is much more pure than Chinese cinnamon, as the latter contains coumarin, a hepatotoxic (liver damaging) molecule,\" Pahan said. The study of cinnamon and learning ability was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Alzheimer's Association. Rush University Medical Center received the ELSO Award for Excellence in Life Support \u2014 the most prestigious designation in critical care by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. Rush is the only full service adult and pediatric academic medical center in Chicago and Illinois to receive the Gold Level Center of Excellence designation. (CHICAGO) - For those who are so critically ill because their hearts and lungs are failing, the only hope for a second chance at life rests in the hands of a team of experts in the intensive care unit who are skilled at applying the use of an artificial heart and lung bypass machine called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This life-saving machine, known by its acronym ECMO, provides relief to the patient's own heart and lungs so the vital organs can heal. ECMO puts oxygen in the patient's blood and helps pump the blood back into the body. A pump circulates blood through a circuit of tubing supporting heart function and through an oxygenator, which functions as an artificial lung. It is used to help patients of all ages with life-threatening diseases that impair heart and/or lung function. While ECMO is often used with patients waiting for heart or lung transplant, most patients who need ECMO are almost certain to die without this level of support. On July 5, Rush University Medical Center received the ELSO Award for Excellence in Life Support \u2014 the most prestigious designation in critical care by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. Rush is the only full-service adult and pediatric academic medical center in Chicago and Illinois to receive the Gold Level Center of Excellence designation. ELSO is an international consortium of health care professionals and scientists dedicated to the development and evaluation of new therapies for supporting failing organ systems. This award is given only to ECMO services that show a commitment to exceptional patient care, have the highest level of quality standards including specialized equipment and supplies, defined patient protocols and advanced education of all staff members. \"ECMO is managed on a moment-to-moment basis by adult and pediatric intensivists and ECMO specialists \u2014 ICU nurses and respiratory therapists who have completed specialized advanced training,\" said Dr. Robert Balk, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Rush. The ECMO team at Rush includes adult and pediatric surgeons, critical care and pulmonary medical experts, perfusionists, pharmacists, nutritionists, respiratory therapists, social workers, case managers, blood bank staff and others who are essential to caring for ECMO patients. The Rush ECMO program continues to expand, and the goal is to provide the same quality care for both pediatric and adult patients. \"We can reach patients in need of ECMO throughout Chicago and the suburbs, who may be hospitalized somewhere they do not have the equipment or personnel necessary to initiate ECMO,\" said Dr. Rashid Ahmad, section head of [cardiac surgery at Rush](https://www.rush.edu/services/cardiology-and-cardiac-surgery). \"Rush's ECMO program also developed a way to successfully get patients to be mobile \u2014 to stand up and walk around, which has proven to improve the recovery process, decreases the need for sedation, risk of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and ventilator-associated pneumonias as well as reduces the number of ICU days,\" Balk said. \"Our use of progressive mobility has allowed our patients to be more awake, which has not only allowed their family members to interact with them more frequently, it has also allowed the patient to actively participate in their own recovery,\" said Balk. \"We are tracking data on the progressive mobility advantages in order to analyze its impact on our program's outcomes, as well institutional quality metrics,\" Ahmad said. \"As one of the busiest ECMO centers in Chicago, Rush is routinely consulted regarding ECMO-dependent patients who require advanced organ-failure therapy,\" Balk said. \"Often, ECMO is begun by another facility, and then the patient is transported to our facility because of our capacity to provide other advanced treatment options or long-term mechanical circulatory support.\" ### Contact: Deb Song 312-942-0588 [deb_song@rush.edu](mailto:deb_song@rush.edu) An emergency room nurse never knows what's next. One ER nurse provides a look into the real-life drama of his work. By Lisa Jevens The real life of an emergency room nurse might not be exactly what's depicted on TV, but there can still be plenty of drama. Everything from birth to death comes through the door, and nurses are the ones who manage every step with hands-on care. An ER nurse never knows what to expect, yet he or she must handle everything and everyone quickly and effectively while acting as the eyes and ears of the attending physicians. Adam Spurlock, DNP, APN, works as a charge (lead) nurse in the [Emergency Department](https://www.roph.org/clinical-services/emergency-department) at [Rush Oak Park Hospital](https://www.roph.org). Spurlock knew he wanted to work in the fast-paced environment of the emergency room as soon as he had his first rotation there. \"I liked the constant turnover and change; the inability to plan your day. It just clicked,\" he says. While working in the ER for five years, Spurlock earned a [Doctor of Nursing Practice](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/programs-admissions/adult-gerontology-acute-care-clinical-nurse-specialist-dnp) (DNP) degree from the [Rush University College of Nursing](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing). This degree helped him assume a leadership role in the Emergency Department. \"I'm in charge of making sure things run smoothly in terms of staffing, communicating with other departments and helping out with overload,\" he says. He basically functions like a medical traffic cop, monitoring the flow of patients' progress in and out of the department. (Spurlock's leadership training also includes earning Clinical Nurse Leader and Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner certifications.) A typical night \u2014 Spurlock works from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. \u2014 starts by taking over for those nurses clocking out. He takes stock of where patients are in their treatment, discharge or admission process. As the night goes on, hospital staff gets thinner, but the ER can get busier with more acute cases. There is only one attending physician from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and one advance practice provider until midnight or 2 a.m., plus the nurses. \"It's usually pretty full. We are up and down \u2014 there's not too much sitting. We do get our steps in on our pedometers,\" Spurlock says. The ER treats a lot of patients for abdominal pain \u2014 gastroenteritis (stomach flu), urinary infections and muscle strains are common diagnoses \u2014 heart attacks and other heart conditions, and upper respiratory complaints. In addition to managing the flow of patients, Spurlock performs everything from IV insertions to EKGs, glucose and urine tests to setting splints. ER nurses have a lot of autonomy to make decisions and advise physicians, which is something most people don't realize, Spurlock says. ER nurses also must be willing to do the dirty work, from cleaning up feces and urine to putting in IVs and drawing blood, along with monitoring the patient's vital signs. In addition, they're also the front line of communication with the patient's family. David Manno, DO, an attending physician in the ER, says teamwork is essential in the unit, and nurses must be true team players. \"It's a close work association,\" Manno says. \"We rely on each other to observe the patient. \"Often they will see something I might have missed because I can't be with the patient the whole time. A good ER nurse will alert you to a change in the patient and know how to manage them so you can step away for a minute.\" This capability is important, because doctors can be responsible for six to eight patients at any given time, Manno says. \"The best ERs run like a team where people play well with others,\" he says. \"A good ER nurse must be smart, adaptable and able to handle a large amount of stress.\" \"We see people at their worst, and we work in an environment where nobody's happy, because nobody makes an appointment to come to the ER. A good ER nurse must have a thick skin to take the abuse that is laid on by patients sometimes.\" Manno is not just speaking figuratively. Spurlock's shift often sees intoxicated patrons from nearby bars after closing time, often accompanied by police. \"They can cause a ruckus,\" says Spurlock, who has been assaulted by angry patients. In those situations, he follows crisis intervention procedures and attempts to de-escalate the situation \u2014and, of course, calls security. On the other hand, he takes pride and satisfaction being a member of an effective ER team and providing care for patients. In one especially rewarding case, emergency personnel brought in a man who had been found unresponsive in a coffee shop, most likely due to cardiac arrest. The condition is almost always fatal, but the ER was able to revive him, and eventually the patient \u2014 a new father who just had bought a house \u2014 made a full recovery. \"To see the efforts of many staff members produce such a good result was great,\" Spurlock says. Interactions among researchers, clinicians and patients are critical to inspiring tomorrow's biomedical discoveries. By Mark Donahue Collaborations are critical to biomedical research. It's through a spirit of discussion and passionate focus that researchers sustain themselves in work that can take decades, through the ups and downs of sponsored funding, in the lab and sometimes far afield. Collaborative studies are on the rise in general, with partnerships at Rush alone emerging around microbiology and immunology, [Alzheimer's](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center) and [HIV](https://www.rush.edu/services/hiv-treatment-program), and work on bone and cartilage, said Tom Wilson, assistant vice president of research affairs. And this cross-disciplinary work is drawing more attention \u2014 and support \u2014 from government and private funding agencies. \"Not too many years ago, most research faculty would kind of be in a silo,\" said Wilson. \"And they're doing what they do isolated in their laboratory, and they were getting funding for that research. But now sponsors' expectations have changed, and they want to see integrated, collaborative research projects.\" The medication Ampyra \u2014 also known by its generic name dalfampridine \u2014 was born out of a collaboration among Rush clinical and basic science researchers that started more than 30 years ago. Ampyra is used to treat [multiple sclerosis (MS)](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis), an insidious disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide. In MS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks myelin in the brain and spinal cord without an identifiable cause or cure. For many sufferers, symptoms such as impaired eyesight, speech and muscle function become a fact of daily life. Ampyra is a potassium channel blocker, which enhances signaling in nerves damaged by MS, allowing patients to live more normal lives. Licensed for use in 2010, Ampyra remains the only FDA-approved therapy recognized to improve walking in MS patients. The initial spark that led to the discovery of Ampyra dates back to the 1960s, when Floyd Davis, MD, then a neurologist in training and later a physician at Rush, observed that many [multiple sclerosis](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis) patients functioned better when their body temperature was slightly lowered. That raised the possibility that MS-damaged nerve fibers do not permanently lose the ability to transmit signals, as many before had thought. In 1978, Davis teamed up with another Rush clinical researcher, [Dusan Stefoski, MD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1587), and they concentrated on finding a compound that could mimic some of the effects of lower body temperature. Their research led them to the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, 4-AP or dalfampridine. Two years later, the team led by Davis published a paper on the scientific foundations of their work, and they began clinical trials in 1983. The results were immediate: Taken intravenously, 4-AP produced transient improvements in MS patients' motor and eyesight functions. In 1990, Rush initially licensed the proprietary know-how developed by Davis and Stefoski to a pharmaceutical company. When the company did not actively develop the drug, Rush looked for a new commercial partner. In 2003, the hospital signed a new license agreement with Acorda Therapeutics, which successfully completed the clinical development of what ultimately became Ampyra. The FDA approved Ampyra in 2010 as an extended release tablet form, followed by regulatory approvals in the European Union and Australia. From its launch until mid-2014, Rush (and its inventors) received a running royalty on sales of Ampyra. Rush sold its royalty rights to a private equity fund in August 2014 for about $42 million, and it has used large portions of the proceeds to fund other research. Today the [Rush Multiple Sclerosis Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/multiple-sclerosis-center) is continuing its work, studying whether Ampyra can help nerves restore the myelin coating stripped away by MS and if long-term use of the drug could gradually improve muscle function, much like athletic training. Bob Eisenberg, chairman emeritus of the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, has been at Rush since 1976 and recalls the excitement around the Ampyra team's initial breakthrough. One of the department's then-researchers, Charles Schauf, PhD, offered some early thoughts to Davis and Stefoski on the science behind ion channel blockade. For Eisenberg, it's a perfect example of how conversations that happen across disciplines are critical to research \u2014 in this case, the contribution of basic science to addressing foundational questions. \"There are things going on like that at the early stage right now,\" Eisenberg said. \"We don't know which one of them is going to work. We don't know where the interaction with the clinician may be helpful, here or somewhere else. It's a community effort.\" A partnership between a Chicago-area business and the Rush University College of Nursing has provided one group of workers not only free health services, but advocacy for care. By Mark Donahue Health care access remains a difficulty for millions of Americans, particularly those most in need, despite the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers of a certain size must provide health insurance options to their workers. A partnership between a Chicago-area business and the [Rush University College of Nursing Office of Faculty Practice](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/departments-college-nursing/faculty-practice-patient-care-and-consulting-services) has provided one group of workers not only free health services, but advocacy for care. The Rush clinic at airline caterer [Flying Food Group's](http://flyingfood.com/) Flying Food Servair O'Hare International Airport location is staffed by three Rush nurse practitioners and assisted by nursing and nurse practitioner students. The clinic administers a number of direct health care services and education initiatives to the 450 employees, and the results have been striking. A recent study that AON Consulting performed for Flying Food discovered that per-employee health insurance costs are significantly less at the O'Hare location than at Flying Food's 20 other kitchens, even though it has the highest average employee age, says Ellen Pritsker, communications director for Flying Food Group. Pritsker adds that these kind of results have inspired the company to expand the Rush clinic model to some of its other major locations. \"Our employees truly appreciate the quality of care and the convenient, on-premises location of the clinic,\" says Steve Kershner, general manager of the O'Hare kitchen. \"There is a respectful and trusting connection between our employees and the clinic staff.\" For Sheila Leen, APN-BC, one of the nurse practitioners at the clinic, the benefits of health care at a job site are obvious \u2014 and go beyond cost for employees. \"They feel like someone cares about them being healthy,\" says Leen. \"They say it every time I'm there, 'Thank you so much. You guys are so great and take such good care of me.'\" Employees at Flying Food Servair ORD work hard, cooking and catering food for international flights. Because it's focused on the airline industry, the kitchen is a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year operation, with the majority of workers on the production line, along with cooks, drivers and managers. Production line workers and drivers are paid hourly. Though they are offered health insurance through the 2015 Affordable Care Act employer mandate, many live in areas without easy access to health care providers, says Angela Moss, APN-BC, MSN, RN, assistant professor in the College of Nursing and another of the nurse practitioners at the clinic. These circumstances were well understood years before by the company's founder, Sue Gin, who passed away in September. Gin was a longtime member of the Rush Board of Trustees and first approached the College of Nursing in 2009 about offering free, on-site health care to employees at her O'Hare kitchen. Today, the Rush clinic at Flying Food Servair ORD provides care for chronic and acute complaints. Rush nurse practitioners also handle employee drug screening, administer flu vaccines, and provide a wide range of health coaching and healthy living seminars. Just as important, the nurse practitioners help the employees navigate the health care system. With more than 20 languages spoken at the O'Hare facility, communication can be daunting for some employees, says Moss. Nurse practitioners help coordinate and make primary care and specialist appointments for them. The partnership seemed natural for Rush, adds Moss, who also directs the College of Nursing's Office of Faculty Practice. \"It helps promote our vision of social justice \u2014 community outreach and helping to decrease health disparities,\" she says. As its name suggests, the OFP creates opportunities for Rush nursing faculty to provide direct patient care while they satisfy state clinical hour requirements for their nursing certifications and licensure. College of Nursing students also have the chance to interact with real-life patients. The office currently partners with 19 nonprofit organizations in the Chicago area, including Heartland Health Centers and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Flying Food Group is its first for-profit corporate partner, with the Rush clinic situated inside the company's facility near O'Hare. Sheila Leen says that through such close contact, a bond forms between faculty and employees. \"I get to see the same people over and over, so I get to know them a little bit on a personal level,\" she says. \"It just feels great to be able to help them, even if it's something minor, just the fact that you're helping them feel better.\" Opportunities such as the Flying Food Servair ORD clinic also offer Rush nursing students a chance to meet required clinical hours for their programs while being exposed to diverse patient populations. Hannah Leavitt, RN, is a student in the Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Doctor of Nursing Practice program, as well as a nurse in a private practice at Rush. She's cared for employees at the clinic since January and has found the chance to work with a different patient population valuable. Last spring, Leavitt also began a small-group health education project aimed at employees with hypertension. Those who sign up get counseling on healthy living strategies such as diet, exercise, and stress management and are monitored over a 12-week period for improvement. Employees have been very open to the effort, Leavitt reports, including some who'd previously been undiagnosed with high blood pressure. Leavitt says she's already brought her experience from the O'Hare clinic into her current work as a nurse. It represents a shift in thinking. \"This has just opened up a whole new idea of what taking care of people means, because I think in this role you're really taking care of the whole person, not just what they're coming in for that time,\" said Leavitt. \"You're talking about their financial situation, their family, and their home and work life.\" A new clinic on the Near West Side continues one Chicago business owner's commitment to health care access. By Mark Donahue Even with the Affordable Care Act in effect, access to health care remains a challenge for millions of Americans \u2014 particularly those from low-income and minority groups. But access becomes much easier when your health care provider is in the same building where you live. A new partnership on Chicago's Near West Side has provided this remedy for one group of local residents. In June, Rush opened the Sue Gin Health Center at Oakley Square, a mixed-income residential complex on Chicago's West Side. \"A lot of people don't like to travel out of their comfort zone,\" says Sandra Ramsey, who has lived at the complex for 28 years. \"Here you can come right downstairs and get taken care of.\" Previously known as St. Stephen's Terrace, the Oakley Square complex underwent a $38 million redevelopment in 2014 and provides apartments to more than 500 residents, from small children to senior citizens. [The Community Builders](http://www.tcbinc.org/), a nonprofit development corporation, manages Oakley Square, and the [Rush University College of Nursing's Office of Faculty Practice](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/departments-college-nursing/faculty-practice-patient-care-and-consulting-services) runs the clinic there. Many residents still are uninsured, and those with Medicaid insurance faced capacity issues at local clinics, says Rose Mabwa, senior manager of community life at Oakley Square. Until now. \"We have a lot of young moms. Now, they don't have to go anywhere to line up; they just have to go to the clinic,\" Mabwa says. \"And their kids can have their physicals done, the shots done, so when they're going back to school, the kids will be ready.\" These outcomes wouldn't be possible without the work of one Chicago-based global business owner and the way she addressed the question of health care accessibility. Her answer is starting to gain ground. The late Sue Gin \u2014 namesake of the new health center at Oakley Square \u2014 was the founder and CEO of [Flying Food Group](http://flyingfood.com/), an airline and retail catering company headquartered in Chicago with locations across the U.S. Gin noticed that the company's mostly production-focused work force had trouble finding the time or way to get to health care facilities. A long-time Rush Board of Trustees member, she proposed a partnership. It led to the establishment of the [Healthy Living Program and Clinic](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/news/rush-clinic-takes-o%E2%80%99hare) at Flying Food Group's O'Hare International Airport production kitchen. For six years now, Rush nurse practitioners have operated the free clinic, and the results are striking. Independent analyst AON Consulting recently concluded that per-employee health insurance costs are significantly less at the O'Hare location than at Flying Food's 20 other kitchens, even though the average age of O'Hare employees is higher than the company average. More importantly, Rush nurse practitioners develop a rapport with employees as they dispense care and wellness advice. It's an approach many hope will continue at Oakley Square. \"The Sue Gin Wellness Center at Oakley Square echoes this model,\" says David Cotton, CEO of Flying Food Group. \"It embodies Sue's commitment to community service, along with her conviction that underserved populations deserve access to quality health care and wellness programming.\" Gin was also a longtime member of the board of directors of Exelon Corporation and its subsidiary, ComEd. When she passed away in 2014, the Chicago-based energy company decided to make a gift of $250,000 toward community health efforts in her name. After Chris Crane, president and CEO of Exelon, discussed the company's intentions with Larry Goodman, CEO of Rush University Medical Center, Rush proposed establishing a clinic at Oakley Square modeled on the one at Flying Food Group. It seemed a natural fit. \"Some of the communities we serve lack access to affordable health care,\" says Crane. \"There is no better way to honor Sue's memory, her commitment to the less fortunate and her service to Exelon than to support this center in her honor.\" Education is another important focus for the Sue Gin Wellness Center. It offers not only primary care health services, but wellness initiatives for Oakley Square residents, including nutrition and fitness classes and walking groups. And it serves as a training ground for the next generation of health care workers. The College of Nursing's Office of Faculty Practice encourages nursing faculty and students to bring their skills to vulnerable populations. The Sue Gin Wellness Center is just one of 20 partnerships this Rush office has fostered around the Chicago area. \"Our faculty practice partnerships provide unique clinical opportunities for students and faculty,\" says Angela Moss, APN-BC, MSN, RN, director of faculty practice. \"We also link faculty researchers and patients who otherwise might not have connected. Most importantly, patients say they appreciate a family-like bond with our Rush faculty practice nurses.\" Weekly wellness classes at Oakley Square began in the winter, ahead of the center's opening, and Sandra Ramsey already has taken part. \"I've learned a lot about healthy eating,\" she says. \"We didn't have that kind of information before, but now we have it not only on nutrition but exercise \u2014 things I need that I'm not able to get in a regular "}
