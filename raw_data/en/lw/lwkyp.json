We address questions that are vital for the well-being of people and the environment andthat nurture our inherent curiosity about our future and our past. In this publication, which covers only a very small fraction of the ongoing research here at Boston University ,we have highlighted some of the investigations of the timely topics of climate change and of biologicaladaptations in response to the dynamic environment. Time and again, observations have shown that smallenvironmental changes can have an enormous impact on the survival of a vulnerable species, while at thesame time some species have demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt to changing conditions. An inter-esting case in point is illustrated on this year's cover , which features Professor Karen Warkentin, a memberof our biology department, and an instrumented clutch of frog eggs. Professor Warkentin's research hasrevealed that these frog eggs have the ability to respond to perceived danger by hatching earlier than normal. In the section \"Learning to Adapt,\" we report on her work and on that of a number of otherresearchers who are examining the adaptive strategies of dif ferent species\u2014all point to an encouragingrobustnessintheability of organisms to survive change. Wehumans are also proficient in adaptability , particularly in developing technologies to support our bio-logicalsystems. Thearticle \"Moving Research into Action\" highlights some of the innovative medicaltechnologies being developed in collaborative projects involving faculty in our College of Engineeringand School of Medicine. Several projects, funded with a $2.9 million, five-year grant from the CoulterFoundation, aredescribed in this section. Among them is an automated glucose regulation system beingdeveloped by a team led by biomedical engineer Edward Damiano that will assume the work of damagedinsulin-producing cells, thus transforming the lives of people living with diabetes. Ourcurrent success in adaptability is a direct by-product of our past, and in the section \"Bringing the Pastto Life,\" we chronicle archaeologist Kathryn Bard's fascinating probe into the 4,000-year-old timbersthat have been unearthed on the Red Sea coast in Egypt, remains from the pharaohs' journeys to anancient kingdom. Just as these relics provide insight into the distant past on another continent, archaeo-logical finds in New England, investigated by BU archaeologist Mary Beaudry , provide insight into thenature of family life in the seventeenth century , from medicinal practices to food preferences.As always, Boston University faculty are mentors and nurturers to the next generation of researchers. In\"Students: Bringing a Fresh Eye to Research,\" we highlight the \"Rhythmic Rehab\" research of Amir Lahav,whose study of the effect of music on brain function facilitated a clinical tool to promote movement instroke patients. Junior Beth Ann Cimini, the recipient of a two-year Beckmann Grant for undergraduateresearch, is working with her neurobiology advisor, Professor Bill Eldred, to investigate how acetylcholineactivates a neurotransmitter in the retina, ultimately unraveling the complexity of a simple visual image. Thispastyearat BU was one of enormous energy and excitement, highlighted by the inauguration of ourtenth president, Dr. Robert A. Brown, Professor of Engineering and a member of the National Academyof Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Underhisleadership, the Schools and Colleges of Boston University have sharpened their focus, strategi-cally planned for the future, and collaborated on interdisciplinary projects that share the core mission ofeducating the best and the brightest to lead in the research of the future. We hope that this magazinechallenges, inspires, and motivates you to learn more about the research endeavors described here aswell as the thousands of other research projects under way on our campuses.

With initiatives such as theKyoto Protocol and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most governments havealso moved from a wait-and-see posture to one of action. Such shifts in public perception have resulted from careful scientific work\u2014andBoston University researchers have been at the fore, engaging the issue on many levels. Fromexamining the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems, to understanding its impactonhuman economies, to engineering ways to reduce human impact on the environment\u2014researchers at BU have developed tools, information, and understanding essential to dealwith this ever-growing challenge. Visualizing Climate ChangeOne of the difficulties in understanding the large-scale consequences associated with climate change is, quite simply , seeing what is happening. Curtis Woodcock, a geographerassociated with the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies and the Center forRemote Sensing, has approached the problem by using satellite imagery and GIS(Geographic Information Systems) data to examine and forecast the impacts of land-usechanges on the carbon cycle. After more than 25 years in the field, Woodcock says that improved satellite imageryand more powerful computer technology have allowed researchers to study larger areasmore efficiently and accurately. He credits the designers of the original Landsat imagingtechnology for building a system that has provided scientists with an invaluable record ofimages, documenting changes on the Earth's surface for more than 30 years.Woodcock focuses on understanding how changes in a particular piece of land alterthe way carbon \"flows\" through that ecosystem. \"If you watch the way the world is changing,reforestation is occurring in some places, like New England,\" says Woodcock, \"while at theMANAGINGACHANGINGCLIMATEThe consequences of global climate change are mind-boggling. The future may seehuge sections of the Earth's polar ice caps melting away; major coastal cities floodingunderrising ocean levels; large portions of tropical rainforests transformed to wasteland;and massive hurricanes and violent tornadoes on a scale never before seen. Geographer Curtis Woodcock and his daughterCleo are standing in front of a satellite photo ofthe region surrounding the Black Sea, an areathat Woodcock studies to reveal how land useand the carbon cycle are related. He hopes thatby better understanding these interrelationships,catastrophic climate changes can be avoidedand the health of our planet can be preservedfor future generations.5Research at Boston University2006 4Research at Boston University2006same time deforestation is happening in the tropics.\" With eachchange made by man\u2014the planting of a field of corn or constructionof a parking lot\u2014comes a change in the carbon dynamics of thatpiece of land. Individually , these alterations may or may not be signifi-cant. But when such changes are looked at cumulatively , on a regionalor global scale, they may have a pronounced impact on ecosystemsand climate patterns. His current work is focused on the area surrounding the Black Seain Georgia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. His work is mademore challenging by the influence of human development in the area. Inthe former Soviet-bloc state of Romania, for example, Woodcock hasobserved the impact of social upheaval on the landscape. Using a seriesof NASA's Landsat satellite images that begin before the collapse of theSoviet Union, Woodcock has observed large, single-crop communescarved up into smaller individually controlled plots. The change in landutilization means a change in the way that carbon flows in and out of theecosystem. \"The fall of communism marked a drastic change in the landuse and carbon dynamics of the region,\" says Woodcock.Even as research is moving ahead, there are uncertainties aboutthe global carbon cycle, a complex series of processes in which carboncirculates between the Earth and its atmosphere. Plants, both terres-trial and aquatic, absorb carbon dioxide (CO2)from the atmosphereand through photosynthesis incorporate, or sequester , carbon atomsinto their biomass. Fossil fuels, produced millennia ago by naturalprocesses that put organic material under enormous pressure, containlarge quantities of sequestered carbon. As they breathe, or respire,both plants and animals release CO2,returning a small portion oftheir carbon to the atmosphere, but most of the carbon stored asbiomass is released only when it decomposes or burns. The differentplaces where carbon is accumulating\u2014the soil, vegetation, and fossilfuels\u2014are called carbon sinks. Current models of atmospheric concentrations of CO2,forinstance, cannot balance the incoming and outgoing CO2,as inputexceeds output. According to Woodcock, finding this \"missing sink\"is a common goal among carbon cycle researchers. Of the approx-imately 7.5 gigatons of CO2added to the atmosphere each yearthrough tropical deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, the fateof nearly 2 gigatons remains uncertain. There are competing theoriesas to where the carbon is going. Some say it is dissolved in the riversof the Amazon; some say it is absorbed in the boreal forests and tun-dra of the northern latitudes. One thing that carbon cycle scientists do agree on is that the continued unchecked burning of fossil fuels, and the freeing of the carbon in the estimated 4,000 gigatons of fossil fuel remaining, havethe potential to cause even more catastrophic shif ts in global climate. Like much climate research today , Woodcock's work has majorpolicy implications. However, he dismisses the idea that climate sciencehas been politicized. \"Anyone who works in the field is serious abouttheir work. Politics does not influence our research or our conclusions,\"hesays. Woodcock also says that his work has ramifications beyond thesphere of climate change. \"The study of land use tells us much abouttheoverall health of our planet, about human impact on biodiversityand onnaturalsystems across the planet.\" To these ends, he workswith GlobalObservationof Forest and Land Cover Dynamics, or GOFC-GOLD, an international organization working to improve the land-usedata available to land managers and researchers.For more information, see www.bu.edu/geography/people/faculty/woodcock.Focus on Forests Ataforest plot in North Carolina, fitted with a special array of sensorsand PVC tubes, biology professor Adrien Finzi observes as increasedloads of carbon dioxide are piped into the air . He is interested in learninghow forests\u2014with their photosynthetic cellular machinery that con-verts carbon dioxide into wood and sugars\u2014may be able to compensatefor increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. According to Finzi'sprojections, by 2050 carbon dioxide levels will be more than 50% higherthan they are now. His research at this experimental forest, owned byDuke University , employs a state-of-the-art system known as free-airCO2enrichment, or FACE, to help researchers better simulate futurehigh CO2conditions.Finzi's data shows that conifers and hardwoods on this plotspeed up their rate of photosynthesis in response to increased CO2levels. The more CO2put into the system, the more efficient thesetrees become at converting atmospheric carbon to sugars and woodycellulose and giving off oxygen. The findings, on the surface, seem tosuggest that the Earth's forests naturally compensate for increasedatmospheric carbon levels; however , Finzi cautions against an over-simplified view. \"As you can imagine, much support for our researchhas come from pro-emissions people,\" says Finzi. \"But they focuson only a fraction of our findings.\" One group, the Greening EarthSociety , actually went so far as to create a campaign that opposed\"globalwarming alarmists,\" stating that increased CO2levels is that pro-emissions proponents selec-tivelyoverlook many important factors. First, he says, the rate at whichcarboniscurrently being introduced into the atmosphere is far greaterthantherateat which the forests can absorb it. Second, the makeup ofthesoilisas important as CO2concentration in determining the rate atwhich forests are able to take up, or sequester, atmospheric carbon. \"In general, the more nitrogen in the soil the higher the rate of carbonsequestration. But not all forests grow in nitrogen-rich areas and aretherefore less able to respond to increases in carbon levels,\" says Finzi.Finally , increased CO2levels in the atmosphere trigger warming thatcauses forests to reach maturity faster\u2014and mature trees metabolizemore slowly and do not take up carbon as quickly. \"The ways that peo-ple are changing the Earth's atmosphere are also causing an overalldeclineinthecapability of the Earth to sequester carbon,\" he says. For further information, see http:/ /people.bu.edu/afinzi.Calculating the CostsCenter for Energy and Environmental Studies (CEES) geographerRobert Kaufmann has taken a different approach to visualizing theproblems associated with climate change. His studies connect thenatural productivity of the land, a measurement called net primaryproduction, or NPP , to economics. \"NPP can be viewed as the 'cur-rency' ofnature,\" says Kaufmann. Using satellite imagery and a vegetation index, or NDVI, he hasmapped the\"value\" of NPP in terms of dollars and cents. He uses hismodeltoestimate the impact of climate change and environmentaldegradation on economic output. Only by assigning a proper economicvaluetoNPP , says Kaufmann, can the true value of a healthy environ-mentand thereal costs of environmental damage be measured. Theeconomics of energy is a complex, interdisciplinary field. Itrequires fluency in disparate studies\u2014from geophysics and geography totheeconomics of oil markets and the political maneuverings of organiza-tions like OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). With degrees in biology , economics, and energy policy , Kaufmannhastherightmix of tools. A basic premise of economics, saysKaufmann, is that in order to understand how much something isworth, you must first know how much there is; in the case of energy ,thismeans calculating a reliable figure of remaining oil supplies.However , Kaufmann says, the prevailing model to calculate supply , Left: An aerial view of the experimental forest near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where biologistAdrien Finzi conducts carbon enrichment experiments. Right:Aview of a free-air CO2enrichmentplot containing the towers that release controlled amounts of CO2into the atmosphere. These pairs of Landsat imagesshow two locations inRomania at two time periods(1990 and 2000). The imagesare false color composites,with vegetated areas appear-ing in brown or reddish tonesand barren areas in light blue.In the first set of images, theforests are primarily com-posed of conifers (dark intone) and show dramaticchange\u2014a significant reduc-tion in conifer forests in 2000as compared with 1990. This is an example of a carbon\"source,\" or an area releasingmore CO2into the atmospherethan it is absorbing. In the second set of images,the forests are primarily hard-wood species that cover mostof the area. The images showvery little change between 1990 and 2000, indicating stableland-use patterns and a locationthat is a carbon \"sink.\"Satellite images such as theseprovide an important record ofhuman actions on the surfaceof the Earth that helps us understand the ways we aremodifying the landscape. With each change made byman\u2014the planting of a fieldof corn or construction of aparking lot\u2014comes a changein the carbon dynamics ofthat piece of land.7Research at Boston University2006 6Research at Boston University2006known as the model\u2014and named after famed geophysicistMarion King Hubbert\u2014is flawed. Kaufmann says that the problem withthe Hubbert model is that it assumes as long as there is oil in theground, supply will increase steadily. By looking at historical data,Kaufmann has found something dif ferent is going on. His analysis of oilproduction data shows that demand, itself , can impact oil production.For instance, in the early 1970s, immediately af ter OPEC tripled theprice for a barrel of oil, the drop in demand caused a subsequent drop inproduction. Kaufmann has incorporated his ideas about the ef fect ofdemand on oil supply into a forecasting model he built for the EuropeanCentral Bank and one he is currently working on for the World Bank.With its social and political implications, Kaufmann's work hasinevitably found its way into the policy realm. In a 2002 white papercalled OilSupply and Oil Politics: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,Kaufmann andCEES director and colleague Cutler Cleveland evaluated the economicimpact of the Bush administration's push to open the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration. Their paper provides adetailed analysis and concludes that the relatively small amount of oilavailable at ANWR would not increase the U.S.'s domestic oil supply inany significant way. They also challenge a view held by many energy economiststhat oil price shocks, and the recessions that follow, result from ourdependency on foreign oil. T o reduce the possibility of price spikes,these economists have lobbied to reduce U.S. dependence on foreignoil\u2014and, by extension, OPEC's price controls. However , Kaufmannand Cleveland have observed that price shocks have little to do withwhereoiliscoming from and more to do with the intrinsic volatilityoftheoilmarket. For example, the jump in oil prices that precededtherecessions of the 1950s and '60s happened while the U.S. pro-duced morethan 80% of its own oil. T oday , the U.S. imports muchmore,over half of the oil it consumes. Kaufmann and Cleveland's conclusion is a sobering one.Skyrocketing demand and flagging production leave little doubt aboutthefuture: \"It's not dependence on foreign oil per se that makes theeconomyvulnerable to price swings, it is the dependence on oil itself,\"theyconclude. Kaufmann says that time is running dangerously shorttomakethetransition to alternative energy sources without majoreconomicand social disruptions. \"Even if we happen to make one ofthelargest oil discoveries we've ever made, with demand increasingthewayithas, the peak comes in the 2030s.\" For more information about the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, see www.bu.edu/cees/.Climate-Friendly Solutions Boston University engineering professors Uday Pal and SrikanthGopalan have taken up Kaufmann's challenge and are designinghydrogen fuel cells\u2014a technology that may someday replace fossil-fuel-burning engines. Pal, who worked as a steel manufactur-ing researcher, an engineer at Westinghouse, and an MIT faculty member before coming to Boston University , also has an interest inreducing the costs associated with the manufacturing industry ,which accounts for an estimated 25% of the world's energy use. Gopalan, who began his career as an engineer at Siemens-Westinghouse before coming to Boston University, says that the promises of hydrogen cell technology are significant; yet, so are thechallenges. One obstacle in using hydrogen as a replacement for fossilfuels is building the infrastructure to produce large quantities of purehydrogen gas. The current methods\u2014electrolysis and steam methanereformation\u2014are both costly and energy intensive. The other chal-lenge, he says, is manufacturing alternative fuel technology inexpen-sively enough to warrant investment from the private sector. Pal and Gopalan have worked together since 2001 designingsolid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that may someday overcome these bar-riers. These are essentially like batteries that generate electricityfrom a reaction between air and fossil fuels. SOFCs, say Pal andGopalan, are highly efficient and emit negligible levels of the pollu-tants emitted by gasoline engines. Though the chemistry involved in SOFCs is relatively simple, themanufacturing methods currently used to produce them are not. Thedifferent parts of the battery\u2014cathode, anode, and electrolyte\u2014 mustbe produced at different temperatures and, therefore, require threeseparate manufacturing phases. Parts must be reheated, thencooled, requiring large energy inputs; these \"extra steps,\" say Paland Gopalan, result in high production costs. Pal and Gopalan are looking to cut these manufacturing costsbymore than half by developing a process that will allow the compo-nents to be fired at a single temperature, reducing the manufactur-ing process to a single step. \"Our process would allow a hugereduction in the manufacturing complexity and cost,\" says Gopalan.Small prototypes produced by the team have been promising andperform comparably to cells produced by traditional means. \"Theimportant thing is that it's simplification without a sacrifice in per-formance.\" Pal and Gopalan envision a wide range of applications fortheir SOFCs\u2014from car engines and residential furnaces, all the wayupto megawatt-generating power plants.Pal and Gopalan say their other project, to produce hydrogenusing a composite material known as an oxide membrane, also holdsgreat promise. Oxide membranes are designed to generate largequantities of pure hydrogen from steam. They work when one side ofthe oxygen-permeable membrane is exposed to steam and the otherside to hydrocarbon gasses. The oxygen from the steam passesthrough the membrane and reacts with the hydrocarbon gasses onthe other side of the membrane\u2014leaving ultra pure hydrogen on the\"steam side\" of the membrane. \"The hydrogen produced with oxidemembranes could be available at 'hydrogen filling stations' for fuel-cell-powered vehicles,\" says Pal. Their novel design is being producedin partnership with private-sector companies. Most importantly , perhaps, is the reduction in greenhouse emis-sions that these cells represent. According to Pal, fuel cells are morethan twice as efficient as the typical gas turbine engine\u2014meaningthat for the same amount of energy , less than half the amount of car-bon dioxide is emitted. And, since the energy-generating reactionsoccurinsealed spaces away from air , production of nitrogen and sulfuroxides\u2014major components of smog\u2014is negligible. Thetworesearchers are also looking to overcome anothermajordrawback ofhydrogen: the difficulty of transport and storage.Currentlyhydrogen gas must be compressed into heavy containersthataredifficult to transport and susceptible to rupture. A possiblesolution, according to Pal, is contained in the bottles of grey sludgelined upontheshelves of his laboratory. He explains that they holdmagnesiumhydride slurry , a liquid in which hydrogen gas can be tem-porarily\"locked up.\" The advantage, says Pal, is that hydrogen gas canbe stored inaslurry at standard temperature and atmospheric condi-tions, thenreleased merely by adding water. Yet, themethod has one major hurdle: it produces hugeamounts ofmagnesium hydroxide\u2014or milk of magnesia\u2014as a by-product. The solution, says Pal, lies in devising a cost-effectivemethod toconvert the waste back to the initial compounds. Facedwith theprospectoflakes of milk of magnesia, Pal smiles, \"Thisproblemwill keep us busy for the next ten years at least.\" Formore information about Uday Pal's research, see http:/ /people.bu.edu/upal/.For about Srikanth Gopalan's research, www.bu.edu/mfg/research/researchlabs/green.shtml.\u2014by Jeremy Above: Engineers Uday Pal (right)andSrikanth Gopalan are developing thetechnologies needed for fuel cells tobecome a viable source of energy fortransportation, heating, and electricity.\"The hydrogen produced with oxide availableat 'hydrogen filling stations' forfuel-cell-powered vehicles.\" \"It'snot dependence on foreign oil per se that makesthe economy vulnerable toprice swings, it is the dependence on oil itself.\"Left: Geographers Robert Kaufmann andCutler Cleveland, colleagues at the Centerfor Energy and Environmental Studies, analyze how social, political, and economicfactors interact to determine available supplies of energy. 9Research at Boston University2006 8Research at Boston University2006Archaeologists like finding firsts\u2014the first tool, the first domesticatedplant, the first fire pit\u2014but Boston University's Department of Archaeologyis a first in its own right. When it was created in 1982, it was the first independent department of archaeology in the United States.As the Department of Archaeology nears its quarter-century mark,members of the department focus on a wide range of geographic areas andtime periods, bringing to bear expertise in classics, art history , anthropology ,earth sciences, geography , and biology. For archaeologists, excavating thepast is not about finding objects to take our breath away , it is about breathinglife back into ancient cultures by understanding their history , politics, economy , and religion. Finding Pharaohs' Ships Mention archaeology and people imagine pith-helmeted scholarsunearthing artifacts from the sands of time in faraway deserts. Minusthe pith helmet, this more or less describes archaeologist Kathryn Bard.At the site of Wadi Gawasis on the Red Sea coast in Egypt, Bard andRodolfo Fattovich, her co-director from the Oriental Institute in Naples,have uncovered timbers from the world's oldest-known seagoing ships.These are all that remain of epic journeys that Egyptian pharaohsorganized to the ancient kingdom of Punt (modern Eritrea and Sudan)almost 4,000 years ago.Punt was the luxury department store of ancient Egypt, thesource of high-status items such as gold, frankincense, and the giraffetails that adorned the belts of the pharaohs. But procuring these itemswas no easy trip to the mall. It was a complex and minutely orches-trated journey. A lack of fresh water prevented the shipbuilders fromliving along the shore during the months it took to construct the ships,so they built them inland in the town of Qina. Traders obtained cedarfrom the mountains of Lebanon and shipped it to the Nile delta, thenupriver to Qina. After the ships were built they were dismantled andBRINGINGTHEPASTTO LIFEKathryn Bard's discoveries onthe Red Sea coast of Ship timbersand cargo boxes from theworld's oldest-known seagoingships; a pottery fragment withan image of a dog; the interiorof Cave 3, used for storage andhousing while ships were beingreassembled. Middle row: Clayseal. University2006 10Research at Boston University2006carried, along with all necessary supplies, on a 10-day trek across the Eastern Desertto the Red Sea. According to a stone stelefound at Wadi Gawasis, one of these expe-ditions involved 3,000 workers and 500sailors. On the coast they reassembled theships and the sailors set sail for Punt.Over the last two years Bard and herteam have uncovered more than 40 shiptimbers, some longer than 12 feet, as well asdozens of stone anchors. They also discov-ered a series of six caves used for storage,and where the work crews may have slept aswell. One cave still contained more than 20bundles of rope used on the ships. Although inscriptions in the NileValley tombs of several pharaohs mentionthese sea voyages, until Bard's discoveries,archaeologists knew little about how theseexpeditions were organized, where theysailed from, or how the Egyptians, notknown as accomplished sailors, managedsuch a long, dangerous voyage. For more information, see www.bu.edu/archaeology/faculty/bard.htm.Digging Up Dirt on New England Families\"I'm not a scientist,\" says BU archaeologist Mary Beaudry , \"but I usewhat scientists can tell me.\" Much of Beaudry's research focuses on thelives of New England families, from the first European settlers to theearly 20th century. By combining information from historical documentsand artifacts with data provided by biologists who study pollen, plantremains, and even insects, she is filling out the picture of how people inNew England lived. \"There are a lot of hidden histories,\" she says, \"andby doing the background research you can meet new people.\"Beaudry has excavated for over a decade at the Spencer-Peirce-Little Farm in Newbury , Massachusetts, originally built circa1690. Her research has provided insights into the changing nature offamily medicine in early New England. She found pollen and plantremains from local herbs in deposits from the 18th century , but sheunearthed patent medicine bottles in 19th-century deposits, indicat-ing that families had abandoned home-grown medicine in favor ofstore-bought preparations. \"Apparently someone was very con-cerned about their hair , because we found a lot of hair restorers,\"Beaudry says.Combining historical records and scientific analysis also helpsBeaudry understand how families used the resources of the farmand surrounding countryside. When she and her crew found bonesand plant remains at the base of a cellar stairwell that had beenblocked by renovations, they conjectured that the finds might be theremains of a dinner given by one of the home's owners. Because theyknew from historical records when the cellar was rebuilt, they coulddate the remains to 1788. Since some of the bones were from youngsuckling pigs, which can only be butchered in the spring, they wereable to identify the season. Finds of pigeons and wild plants toldthemthatthe homeowners gathered food from the surroundingcountryside in addition to what they grew on the farm. The Spencer-Peirce-Little excavations explored farm life, butBeaudry also studies urban archaeology. She's excavated boardinghouses in Lowell where textile factory workers lived and is currentlywriting a book on the archaeology of Boston, much of it based ondiscoveries made by the city archaeologist (one of Beaudry's formerstudents) during the \"Big Dig,\" Boston's two-decade-long highway/tunnel project. In one instance historical records indicate that a brothelmadam married a homeopathic doctor, a fact supported by finds ofhuge hypodermic needles found at the site. \"Cities,\" she notes, \"areplaces where people always find interesting ways to get by.\" For more information, see www.bu.edu/archaeology/faculty/beaudry.htm.Tracing the Chocolate RoadTo t he an c i ent M aya li v in g in B eli z e, G uatemala , an d t he Yuc at an st ateof Mexico, cacao, the basic ingredient of cocoa and chocolate, wasnot just an indulgence\u2014it was the food of the gods and a form ofcurrency. Elite Maya living in major cities, like Chichen Itza in Mexicoand Tikal in Guatemala, used cacao in both religious and political cer-emonies. But those areas were not environmentally suitable for cacaocultivation according to BU archaeologist Patricia McAnany , who istrying to determine who controlled the cacao trade\u2014local villagers ormembers of the elite classes living in important Maya cities. McAnany ,who focuses on questions of economic and political control in ancientsocieties, says \"We can't fully understand ancient societies until weunderstand the basis of their food and luxury crop production.\"During the course of McAnany's Xibun (pronounced shee-boon)Archaeological Project (XARP), \"wild\" cacao trees were found in theXibun River Valley of Belize. There is also ethnohistoric evidence ofcacao cultivation in the region during the 17th century. McAnany'steam is now searching for direct evidence of cacao and trying todetermine whether production in the valley was regulated by out-siders, much as Europe used the Caribbean for sugar production, orwhether local villages controlled production and made alliances withmajor cities to secure their markets. Evidence from throughout the Xibun Valley indicates thataround 825 CE,political power shifted from the old heartland in thewestto cities in the drier north. Inscriptions found at one site in thevalley , known as the Hershey site, link it to Naranjo, a Maya city tothewest. Downriver , on the other hand, three round shrine struc-tures have been discovered. They are similar to a type used atChichen Itza and provide evidence of northern influence.McAnany's team found scattered human bones in a buriedpassageway at the Hershey site that date to just before the city wasabandoned during the 9th century. The remains, males and femalesofvarious ages, indicate that they may have belonged to a family , andteeth that were filed and inlaid with jade indicate wealth and power. Over the last two years Bard and herteam have uncovered more than 40shiptimbers, some longer than 12 feet,as well as dozens of stone anchors.

Mary Beaudry's studies at theSpencer-Peirce-Little Farm inNewbury,Massachusetts, built inthe late 17th century, have yieldedinsights about the changing natureof family life in early New England.13Research at Boston University2006 12Research at Boston University2006McAnany thinks that the crypt of an impor-tant family may have been desecrated, orthat they were possibly murdered\u2014eithercase pointing to a shift in power . While the north was clearly becomingmore important, it is not clear whether it wasactively controlling cacao production in theXibun Valley. Graduate students workingwith McAnany are currently analyzing potteryfound throughout the valley to determine if itwas made locally or imported. The bones ofan elite male burial are undergoing isotopicanalysis to determine his place of birth. Hisexcellent physical condition (his bones indi-cate the well-developed musculature of awarrior or a ball player) and a carved trophyskull found in his grave are proof of his highstatus. Since bones preserve chemical tracesfrom the region where people grew up,McAnany is trying to determine if this man'schemistry is similar to that of other skeletonsfound in the Xibun Valley. If his bone chem-istry is not a match, it will indicate that out-siders had important roles in the political andeconomic life of the valley.Although McAnany focuses on smallersites rather than major cities, her goal is tounderstand the interplay of politics, eco-nomics, and religion in the broader Mayasociety.\"I comeat it from an economicangle,but I am studying it in context withtherest of society ,\" she explains.For more information, seewww.bu.edu/tricia/reports/xarp2004/.Reading Human History in the Earth Geoarchaeologist Paul Goldberg studies the geology of archaeologicalsites. He compares analyzing layers of earth found at sites to reading\"a crazy language where the translation code isn't ready yet.\" Unlikemost archaeologists, who excavate while sweating under a hot sun,Goldberg mainly works in caves throughout Europe, Africa, and Asiathat were home to early hominids, including Homo erectus,Neanderthals, and the earliest Homo sapiens.Goldberg's method of choice is micromorphology , the microscopicstudy of undisturbed sediments and soils. He collects blocks of sedimentfrom archaeological sites, carefully packages them to keep them fromfalling apart, and ships them back to his lab at BU. There he soaks themin polyester resin, essentially turning the once loose sediment into a rock.He cuts the blocks into sections thinner than a sheet of notebook paperand studies them under a microscope, much as other geologists studyrock samples. Under the microscope the sections reveal what is in thesediment and what mineralogical and physical changes have occurred.And because this technique preserves the original internal integrity ofthe soil/sediment sample and its individual components, Goldberg canalso determine how the sediment was deposited, whether grains of sedi-ment washed in or whether they fell from the roof of the cave. The focus of the research is to understand how early hominidsused fire. Archaeologists consider the ability to start and maintain afire an important indication of a hominid's cognitive development.Not only could fire-using hominids move into and exploit colder ter-ritories, they could also cook food, making it easier to digest andperhaps giving them an adaptive advantage. But because these sites are so old, identifying fires can be diffi-cult. Archaeologists working at the site of Zhoukoudian, in China, hadclaimed for decades that the site contained fires dating back almost700,000 years. Although previous studies showed that they did con-tain burned bone and possibly organic matter , Goldberg's examinationof thin sections of the putative hearth layers revealed that sedimenthad been deposited by flowing water . He argues that any possiblyburned material was in fact washed into the cave and was not evidenceof fires as the original excavators had thought.In his latest research project, funded by the National ScienceFoundation, Goldberg is studying fire sites from Neanderthal settle-ments in Europe and the Middle East with an international team ofspecialists from Spain, Germany , and Italy. These fire sites rangefrom 50,000 to 200,000 years old. Goldberg calls the sites \"mini-Pompeiis.\" By studying the fire sites microscopically and identifying thetypes of fuel used, how hot the fire was, and how long it was used,Goldberg and his associates hope to create a clearer picture ofNeanderthal behavior . He hopes that by comparing Neanderthals'use of fire with that of early modern humans, he can translate thetraces of charcoal and ash into an understanding of what constitutes\"modern behavior\" and what might be some of the dif ferences thathelped humans survive while their Neanderthal cousins went extinct.Formore information, see http://people.bu.edu/paulberg.Investigating Ancient People and PlantsArchaeologist Ksenija Borojevic began her research at an early age.When she was ten she constructed a museum of \"old things\" for hermother's 40th birthday\u2014complete with an exhibition guide, a guestbook, and an entrance fee. Her mother may have appreciated thegift, but her parents, both plant geneticists, were not thrilled withher ultimate career choice. They wondered why she wanted to lookat the past instead of the future, and of course they worried that shewould never find a job. But Borojevic persevered and in 2005 shejoined the archaeology faculty at Boston University. She did follow inher parents' footsteps in one regard\u2014her research focuses on paleo-ethnobotany , the study of how ancient people used plants. \"Archaeologists often look at the pots and forget to thinkabout what's inside of them,\" she says. \"But by studying plantremains we can learn about the local environment, what season ofthe year people lived at a site, what they ate, how they farmed, andwhat kind of medicinal plants they used.\" Borojevic collects plantremains by pouring samples collected during excavation into spe-cially designed \"flotation tanks\" that allow sediment to sink to thebottom while the lighter seeds rise to the top. Once collected, sheidentifies each seed under a microscope.Much of her research focuses on the village of Opovo, Serbia,that was occupied during the Late Neolithic period, from 4700 to4500 BCE,when Europeans first learned to farm domesticatedplants. While paleoethnobotanists often focus on major food sources,principally wheat and other grains, Borojevic looks at all of theremains from a site. While she found domestic wheat and barley atOpovo, she also found that the villagers used many wild plants,including water chestnuts. Archaeologists had thought that oncepeoplebegan to farm, domesticated grains became their major food,but Borojevic's research demonstrates that early farmers at Opovocontinued to eat a wide variety of foods gathered from the wild. As the principal archaeobotanist at another site, Tel Megiddoin Israel, Borojevic studies plant remains from a city that was animportant crossroads of the ancient world. She is also involved instudying plant remains at Tel Kedesh, a Hellenistic period site (ca.2nd century BCE)in the Upper Galilee of modern Israel, and at otherarchaeological sites in southeastern Europe.

These frogs live in trees and laytheir eggs in a gelatinous clump, or clutch, stuck to leaves overhanging water . The eggs facemany risks, including predatory wasps, a pathogenic fungus, drowning, and the four snakespecies that consider them dinner . In her graduate research, Warkentin showed that treefrog eggs can hatch up to 30%early if necessary by wriggling within the egg and dropping into the pond below to becomeatadpole. \"Before that, people didn't think that eggs responded behaviorally until theyhatched,\" says Warkentin. A new interest in the behavioral ecology of eggs was triggered byher discovery that these embryos are not merely passively awaiting birth, but activelyresponding to their environment. The time of hatching is a crucial switch point between the frogs' egg and waterstages. An early hatch, even two days, is a very risky decision, Warkentin explains: it's like ahuman being born three months premature. Choosing between getting eaten by a snake orfacing predators in the pond is not taken lightly by vulnerable embryos. \"A snake could stareat the clutch all day and the embryos wouldn't budge,\" she says; however , early hatchingcan be induced by vibrations made by an attacking snake. And, according to Warkentin, red-eyed treefrog embryos can distinguish between recordings of vibrations from a snake attackand those produced by harmless rain.T o learn how the eggs use vibrational cues to distinguish between signs of danger andabenign disturbance, Warkentin teamed up with Michael Caldwell, a graduate student inLEARNING TOAllanimals, from fruit flies to human beings, need to adapt to changing environments.Biologists at Boston University study a multitude of creatures\u2014escape-artist treefrogs,pugnacious lobsters, busy beavers, indigobird mimics, and multitasking ants.

Working with synthetic white noise, they varied both theduration of the vibrations and the spacing between them. Theyfound that the embryos responded only to vibration patterns similarto those produced by snake attacks. But snake attacks are only one of the risks that treefrogs face. Ifthey make it into the water and survive a vast array of predators underthe surface, they face another risk when attempting to leave the pondas juveniles. Fishing spiders patrol the surface of the pond, just waitingfor the froglets to \"run the gauntlet James Vonesh, she recentlydemonstrated that tadpoles can delay metamorphosis in response to aperceived risk in the next stage of life: in this case, fishing spiders. Shehopes thatlearning more about risk-sensitive hatching and metamor-phosiswill lead to an understanding of how such plasticity affects theoverall ecology of treefrog populations. This research was published in the April 15, 2006 issue of The Journal ofExperimental Biologyand theMarch 2006 issue of Ecology.To see a early hatching, visit http:/ /people.bu.edu/kwarken/.Beavers, Beavers Everywhere Acentury ago, there were virtually no beavers in Massachusetts.Farmers in the state had cleared beaver habitat for pasture and crop-land, and the population of the North American beaver dwindled.Restoration campaigns during the last half of the 1900s and a declinein the fur market returned them to a near-original range, and todaythe beaver population seems to be growing exponentially. Between1996 and 2001, the beaver population grew from 24,000 to nearly70,000 animals. Beavers are beneficial for the environment becausethey dam streams, expanding the wetlands which in turn filtergroundwater and provide habitat for other wildlife. But beavers canalso be a nuisance to humans, damaging property , contaminatingwater supplies, and flooding roads and buildings. Many people want to harvest beavers to control these threats,but biologist Peter Busher suggests a more passive approach. \"My oldadvisor puts it this way ,\" he says. \"Either you love beavers or you hatethem, and that depends on whether they're doing positive or nega-tive things for you.\" Busher says that the high numbers may not rep-resent the true population across the state because beavers tend tolive in small groups, making their population difficult to estimate.Also, the beaver population is dynamic; beaver families may try outone area but move on the next year if it turns out not to be suitablehabitat. Dispersal of young adults also affects mating and rearingbehavior . Two-year-old beavers leave the parent territory to findmates, so an extended period of migration can delay reproduction. Busher adds that the high rate of increase seen in beaver pop-ulations, while alarming to residents whose trees have been cut orbasements flooded, may not be a permanent trend. For years, Busherhas been monitoring beaver populations on Prescott Peninsula, thestrip of land between the east and west sections of QuabbinReservoir that is off limits to visitors. After plotting the number ofbeavers on the peninsula over the past half-century , he noticed thatthe population grew exponentially at first, reached a brief plateau,and then fell to stabilize at 25% of its peak.Many regions in the state are in the expansion phase, Busherexplains, because they haven't had beavers as long as the reservoirhas. He says that although it seems like a big problem now, some ofthose areas are not suitable habitats for beavers and the animals willeventually move on. \"The state is just lagging behind the peninsula,\"Busher says. \"We have studied how the natural population [in theabsence of human impact] has grown and then decreased on thepeninsula. This understanding can be applied to populations that arebutting up against humans where conditions are less favorable forthe beavers. If you give an area 25 years, it will stabilize at somelower level.\"The issue at hand, he explains, may be one of human toler-ance. \"It's what wildlife people would call the 'cultural carryingcapacity'. Howmuch will humans put up with?\" There manybenefits totolerating the beavers, he says. \"Weneed tobe more aware of our place in the whole ecosys-temand learn to live with wildlife,\" Busher says. If people can learntolivewith beavers now, they will reap environmental benefits andthebeaverproblem will most likely take care of itself.

Each spring he collects anew crop of lobsters from the waters near his laboratory in WoodsHole, Massachusetts\u2014for his observation tank, not for his dinnertable\u2014where he investigates this crustacean's curiously fine senseof smell. After arriving on Cape Cod in the 1970s from his native homein the Netherlands, Atema searched for a model animal to reveal thesecrets of chemical messaging between aquatic species. Lobsters, itturned out, proved to be a very good model for learning about socialcommunication. He has studied them for decades, producing awealth of knowledge about chemical communication in this species. Atema's recent work reveals even more complexity in what hecalls the \"underwater odor world.\" The whole social structure of lob-sters is held together by chemical recognition of dominance, sex dif-ferences, and molting state, he explains. \"It's remarkable that whathumans consider a higher-animal behavior is found in what's knownas a lower animal.\" Male lobsters fight to establish dominance, andthe losing male, in subsequent encounters, will back down to avoidanother fight with a previous victor. The animals identify each otherindividuallyby \"smelling\" odors in urine released during the fight. Lobsters have five major chemoreceptive organs on a varietyof antennae and hairs projecting from their heads and legs. One hairtype, known as aesthetasc sensilla, leads directly to the olfactory(odor-receptive) area of the brain. Y ou can see them flick in a quickdownstroke, a sniffing-like action, says Atema. He hypothesized thatreceptors in these hairs might allow lobsters to recognize an individ-ual's unique scent.T o test the theory , Atema pitted male lobsters, either with orwithout the hairs, against one another in a fight for dominance. Inround two, he measured how long the weaker lobster challenged thedominant one. Male lobsters that had their aesthetasc sensillaremoved spent longer challenging the dominant males, seeming notto remember their vanquishers from round one. \"Without anydoubt,\" Atema says, \"this experiment shows that for individualrecognition lobsters need aesthetasc sensilla.\"Atema's newest collection of lobsters will help him search forthe specific urine chemicals to which the hairs react. The immunesystem of humans and other vertebrate animals is based on gene fam-ilies called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These genesgenerate chemicals that protect the body from foreign invaders andprovide individual odors. \"Now comes the kicker ,\" says Red-eyed treefrog embryoscan distinguish betweenrecordings of vibrations and those produced by harmless rain. Above: Asnake attack on a clutch oftreefrog eggs may induce early hatching.Below: Treefrogs producing a clutch ofeggs on a hanging leaf.Right: According to biologist Peter Busher,beavers such as this one are beneficial tothe environment, creating wetlands thatfilter groundwater and provide habitat forother wildlife. 19Research at Boston University2006 18Research at Boston University2006invertebrates like lobsters, no MHC system isknown. So how do they do it?\" His next step is to painstakingly honedown the list of urine chemicals to the onesessential for individual recognition. Heexpects that it might be a protein of similarstructure and size to the MHC, but becausethis is \"totally novel research,\" Atema says,his mind is open to all possibilities. \"As soonas you know the chemistry , a whole newworld opens up because you can talk aboutthe evolution of these substances, theirsources, their function besides recognition,and their role in neurobiology.\" to unexplored territory: that we just don't know what we'llfind whenwegetthere.\"This research was published in the August 1, 2005,issue of The Journal of Experimental Biology.To findout more about the Boston University MarineProgram, visit www.bu.edu/bump/.For the theory of sympatric speciation to hold weight, behaviors,like song preferences, must lead to reproductive isolation, and ultimatelyan inability for the birds from two different groups to interbreed at all.Along with his collaborator and former advisor Robert Payne, a Universityof Michigan biologist, Sorenson has been studying two \"races\" of theCameroon indigobird that dif fer only in their One parasitizes theAfrican firefinch, the other the black-bellied firefinch. He explains, \"Wethink they may represent two reproductively isolated populations in thevery beginning stages of speciation.\" To te st t he overall mo del of s y mp at r ic s p e c i at ion in t h is g ro up,Sorenson and former student Chris Balakrishnan designed an experi-ment to play back the mimicked host songs to the males of eachgroup. As expected, the indigobirds that grew up in the nests ofAfrican firefinches were agitated by hearing mimicked African fire-finch songs, responding as if to a competitor for female interest. Moreimportantly , if the mimicked black-bellied firefinch song was played,the showed no interest, is definitely plausible,\" Sorenson says, \"and wehave just about all the pieces of the puzzle.\" Such behavioral reproductive isolation may eventually lead toenough genetic changes over time to turn the races into recognizably dif-ferent species, but the evolution of a new species is not immediate. \"Youmight have to come back in 20,000 years or so,\" Sorenson says. \"But weknow it has happened in the past, because we have ten species of indigo-birds today , each with different hosts.\" Sorenson is now expanding hisobservations to indigobird populations in East Africa. The driving force ofthisresearch, hesays, is to understand how evolution has produced thediversity of life on this planet. \"Indigobirds are just a unique and fascinat-ing example of things working a little bit differently than the usual.\" This research appears in the May/June 2006 issue of Behavioral Ecology.Formore information, visit http:/ /people.bu.edu/msoren.Nurses, Foragers, and SoldiersIn many ant species, age correlates with an individual's role in thecolony. Y oung ants of the worker caste toil within the nest, while olderants leave the nest for riskier tasks. Biologists have assumed that suchbehavior is programmed: that age-related changes are caused by neu-ral and physiological development, and as ants age, they shift amongnon-overlapping tasks. But, according to biologist James Traniello, thismight not be the whole story. Traniello studies the behavior and neurobiology of the ant Pheidoledentatafor clues to how social insects divide labor among colony mem-bers. P. d e n t a t ais a completely dimorphic species, meaning that workersareeither minors who perform most labor within a colony , or majorswho,with their large heads and strong mandibles, are primarily defend-ers and food processors. In the paradigm, young minors specialize inbrood care. \"They're basically nurses,\" says T raniello. At about twentydays old, they start foraging. T ask sets are thought to be segregated, heexplains. \"Nurses are only nurses and foragers are only foragers. Butwe've found that the traditional model might not be correct.\"Traniello observed that the minors start as nurses but retain theability to perform nursing tasks as they age. \"In a large number of Evolution of a Con ArtistEvolutionary biologists traditionally thought that for new species to evolve,groups of animals had to be geographically separated long enough thatthey became unable to interbreed. This classic view is known as allopatricspeciation. The possibility that new species might develop in the same geo-graphical area, known as sympatric speciation, is less accepted amongbiologists, but may be possible if groups become reproductively isolated byphysiology , genetics, or behavioral quirks. The case for sympatric speciation is made stronger by the find-ings of biologist Michael Sorenson, who sees evidence in the fascinat-ing behavior of indigobirds. Sorenson and his graduate students travelto Tibati, Cameroon, to study indigobirds that display brood parasitism,aphenomenon that he says floored him the first time he learned of it.The birds lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. The youngindigobirds look and act like the hosts' chicks, so the hosts are trickedinto raising the imitators as their own. As the birds become adults, theylearn to sing the hosts' song and use both it and their native indigobirdsongs to attract mates. About ten species of indigobirds display brood parasitism,Sorenson explains, and each species lays its eggs in the nests of a spe-cific host. Because the birds will only mate with other indigobirds thatwere raised in nests of their own hosts, they become reproductively iso-lated from indigobirds with different hosts. \"Indigobirds are just a uniqueand fascinating example ofthingsworkingalittle bit differently than the usual.\" Top: Jelle Atema's research has identified specializedhairs on the heads of male lobsters that allow them torecognize each other individually by odor.Right: The indigobird Vidua senegala(bottom). These species arefound in and around Lochinvar National Park in Zambia. colonies we saw that older workers did more than their normal foragingtasks. Theyadded tasks as they matured,\" he says, \"undergoing up to asix-fold increase in tasks from day one to day twenty.\" His researchshowed that young ants with weak mandible muscles are ill-suited forriskiertasks. \"They're simply not ready to work efficiently , so as theymature they add more work as they are able.\" Traniello has also experi-mentally removed members of a colony and shown that ants take over theroles of the missing castes. \"They switch tasks almost immediately ,\" hesays, suggesting that they are readily able to perform a variety of jobs.Together with graduate student Mario Muscedere and under-graduates Tara Willey and Jennifer Berglund, Traniello is to determine if age- and size-related behav-iors are correlated with neurology. In recent work, graduate student MarcSeid found that levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine andserotonin increased as minor workers matured. He also found age-correlated changes in the connectivity and strength of synapses, themessage-trafficking connections between neurons. \"This is the patterninmany organisms; they start with synapses, then prune them. Wefound that ants were doing the same thing, supporting our hypothesisthatthey gain abilities as they grow by refining neural connections.\" Ashecontinues to correlate ant behavior with neurobiology to better understand the remarkable adaptability of insectbehavior and the source of their complex social structure.

Aresearcherin a biology department might study how heart cells react during a myocardial infarction,while a physician at a medical school attempts to treat a patient having a heart attack. But anew idea in medical research, called translational medicine, breaks through the tower walls,bringing research from the lab bench to the bedside.

MOVING RESEARCH INTO ACTION When David Damiano (center)wasdiagnosed with type 1 diabetesbefore his first birthday, BU biomed-ical engineer Ed Damiano and hiswife, pediatrician Toby Milgrome,began working on an automated system able to mimic the body's natural glucose regulation system.Damiano hopes to begin first trialson patients in a closely monitoredclinical setting within a year.APersonal Research AgendaOnerecipientofaCoulter grant is biomedical engineer Ed Damiano. For many years he did whathecalls \"basicscience stuf f ,\" investigating the biomechanics of the circulation system. But sixyears agohewas drawn to an entirely new field of research. His son, then not yet a year old, wasdiagnosed with type 1 diabetes, historically referred to as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes.Thedisease requires constant vigilance, including frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels,close attention to diet and exercise, and either multiple daily insulin injections or continuousinsulininfusion with an insulin pump. Spurred bytheexperience of living with a child with type 1 diabetes, Damiano began towork onanautomated system that would continually measure glucose levels and provideinsulinas needed\u2014a system that would mimic the natural function of the insulin-producingcells ofthepancreas. He recruited his wife, pediatrician T oby Milgrome, in this effort.Almosttwomillion Americans have type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which thebodyattacks theinsulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The trigger for the attack isunknown. Without insulin, most of the body's cells are unable to absorb and use the glucose thatfuels cellprocesses. The glucose remains in the bloodstream where high glucose levels can lead toarangeofproblems including kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, high blood pressure, heartattack, and stroke. \"There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, but if people can maintain their bloodglucose withinthe normal range, they can reduce and possibly eliminate the deleterious conse-quences oftype 1 diabetes,\" says Damiano. \"But,\" fluctuate23Research at Boston University2006 22Research at Boston University2006constantly (especially after meals), even intensivetherapy fails to adjust insulin levels to their every riseand fall.\"Insulin pumps, devices the size of a cell phonethat administer insulin through a small catheterimplanted in the skin, are an increasingly commontreatment alternative. These devices provide a baselinedosage of insulin throughout the day and the patientadministers a bolus (or additional dose) when glucoselevels increase (most commonly af ter meals). But toknow how much additional insulin is needed, glucoselevels must be checked several times a day using asmall meter that tests a tiny drop of blood. Damianoand his wife check their son twelve times a day , morethan most. Damiano, his research team, and Milgrome aredesigning a more automated system that combines aninsulin pump with a device to automatically measureglucose levels every few minutes via an electrochemi-cal wire embedded in the skin. A small computer chipwill use this data to instruct the device to deliver moreinsulin if needed. Although the system uses technology alreadyapproved by the FDA, some technical hurdles remain.The meter they are using tests interstitial fluids, notblood. Glucose levels in these fluids lag behind and arelessconcentrated relative to blood glucose. Since it istheblood glucose levels that must be treated, thisposes a problem. One of Damiano's former graduatestudents, Firas El-Khatib (now a his original glucose-control algo-rithm bydeveloping a scheme that translates the glu-cose measurements from the interstitial fluid intoestimates of blood glucose.Also,theindividual pieces of technology mustcommunicate with each other . Damiano and El-Khatibhavealready tested the system on pigs, by combiningwirelessly actuated insulin pumps, a glucose meter ,and theircontrol algorithm running on a laptop com-puter.They had to sedate the pigs to keep them fromrunning around and upsetting the system. They plan touse theCoulter grant to build a system that can bemountedon a pig's back and tested while the pigs areawakeand active. Damiano is also looking ahead to introducingtheirsystem to people with diabetes. He hopes to beginhisfirsttrials on patients in a closely monitored clinicalsetting, using a non-portable system, within a year\u2014andthinks a fully portable system could be ready to test intwotothree years. \"I have a deadline,\" says Damiano. \"Ihaveto have this ready before my son goes to college.\"For more information, seewww.bu.edu/dbin/bme/faculty/?prof=edamiano.High-tech DisposablesFor some life-threatening diseases, treatments exist but the route todiagnosis is costly , slow, and cumbersome. Often health-care workersmust wait hours or even days for laboratory test results before theycan diagnose and treat patients. Workers in the field or in developingcountries, without access to expensive equipment or even a powersupply , can face a daunting task in reaching even the most straight-forward diagnosis.Biomedical engineer Catherine Klapperich, another Coulteraward winner , is developing a small, disposable diagnostic device,sometimes referred to as a \"lab-on-a-chip\" that may eliminate thisproblem and allow point-of-care testing and field-based analysiseven in remote areas. She and her students are conducting the initialwork to develop a range of labs-on-chips to diagnose dangerous bacterial infections or signal the presence of biomarkers that maypredict life-threatening events. One chemical that Klapperich is targeting is C-reactive protein(CRP). This biomarker of heart disease can predict a second event forsomeone who's had a previous heart attack or even a first event forseemingly healthy patients. T raditionally , physicians determine levels ofCRP by taking a vial of blood, spinning it down in a centrifuge, removingthe serum layer , and performing a lengthy test called an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). \"With a traditional ELISA you are wash-ing the thing half the day ,\" Klapperich says, referring to the many stepsinvolved in the test. \"We want something that is quick, disposable, andsimple to use, and that has an easy-to-read output.\" Her solution is a plastic chip a few inches long, imprinted withmicrofluidic channels each roughly the size of a human hair . Thesechannels have a very high surface to volume ratio, speeding theELISA reaction and reducing the length of the test to less than 30minutes. A chemiluminescent substrate reacts with antibodies thatbind CRP to produce an image on instant film that can be easily readby a health worker . The chip's disposability , speed of analysis, and small samplerequirement, says Klapperich, might make it ideal for a wide range ofbiomarkers. She is also working on a version of the chip to detectinfluenza viruses and help control the spread of a flu pandemic. Theclassic way to diagnose influenza infection is with a hemagglutinationassay , which indicates a flu virus is present but not which strain. T odiagnose a specific flu, a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) must be runto amplify the DNA. By replacing the ELISA step with a PCR step, theresearchers hope to detect the specific flu virus quickly so that stepscan be taken to combat its spread.Another worrisome invader is C. dif ficile,abacterium thatcauses debilitating diarrhea, often in patients who are already sickand taking antibiotics for other illnesses. Experts also worry thatantibiotic resistance may make C. dif ficilemore virulent over time.The current test to diagnose C. dif ficileinfection involves a 2-4 daywait to see if the patient's fecal sample kills cultured fibroblasts, butit provides no information about the strain of bacteria infecting thepatient. Klapperich's PCR device could enable a quick and preciseanalysis of the infection by purifying and extracting its nucleic acids,and prevent inappropriate usage of antibiotics.\"I'm really interested in making a dif ference by enabling point-of-care diagnosis of emerging diseases in poor countries,\" she says. \"Whatwe're facing is primarily an engineering problem\u2014bringing the testdown to a tiny scale and making something that can be manufactured inquantity.\" The main hurdle is sample preparation, either filtering bloodto remove proteins or lysing tough bacterial cells to isolate the nucleicacids. Klapperich adds that if they can succeed in developing a field-based tool, without the need for external power or a refrigerator tostore reagents, then they can start thinking about the device's utility indeveloping countries. \"Y ou could actually change the spread of somenasty diseases with this device.\"For more information, see www.klapperichlab.org.Preventing Damaged LungsThe hum and hiss of ventilators pushing air into the lungs of patientswho cannot breathe on their own are common sounds in intensivecareunits and operating rooms. For most, these ventilators are lifesaving, butsome patients develop a serious complication calledVentilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI), a condition with a mortalityrate of 30-40%. Biomedical engineer Bela Suki's research focuses primarily onunderstanding the biomechanical properties of lungs that contributeto cell damage, but with the support of a Coulter grant he is also \"I'm really interested in mak-ing a difference by enablingpoint-of-care diagnosis diseases in poorcountries.\" Biomedical engineerCatherine Klapperich inexpensive,rapid, point-of-care diag-nosis of serious diseasesin developing countries. Biomedical engineer Bela Suki'sresearch may help prevent serious complications that canoccur when hospital patientsneed to be put on ventilators. 25Research at Boston University2006 24Research at Boston University2006developing a novel system that he hopes will pre-vent VILI and help thousands of patients every year . Suki looks at lungs as basic biomechanicaldevices that stretch and contract ten times everyminute. While many researchers focus on the biol-ogy of lungs and the presence of enzymes or otherchemicals that affect how lungs work, Suki arguesthat mechanical factors have a huge impact as well.When hospital patients are put on a ventilator ,it pushes air into their lungs then lets them exhale.Doctors calculate the volume and rate of the air tobe forced in with a standard chart that considers aperson's height, weight, and age. But a small numberofpatients develop complications. \"Even if therewere no problems with your lungs initially , themachine can cause problems,\" Suki says. He suspectsthat if a patient's lungs are being over-inflated celldamage may result, leading to fluid accumulation inthe lungs and further complications. If part of a lungcollapses, but the ventilator continues to push thesame amount of air into the reduced space, over-stretching and damage may also occur.Suki notes that while ventilators use a con-stant volume and rate of air , our breathing normallyvaries: sometimes we breathe deeply , other timesnot. He hasdeveloped a method of variable ventila-tionthatuses analgorithm to adjust the flow of airfromventilator to patient. In tests on guinea pigs,rats, and sheephe found that the method not onlyprevents injury but also allows more air to get fromthelungs into the bloodstream. He is awaiting FDAapproval to test the system in humans. During the 15 years that he has been atBostonUniversity , Suki has collaborated withresearchers in a number of tothe School of Medicine. \"Y ou findalmosteverything here,\" he says.For more information, seewww.bu.edu/dbin/bme/faculty/?prof=bsuki.Protecting the HeartMany of us think of fat as the lard-like stuff that expands our waist-lines. But according to Ken Walsh, a biochemist at the BU MedicalCenter's Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute, fat is also an organ thatpumps out a variety of chemical messengers. Walsh has spent thelast few years trying to understand how these chemicals affect ourbodies, and his current work focuses on a particular chemical, calledadiponectin, that may protect the heart and blood vessels.While fat stores energy , it also produces a wide variety of hor-mones. Some stimulate the immune system, protecting against infec-tion, but excess fat may produce inflammation, giving rise to a statein which the immune system is constantly revving its engine. Adiponectin is one hormone produced by fat cells that helpsprevent inflammation. Curiously , levels of adiponectin for unknownreasons are inversely proportional to fat levels\u2014that is, obese peoplehave low levels of the hormone and lean people have high levels.Studies in mice have shown that low adiponectin levels are not simplyassociated with heart disease but actually help cause it. With his Coulter award Walsh is investigating possible clinicaluses for adiponectin. One promising possibility is as a treatment toreduce the injury to heart tissue associated with heart attacks, alsoknown as myocardial infarctions. Studies have shown that a one-timeadministration of adiponectin immediately following a myocardialinfarction will significantly minimize damage and improve heartfunction in experimental models. Walsh is currently working with colleagues at Boston University to search for other molecules thatfunction in a similar way. Walsh credits much of the success of his research to the interdis-ciplinary and stimulating environment at the Whitaker CardiovascularInstitute. \"Here,\" he says, \"walls practically don't exist.\" For about the Institute, seewww.bumc.bu.edu/bumc/wci.\u2014by Trina Arpin\"High-tech Disposables\" by Leah EisenstadtIf knew the pattern of airwayconstriction in a particular patient,they could tailor medications torespond to that pattern. ANew View of AsthmaAnother researcher helping people breathe easier isbiomedical engineer Ken Lutchen. Recently appointedDean of the College of Engineering, Lutchen haschaired the Department of Biomedical Engineering forthe past eight years and spearheaded both the $14 mil-lion Whitaker Leadership Award and the CoulterFoundation translational research grant. At the sametime he has been actively engaged in teaching and men-toring students as well as working in the lab where he isdeveloping a new understanding of how airways con-strict during asthma attacks.Asthma is a rapidly growing disease. It currentlyaffects 300 million people worldwide and is increasingat a rate of 50% every decade according to theCanadian Lung Association. Lutchen is developing animage-driven modeling system to give doctors a real-time picture of what happens in the lungs during anattack so that they will be able to design more personal-ized and effective treatments.When people suf fer an asthma attack, theinflamed airways constrict, reducing their size and mak-ing itmore dif ficult for air to flow freely. In some patientsasthmaattacks occur when the immune system overre-acts to allergens like pollen or dander . In other patientsinflammation is provoked by a wide variety of factors,including stress and exercise. When attacks occur , mostpatients take medications to minimize inflammation andrelax the muscles of the lungs.Just as the causes of asthma can vary , the reac-tion of the lungs can differ as well. The airways in thelungs are like intricately branching trees. In somepatients, asthma may constrict many of the smallestbranches farthest away from the main trunk. In otherpatients, fewer but larger branches may constrict. If doctors knew the pattern of airway constrictioninaparticular patient, they could tailor medications torespond to that pattern. Lutchen's image-based model-ing system may be able to give doctors this information.Hissystem feeds information from a three-dimensionalMRI image of the lungs and data about how much air ismoving in and out of the lungs into a computer model.Themodel calculates which size airways must be closingdown to produce this pattern of response. Tests so far have shown that in most patients,very small airways contribute to asthma attacks in verybig ways. Armed with this information about eachpatient's response, doctors can choose those drug ther-apies that best target the affected airways\u2014and helpasthma patients breathe a little easier .

Most people agree that exercising and eating right canreduce the risk of developing heart disease, but what about tooth brushing, flossing, or treatinggum infections? Oral biologist Salomon Amar says that treating an infection, whether it's herpes,pneumonia, or gum disease, may be one route to lower the risk of systemic diseases like heart orpulmonary disease. Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between atherosclerosis (hardening of thearteries) and severe periodontal disease (a chronic bacterial infection of the gums). Evidencefrom Amar's lab supports this hypothesis, indicating that infection causes an inflammatoryresponse in the body which may trigger systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis. This line ofresearch has enormous implications for dental health care. \"People will take better care of theirteeth if they know it can prevent heart disease,\" says Amar. In earlier research, Amar had shown that people with severe gum disease often have dys-function of the endothelium lining blood vessels, a sign of cardiovascular trouble. He also foundhigher levels of disease markers in their blood plasma, including the bacteria themselves, theirby-products, or inflammatory mediators produced in response to the bacteria entering thebloodstream. \"But,\" says Amar, \"if you treat the infection you drastically reduce the chance ofdeveloping systemic disease.\" To te st w het her t re at in g g um infe ct ion mig ht re duc e e v iden c e of he ar t dis e a s e, A margathered a group of eight people with periodontal disease and treated them with scaling, rootplaning, and surgery. He found drastic improvement in the function of endothelial cells liningblood vessels and less inflammation in all the subjects who received intensive periodontal treat-ment. Amar is currently conducting a phase II/III clinical trial to confirm these findings in a largergroup of subjects. Aware that the progress from infection to inflammation and systemic disease is not anisolated one, Amar is now studying obesity , a condition that may complicate the pathway. In newstudy results, he found that obese animals were incapable of mounting an adequate immuneresponse to infection, produced lower levels of immune chemicals to fight infection, and hadinfections that lasted longer, potentially harming healthy cells. In addition, he found that theactivity of enzymes, such as kinases, known to be critical to the molecular pathways thatrespond to inflammation, were dysfunctional in obese animals. These results suggest that obesitymay be a factor in reducing an organism's ability to fight infection and potentially play a role inchronic infection, systemic disease, and lower quality of life. Amar is planning a clinical trial that will compare immune responses in patients with anormal body mass index (BMI under 25) and obese subjects (BMI over 35). He hopes that byfurther elucidating obesity's role in the pathway that leads from infection to systemic diseasehe may also help explain why obesity poses such a danger to overall health.

The chimpanzee genome, for example,differs from the human genome by only a few percent. \"The big question I wanted to ask was, 'Whatgeneticsequences make us so different from other primates?' If our genes are so similar , then whatisitthatmakes us human?\" Deshler says he now thinks that the answer, at least concerning cogni-tiveabilities, may lie in part where messenger RNA (mRNA) is located within cells.MAPPING MOLECULAR PATHWAYSLeft: Oral biologist Salomon Amarhas shown that severe gum diseasemay trigger atherosclerosis andheart disease.

Experiments on embryonic development in frogs and otherspecies, however , revealed that some mRNAs prefer one side of the eggover the other, indicating that mRNA can sort itself in the cytoplasm.Further work revealed that the location of mRNA determines howproteins are positioned in the cell, a process critical to embryonic devel-opment and for the growth of polarized cells, like neurons. \" A highlyevolved mechanism of RNA localization allows neurons to grow appro-priately during development and learning,\" says Deshler . Proteins mRNAs) control the growth of neuronal axons duringembryonic development and the reinforcement of connections neces-sary for learning in adults. The distinction between humans and chimps,therefore, might lie in the relative amounts of proteins and RNA thatgather at synapses, the connections between neurons. Higher-ordercognitive functions might be genetically hardwired in the unique waysynapses are regulated in humans. In earlier work with mRNAs known to localize within cells,Deshler had noticed short repeating sections in the non-coding portionof the RNA, corresponding to so-called \"junk\" sequences. Experimentsshowed that those \"words,\" which repeated in the sequence moreoften than expected, were necessary for mRNAs to recruit the acces-soryproteins needed to move themselves around the cell. Withoutthese words, themRNAs floated around, lacking any apparent abilitytosense direction. Deshler refers to these repeating words as the GPS(globalpositioning system) of the cell, while others in the field prefertocallthemzip codes. He originally discovered repeated GPS codes with his own eyes,visually scanning a sequence for repeating words, but now he harnessescomputer power . Researchers in his lab designed a program calledREPFIND which scans onegene for words that repeat more than twiceand produces a list of those potential GPS codes. He uses REPFIND tosearch neuronal genes for repeated words, and then tests whether thosewordsare actually GPS codes by conducting cellular lab experiments. Healso wanted the ability to search the genomes of other organisms to see if certaincodes are repeated in them as well, reasoning that if a wordshowsupfrequently in many genomes, it may represent a fundamentallanguage for mRNA localization. Because each gene takes about 30 sec-ondstoscan in REPFIND, however , it would take several days to look for asinglerepeating word among the thousands of genes in each organism. Tospeed uptheprocess, Deshler recruited Ben Kennedy and InLim, bioinformatics graduate students taking Gary Benson's BiologicalDatabases course. They created an online database of all repeating wordsand theirprobabilities, called GeneFinder . Researchers can use the data-base tosee howmany genes contain repeats of a particular word andthentest in the lab whether those words are GPS codes. Deshler plans touse GeneFinder to crack the genetic code for mRNA localization, andpotentially discover what sets us apart from our fellow primates.For further information, see www.bu.edu/biology/Faculty_Staff/jdeshler.html.To try REPFIND for yourself, visit http:/ /zlab.bu.edu/repfind/.Shape Matters DNA microarrays can monitor expression of thousands of genes simul-taneously , making them powerful tools for biological research. Thesedevices rely on hybridization, or the binding of sample DNA to oligonu-cleotide probes, short strands of DNA with a known sequence that aretethered to a glass slide. The pattern of where a sample has bound totheprobes provides information about how genes are expressed in theDNA sample.As powerfulas microarrays are for researchers, they have notyetbeenapproved by the Food and Drug Administration for diagnosticuse.Onereasonis that the percentage of sample DNA strands that areabletohybridize fluctuates, making the process too imprecise for clini-calpurposes. \"T o improve the hybridization efficiency of microarrays,researchers must understand the factors that influence how DNAbinds to the array surface,\" says physicist Bennett Goldberg. He ispart ofateamthat has devised a new way to precisely measure theconformation, or shape, of DNA molecules tethered to a surface.\"Therearephysical barriers that make it difficult to predict conforma-tion,\" explains Goldberg, \"as well as differing densities of DNA on thearraythat complicate matters.\" In addition, he says, a single strand ofnucleicacids is floppy , like a soft rope, and can wiggle freely. Goldberg's collaboration with electrical engineers Anna Swanand Selim \u00dcnl\u00fc, and former graduate student Lev Moiseev, hasresulted new method called spectral self-interference fluores-cence microscopy (SSFM). SSFM, Goldberg explains, is able to provideprecise information about the size and shape of individual DNA mole-cules for the first time. In SSFM, fluorescent labels are attached to one end of DNA teth-ered toaglass surface. Light is bounced of f the top surface of the DNAlayer , but it also travels through and bounces of f a reflective bottom surface. The interaction of the two wavelengths\u2014one reflected fromthefluorescent label, the other from the bottom layer\u2014produces oscil-lations in the spectrum of the returning light. The pattern of oscilla-tions, or interference spectrum, describes the location and shape of theDNA molecule with sub-nanometer accuracy. The team's experiments showed that unhybridized single-stranded probes moved somewhat randomly , wriggling like worms atan average height of 2 to 2.5 nanometers above the surface. Afterhybridization, double-stranded DNA formed a rigid rod shape that was,on average, 5.5 to 10.5 nanometers from the surface and tilted at anangle of between 40 and 50 degrees relative to the surface. Microarray manufacturers will soon be able to use SSFM to mea-sure hybridization ef ficiency and optimize their product. According toGoldberg, SSFM can also be used to predict the virulence of viruses bymeasuring the conformation of sugars on their surface, and to study theshape of molecules on the surface of live cells. \"One reason we careabout DNA conformation is that it tells us about how molecules organizeand act near surfaces,\" he says. \"Such information is crucial to designbiosensors and biomimetic materials. It provides a template for measur-ing and controlling biomaterials at nanometer-length scales.\" This research was published in the February 2006 issue of the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences.For more information, visit http:/ /nanoscience.bu.eduand http:/ /ultra.bu.edu/projects.asp?project=fluorescence.Predicting the Roles of Proteins The recent completion of the mapping of the human genome hasuncovered the genetic sequence for the approximately 30,000 humangenes, but scientists are largely in the dark concerning the role ofthose genes and the proteins they encode in development, physiology ,and disease. One way to decipher the biologically relevant meaning ofthe human genome's code of letters is to change, or mutate, eachsequence in the laboratory and examine the physical or physiologicalchanges inamodel organism. Bioinformaticist Boris Shakhnovich hasdeveloped an easier way: exploiting the power of computer modelingto narrow the potential roles of a protein before beginning lab experi-ments on the genes themselves. \"If someone sequences a new genome or finds a pet new gene,they are, of course, interested in what it does,\" explains Shakhnovich.\"The easiest thing to do is compare the new sequence to other genes.But there's inherent ambiguity because even the function of a protein'sclosest relative is not exactly a match.\" The sequence of a gene can beused to predict the secondary structure, or building blocks, of the pro-tein it encodes. But protein function is tied to how those blocks are puttogether\u2014its three-dimensional shape, or tertiary structure, which isquite hard to predict from sequence alone. Predicting a protein's func-tion is further complicated by the fact that structure and function haveamany-to-many relationship, meaning that there are many functionsthat can result from one structure and many structures that can giverise to the same function. According to Charles DeLisi, Arthur G. B. Metcalf Professor ofScience and Engineering, one of the \"founding fathers\" the HumanGenome Project and Shakhnovich's mentor , \"Although researchershad previously developed ways to approximate relationships betweenstructure and function, Shakhnovich significantly improved on previ-ous work by creating a mathematical method that is able to correlateprotein structure and function with a high degree of accuracy.\"Shakhnovich began with a previously established ontology , a struc-tured, controlled vocabulary that maps gene products in terms of theirmolecular function, such as DNA-binding or ATP-producing. By measur-ing the \"distance\" between two proteins on the ontology , he could thenassign a score of functional similarity between protein structures. \"Thiswas thefirstinstance of distance in functional space,\" saysShakhnovich, \"but we wondered if it corresponded to known relation-ships betweenstructure and function.\" After comparing his measure with thestructural distance, he saw a tight correlation that let him knowhewas ontheright track. Shakhnovich then compared his functional distances to a measure of phylogenetic distance, a gauge of similar distri-butions on an evolutionary tree, and again observed a correlation. Bymapping structural, phylogenetic, and functional distances on one func-tionallandscape, he realized that function could best be predicted byconsidering structural distance in a genomic context. Thegoalofthework is to narrow down the range of possiblefunctions of a particular protein to a few possibilities, thus making iteasiertodesign experiments that predict the protein's functionexactly.\"Given the new definition of functional distance, we can saythattheprotein function is a certain distance away from known func-tions, with one of those nearby functions being a perfect match.\"Shakhnovich gives an analogous example: \"If the only thing you knowisthatastructure has four legs, it could be a chair or a table or an ele-phant.\" Y ou then can test to see which of the four-legged possibilitiesisaccurate. \"My hope is to redefine the notion of how we predict func-tions,\" headds. The goal is not to hit it exactly on the mark, but to pre-dicttherange of options accurately so that researchers can quickly testagene's function in the laboratory and more quickly understand how itfunctions in the organism.

Funded by the UnitedStates Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the PHH-PRC is an equitable partnership among fourgroups\u2014Boston University School of Public Health, the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), theBostonPublic Health Commission, and the Community Committee for Health Promotion\u2014that isaddressing the health needs of residents of public housing. \"Byand large, the population living in public housing is in poorer health than most people inBoston,\" says BU epidemiologist and program director Robert Horsburgh. \"The data suggest thathealth problems go hand-in-hand with poverty. In addition, public housing residents have lessaccess to information about disease prevention and health promotion programs.\"Theprogram's main objectives are to identify health issues af fecting people in public housing,todesign research plans to collect data on these issues, and to implement strategies to address them.Oneof the strategies implemented by the partnership is to find leaders among the residents of thehousing developments and to train them to become health advocates within their own communities.Theprogram, now in its fourth year , is fully funded by the CDC, which has apportionednearly $30 million to 33 centers across the country. \"The CDC has been very supportive andpatient . . . Community-wide public health initiatives like these take time,\" says Horsburgh.Horsburgh has worked on public health issues since the early 1990s, first focusing on infec-tious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, then moving on to address other disparities in healthcare among ethnic groups. \"The methods have changed a lot since this kind of research began.Nowwe do research with community members, not on them,\" he says.Specific initiatives of the PHH-PRC have targeted health issues from smoking cessation anddental health to domestic violence and motivating younger teenage girls to become more physicallyactive. The group has found that community participation is critical. \"We have swung away fromthe SWAT team approach where we came in like an army and never came back,\" says Horsburgh.REACHING OUT TOTHECOMMUNITYAND TO THE WORLDFrom poverty and endemic disease in developing nations to domestic violencein theinner cities of the United States, researchers at the Boston University School of PublicHealth are exploring ways in which education can help overcome the complex healthissues that face the world today. Resident Health Advocates (from left) Yanick Francois, RosaMaldonado, Gayisha Barrow, Cheryl Fielding, and CorinneBrun and SPH graduate and team manager Alex Muenze(center rear),work with the Partners in Health and HousingPrevention Research Center to bring health education andwellness initiatives to people in their own communities.33Research at Boston University2006 32Research at Boston University2006\"T oday we work with community members to developobjectives for their communities.\"Alex Muenze, a graduate of the School of PublicHealth, co-manages the recruiting and training of eachyear's group of resident health advocates, or RHAs.RHAs are selected from applicants living in housingdevelopments across the city. This is done in collabora-tion with Rachel Goodman, BHA's Community ServicesDirector and Greg Davis, BHA's Family Services ProgramManager . Each year 12 RHAs participate in a 10-weektraining course. Once certified, they receive stipendsand are supervised by Davis and work on various com-munity initiatives\u2014from door-to-door outreach to man-ning tables at health fairs.While Muenze says that much of the collabora-tive work has been fruitful, tracking the effective-ness of the program has, in some cases, been achallenge. \"Long-term data is hard to gatherbecause after our initial year of contact with theRHAs it can be hard to maintain contact. We mayfind that phone numbers are out of service or peoplehave changed their address for a variety of personaland economic reasons,\" she says.Yet t he wor k R H A s p er for m in t heir ye arappointments is the essence of grassroots communityactivism.

Lastyear,sherenovated and reopened the ArchdaleCommunity Center that had been closed for sometime.According to Joseph, who lobbied the CityCounciland BHA for assistance, the plan came tofruition after she became an RHA. \"I know that Ihaveagreat support system here and can call on anyoftheother RHAs for help,\" she says.Theclimate of some housing developments canmakegrassroots work difficult. For example, RosaMaldonado of South Boston said that some residentsof her community view her work with skepticism and see her as anagent of BHA management or law enforcement. \"Some people thinkthat because I'm getting paid by BHA that I'm there to spy on people,\"says Maldonado. \"They don't realize that I'm not there to judge, I'mthere to provide information.\" As a group, the RHAs agree that thebest way to overcome such misperceptions is through consistency andpursuing their goals even after their RHA appointments are finished.\"We've got to stay connected. Our work has to be maintained afterwe're gone,\" says Zollarcoffer.Muenze says the effect of each initiative is small but cumula-tive. \"We work within a realistic set of parameters . . .

The genocide in Darfur , Sudan, for example, isascenario fueled by massive poverty and state-sponsored ethniccleansing. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was a blend of short-sighted planning, racial division, and the lack of an efficient, coordi-nated response. Y et, though the causes may vary , all humanitarianemergencies have certain common elements, says Monica Onyango,an instructor in Boston University's International Health Program.\"Whether it is war or famine, when large numbers of people are displaced there are basic needs\u2014food, water , shelter , medicine.\" Onyango, who served as a relief worker in Africa before com-pleting a master's degree in Public Health at BU in 2000, has usedher firsthand experience to design and teach a 12-week intensivecourse called Managing Disasters and Complex HumanitarianEmergencies. The course provides a broad look at the managementof relief efforts in the wake of natural and man-made disasters.From understanding human rights law and learning to write grants,to gaining a solid grasp of epidemiology and acquiring techniques forland-mine removal\u2014the program gives students an opportunity tolearn from leading experts in the field. The course also examines thecomplex coordination required between large, bureaucratic relieforganizations. \"Most of our instructors are professionals who haveworked in conflict situations worldwide, including the Balkans,Afghanistan, the Congo, Sudan, and Liberia,\" Onyango said. Other schools such as Harvard, Columbia, and T ulane offercourses in international public health, but few, if any , take theintensive, hands-on approach that her course does, she continues.Students work for six hours a day on assignments ranging from casestudies to role-playing. Experts in the field teach specific portions ofthe course. CDC researchers, for example, teach the epidemiologysections of the course; FEMA (Federal Emergency ManagementAgency) representatives discuss emergency response coordination.News reports, white papers, and policy analyses are incorporated tokeep coursework current. \"The goal is to provide students, many ofwhom have no international experience, with the backgroundneeded to work in an international, humanitarian setting,\" saidOnyango. Graduates have gone on to serve as aid workers in theaftermath of Hurricane Katrina and in the refugee camps of Darfur .The hands-on focus of the course is perhaps best illustrated inan exercise held this past April in collaboration with the AmericanRed Cross to organize a mock refugee camp. Onyango says sheapproached the Red Cross after attending a mock emergency eventin Boston's Back Bay last year . Complete with medical and resettle-ment tents, feeding center , field latrines, and visitors playing theroles of displaced civilians, the mock camp immersed the partici-pants in the experience of an unfolding humanitarian crisis.

Learning like this cannot be accom-plished by books alone,\" she said. AHealing LandscapeAgroup of about twenty men and women sat in rapt attention as atall, well-dressed young man spoke of how as a youth in Haiti helearned to listen to his dreams and to allow them to guide his path.The man was Niete Decimus, a Vaudau (Voodoo) priest andanthropologist, and the listeners were medical residents at BostonUniversity Medical Center . They were brought together as part of anew training program instituted by BUMC's Department of InternalMedicine. This session, led by medical resident Cynthia Garner , drewupon the resources of the Boston Healing Landscape Project (BHLP),apartnership of researchers, health workers, anthropologists, andscholars of religion, that is charting a course to integrate alternativemedical practices into Western medicine. In the United States, where new immigrants often arrive withnative traditions intact, the relationship among certified medicalworkers, traditional practitioners, and non-native patients is oftenfraught with shadows of skepticism and misunderstanding. TheBoston Healing Landscape Project has assumed the task of helpingBoston's medical practitioners\u2014who work in a city of tremendousdiversity\u2014understand the complex and varied landscape of healingand medicine. \"Weencourage doctors to think about different culturally andreligiously defined approaches to healing,\" says Linda Barnes, directorofBHLP . \"We also work with doctors on anthropological issues that arepart of their everyday practice.\"While the tools and health-care goals of BHLP are unique,Barnes says she owes much of her initial thinking on the subject toHarvard professor Diane Eck and her Pluralism Project. \"Diane Eck'swork on growing religious pluralism in the United States got methinking about the comparable trend happening in health care.\" Athrust of the group is developing information resources forWestern practitioners. One, an online database of herbs used by vari-ous ethnic groups in Boston, provides information about substances'physiological effects, chemical makeup, possible drug interactions,and toxicities. Another project in development is a country index thatlinks to online resources that can help doctors and medical studentsbetter understand the cultural, religious, and political backgrounds of \"We encourage doctors to thinkabout different culturally andreligiously defined approaches to healing.\" The Boston Healing Landscape Project helps to edu-cate medical practitioners about culturally and reli-giously defined approaches to healing, such as theSanteria ritual pictured here. It is a celebration of thebirthday of the Orisha Elegua, one of the guardianspirits. Santeria is one of many syncretic religionscreated in the New World. It is based on the WestAfrican religions brought by slaves imported to theCaribbean to work the sugar plantations.non-native patients. An interactive world map allows the user toselect a country of interest. By clicking on, say , Africa, then on thecountry of Ghana, the user is taken into a series of menus that provideinformation on immigration, health-care issues, spirituality , religion,and economics. \"The Country Index provides a Web resource that con-tains the best information available on a range of issues affecting ourforeign-born patients,\" said Barnes. \"It is designed to be easy to usein a clinical setting when taking the medical history of patients fromother cultures.\"When doctors are sensitive to different religious and culturaloutlooks on health, says Barnes, they can make better recommenda-tions to their patients. For example, BHLP researcher and GeneralPediatrics Fellow Lance Laird is working to understand how Muslimsare represented in medical literature and how Muslim patients per-ceive the Western health-care system.Medical interpreters are an important\u2014yet relatively new\u2014resource in helping doctors bridge these cultural gaps. Justine deMarrais, a project manager and researcher with BHLP , has looked atthe role and effectiveness of medical interpreters as cultural brokers inmedical settings. One example de Marrais gave\u2014which, coincidentally ,she said, inspired her current research\u2014was when doctors in the pedi-atric ward noticed a small red ribbon tied around a baby's waist. DeMarrais and doctors in the ward learned later from an interpreter thatthe tying of protective ribbons is a common practice among someSoutheast Asian peoples. \"The ribbon served as an amulet or talismanto ward off harmful spirits. The removal of that ribbon could have beenvery offensive to the parents,\" said de Marrais. Although there are potential benefits, according to de Marrais,there is disagreement about the overall value of interpreters as cul-tural liaisons. \"Right now there is not a lot of consensus on whethermedical interpreters play a legitimate role in communicating culturalpractices,\" said de Marrais. The group's findings suggest that the lackof consensus may be the result of inconsistent relationships betweendoctor, patient, and interpreter. According to de Marrais, these rela-tionships depend on a number of key variables including the \"culturalfluency\" of an interpreter and whether or not an interpreter has pre-viously worked with a particular doctor or nurse. \"In spite of thesevariables, recognition is growing that interpreters are positioned toprovide an important service to patients and doctors,\" she said. As Boston's population continues to diversify , the medical fieldgrows more complex\u2014and the value of cross-cultural knowledgeand understanding increases. \"It hasn't been a tough sell to doctors,\"says Barnes. \"We are giving them useful information that applies totheir everyday reality.\"In 21st-century Boston, it seems, there is no single road towellness\u2014but the BHLP is creating an invaluable map of the terrain.

After majoring in physical education and serving as acombat fitness officer in the Israeli army , Lahav turned to music. As a professional musician hecomposed, performed, and gave piano lessons to beginners and experts alike. With a desire to combine his passions for music and movement into \"something more scientific,\" Lahav entered the graduate program in Rehabilitation Sciences at Sargent College in2003 to study the effect of music on brain function and to explore possible therapeutic modali-ties. Lahav explains his hypothesis: Blinking lights in a crowded room do not motivate people tomove in synchrony , but music or a steady beat starts people tapping their feet and moving to themusic. He speculated that this special communication between auditory and motor pathways inthe brain could be harnessed to create a useful clinical tool for patients with movement problems,such as those recovering from a stroke.Working with hisadvisor, Elliot Saltzman, and his collaborator, neurologist GottfriedSchlaugat Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Lahav designedtheMusic, Mind, and Motion Laboratory and created software to teach non-musicians to play byear.\"Weused the piano keyboard as a model task,\" he says, \"in which learned movementsproduce sound.\" He recruited Roxanne Chess, a Sargent College undergraduate majoring in occupationaltherapy , as a research assistant through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program(UROP). Chess, whose aunt is an occupational therapist and who has a disabled cousin, chose herfieldbecause, she says, it takes a holistic, personal approach to therapy , changing and adaptingSTUDENTS: directed towardunderstanding the effect ofmusic on brain function anddeveloping new therapeuticmodalities based on music.39Research at Boston University2006 38Research at Boston University2006the environment so that individuals with disabili-ties can participate fully in life. Last summer Lahav and Chess designed abehavioral study to see if music could improvemotor skills. \"We wondered,\" Chess says, \"if amusician knows a piece of music well, then asidefrom mentally rehearsing it, can hearing it be aform of practice?\" They taught subjects to play a piece ofmusic and used brain imaging to see what areaswere activated while the subjects listened to themusic they had learned. They found that listeningtoapreviously learned song activated motor-related regions in the brain, and even improvedthe subject's performance of the song. \"Even lis-teners distracted by doing puzzles while listeningto the music showed a performance improvementsomewhere between that of active listeners andthose listening to nature sounds,\" Chess explains.\"Our study suggests that a patient who producessegments of a song through a particular sequenceof movements may be able to listen to that songat home and, effectively , without moving, con-tinue to practice the movements.\" Even though he didn't win a Grammy for hisownmusic, theaward will support Lahav's post-doctoral research at Harvard Medical to further develop his VirtualMusicMaker (VMM), the human-computer inter-facehedesigned that translates a patient'stherapeutic exercises into music. \"For patients,listening to the VMM-produced music is like inter-estonabank account\u2014you gain a couple of cents.Butforastroke patient those couple of centscouldaddupto a big benefit, especially whereconventional therapy has failed,\" says Lahav.

Under the guidance of her advisor , neurobiology professor BillEldred, and in partnership with researchers at the University ofAlabama, Cimini is studying how acetylcholine activates nitric oxide,another the retina. In cells, for exam-ple, acetylcholine is released into the synapse and triggers the open-ing of ion channels that cause muscle contraction. In the retina,however, it appears that acetylcholine not only acts directly to gener-ate nerve impulses but also works indirectly through a series of otherchemicals. Using a special staining technique called immunocytochem-istry , in which a fluorescent protein is attached to a particular targetcell, Cimini is looking at how acetylcholine initiates a \"chain\" or \"cas-cade\" of chemicals that generate nerve impulses in the retina. Herwork suggests that acetylcholine may \"turn on\" nitric oxide, as cyclic GMPs, orcGMPs. \"The cGMPs appear to determine which cells are beingturned on and off ,\" she says. Cimini's work contributes to a clearer view of how the eye itselfmay process visual information before it is sent to the brain. \"The morecomplex the system, the more complete a picture that can be generatedin the eye itself , before the brain even becomes involved.\" \u2014by Jeremy MillerModeling MoleculesWhat do accounting and computer modeling of RNA molecules haveto do with one another? Not much, says Poornima Chalasani, a master's candidate inbioinformatics who began her college career as an accounting stu-dent. She became interested in computer engineering after a fewundergraduate computing courses at Andhra University in India andcompleted a master's program in computer applications in 2001. Herinitial foray into biology came after she moved to BostonUniversity in 2002 to pursue a second master's in computer systemsengineering. \"In India, biology was mostly geared toward medicine,which I was not interested in,\" said Chalasani. \"But in the U.S. thereare many directions in biology , even for computer people.\" Afterworking as a molecular biology lab technician, she thought abouthow she could apply her computer expertise to the world of biologi-cal molecules. Chalasani and a team led by Nikolay Dokholyan, her formeradvisor at Boston University who is now a professor at the Universityof North Carolina, have developed a computer simulation to computethe folding properties of RNA molecules. Their work is moving in apromising direction; in March, Chalasani won the coveted Provost'sAward at BU's Science and Engineering Research Symposium for herpart of this work.RNA is a vital molecule, which functions as a \"messenger\" inthe production of proteins and as a catalyst in various reactions inthe cell. Like all biological molecules, RNA's function depends on theway it's made. \"In order to understand what's going on, we've got to \"Alzheimer's patients, who arealready confused, are seeing a confusing picture.\" These black-and-white images illustrate howpeople with Alzheimer's disease may see theworld as confusing, low-contrast images, furtherexacerbating any confusion associated withother brain damage resulting from the disease.Healthy ContrastAfter watching her great-grandmother struggle with Alzheimer's dis-ease, Karen Sullivan wanted to do something to help others. Afterhigh school she worked for a time as a live-in home health aid forpeople with the disease. Now she is a PhD candidate studying howvision problems caused by Alzheimer's may interfere with a patient'sability to function in daily life. Sullivan received a national researchservice award from the National Institute of Neurological Disordersand Stroke for her research in the Psychology Department's Visionand Cognition Laboratory.Alzheimer's disease damages nerve cells in the brain that controlmemory and language, but the disease also harms the optic nerve,reducing the ability to see contrasts. (A similar problem occurs inParkinson's patients.) Sullivan explains, \"Alzheimer's patients, whoare already confused, are seeing a confusing picture.\" For example,patients with a reduced ability to perceive contrasts may have difficultyseeing blue buttons on a blue shirt and find it hard to dress themselves. Sullivan's advisor , Alice Cronin-Golomb, previously showed thatAlzheimer's patients, who often must eat soft foods like mashedpotatoes or pasta, ate significantly more when food was served on ared rather than a white plate, probably because they could see theirfood more clearly. Sullivan also notes that perceiving contrasts is a critical part ofrecognizing people's faces. For her dissertation project, Sullivan hasdesigned experiments involving everyday activities like finding therightpill, getting dressed, and writing checks. She is testing to see ifsimple changes, like using buttons in a contrasting color on a sweater ,canhelp patients in the beginning and middle stages of Alzheimer's.Hergoal is to find solutions that will make visual information morecomprehensible to Alzheimer's patients. \"If their brain gets betterquality input they are less confused,\" she says. By implementingadaptations to enhance their vision, she hopes that some patientswillbeable to function as well as their peers without the disease.\u2014byTrina ArpinVisualCoordinationSinging with an acappellagroup, with its harmonies and multiplevoices meshing into one song, parallels in some ways the coordinationof the body's nervous system, where multiple stimuli must be inte-grated into a singular experience. Perhaps, then, it's no surprise thatone of Boston University's most gifted young neurobiology studentsis also an acappellasinger . Junior Beth Ann Cimini, the first in her family to study science,is the recipient of a coveted two-year Beckmann Grant for under-graduate research. She has taken up the challenge of understandinghow the retina processes visual stimuli. Specifically , she is looking atthe role of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a chemical relay thatoperates in the synapses, or junctions, between nerve cells. While the eye may seem a marvelous piece of stand-alone bio-logical architecture, Cimini says much of it is derived from the sametissue as the nervous system. This means that parts of the eye that41Research at Boston University2006 40Research at Boston University2006understand the shape and composition of the tinyparticles that make up our cells,\" says Chalasani. \"On the surface, the RNA molecule seemssimple. But under the surface, there is a lot ofcomplexity.\" This complexity is overcome todaywith computers. Using powerful processors and3-D modeling programs, the shape of RNAs canbe inferred from their \"sequence.\" The\"sequence\" is a veritable alphabet, which scien-tists abbreviate using the first letters\u2014A, C, Uand G\u2014of the chemicals, or nucleotides, thatmake up this alphabet. The programs currentlyused togenerate 3-D models of RNA moleculesare, according to Chalasani, \"computationallyheavy ,\" meaning that the algorithms in the soft-ware take a lot of computer processing power tocarry out. \"Some of these models take weeks togenerate . . . our technique cuts processing time toamatter of hours,\" she says.The complexity arises from the multipleinteractions between atoms within the RNA itself.Each nucleotide is made up of 16 or 17 atoms, andan individual RNA strand may comprise hundredsof thousands of nucleotides. Adopting principles used in protein com-putersimulations, Chalasani's model overcomesthisintrinsiccomplexity by consolidating sets ofatoms into groups. \"Instead of looking at an RNAnucleotide as a set of a few dozen atoms, we lookatitas a setofthree distinct groups, or 'beads,'\"Chalasani said. The\"beads\" correspond to the sugar,phosphate, and base that are common structuralelements in all nucleotide molecules. Looking attheatoms ofRNA in terms of these groups dras-ticallyreduces the number of molecular interac-tions\u2014and, thus, thecomputational complexity. Once thestructure is computed, the pro-gramgenerates a movie file. Like a digital flip-book, these movies depict how an RNA strandfoldsitself up into its distinct 3-dimensionalshape.Thegroup's results have been promising.\"Ofcourse,when you take away some ofthecomplexity you sacrifice a bit of accuracy ,\"saysChalasani. \"But these models do a good jobofgenerating an accurate pathway by which anRNA molecule arrives at its unique 3-D structure.\"Chalasani says her team's work holdspromise for cell biologists and diseaseresearchers trying to understand how mutationscanleadto misshapen macromolecules that contribute to disease. \u2014by Jeremy MillerFishing in the Frog PondT wo 4-foot-high bronze frog sculptures watch over the winter skatersand summer waders at the Frog Pond on Boston Common. From theirperch on the eastern end of the pond they look across Charles Street tothe trees in the Boston Public Garden. According to Joseph Bagley , if youwere standing on the same spot 8,000 years earlier , the pond would stillbe there, inhabited by real, not bronze frogs. In place of the skaters andwaders, you'd find indigenous peoples living around the pond, andthousands of clamshells would be visible, scattered along a shorelinereaching as far as Charles Street. Bagley , a recent archaeology graduate,easily paints this picture\u2014the fruit of senior work for distinction,funded by UROP , in which he studied artifacts excavated from thearea around the Frog Pond.When Bagley arrived at Boston University , he knew he wanted tomajor in archaeology. \"I liked science, I liked history , and I didn't want adesk job,\" he says. He had also honed his skills and interest in highschool by attending an archaeological field school in his home state ofMaine. Originally interested in classical archaeology , a second summerexcavating in Maine refocused his interests to the history of NewEngland before the arrival of Europeans. Working with his mentor, archaeologist Curtis Runnels, Bagleylearned that a prehistoric site on the Common had been excavated buttheartifacts had never been studied. He saw in this both a subject for hissenior work for distinction and an opportunity to explore the earliest his-tory of Boston. With the permission of the City of Boston archaeologist,Bagley analyzed and photographed the finds. From them, he created aportrait of Native Americans who lived around the pond from 8,000years ago until European settlers arrived. Among Bagley's most importantdiscoveries was a Neville spear point, the oldest artifact ever found inBoston. Bagley also found pottery fragments bearing the impressions ofwoven textiles, the oldest examples of weaving in Boston. Another tool inthe collection, called a scraper because it could be used to scrape fat andmusclefrom animal hides, was made from Pennsylvania jasper, showingthatvillagers traded well beyond the local area. Based ontheartifacts from the Frog Pond excavation, Bagleywroteabrief story describing the village and the villagers\u2014childrenchase each other brandishing toy spears made from reeds, while grown-ups make pottery , tend fires, or butcher deer . The Frog Pond artifacts aretypicalof those from villages of this time period along New England'scoast, says Bagley , but given the tremendous amount of construction inBoston, the Common is one of the few areas where evidence of this earlyhistory is still preserved. He adds that part of the site's importance is inreminding people that \"the history of Boston began long before 1630when the colonists arrived.\" \u2014byTrina Arpin Given the tremendous amount of construction in Boston, the Common isone of the few areas where evidenceof this early history is still preserved. Facing page: These artifacts found at the Frog Pond in Boston Commoninclude (from top)astone projectile point made by Native Americansfrom the Archaic period of occupation at the site, 3,000-8,000 years ago;abroken Neville point, probably a spear point made with local stone bysettlers during the earliest period of occupation of the site, 6,500-8,000years ago; a stone projectile point of a type called Levanna, dating to theLate Woodland period, 400-1,000 years ago.Honing in on Kidney CancerDavid Yao says he grew up asking the question \"why?\" Instead of readinghis textbooks, the Boston University medical student says, \"I wanted to bewriting them.\" Yao's curiosity led him to study the birdsongs of Europeanstarlings as an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University. He studiedneuroscience because of his own interest; economics so that he couldhave something to discuss with his parents during visits home; anddevelopmental biology , axonal guidance, and Alzheimer's disease af terhis grandfather developed the condition. After entering medical school at BUMC, Yao was attracted to thefield of urology and approached urologist Louis Liou. \"During David's clinical rotation, he operated with me and was enthusiastic and hard-working,\" Liou says. Yao then suggested doing research with his mentor ,and as Liou says, Yao had both the motivation and experience necessarytoconduct medical research. \"I gave him control over a project on kidneycancer,and he just took the ball and ran with it. He was very productive.\"Yaosays he knew that kidney cancer was a very bad condition andhoped tofind a novel method to find and treat the cancer . \"There are nogood screening tools, and once the cancer spreads from the kidney thereareno good treatments.\" The type of cancer that Yao studied, clear cellrenal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), is dif ficult to treat because it is resistanttochemotherapy , radiation, and immunotherapy. Liou's lab screened healthy and cancerous tissue from CCRCCpatients using a DNA microarray of all human genes. Nearly a thousandgenes were expressed dif ferently in normal and cancerous cells, but aliterature search narrowed the field to four probable candidates. \"I wasattracted to one gene in particular for the vitamin-D receptor (VDR),which is known to play a role in breast, colorectal, and parathyroidcancer ,\" Yao says. Also, low levels of vitamin D in the body are associatedwith obesity , a risk factor for kidney cancer . The microarray data wasconfirmed using a technique called quantitative Polymerase ChainReaction (PCR). It was found that the levels of VDR mRNA were lower incancerous cells compared to normal ones. Yao then stained both tissuetypes for protein expression and observed less staining in the undiffer-entiated, unstructured tumor cells. If VDR levels found in serum and urine can be correlatedwith a particular stage of cancer , the test may form a basis forCCRCC diagnosis and prognosis. If future work with VDR vaccines orviral transfection of cells with VDR is successful, it may lead toCCRCC therapeutics. Liou says, \"David's work is a great contributionto high-quality , groundbreaking research at Boston University.\"This research waspresented as an abstract at the American Association forCancer Research meeting in April 2006.\u2014byLeahEisenstadt43Research at Boston University2006 42Research at Boston University2006Saralynn Allaire(Medicine) won the First Place Research Awardfrom the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association.Kazem Azadzoi(Urology and Pathology) was appointed to theInternational Continence Society Hall of Fame at the Society's 35thannual meeting.Paul Barber(Biology) was honored with a Presidential Early CareerAward for Research Endeavors (PECASE) by the National ScienceFoundation for his work in evolutionary and conservation biology.Thomas Barfield(Anthropology), Richard Primack(Biology), Frank J.
