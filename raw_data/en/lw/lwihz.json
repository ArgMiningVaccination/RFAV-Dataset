Passive protection against pertussis in early infancy following maternal immunisation during pregnancy (see 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , and 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ) BOOSTRIX -POLIO is not intended for primary immunization. 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients who are hypersensitive to any component of the vaccine or to individuals having shown signs of hypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or poliomyelitis vaccines (see 6 DO SAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING ). BOOSTRIX -POLIO (combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) poliomyelitis) vaccine contains traces of neomycin and polymyxin. The vaccine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to neomycin and polymyxin. BOOSTRIX -POLIO is contraindicated if the individual has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown etiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In t hese circumstances, adult -type combined diphtheria tetanus and poliomyelitis vaccine should be used. BOOSTRIX -POLIO should not be administered to individuals who have experienced transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunization against diphtheria and/or tetanus. 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION 4.1 Dosing Considerations Tetanus Prophylaxis in Wound Management Table 1 summarizes the recommended use of immunizing agents in wound management. It is important to ascertai n the number of doses of toxoid previously given and the interval since the last dose. When a tetanus booster dose is required, the combined preparation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid formulated for adults (Td) is preferred. Appropriate cleansing and deb ridement of wounds is imperative, and use of antibiotics may be considered. Some individuals with humoral immune deficiency, including those with HIV infection, may not respond adequately to tetanus toxoid. Therefore, tetanus immune globulin (TIG) should b e used in addition to tetanus toxoid if a wound occurs that is not clean, regardless of the time elapsed since the last booster.

If the individual is < 7 years old a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine is given as part of the routine childhood immunization. **Tetanus immune globulin, given at a separate site from Td (or Tdap). The immunization series for tetanus is described in the text (Schedule and Dosage). Yes, if > 10 years since last booster. \u00a7Yes, if > 5 years since last booster. More frequent boosters not required and can be associated with increased adverse events. The bivalent toxoid, Td, is not considered to be significantly more reactogenic than T alone and is recommended for use in this circu mstance. The individual should be informed that Td (or Tdap) has never been given. \u00b6Yes, if individuals are known to have a significant humoral immune deficiency state (e.g. HIV, agammaglobulinemia) since immune response to tetanus toxoid may be suboptimal. 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment A single 0.5 mL dose of the vaccine is recommended. Repeat vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis should be performed at intervals as per official recommendations (generally 10 years). If BOOSTRIX -POLIO is administered to a pregnant woman, it should ideally be done during the third trimester of pregnancy or according to recommendations from the National Advi sory Committee on Immunization (NACI). BOOSTRIX -POLIO should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. BOOSTRIX -POLIO is for deep intramuscular injection. 4.3 Administration Do not remove the white back -stop from the syringe. Prior to administration, ensure that the plunger rod is firmly attached to the rubber stopper by turning the plunger clockwis e until slight resistance is felt. Do not over tighten. Remove syringe LUER Tip -cap and needle cap. Attach needle by pressing and twisting in a clockwise rotation until secured to the syringe. September 06, 2022 Product Monograph Master Template Template Date: 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 6 of 27 Prior to vaccination, the vaccine should be well shaken in o rder to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension and visually inspected for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, do not administer the vaccine, and any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 5 OVERDOSAGE For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre. 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACK AGING To help ensure the traceability of biologic products, including biosimilars, health professionals should recognise the importance of recording both the brand name and the non -proprietary (active ingredient) name as well as other product -specific identifiers such as the Drug Identification Number (DIN) and the batch/lot number of the product supplied.

Description BOOSTRIX -POLIO (combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis) vaccine is presented as a turbid white suspension in a single dose prefilled syringe. Upon storage, a white deposit and clear supernatant can be observed. This is a normal finding. 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS General It is good clinical practice that immunization should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regards to previous immunization and possible occurrence of undesirable events). As with any other vaccine, BOOSTRIX -POLIO (comb ined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis) vaccine may not protect 100% of individuals receiving the vaccine. BOOSTRIX -POLIO should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. As with other vaccine s, the administration of BOOSTRIX -POLIO should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate or severe illness with or without fever. The presence of minor illnesses with or without a low -grade fever are not a contraindication. If any of the followi ng events occur in temporal relation to administration of whole -cell DTP or acellular DTP vaccine, the decision to give subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. There may be circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, in which the potential benefits outweigh possible risks, particularly since these events have not been proven to cause permanent sequelae. Temperature of 40.0oC within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause . Collapse or shock like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. Collapse or shock -like state (hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode) and convulsions have been reported very rarely following immunisation of children with products containing one or more of the antigenic constituents of B OOSTRIX -POLIO . Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. September 06, 2022 Product Monograph Master Template Template Date: 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 8 of 27 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome A review by the National Academy of Medici ne found evidence for a causal relationship between receipt of tetanus toxoid and both Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and brachial neuritis. If GBS occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give BOOSTRIX - POLIO or any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. Hematologic BOOSTRIX -POLIO should be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these individuals. Firm pressure should be applied to the injection site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. Immune HIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expe cted immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed individuals, e.g. individuals on immunosuppressive therapy. Neurologic In children with progressive neurological disorders, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epile psy or progressive encephalopathy, it is better to defer pertussis (Pa or Pw) immunization until the condition is corrected or stable. However, the decision to give pertussis vaccine must be made on an individual basis after careful consideration of the ri sks and benefits. A history or a family history of convulsions and a family history of an adverse event following DTP vaccination do not constitute contraindications. Sensitivity/Resistance As with other injectable vaccines, appropriate medication (e.g. E pinephrine 1:1000) should be readily available for immediate use in case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions following administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after immunizat ion. For initial management of anaphylaxis, please refer to the current Canadian Immunization Guide. 7.1. Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women Data from post -marketing surveillance where pregnant women were exposed to BOOSTRIX -POLIO do not suggest vaccine related adverse effect on pregnancy or on the health of the fetu s/newborn child. Human data from prospective clinical studies on the use of BOOSTRIX (dTpa component of BOOSTRIX - POLIO) and BOOSTRIX -POLIO during the first and second trimester of pregnancy are not available.

Concomitant use with other inactivated vaccines or with immunoglobulin has not been studied. There is no evidence, to date, to indicate that co -administration will result in interference with the immune responses. However, extrapolation to new future vaccines cannot be made. When considered necessary, BOO STRIX -POLIO (combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis) vaccine, can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines or immunoglobulin, at a different injection site. As with other vaccines, individuals r eceiving immunosuppressive therapy or individuals with immunodeficiency may not achieve an adequate response. Interactions with other drugs have not been established. Coadministration with live attenuated MMR/V vaccines in children aged 3 -6 year : BOOSTRIX -POLIO was coadministered with MMR/V vaccines in 2 clinical studies with 406 children aged 3-6 years. In these studies, upper respiratory tract infection and rash were commonly reported. Fever, irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite and gastrointe stinal disorders (including diarrhoea and vomiting) September 06, 2022 Monograph Master Template Template Date: September 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 13 of 27 were reported with a higher frequency (very common) when compared to Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with BOOSTRIX -POLIO , while all other adverse reactions occurred at the same or lower frequency. 9.5 Drug -Food Interactions Interactions with food have not been established. 9.6 Drug -Herb Interactions Interactions with herbal products have not been established. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions with laboratory tests have not been established. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y Diphtheria Diphtheria is a serious communicable disease, primarily a localized and generalized intoxication caused by diphtheria toxin, an extracellular protein metabolite of toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae . The disease occurs most frequently in unimmunised or partially immunized individuals. The incidence of diphtheria in Canada has decreased from 9,000 cases reported in 1924 to extremely low levels. Only one or two cases have been reported annually in rece nt years. The case fatality rate remains 5% to 10%, with the highest death rates in the very young and elderly. If immunization levels are allowed to fall and adults do not receive booster doses, disease re -emergence may appear as demonstrated in the Commo nwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union), where tens of thousands of cases with substantial mortality have been reported. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the diphtheria toxin. Following adequate immunization with diphtheria toxoid, it is generally accepted that protection persists for at least 10 years. Serum antitoxin levels of at least 0.01 antitoxin units per mL are generally regarded as protective. This significantly reduces both the risk of developing diphtheria and the severity of clinical illness. Immunization with diphtheria toxoid does not, however, eliminate carriage of C. diphtheriae in the pharynx or nose or on the skin. Tetanus Tetanus is an intoxication manifested primarily by neur omuscular dysfunction caused by a potent exotoxin released by Clostridium tetani . Immunization is highly effective, provides long lasting protection and is recommended for the entire population. Only 1 to 7 with an average of 5 cases of tetanus are reporte d annually in Canada while no deaths have been recorded since 1995. The disease continues to occur almost exclusively among persons who are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated or whole vaccination histories are unknown or uncertain. September 06, 2022 Product Monograph Master Template Template Date: September 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 14 of 27 Spores of C. tetan i are ubiquitous. Naturally acquired immunity to tetanus toxin does not occur. Thus, universal primary immunization and timed booster doses to maintain adequate tetanus antitoxin levels are necessary to protect all age groups. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the tetanus toxin. Tetanus toxoid is a highly effective antigen and a completed primary series generally induces serum antitoxin levels of at least 0.01 antitoxin units per mL, a level which has been re ported to be protective. It is generally accepted that protection persists for at least 10 years. To maintain immunity to tetanus following completion of primary immunization, booster doses administered as Td are recommended at 10 yearly intervals. Pertussis Pertussis (whooping cough) is a disease of the respiratory tract caused by Bordetella pertussis . Pertussis is highly communicable and can affect individuals of any age; however, severity is greatest among young infants. Although there is no est ablished serologic correlate of protection against pertussis, majority of pregnant women were found to have undetectable anti -pertussis toxin levels. Newborn infants therefore remain susceptible until their first vaccination at two months of age. Immunizat ion in pregnancy provides newborn infants benefits from the transfer of the maternal antibodies. Antigenic components of B. pertussis believed to contribute to protective immunity include: pertussis toxin; filamentous hemagglutinin; and pertactin (69kDa) . Although the role of these antigens in providing protective immunity in humans is not well understood, clinical trials which evaluated candidate acellular DTP vaccines manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline supported the efficacy of three component INFANRIX (DT aP). Recently published data suggests a higher importance of the PT and pertactin (69kDa) components in providing protection against pertussis. Poliomyelitis Poliovirus is an enterovirus that belongs to the picornavirus family. Three serotypes of poliovir us have been identified (types 1, 2 and 3). Poliovirus is highly contagious with the predominant mode of transmission being person -to-person via the fecal -oral route. Infection may be spread indirectly through contact with infectious saliva or feces or by contaminated water or sewage. Replication of poliovirus in the pharynx and intestine is followed by a viremic phase where involvement of the central nervous system can occur. While poliovirus infections are asymptomatic or cause nonspecific symptoms (low -grade fever, malaise, anorexia and sore throat) in 90% to 95% of individuals, 1% to 2% of infected persons will develop paralytic disease. Following the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV/ POLIO) in Canada in 1955, the indigenous disease has been eliminated. Since 1980, 12 paralytic cases have been reported in Canada, 11 of which were determined to be vaccine -associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). The last reported case of VAPP occurred in 1995. Forty seven studies involving over 19,000 infants and children have been conducted in developed and developing countries with GlaxoSmithKline's enhanced inactivated poliovirus vaccine, as trivalent IPV vaccine or as a part of DTPa -IPV based combinations.

The children 4 to 8 years of age were previously vaccinated with four doses of DTPa or DTPa -based combinations and at least 3 doses of OPV or IPV. The adolescents 10 to 14 years of age had received primary and booster vaccination with DTPw in infancy and childhood and subjects in the 15 and older age range had in many cases received primary vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio vaccines. The percent s eroprotective rates and vaccine responses of the 3 pivotal studies are presented in Table 9. Each of the 3 pivotal studies compared BOOSTRIX -POLIO to BOOSTRIX and IPV given separately.

N = number of subjects wit h available results CI = Confidence Interval (95%) After administration of one dose of BOOSTRIX -POLIO to 140 adults 40 years of age that had not received any diphtheria and tetanus containing vaccine in the past 20 years, at least 96.4% of adults were s eropositive for all three pertussis antigens and 77.7% and 95.7% were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively. After administration of two additional doses of a diphtheria and tetanus containing vaccine one and six months after the first dose of BOOSTRIX -POLIO, the seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus reached 100%. Diphtheria and Tetanus One month after vaccination, 100% of subjects up to 14 years of age and 83.5% of the subjects 15 years of age and older were seroprotected ag ainst diphtheria (0.1 IU/mL). One month after vaccination all subjects up to 14 years of age and 99.6 % of the subjects 15 years of age and older had seroprotective anti-tetanus antibody concentrations (0.1 IU/mL). Polio More than 99% of subjects were s eropositive to all three polio types one month after a booster dose of BOOSTRIX -POLIO. September 06, 2022 Product Monograph Master Template 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 21 of 27 Pertussis One month after vaccination, over 97.7% of subjects who received BOOSTRIX -POLIO were seropositive for anti -PT, anti -FHA or anti -PRN antibodies (5 EL.U/mL). The pertussis antigens contained in BOOSTRIX -POLIO are an integral part of the paediatric acellular pertussis combination vaccine (INFANRIX), for which efficacy after primary vaccination has been demonstrated in a household contact efficacy study. The ant ibody titres to all three pertussis components following vaccination with BOOSTRIX -POLIO were at least as high or higher than those observed during the household contact efficacy trial. Based on these comparisons, BOOSTRIX -POLIO would provide protection ag ainst pertussis, however the degree and duration of protection afforded by the vaccine are undetermined. Protective efficacy of pertussis There is currently no correlate of protection defined for pertussis; however, the protective efficacy of GlaxoSmithKline DTPa (INFANRIX) vaccine against WHO defined typical pertussis ( 21 days of paroxysmal cough with laboratory confirmation) was demonstrated in the following 3 dose primary studies: A prospective blinded household contact study performed in Germany (3, 4, 5 months schedule). Based on data collected from secondary contacts in households where there was an index case with typical pertussis, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was 88.7%. Protection against laboratory confirmed mild disease, defined as 14 days or more of cough of any type was 73% and 67% when defined as 7 days or more of cough of any type. An NIH sponsored efficacy study performed in Italy (2, 4, 6 months schedule). The vaccine efficacy was found to be 84%. When the definitio n of pertussis was expanded to include clinically milder cases with respect to type and duration of cough, the efficacy of INFANRIX was calculated to be 71% against > 7 days of any cough and 73% against > 14 days of any cough. In a follow up of the same co hort, the efficacy was confirmed up to 5 years after completion of primary vaccination without administration of a booster dose of pertussis. As infants cannot begin their pertussis vaccination course until they are at least 6 weeks old and three doses of vaccine need to be given, vaccination does not confer complete protection until infants have received all 3 doses. Several studies have shown that adults are a significant source of pertussis in the first week of life. It could be expected that immunizati on of immediate close contacts of newborn infants, such as parents, grandparents and healthcare workers, would reduce exposure of pertussis to infants not yet adequately protected through immunization. Booster immunization with BOOSTRIX - POLIO, an acellular pertussis vaccine with reduced antigen content of diphtheria toxoids and pertussis, has demonstrated that the vaccine was immunogenic and well tolerated in clinical studies in which adolescents and adults have received BOOSTRIX -POLIO. September 06, 2022 Product Monograph Master Template 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 22 of 27 Passive protection against pertussis in infants (below 3 months of age) born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy In a randomized, cross -over, placebo -controlled study (DTPA -047) , higher pertussis antibody concentrations were demonstrated at delivery in the cord blood of infants born to mothers vaccinated with BOOSTRIX (N=291) versus placebo (N=292) after 27 weeks of pregnancy. The concentrations of antibodies against the pertussi s antigens PT, FHA and PRN were respectively 8, 16 and 21 times higher in the cord blood of infants born to vaccinated mothers versus controls. Immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy In two follow -up studies ( DTPA -048, -049) , more than 500 infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with BOOSTRIX or placebo after 27 weeks of pregnancy, received primary and booster vaccination of INFANRIX hexa and Prevnar * 13. Antibody response to diphtheria, tetanus, hepati tis B, inactivated polio virus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens were comparable between infants/toddlers born to vaccinated mothers and infants/toddlers born to unvaccinated mothers. Lower concentrations of antibodies against all pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN) were observed post p rimary vaccination and against PT and FHA antigens post booster vaccination in infants/toddlers born to vaccinated mothers compared to infants/toddlers born to unvaccinated mothers. However, 92.1% to 98.1% of infants and toddlers born to vaccinated mothers showed a booster response (post -booster antibody concentration 2 times the pre -booster antibody concentration) against these pertussis antigens. *Trademark owned by Wyeth LLC Effectiveness in the protection against pertussis disease in infants born to women vaccinated during pregnancy : BOOSTRIX or BOOSTRIX -POLIO vaccine effectiveness (VE) was evaluated in three published observational studies, in UK, Spain and Australia (Amirthalingam G et al , 2016 Clin Infect N et al , 2018 Vaccine 36(14):1887 -1892). The vaccine was used during the third trimester of pregnancy for passive protection of infants below 3 months o f age against pertussis disease. Across the three studies, VE against pertussis disease for infants below 3 months of age born to mothers vaccinated during the third trimester of pregnancy with BOOSTRIX or BOOSTRIX -POLIO ranged between 69% to 90.9%. If maternal vaccination occurs within two weeks before delivery, VE in the infant may be lower than these figures. 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Intramuscular administration during th e organogenesis phase of pregnancy of 100 \u00b5l BOOSTRIX (dTpa) to rats previously primed with INFANRIX (DTaP) vaccine or 100 \u00b5l dTpa -IPV previously primed with INFANRIX -IPV (DTPa -IPV) was well tolerated during pregnancy and lactation and both treatment regimes were considered to be a no -toxic -effect -level for the parental female. September 06, 2022 Monograph Master Template Template Date: September 2020 Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (adsorbed) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine Page 23 of 27 The treatment regime outlined for BOOSTRIX (dTpa) vaccine was considered to be a no -observed - effect -level (NOEL) for pre - and post -natal survival and development of t he offspring. Although an isolated and slight retardation of some ossification parameters was observed among dTpa -IPV treated fetuses on Day 20 gestation, no sustained effects were observed after parturition. Post -natal survival and development measures in the offspring were unaffected and therefore, this treatment regime was designated a no -observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL). There were no biologically significant effects of treatment on bodyweight or bodyweight change either before pairing or througho ut gestation or lactation. Bodyweight change, relative to Day 0 of gestation was significantly lower than Control for Group 3 (dTpa -IPV) from Day 6 -17 of gestation. However, bodyweight gains from Day 6 of gestation (the first day of dosing during gestatio n) were similar to Control and intergroup differences were considered to be of no toxicological significance. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Nonclinical data obtained with BOOSTRIX -POLIO reveal no specific hazard for humans b ased on conventional studies of female fertility and embryo -fetal development in rats and rabbits, and also parturition and postnatal toxicity in rats (up to the end of the lactation period).
