Acupuncture and Pain Relief Acupuncture is a treatment that uses thin needles that are placed in certain areas of the body to promote pain relief and healing. It is used in Chinese medicine and has greatly evolved over the years. The technique is painless and involves placing needles in specific areas of the body to promote blood circulation. As a result, injured areas receive the nutrients they need to function and heal. The process also stimulates pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory substances to ease pain. By reducing inflammation, acupuncture promotes natural healing in the body. Our veterinarian in Laguna Beach, CA, may recommend this treatment if your pet has sore muscles, arthritis, and other similar issues. Cold Laser Therapy and Healing Cold laser therapy is another natural method that can alleviate your pet's pain. This technique uses a laser light on damaged or painful areas of the skin to penetrate cells and promote healing. It is a painless process that helps with the healing of cells and tissues. Our veterinarian uses a K-laser, which is a high-energy laser. As pet therapy, cold laser therapy may help heal acute conditions, like nerve damage, fractures, and back pain. This treatment is also known to relieve pain associated with chronic conditions, like arthritis and muscle pain. Additionally, cold laser therapy may even assist with wound healing. Benefits of Cold Laser Therapy and Acupuncture for Pets Treatments with K-laser or acupuncture are natural and do not cause any side effects for your pet. These methods are non-invasive and drug-free, so you don't need to give your pet medications or consider surgery. Plus, every treatment plan is specifically tailored to your pet, which means your pet will receive the highest level of results.
