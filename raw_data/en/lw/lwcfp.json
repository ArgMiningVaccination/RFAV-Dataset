Verywell Fit / Amelia Manley Acupressure mats are gaining popularity as an at-home, holistic treatment tool for post-workout recovery and overall stress relief. Similar to acupuncture, acupressure is intended to help chi (Qi), or energy, flow freely through the body by stimulating the body's pressure points. \"Acupressure mats work to prevent imbalances, enhance circulation, and help reduce the likelihood of stiff and sore muscles from overuse,\" says Gudrun Snyder, acupuncturist and founder of Moon Rabbit Acupuncture. There is still limited research on the benefits of acupressure, but some experts say that it may relieve pain and help release endorphins, promoting faster recovery and relaxation. Look for an acupressure mat with foam padding and 6,000 to more than 8,000 spikes to hit as many pressure points as possible. We reviewed acupressure mats for features including materials, spikes, size, and extra features like an included pillow or a carrying case. We also had a board-certified clinical specialist in orthopedic physical therapy from our Review Board review this article for accuracy surrounding what to look for in acupressure mats, how to use them, and the potential benefits of acupressure therapy. Here are the best acupressure mats on the market.

Extremely durable and versatile, it can be used when you're lying down or sitting to target a wide range of areas, from your head to your feet. If you're new to acupressure and not quite sure if you want to invest in a high-end mat, the BalanceFrom Acupressure Mat (view at Amazon) is another reliable and affordable pick. It's smaller than some other mats, but it is extremely portable and comes with a pillow that can provide support for the head and neck, as well as more acupressure points. What to Look for in an Acupressure Mat Materials Acupressure mats made with high-quality materials will be more effective and long-lasting. For optimal comfort and durability, the padding of the mat should be a sturdy, non-toxic foam, not polyurethane. The best mats have covers that are made of cotton or some other breathable, natural fabric that feels soft and is easy to clean. In general, acupressure points are plastic; however, there are some mats with metal spikes. To avoid any potential chemical sensitivities or odors, some brands focus on eco-friendly materials, which may increase the cost of the mat. Spikes The more spikes on a mat, the easier it is to adjust to the treatment and the more pressure points you'll hit. Most quality mats have anywhere from 6,000 to more than 8,000 spikes. Size Acupressure mats vary in length and width, so consider how much coverage you'll need and where you'll be using it. While larger mats are versatile to treat many areas at once, smaller ones are ideal for carrying to the gym, yoga studio, work, or on vacation. They're also good if you want to target one spot, such as your feet or lower back. Extra Features An included acupressure pillow is a nice bonus because you can use it to support your neck while also getting additional pressure points. However, many mats can be rolled up and used to treat a sore neck, so a pillow is not a must-have item. Some mats come with a carrying bag, which is ideal for storage or for taking your mat on the road. Frequently Asked Questions How do you use an acupressure mat? If you're using an acupressure mat for the first time, or you're still fairly new to the treatment, wearing a lightweight shirt or using a sheet on it will allow your skin to develop some tolerance to the points. As you become accustomed to the feeling over time, you'll eventually be able to use it on bare skin. Initially, you'll want to use it on a bed or couch, rather than a hard floor.Position the area of your body that you want to treat across the mat. You may want to use a small pillow under your neck for support. Try to lay on it for just a few minutes to start. The first minute or so may hurt slightly, but the pain will diminish as your skin adjusts and you begin to feel more relaxed. To get the maximum benefits, it's recommended to lay on the mat for 20 to 30 minutes a day. You can also use an acupressure mat for a foot treatment by standing on the mat. How do acupressure mats work? Acupressure therapy is similar to acupuncture, but the spikes on the mats do not puncture the skin. The unique design of acupressure mats allows them to hit and stimulate thousands of points on your body at once, which can lead to pain relief and relaxation.\"For people who have a fear of needles or want a DIY home version of acupuncture, acupressure mats can provide a safe and easy-to-use alternative to treat what ails you and help you be your most Zen self,\" says Snyder.The benefits of acupressure are still being studied, so keep in mind that acupressure mats shouldn't be used as a substitute for medical treatment or advice from a healthcare professional. However, they can be used as part of a holistic wellness routine.
