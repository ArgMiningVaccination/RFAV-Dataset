HOST Park is a unique outdoor demonstration site for emerging renewable energy, aquaculture and other ocean-based sustainable technologies. HOST Park has become the world's premier ocean science innovation hub and operates at the nexus of water, energy, and food. Three sets of pipelines deliver cold deep sea water from up to 3,000 ft. depth as well as warm pristine surface seawater. Current equipment and pipeline infrastructure is capable of pumping up to 100,000 gallons per minute of seawater throughout the 900-acre technology park.
