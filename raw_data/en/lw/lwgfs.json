About norovirus - Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that frequently spreads person-to-person and is often associated with food. Norovirus illness often has a sudden onset of nausea and vomiting and/or watery diarrhea with cramps. A low-grade fever, chills, and body aches sometimes occur. - Norovirus rarely causes severe complications. Dehydration is the most common complication, particularly among young children and the elderly. No vaccine is available for norovirus. Prevention General advice for reducing risk of contracting norovirus: - Wash hands, cutting boards, and counters used for food preparation immediately after use to avoid cross contaminating other foods. - Wash hands thoroughly with soap after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and before preparing any food or eating. - Wait at least 48 hours after the last episode of vomiting and/or diarrhea before preparing any food for others.
