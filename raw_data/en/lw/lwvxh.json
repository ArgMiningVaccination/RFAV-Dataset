The human movement system is a system of physiolog ical organ systems that interact to produce and support movement of the body and its parts. Physic al therapists are movement system experts. HUMAN MOVEMENT SYSTEM MISSION Washington University Physical Therapy will lead in advancing h uman health through movement, integrating interdisciplinary research, outstanding clinical ca re and education of tomorrow's leaders to drive optimization of function across the lifespan. Education Prepare exceptional practitione rs and researchers who contribut e to the practice and science of physical therapy by providing education exclusively at the doctoral leve l and using innovative teaching strategies delivered by expert faculty. We: Prepare clinical leaders who are practitioners of choice in dia gnosis-based patient care and who aspire to exceed accepted standards for compassionate care and promoti on of health. Provide creative post-professional education that enable physi cal therapists to achieve advanced knowledge, skills and effectiveness in health care delivery; Develop scientists whose research extends the body of knowledge in the movement sciences and whose interdisciplinary work enables translation of new knowledge to enhance clinical practice. Clinical Practice The mission of the Clinical Division is to provide high quality , evidenced-based care with compassion. As movement system experts, we strive to diagnose movement impairm ents and deliver individualized treatment to optimize physical function, health, and wellness a cross the lifespan. Research The mission of the Research Divis ion is to understand a) how th e movement system is affected by disease, injury, lifestyle, development, and aging, and b) how movement can be used to promote health by enhancing 8 physical function, activity, and participation across the lifes pan. Our interdisciplin ary scientific endeavors include mechanistic and translati onal investigations at all lev els of organization from the cell to society. VISION In advancing human health through movement, Washington Universi ty Physical Therapy will: Transform our professional identity by promoting the human move ment system as the foundation of physical therapy Synergistically align creative e ducation, groundbreaking team s cience, and innovative evidence-based practice within the framework o f the human movement system Foster a culture of committed common interest that supports div ersity, inclusion, critical thinking and creativity Embrace consumer values and goals Washington University Program in Physical Therapy Professional Doctor of Physical Therapy Program Philosophy In concert with the view of the University and the School of Me dicine, the Program in Physical Therapy strives to create a collaborative learning environment in which each physical therapy student acquires the knowledge, skills, and attitudes requi red to practice as an eff ective and compassionate health care practitioner at the highest level of excellence in a constantly changing health care environment. At the core of the learning environment is a curriculum based on the f aculty's beliefs about clinical practice and the profession of physical therapy. These beliefs are: Physical therapists have unique expertise and are the practitio ners of choice in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, a nd treatment of movement-rel ated conditions; Physical therapists have a res ponsibility to promote optimal mo vement and general health and to prevent injury, disability, d isease and loss of function; Clinical practice is based on th e clinical science of physical therapy, a body of knowledge drawn from the basic biomedical and physical sciences, applied and clinica l research evidence regarding specific movement-related conditions in hum ans, expertise regarding clin ical phenomena, and knowledge of human behavior derived from the s ocial and behavioral sciences; Optimal clinical effectiveness depends upon the ability of clin icians to think critically; to make decisions in accordance with the current best evidence, sound c linical judgment, and patient preferences; and to function auto nomously in a collaborative, c ollegial manner with other health care practitioners; Physical therapists must perpetually pursue life-long personal and professional development to enhance their ability to assume multiple and continually changi ng roles required of health care professionals who are leaders in a dynamic health care environm ent. 9 Washington University Program in Physical Therapy Professional Degree Program (Doctorate in Physical Therapy) Curriculum Goals, Prerequisites, and Objectives Curriculum Goals The primary goal of the professional curriculum is to prepare p hysical therapists who are committed to providing skillful, evidence-based practice, and continuing gro wth and development of themselves and the profession. Graduates will possess the essential knowledge that contributes to sound clinical decision-making, specifically: a solid foundation in the physi cal, biological, biomedical, beh avioral and social sciences knowledge of the impact of structure, function, growth and deve lopment across the life span, and disease on the ability of the human body to move, function, and respond to treatment; Graduates will be qualified as ge neral practitioners to do the following: use current best evidence, which includes information obtained from expert clinicians and the literature, to support the practice of physical therapy; screen individuals to establish whether or not they are appropr iate for physical therapy; perform a systematic examinati on consisting of appropriate test s and measurements for healthy individuals and for those with m ovement-related musculoskeletal , neuromuscular, cardiopulmonary or integumentary problems; interpret findings, using sound critical thinking and good judg ment (evaluation); assign a movement-related diagnosis based on recognized cluster s of signs and symptoms, using either previously named diagno ses or systematically developed n ew ones; consider the prognosis and other factors that moderate an indiv idual's response to intervention select and provide optimally effective care that is based on th e diagnosis; assume the roles of direct care provider, care manager, educator, consultant and ad vocate; collect data and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions fo r individuals and groups of individuals who are similar to one another; help patients and clients prev ent future movement-related probl ems promote health and wellness effectively communicate and collaborate with peers, care extend ers, patients, and colleagues in other health professions. Graduates will demonstrate behavi ors consistent with their role as compassionate and responsible health care providers, including: respect and advocacy for the ri ghts, beliefs, capabilities, and preferences of others; willingness to accept change, and effectiveness in negotiating for change; effective interpersonal and communication skills; life-long professional conduct; healthy life habits; dedication to the ethical and le gal standards of the profession ; leadership skills that are used in the profession and in one's community; and lifelong commitment to staying informed about contemporary heal th care practice and trends. 10 Professional Doctor of Physical Therapy Accreditation The Program in Physical Therapy is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), 1111 North F airfax a nationally recognized accrediting agency b y the US Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).

A s tudent who has not satisfied al l financial obligations to Washington University (tuition, Olin Hall, p arking fines, etc.) by the end of the Program will not be allowed to graduate. Students who rely on lo an or scholarship funds to mee t their financial obligations should submit their loan applications for processing at least eight we eks prior to the start of classes each year. The Financial Aid office w ill assist students with seekin g information on financial aid options upon request. Continuing Student Status In special instances, the Unive rsity allows Programs to make th e determination that a student can remain with a full-time status, e ven if units drop under the no rmal threshold for full-time status. This status is only allowed when a student is registered in an on-go ing basis in a full-time program, but for some unique reason needs to drop under the full-time threshold. This status allows students to 32 continue with some University b enefits, such as student health and the University's UPass. An individual plan will be discussed w ith the student if this stat us is needed. International students are not eligible for the Continuing Student Status. Annual Schedule The annual academic schedule is prepared in October of the year prior to the beginning of the fall semester. The schedule is coordina ted with the Danforth Campus and Medical Campus schedules. Class Scheduling Faculty and staff are responsib le for scheduling classes and cl ass location. A master schedule is posted for all students at the first of each semester on ShareP oint. Notice of changes in this schedule should be given through course sy llabi or by class. Use of all rooms should be scheduled in advance with the receptionist or other staff member. Classes are scheduled so that students have a 10 minute break e ach hour. Ideally the classes continue from the hour until ten minutes be fore the hour throughout the day (e.g. 8:00 a.m.-8:50 a.m.). Occasionally a speaker will need to complete a section for cont inuity. If classes are 1\u00bd hours long then the class meets for 75 minutes and a 15 minute break is gi ven between it and the next class. Faculty members are responsible f or allowing the breaks and mak e every effort to keep up the schedule. Students must return pr omptly after the break to res ume the schedule. To avoid problems with the schedule, faculty members and students need to be mind ful of the clock, by starting and ending on time. Problems with keeping to the schedule should fi rst be discussed between faculty and students. Persistent problems should be brought to the attentio n of the Assistant Director for the Professional Curriculum. Exam and Assignment Schedules The faculty plans the exam schedule in advance to minimize exce ssive numbers of assignments and exams occurring in one week whene ver possible. Students have in put into the scheduling of finals, with direction from the Assistan t Director for the Professional Curriculum. The semester exam schedule and the finals exam schedule will be finalized by stud ents, in accordance with the course coordinators, by the end of th e second week of each semester. Once the semester's exam schedul e has been finalized, the Assis tant Director for the Professional Curriculum will confirm it with faculty. This schedule will not be changed after the second week of the semester in order for students and faculty to plan their sc hedules accordingly, unless unanimously agreed upon by students and the course master. 33 The Clinical Education Program The Clinical Education Program p rovides an environment in which the student is immersed within physical therapy practice. The student utilizes problem solving and critical thinking skills to integrate specific concepts and techniques into the provision of quality clinical care. This phase of the curriculum is comprised of early integrated and full-time clinical experience s, scheduled at a variety of practice settings that represent the broad scope o f clinical practice in physical therapy. Each clinical education course is designed to correlate with the academic preparation of the stud ent by increasing the number of skills and complexity of problem solving required. The Clinical Education Program promotes a focus on the education of students to the common process of practice in phys ical therapy, which involves professional behavior, communication, patient examination, evaluation, diagn osis, and intervention across inpatient and outpatient settings and with a variety of medical diagnoses (orthopedic, neurological and general medical). Each student is expected to activ ely participate in the clinica l education process and to share in the planning and evaluation of learning experiences. In accordance with the commitment of the Program in Physical Therapy to assessing the quality of all activities thr ough internal and external evaluation, the Clinical Education program incor porates a system of evaluation designed to assess the quality of student performance, clinical faculty performance, and activities of th e Associate Director for Clinical Education/Clinical Education Team. The clinical faculty of the Program in Physical Therapy is rega rded as an integral part of the collegial environment in which our students are educated. The Program is committed to a plan for faculty development for both academic and clinical faculty that is desi gned to incorporate a v ariety of elements leading to professional growth. This exchange of services by t he academic and clinical faculty promotes a cooperative attitude among all involved in the preparation of our future professional colleagues in physical therapy. The Clinical Education Program is, therefore, an essential ingr edient of the curriculum in achieving the goal of producing the type of professional physical therapist w ho can function competently in general clinical practice. The activities of the Clinical Education Pr ogram are supported by the Program as actively as all didactic activities and are recognized as provi ding the environment in which integration of knowledge, skills and attitudes occu rs as each student grows in to a professional physical therapist. In the final clinical experiences, (cons isting of a 10-week and a 12-w eek rotation), the student is asked to integrate all knowledge and sk ills learned in the classroom, la boratory and prior clinical experiences. The emphasis during this time is on: * Complete, accurate and efficient patient assessment and diagn osis, including rationale for choice of procedure and concentration on clinical decision making. * Individualized and creative pa tient intervention program plan ning with elements of revision and timely progression of treatments. * Implementation of treatment p lans using effective teaching an d communication skills. * Early planning for discharge and follow-up care. * Use of evidence in the literature related to examination and intervention. * Demonstration of professional behaviors such as initiative an d assuming responsibilities as appropriate. 34 Grading Criteria for Clinical Education Courses All clinical education experiences (Integrated Early Clinical E xperience I and II through Full-time Clinical Experience I-IV) are graded on a Pass/Fail basis. The requirements for passing include: 1. Successful completion of the fo llowing items at the designated times: A. Self-learning objectives B. Student Evaluation of Clinical Experience and Clinical Instruct or C. Physical Therapist Clinical Performance Instrument (PTCPIWEB) D. Student Self-Assessment E. Professional Behaviors (Generic Abilities) Assessment F. Interprofessional Collaboration Experience G. All other required assignments 2. Achievement of the appropriate r ating scale anchors on the PTCP IWEB 3. Attendance at the clinical experience and at all class discussi on meetings Grading expectations are explaine d and distributed for students and clinical instructors in advance of each clinical experience. Students must successfully complete each clinical experience in the order scheduled before proceeding onto the next. In addition, st udents will only be permitted to begin CE III and IV if he/she has attained a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 for the curriculum of the Progra m in Physical Therapy. At any time during the clinical experiences, if safety issues, clinical performance, or professional behavior becomes a major concern, a student may be immediately withdrawn from the site and the experience. This will constitute a failure of that clinical edu cation course. Early Clinical Experience These two-semester first year integrated clinical experiences a re located within the Professional Issues and Skill Development I and II courses. Both semesters of the E arly Clinical Experience must be passed, and all coursework completed successfully before a student may continue on to Clinical Education I. Clinical Education I (CE I) and Clinical Education II (CE II): Both of these full-time clinical experiences are eight weeks lo ng. CE I occurs at the end of the second semester of didactic prepara tion and CE II follows the 3 rd semester of classroom preparation. Clinical Education III (CE III) and Clinical Education IV (CE I V): CE III and IV are considered to be the 10 and 12 week clinical experiences. CE III and IV follow the 4th semester of classroom preparation. Selection of Clinical Education Facilities: Clinical site selection and deve lopment is the responsibility o f the Clinical Education Team members. We presently have over 500 on-going clinical contract s in St. Louis and throughout the United States. In addition, a small numbe r of international clinical e xperiences are available. Clinical sites are chosen on the basis of their reputation, their philosophy of cl inical education, the type of facility, unique opportunities that can be offered to students, and the clinical expertise or experience of the clinical instructors. Location and trav el expenses, for the student and for visiting faculty members are taken into 35 consideration when a clinical facility is evaluated. Students are given the opportunity to request the investigation of a new clinical site. Students are expected to initiate this through the proper channel (Clinical Education Team). Students or family members should never contac t facilities on their own! The Clinical Education Team will use discretion in choosing the new sites to be investigated dependi ng upon the needs of the students and of the Program in Physical Therapy. Suggestions for new clinical sites for CE I must be submitted by July 1st of the previous year and sugg estions for CE II, III and IV must be submitted by May 15th of the previous year. This time frame allows for site investigation an d development of a completed contract prior to the two site selection days. It should be noted that students who suggest a clinical facility will not automatically be placed at that site. All students have equal o pportunity for experiences at any of the sites we offer. Appropriate Behavior and Appear ance for Clinical Experiences: The physical therapist's professionalism encompasses not only h aving specialized knowledge, but also being aware of the aspects of b ehavior and appearance that affe ct clinical practice. Although there are many variations in both of these latter areas, the requirements below will serve as a basis on which to form your own style of professionalism after graduation. Until then, you will be expected to adhere to these standards while participati ng in the clinical education p hases of the Program in Physical Therapy or when in contact with patients dur ing other phases of the curric ulum. I. Appropriate Appearance for Clinical Experiences: Wearing the appropriate attire is important because you are a p rofessional representative of Washington University. Appropriate attire also provides you wit h comfortable, non-restrictive clothing necessary in a physical t herapist's clinical practice. You will be expected to wear the appropriate attire for all activities involving clinical contac t with patients unless specifically instructed otherwise. [You may be specifically requested or all owed, by a clinical supervisor, to change your dress requirements while at that facility. Adapting your style of dress and accessories (including piercings) to fit the standards set at any facility may be necessary.] A. Appropriate Attire: The appropriate attire consists of a short white jacket to b e worn with professional clothing. This jacket will be provided to each student as a gift from the Program. The length of shirts/tops should be adequate t o cover the entire trunk at res t and during all movements by the student. That means that no skin should be visible on the abdomen, breas ts, or between the shirt and pants when in the clinic. Jeans and t-shirts must never be worn. Clothing should be in nice condition. A nametag, p rovided upon admission, is to b e worn on the left side of the jacket below the collar. Your shoes must be closed-toe s tyle of a neutral color. No s andals, clogs, tennis shoes, hiking boots or other novelty shoes will be permitted. Nylons or sock s should be worn. Accessories such as jewelry should be kept at a minimum and should not inte rfere with treatment or cause potential safety hazards. For example, large earrings or other body rings are inappropriate. Fingernails should be kept shor t and clean for sanitary and saf ety reasons. A watch that counts seconds is needed. Hairstyles must stay neat while you work and not interfere with your performance of patient care ac tivities. Long hair should be tie d back with a simple clip, barrette or rubber band. Avoid obtrusive hai rstyles, colors, and decorat ive accessories. 36 II. Appropriate Behavior for Clinical Experiences: In addition to employing appropr iate social courtesy, the foll owing should be regarded as specific suggestions for professional beh avior in the clinical setting: 1. It is your responsibility to seek all the information you need to be able to comply with the departmental policies in the clinical setting. The orientation given you by the clinical instructor should assist you in knowing policies, but it is also your resp onsibility to ask for additional information or seek clarificati on of information provided. Such policies will concern lunch, breaks, smoking regulations, dress code, fire and emergency pro cedures, departmental hours, and holidays. 2. Any gratuities offered to you by patients should be reporte d to your clinical instructor and handled in a manner appropriate to that specific situation. 3. Avoid chewing gum while treating patients. 4. Permission of the clinical ins tructor is required before vi siting patients after departmental hours. In some facilities, this is an acceptable practice, in s ome it is not. Check beforehand, and comply with those procedures. 5. Asking questions of your clinical instructor will not only facilitate your learning, but will ensure patient safety and quality care. Be discrete about quest ions asked in front of the patient, and reserve all questions regar ding prognosis for when the pati ent is not present. Be aware of your clinical instructor's time c onstraints in answering questi ons as well as your obligation to ask those questions. 6. Your strict adherence to the ethical standards, which prote ct the patients' confidence, is required. Do not discuss your patients' condition(s) outside th e clinical setting. Patients may be discussed with classmates and faculty for educational purposes, but avoid identifying them by name. 7. Your attention to common courtesy is essential in the clini cal setting. Communication of respect, your display of good lis tening skills and sensitive ve rbal communications will be helpful in promoting productive working relationships with your clinical supervisors and peers. 8. You are expected to strive toward achievement of the \"Profe ssional Behaviors/Generic Abilities\" (see handout), displaying appropriate affective/prof essional behaviors. 9. Students are obligated to report back to the school any eth ical or legal compromises noted at their clinical sites. 10. Cell phones may not be turned on during clinic times unles s they are being used for an aspect of patient care. 11. Photos/videos should not be taken on personal cell phones or other recording devices. 11. Students completing clinical internships are not allowed to also be employed by the institution/clinic during the time frame of the clinical intern ship. 37 Remedy of a Failure in Clinical Education: Under most circumstances, the failure of any clinical experienc e will necessitate review by the faculty. Ordinarily, if a student fails a full time clinical experience for the first time, the Clinical Education Team will offer a remedy. The locati on, length, and type of a make-u p clinical experience will be determined by the Clinical Education Team. In some instances students may be denied the opportunity to remedy a failed clinical experience. Stude nts needing to remediate a cli nical experience will incur additional tuition costs at the usual rate. If a student fails the same Clinical Education course twice or fails more than one course in the clinical education series, he or she will be revi ewed by PT CAPES and may be dismissed from the Program in Physical Therapy (See PT CAPES policies.) S tudents who require an additional clinical experience and those who cannot complete all clinical education requirements by the fifth semester will graduate and be elig ible to sit for the national physical therapist licensing exam at a later date than their classmates (although they may participate in th e class graduation ceremonies held in May). Travel for Clinical Education: It is extremely beneficial for students to have cars; however, carpooling may be arranged for local clinical experiences. Students must be prepared to travel out-of-town f or clinical education. Expenses incurred during local or out-of-town clinical experiences must be paid b y the student. This includes things such as travel (airfare, mileage, and accessibility to transportation), lodging, parking, meals, phone calls, etc. Criminal Background Checks: As stated in the mailing prior to matriculation, criminal backg round checks are required of all incoming students by the Medical School. Students must clear this backgr ound check prior to matriculation into the Program. Subsequent background checks may be required by the cl inical sites and/or the Program. The student will be responsible for a ny additional costs associated with criminal background checks. No records will be kept by the Program. The Medical School registr ar will keep a letter on file stating simply that the student passed the background check. Minor infraction s may be permissible for Program enrollment, however, may not be permissible by clinical facilit ies and/or state licensure boards. Drug Testing Drug testing is required of all incoming Medical School student s. This swab test must be completed through Student Health during orientation. Students who do not pass the drug test will undergo further testing by an outside lab. Any student not passing this test wi ll not be permitted continued enrollment. Any future testing required by a clinical facility according to their policies (prior to or during the clinical experience) will need to be completed through the clinical faci lity or a local agency, a t the student's cost. Students who test positive after the first test will be treated appropriately by Student Health and may be prevented from enrolling in a clinical experience course prior to successful completion of treatment and subsequent clean testing. Records will be given to the student and a letter stating the status of their test will be kept through the Medical School registrar. Neither the Program nor Student Health will keep records of drug testing. 38 INSURANCE AND FEES FOR CLINI CAL EDUCATION E XPERIENCES Liability Insurance: Through a self-insured program, Washington University protects each duly registered student against lawsuits or claims of medical m alpractice.

Participation in these three a reas enables us to contribute broadly to the advancement of the profession of p hysical therapy. It is both a privilege and an obligation for the faculty and students to participate in all three areas. The organizational charts on th e following two pages will famil iarize you with how the Program is organized. Within this basic structure, you will find the lines of communication to be open and the faculty to be actively concerned that t heir activities be well integrat ed into a meaningful whole. This means we have a commitment to your edu cation that is equal to our resear ch and patient care activities. The Faculty & Staff You have a very dynamic faculty at Washington University. In ad dition to a core group of faculty members, many other physical the rapists and experts in health c are are involved in both lecturing and lab assisting. All faculty members are oriented to their roles by c ourse coordinators or the Associate Director for the Professional Curriculum. All core faculty members are involved in teaching, as well as c linical practice and/or research. Most faculty members are involved with the American Physical Therapy Association and other professional societies. Make time to get to know your faculty and their acti vities. Names of the c ourse coordinators are listed in the section on the curriculum. Staff members are skilled and friendly. You will find many of t hem working in the main office, the clinical practice, and in the various research laboratories.

The following services are highlighted as important to the majority of students. Advisement No formal system is used to assign students an academic advisor once they are in the graduate physical therapy program. We have found that students in need o f advisement will contact the faculty member with whom they feel most comfortable. All facult y members are willing to serve as an advisor for any student. Please feel free to contact any faculty member as the need arises. You may meet with faculty members as often as seems necessary. If you are not sure who to talk to, contact the Associate Director for Professional Curriculum. All students are assigned a clinical education team member to serve as an advisor for the clinical e ducation component of the program.

HIV/HBV/Immunization Policy All incoming students must provide student health services with immunity documentation. A list of the vaccinations that are require d can be found on the student health services web page. http://wusmhealth.wustl.edu/students/new-students/ The program is committed to the protection of all individuals w ho test positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is the right of all patients including those with HIV or HBV to receive physical therapy equal to that offered to all other patients. Physical therapy students and physical therapists have the prof essional and ethical responsibility to provide appropriate care to all patients, without discriminatio n. Students are informed in the curriculum as to the correct pro cedures to use when working wit h all types of infections in order to protect themselves. To protect others, any student who tests positive for HIV or HB V must identify themselves if other individuals, including classmat es, faculty, and patients, with whom they have contact may be at risk. Again it is the student's professional responsibility to protec t others. The Program will in turn protect the privacy of the student with HIV or HBV and is willing to al ter the curriculum, with reasonable accommodation, for the student to meet the competencies. Immuni zation against HBV is available to all students. Noncompliant stude nts will be excluded from class room and /or patient care areas. Students are encouraged to be immunized. Most students choose t his option and for the majority of the clinical facilities it is required. We cannot guarantee cli nical experience placement and resultant Program completion for those who choose not to be immunized. Tutorial Assistance Tutorial assistance is available and can be obtained by student s experiencing difficulty during the semester. Generally the limit on tutorial assistance is 12 hour s per month per course per student. Students may not request a tutor to improve already acceptable (passing) grades. Students are discouraged from using tutors for the purpose of having a ready study partner or to substitute for unexcused absences from class. St udents are encouraged in these cases to study with other individuals or student groups on an informal basis. Students may request a tutor or a tutor may be recommended for a student by a faculty member. To obtain a tutor, students must contact the course master. The course master will assign a tutor for that student. Occasionall y tutoring will be offered to groups depending on the type of tutoring needed and the topic of inter est. Under special circumstances tutors may be recommended by PT CAPES in advance of specific needs. Tutors for first year students include either second year stude nts or fellow students in the first year class who have demonstrated excellent performance in class and have volunteered to tutor. Third year students are used to tutor second year students, when they are available. If they are not available, second year students will tutor their peers. Students who are d oing well are highly encouraged to volunteer to become tutors. Faculty often will approach student s to ask them if they would be willing to serve as a tutor. 54 Students requesting tutoring hav e the following responsibilitie s: - regularly attend class (an attendance record of students who have tutors will be kept.) - once a tutor is identified by the course coordinator, the stu dent may approach the tutor to arrange a time and place for assistance - the student must arrive at th e appointment on time and be pre pared with questions to ask - a student who arrives unprepared may be asked to reschedule t he appointment to make better use of the time allowed for tutorial assistance - students must respect the schedule of the tutor; last minute requests and excessive demands, especially during test weeks may be refused - tutoring is not to be used for completing assignments or take home exams Tutors are paid for their time and they have the following resp onsibilities: - tutors must notify a course m aster when they have been approa ched by a student for tutoring, complete a tutoring authorization form and follow the instructions on this form - tutors must keep the course coordinator informed of any probl ems which occur during tutoring (e.g. the student comes unprepared, does not ask quest ions, does not follow through with suggestions, is disrespectful of the tutor's time, etc.) - tutors have the right to refu se to provide tutoring assistanc e which is not scheduled in advance or when a student arrives unprepared or wants the tutor to \"do the work for him or her\", or when the tutor's o wn performance in class is being jeopardized - tutors must notify the course coordinator when they wish to d iscontinue being a tutor - tutors are responsible for keep ing track of their time and su bmitting a tutor time sheet to the designated staff member on a biweekly basis WebSTAC WebSTAC is an online student info rmation resource which include s Academic Records (grades, gpa, intent to graduate etc.), Billi ng Records (account, pay/view bi ll, third party billing, etc.), Contact Information (address/e-mail address), courses and Registration (course listings, bulletin etc.), and Personal Preferences (information restriction/password). You m ay access WebSTAC at https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/ or through the Program website under quicklinks at http://pt.wustl.edu . It is very critical that you update y our local address and phone numb er during orientation and keep it updated so that your financial aid, e tc. will be processed in a timely way. Please refer to the WebSTAC brochure that was provided to you over the summer and during orientation . Writing Center A writing center is available on the main campus to assist stud ent with their writing skills. They will offer critique and feedback for improving student (and faculty) writt en papers. For more details see http://artsci.wustl.edu/~writing/home.html Diversity and Inclusion Washington University Program in Physi cal Therapy (WUPT) is committed to promoting and fostering diversity a nd inclusion within the Prog ram, the University and the Community. There are many resource s regarding diversity and inc lusion at Washington University. WUPT works collabor atively with other groups to en sure that WashU is a community where everyone is valu ed and respected. For more info rmation and opportunities, see https://diversity.wustl.edu/ a nd https://divers ity.med.wustl.ed u/. We also encourage you to view the full list of nearly 100 divers ity groups at https://diversi ty.wustl.edu/get-involved/?group- filter=students to determine how you would like to get involved . 55 Financial Aid/ Scholarships/Contracts The faculty would like no student's education compromised because of financial need. Financial aid information (e.g. loans and scholarships) can be found in the F inancial Aid Office of the Medical School which is located across from the Registrar's Office in the McDo nnell Science building. This office keeps information about generally available graduate student assistan ce as well as some information specific to physical therapy. Occasionally, the program will post informat ion it receives in the mail about financial aid. Staff members in the program admissions office are program liaisons to the Financial Aid Office. Emergency student loans can often be obtained through the Misso uri Physical Therapy Association. If you develop problems that cannot be solved through the financia l aid office, please see the Director of the Program. Scholarships As noted abo ve some scholarship opportunities are known by the Financial Aid Office. Many students find scholarships funding throug h a wide variety of sources inc luding small businesses, philanthropic and service groups, and special interest groups. It does take time to make the effort to complete applications, but the payoff in the long run could well be worth that time. Students have been successful in covering many school-related costs by obtaining a series of small schola rships. Faculty members are willing to write letters and references that are needed for scholarship ap plications. Ask a faculty member whom you feel knows the most about you and your performance to receive a positive reference. Students should watch for schol arships offered by the APTA (www .apta.org). Occasionally outstanding students are nominated by faculty for special scholarships such as the Mary McMillan Student Scholarship Award. Scholarships are for one year onl y and can change based on available funds. Program Scholarships Prog ram in PT Merit Sch olarships: Merit Scholarship are awarde d to second and third-year stu dents based upon the cumulative GPA from their p revious year's course work and recommendation b y the Director of the program. Application for this recogn ition of merit is not necessary. Prog ram in PT Need Scholarships: Students will receive a scholarship based on information received from the Finan cial Aid office. Assistantships: Assistantship op portunities in the Program are designed to allow students to gain valuable research and professional experien ce, while working to defray educational costs. Students are required to work 250 hours during their first year, 200 hours during their second year, and 100 hours during their final third year semester. In this cooperative scholarship program, students will receive up to $8,000 during their first and second year and $2000 during their third year final semester to assist them with tuition and other program expen ses. Assistantship recipients m ay renew their position each year provided that they maintain at least a 3.25 cumulative GPA at the end of each academic year, receive positive performance appraisals from their supervising faculty member, a nd research opportunities and assignments remain available. Selection is made by a committee composed of faculty members appointed by the Director, and is based upon information on each individu al's application. 56 Robert J. and Betty L. Hick ok Scho larsh ip: Named for an emeritu s member of the faculty, this scholarship is awarded to a secon d-year student wh o has demonst rated exemplary personal integrity, consistent pro fessional commitment, leadership, and excellence in clinical work.

Steven J. Rose Diversity Development Scholarsh ip: This scholarship is awarded to a first-year, second- year, and third-year student who has achieved a cumulative 3.0 GPA or above and will contribute to the educational diversity at The Program in Physical Therapy. An email announcing additional scholarships, with the financial amount, criteria, and application deadline will be sent at the end of each academic year. Professional Behaviors (Gen eric Abilities) of Students The faculty at the Program in Physical Therapy agrees there are behaviors expected of all students in a professional program. We have selected as a method of assisting students to develop professional skills part of a system originally developed at the University of Wisc onsin in Madison. The expected behaviors are termed \"Generic Abilities\" . These abilities are described in detail in the following several pages. Students are not expected to automatically demonstrate advanced skills in all areas of the assessment, but basic behaviors are expected from students at all times, in the classroom and the clinic; and students are expected to develop as they progress through the program. Stude nts are expected to become familiar with the information on the generic abilities early in the curriculu m. Self-Assessment: Near the middle of the Fall semester, all stud ents are required to complete a self- assessment of their Generic Abilities using a form developed by the program. The Clinical Education Team Members review the self-appr aisals and return them to stud ent with appropriate feedback as needed. Copies are not retained by the Program. Students experi encing difficulty in developing professional behavior are expected to assist faculty in identif ying ways to further their development. Assessment by Academic Faculty: Faculty may expect students to demonstrate all or some of the Generic Abilities as part of class participation or during class activi ties. Faculty will use th e descriptions of the generic abilities to communicate with students about expectatio ns. Assessment by Clinical Faculty: The Generic Abilities Assessment by clinical faculty and additional self- assessment will occur during the Early Clinical Experience (ECE ) and continue into the full time clinical experiences (CE I-IV). 57 Professional Behaviors for the 21st Century 2009-2010 Definitions of Behavioral Criteria Levels Beginning Level - behaviors cons istent with a learner in the be ginning of the pro fessional phase of physical therapy education and before the first significant int ernship Intermediate Level - behaviors consistent with a learner after the first significant internship Entry Level - behaviors consistent with a learner who has compl eted all didactic work and is able to independently manage a caseload with consultation as needed fro m clinical instructors, co-workers and other health care professionals Post-Entry Level - behaviors cons istent with an autonomous prac titioner beyond entry level Background Information In 1991 the faculty of the Univ ersity of Wisconsin-Madison, Phy sical Therapy Educational Program identified the original Physical Therapy - Specific Generic Abilities . Since that time these abilities have been used by academic programs to facilitate the development, m easurement and assessment of professional behaviors of student s during both the didactic and clinical phases of the programs of study. Since the initial study was conduc ted, the profession of Physic al Therapy and the curricula of the educational programs have undergone significant changes that mi rror the changes in healthcare and the academy. These changes include managed care, expansion in the s cope of physical therapist practice, increased patient direct access to physical therapists, evidenc ed-based practice, clinical specialization in physical therapy and the American Physical Therapy Association' s Vision 2020 supporting doctors of physical therapy. Today's physical therapy prac titioner functions on a more auton omous level in the delivery of patient care which places a higher demand for professional development on th e new graduates of the physical therapy educational programs. Most recen tly (2008-2009), the research team of Warren May, PT, MPH, Laurie Kontney PT, DPT, MS and Z. Annette Iglarsh, PT, PhD, MBA comple ted a research project that built on the work of other researcher s to analyze the PT-Specific Generic Abilities in relation to the changing landscape of physical therapist p ractice and in relation to gen erational differences of the \"Millennial\" or \"Y\" Generation (born 1980-2000). These are the graduates of th e classes of 2004 and beyond who will shape clinical practice in the 21 st century. The research project was twofold and consisted of 1) a research survey which identified and rank ordered professional behaviors expected o f the newly licensed physical therapist upon employment (2008); and 2) 10 small work groups that took the 10 identified behaviors (sta tistically determined) and wrote/revised behavior definitions, behavioral criteria and placement within developmental levels (Beginning, Intermediate, Entry Level and Po st Entry Level) (2009). Intere stingly the 10 statistically significant behaviors identified were identical to the original 10 Generic Abilities , however, the rank orders of the behaviors changed. Participants in the research survey include d Center Coordinators of Clinical Education (CCCE's) and Clinical I nstructors (CI's) from all reg ions of the United States. Participants in the small work groups included Directors of Clinical Education (DCE's), Academic Faculty, CCCE's and CI's from all regions of the United States. 58 This resulting document, Professional Behaviors , is the culmination of this research project. The definitions of each professional be havior have been revised alo ng with the behavioral criteria for each developmental level. The 'devel oping level' was changed to the 'intermediate level' and the title of the document has been changed from Generic Abilities to Professional Behaviors . The title of this important document was changed to differe ntiate it from the original Generic Abilities and to better reflect the intent of assessing professional behaviors deemed critical for profess ional growth and development in physical therapy education and practice. Preamble In addition to a core of cognitiv e knowledge and psychomotor sk ills, it has been recognized by educators and practicing professionals that a repertoire of behaviors is required for success in a ny given profession (Alverno College Faculty, Assess ment at Alverno, 1979). The id entified repertoire of behaviors that constitute professional behavior reflect the values of any give n profession and, at the same time, cross disciplinary lines (May et. al., 1991). Visualizing cognitive knowledge, psychomot or skills and a repertoire of behaviors as the legs of a three-legged stool ser ves to emphasize the importance of each. Remove one leg and the stool loses its stability and makes it v ery difficult to support professional growth, development, and ultimately, professional success. (May et. al. , Opportunity Favors the Prepared: A Guide to Facilitating the Development of Professional Behavior, 2002) The intent of the Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool is to identify and describe the repertoire of professional behaviors deemed n ecessary for success in the prac tice of physical therapy. This Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool is intended to represent and be applied to stu dent growth and development in the classroom and the clinic. It also contains behavioral criteria for the practicing clinician. Each Professional Behavior is defined and then broken dow n into developmental levels with each level containing behavioral criteria that describe behavio rs that represent possession of the Professional Behavior they represent. Each developmenta l level builds on the previo us level such that the tool represents growth over time in physical therapy educat ion and practice. It is critical that students, academic and clinical faculty uti lize the Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool in the context of physical therapy and not life experience s. For example, a learner may possess strong communication skills in th e context of student life and work situations, however, may be in the process of developing their physi cal therapy communication skil ls, those necessary to be successful as a professional in a greater health care context. One does not ne cessarily translate to the other, and thus must be used in the appropria te context to be effective. Opportunities to reflect on each Professional Behavior through self- assessment , and through peer and instructor assessment is critical for progress toward entry lev el performance in the classroom and clinic. A learner does not need to possess each behavioral criteria ide ntified at each level within the tool, however, should demonstrate, and be able to provide examples of the majority in order to move from one level to the next. Likewise, the behavioral criteria are examp les of behaviors one might demonstrate, however are not exhaustive. Acad emic and clinical facilities m ay decide to add or delete behavioral criteria based on the needs of their specific setting. Formal opportunities to reflect and discuss with an academic and/or clinical instruc tor is key to the tool's use, a nd ultimately professional growth of the learner. The Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool allows the learner to build and strengthen thei r third leg with skills in the affective domain to augment the co gnitive and psychomotor domains. 59 Professional Behaviors 1.

The re sponsibilities connected with that commitment are many, just as they are numerous for the faculty. The following expectations for professional behavior are needed to meet these obligations. If a student demonstrates unprofessional behaviors, faculty may use the Professionalism Concern Form to document and counsel the student. Please refer to form at the end of the section on professional behavior. DEMONSTRATE PROFESSIONAL CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR Come to class Make the investment you are putting into your future career wor thwhile- come to class. Your ultimate obligation to your patients implies an interest in lea rning the most you can. All faculty members expect students to attend class. Classroom discussion a nd lab participation will enhance your assigned readings. Attention during class will enhance you r understanding of information, no matter what your learning style is. Class participation and clinical experience will form the basis for your developing sound clinical judgment. At times att endance in class will be mandatory and attendance may be taken at any time. Absenteeism is a refle ction of your reliability and an indication of your professional work habits in the future. Pat terns of being absent will be considered when assessing your pe rformance in the curriculum. T reat being a PT student as your full time job. The faculty does understand th ere will be occasional absences. When students miss class, it is expected they will call the school prior to class to inform the staff, who will then notify the appropriate faculty members. If you are absent it is your responsibility to obtain handout materials and class notes from your classmates and to meet with faculty to clarify questions . Be prepared in advance for class Being prepared for class saves time (an important commodity) be cause it allows you to direct your questions toward areas of tru e confusion rather than gener al lack of knowledge. You contribute to your classmates' learning through your questions as they contribute to yours with their questions. Be prompt Come to class, clinical experiences, and meetings on time. It b enefits you and is your professional responsibility. It is a courtesy to the faculty, your patients, and your classmates. Hand in assignments on time. Not only will that allow you to avoid pena lties, which may affect your grades, it will help you to keep on time for other commitments. Be courteous Even in times of stress, be cour teous to your classmates, staff , and all faculty members. All will appreciate your efforts and will certainly reciprocate. In rece nt years class members have been increasingly upset with classmates who are not courteous. Disco urteous behavior is not acceptable in the classroom under any circumstance. 69 Examples of discourteous classroom behaviors that are not accep table include ringing cell phones, using text messaging or e-mail during class, wearing ha ts, sleeping, talking during lectures, interrupting lecturers excessively, being late to arr ive or in returning from break, packing up early, and using non-verbal behaviors which would commonly b e judged as impolite. Students who are discourteous in class will be advised and may be asked to leave a class if their behavior continues to be a problem. Repeated infractions will be reporte d at PT CAPES as a deficiency in professional behavior. Help to keep the space neat and professional looking Students are responsible for pu tting away all equipment and sup plies used during class each day. Students are responsible for resetting the classroom furniture each day. Students must be sure not to leave trash, food containers, food, or dishware behind in a ny of the space. Items left behind will be discarded weekly. Faculty members are responsibl e for keeping the stage and podium neat and professional looking. The Housekeeping departme nt will provide cleaning of the space. Any problems with the sp ace or supplies should be report ed immediately to Charlene Williams who is our liaison with h ousekeeping and maintenance. 70 Washington University School of Medicine Program in Physical Therapy Professionalism Concern Form ________________________________________ ______________________ _____________________ Student name (type or print legib ly) Evaluator Name (type or print legibly) _______________________________ ________________ ______________ ______________ Course, if applicable (dept. or course title) Site (if applicab le) Time Period of Concern This student has exhibited one or more of the following behavio rs that need improvement to meet expected standards of professional behaviors as outlined in the Physical Therapy Student Handbook in the sections on Professional Behaviors for the 21st Century and Professional Classroom Behavior.

Membership provides you with many sources of information that will teach y ou about the Association and keep you current in issues and ev ents in the profession of phys ical therapy today. Membership also provides you with opportun ities and privileges not afforde d to non-members. These include free publications, access to much of the website, and discounts on courses and products, among other things. Students will need access to restricted portions of the website to complete assignments. Being a student member also has special financial benefits once you graduate and become a regular member. Students are highly encouraged by faculty to attend Eastern Dis trict meetings (usually once monthly on Tuesday evenings during the school year) and other s tate or national meetings if possible, unless classes are scheduled. Students are encouraged to be active in the Missouri Chapter of the APTA student special interest group (MSSIG). Each class appoints an APTA rep resentative to serve as a liaiso n to the faculty and to the student committees at the District and State levels. See section on class organization and committees. Be Active in The Program Be willing to volunteer and to work with the members of the pro gram. Such opportunities allow students variety from their usual class routine, encourage soci alization among students, and help develop leadership skills. Your contributions improve the qual ity of the program and your experience here. The program inv ites student participation thro ugh several mechanisms. Class Organization Each class organizes itself through some sort of structure that allows students to plan activities such as special events at the p rogram, social events, community volunteer efforts, and graduation. The class is welcome to develop its own structure. Leaders are to be reconsidered at the beginning of each year (fall of the first year, fall of the sec ond year, and late spring of the second year in preparation for the third year.) Generally officers an d committees are formed to serve individual needs of the class. S ome examples of positions and d uties created in the past are listed below. [Not all classes have had all positions and not all duti es have been divided this way- these are examples.] President: serves as primary lead er of the class, aids decision making and communication among groups. Communicates between Program staff and class. President helps staff recruit student help for special functions. Attributes: organization, communication and leadership skills, a positive attitude. Faculty liaison: serves as primar y communicator between the fac ulty and the class (does not represent individual students); a ttends regular faculty meeting s held every other Tuesday from 12:10 p.m.-12:55 p.m. Helps the Assistant Director for Professi onal Curriculum in finalizing the test and final exam schedules; negotiates between the faculty a nd class when class sessions have 73 to be changed. Coordinates \"Bro wn Bag lunches\" for faculty and students with the faculty coordinator (C. Caldwell). The liaison will call for periodic c lean-up of the classroom. Attributes: communication and negotiation sk ills, organization, and willing ness to advocate for both students and faculty. APTA/MPTA liaison: serves as the representative of the class to the Student Liaison Committee of the Eastern District of the Missouri Chapter of the American Physical Therapy Association. The liaison is encouraged to a ttend district meetings (the seco nd Tuesday of about three months each semester) and report back to classmates. Helps faculty enc ourage student attendance at district and state meetings. W orks with faculty APTA liaison an d the Associate Director for Professional Curriculum in communicating about the APTA to clas s. Either the first or second year APTA liaisons serve as Program representatives for the MPT A state Student Liaison Committee. The representative will also be the contact to the M issouri Student Special Interest Group (MSSIG) and may wish to participate actively within this group. Attributes: interest in the APTA, enthusiasm, and communication skills. Treasurer: Most classes raise monies for special events, social activities, and community or professional contributions. Money can be raised through class d ues, special requests, or Program sanctioned activities (approved by the Director). Classes have tried a number of ways to raise money. Second year students have traditionally sold PT school r elated items like logo clothing and athletic wear. The treasure r makes deposits and writes chec ks, solicits and collects dues or special collections. Attributes: attention to detail, accountab ility. Students may have a class checking account, but they are no t tax exempt and the Universit y's name may not be on the checking account. [For additional information see Linda Lynn.] Social Chair: Can be a committee. The social chair leads the or ganization of social events. Tradition, but not the Program, has dictated when classes give each other parties. In the past the second year students have hosted a party after the first major exam of the first year students. The first year students have traditi onally hosted a Halloween party . None of these events are required, but the class might want a leader if you decide to have events. Also, some social committees organize weekend special trips and acknowledge student birthday s. Sometimes classes have a separate birthday committee. Attributes: organization, enthusia sm, a sense of fun. Intramural liaisons: help to communicate about intramural event s on Main Campus, post sign- ups, make announcements. May want t wo people- one for men, one for women. Attributes: enthusiasm for sports, organization and communication skills. Community Service: The Program encourages classes to become inv olved in community and volunteer activities. Some classes have adopted particular caus es and some classes have been involved in a variety of activities. Some activities in the pas t have been participating in and raising money for walk/runs like those for the Relay for Life, Juvenile Diabetes Association, AIDS, Breast Cancer. Some classes have helped to collect clothi ng of food for local charities. One year our students organized t hemselves to deliver bagels fr om a local bagel shop to a homeless shelter downtown every night all year. We frequently h ave university wide blood drives. For a couple of years students held a Talent Show in th e fall to raise money for a family's Christmas. Recently students have gone on international medica l and social service trips to Honduras, Guatemala , and Argentina. In the Springs of 1998-2017, st udents organized a run for the A PTA Foundation for Physical Therapy Research (we have won third place in the school challen ge three years and received 74 Honorable Mention twelve years). The Foundation for PT run take s quite a bit of organization. The class might have a separate committee for that effort (see below). In 2012, we were entered into the Philanthropy Circle of the Foundation's Cornerstone Ci rcle for dedicated support of the Foundation and physical therapy research. In 2015, we received the Award of Merit for raising greater than $6,000. Historian: Recently classes have appointed a historian. This pe rson is responsible for tracking the activities of the class and helps consolidate a series of pictu res to record class activities. Sometimes classes have retrospective DVD shows during the gradu ation festivities. The historian can help to organize this effort. Web page liaison to faculty: The faculty and staff have a web p age committee. Each class is requested to have a representa tive to the committee. University policies regarding use of logos, and content of the pages must be adhered to. All creations must be approved by the web page committee. Liaisons will also be invited to give their input re garding new ideas for the Program web site. Social Media liaison: Jenny Brown coordinates our social media efforts. She would like to have a social media liaison from each c lass to provide input when chan ges are made. . Committees /Activities Student Ambassadors: Students may sign up to serve as Student Ambassadors to help th e Supervisor of Admissions and Student Affairs. Student Ambassadors assist the admissions offi ce staff in meeting prospective and admitted students throughout t he year. Students help to pro vide Program tours, give information, and frequently will take a prospective student to lunch (paid for by the Program). Orientation committee: The second year class hosts, with the Pr ogram's help, the orientation social. It is helpful for several members to be on this committ ee. Help is needed to locate and reserve a place and time, organize sign-ups for the picnic, get out invitations, maps etc. At the picnic help is needed to set-up and clean-up. Also at orientati on the Program solicits students in the second year class to help with writing a welcoming letter, developing the list of helpful resources in the area, providing tours, serving on the student panel discussion, \"manning\" the welcome desk, and helping with orientation. Open House/DPT Preview: On a Satu rday in the Fall and Spring of each year the Program hosts an Open House or Preview for a pplicants and prospective student s to the Program. The staff and faculty solicit student help with small group discussions, \"man ning\" a welcome desk, and providing tours as needed. Graduation Committee: Students will participate in the Danforth campus graduation and the Program arranges and provides a private luncheon and hooding ce remony afterwards. Some classes have organized more festivities outside the ceremony. F or example, some classes have opted for more than one reception. Some classes have organized parties on an evening before graduation. Sometimes classes have raised funds prior to gradua tion to cover all costs and sometimes they charge people t o attend graduation events. The d ecision about having extra activities and whether they are p aid by the class or by individ uals is up to the class. A committee typically handles these efforts be ginning in the spring of the second year 75 Foundation for PT Research Fundraisers: Run for Research: For the past 19 years students have organize d a 5K run and a one mile walk to raise money for the Foundation for Physical Therapy, wh ich supports research in physical therapy. The Challenge is typically organized by two P T programs and their students as a challenge to raise money for this cause. Committe e members are needed for this effort to continue. All kinds of skills would be useful fo r this committee. Bulletin Board/ Facilities Committe e This committee, consisting of faculty, staff and students with representation from each class, works to keep our space in presentable shape and the bulletin boards current. The student mem ber will provide input to the co mmittee about ideas for what gets placed on bulletin boards and w ill assist in keeping postings o n the boards appropriately placed. Also, the facilities committee me mber will assist staff in keep ing the student space and lounge clean, with particular attention to the classrooms after labora tories and to the refrigerator, being sure old food is discar ded in a timely way. Physical Therapy Inclusion & Div ersity (PTID) Washington Univer sity Program in Physical Therapy (WUPT) is committed to promoting and fostering diversit y and inclusion within the Program, the University and the C ommunity. The Program has a te am called PT ID (Physical Therapy Inclusion & Diversity) that meets monthly and works to advance this mission. PT ID includes students, staff and faculty who meet monthly. If you are interested in being a member of PT ID please email Gammon Earhart ( earhartg@wustl.edu ). OBTAIN AND USE YOUR BOOKS AND TOOLS Buy and keep your books- this is your professional library The faculty works regularly to keep the reading of books and as signments limited to what they think is necessary for preparing you for safe clinical practice . The faculty believes the reading for class is critical material that not only reinforces what is lec tured on in class, but extends the content beyond what can be gained by lecture. Unless it is note d, faculty members consider reading assignments required and they will test on content that is assigned. Faculty members select required books on the basis of whether t hey themselves would buy the book for keeping in a personal library. Required books are expe cted to be useful to students for many years, and not become obsolete in a short period of time. Because students could never rely wholly on what they learn in lecture and what they remember aft er the program for safe practice, books should be purchased and kept for personal reference. A li brary is a wise investment that all faculty members value highly. Purchase the Required Clinical Tools The faculty has carefully develope d a list of clinical tools th at it feels are necessary for physical therapists to own for use in the clinic. Students are expected to arrive to the Program with the following list of items and guidelines are provided to incoming students as to the quality and type needed. Student Responsibility Program provides at Orientation Option al tape measure 8\" goniometer s t a i n l ess steel scissors reflex hammer finger goniometer inclinometer pen light standard adult pressure cuff s t e t h o s c o p e 76 The program provides lockers in the locker rooms for students t o store their equipment, as it is necessary to have it available fo r student during class. Studen ts should also take the needed equipment to the clinic during clinical experiences. Inclinometers, flexible rulers, gait belts, and scissors are pr ovided for student use while they are in the Program for use during class. They are stored in the equ ipment closet lockers. Students are responsible for returning all bo rrowed equipment to the designa ted lockers. See the section on clinical education to learn about clinical t oo and uniform requirements for the clinical experiences. COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY Communicate frequently Keep faculty and your classmates informed. Faculty members are always open to meeting with students. Though most do not have regular office hours, all are willing to arrange appointments as needed. All faculty and staff members have e-mail addresses and mailboxes in the Main Office. Messages can be left and faculty m embers are prompt to reply, u sually through your university e- mail or mailbox in return. Messages may also be left with the s taff. Many class announcements are made through e-mail- check your mail daily! Seek Advice The program does not assign specific advisors to each student, but each of the f aculty believes that advising students is a faculty member responsibility. If y ou need to seek advice about academic or personal needs, please contact any faculty members with whom you feel comfortable. Each faculty member shares a genuine concern for t he students in this program. If you are unsure who to contact- see Dr. Jennifer Stith. Give Constructive & Complimentary Feedback Your opinions are essential to maintain an excellent curriculum . Interaction with the faculty through both formal and inform al opportunities are provided and encouraged to allow you to voice your opinions and suggesti ons. You may also make individu al appointments with the faculty to share your views. Ample opportunities are available throughout each semester for you to provide formal written feedb ack. Remember, faculty members n eed to hear compliments as well as constructive criticisms, and both are welcome. MANAGE YOUR STRESS Professional PT education is int ense and requires long hours an d hard work. A little stress can be helpful in motivating you to work hard and stay involved and allow you to get the most out of your education. But you will need to be atten tive to becoming over-stressed. To help prevent excess stress, you will want to Keep up with your studies Not only will you be better prepared for exams if you keep up w ith your work, your stress level may be lower throughout the sem ester allowing you to study more efficiently. Especially during the first part of each semester , when you are getting used to t he work load, budget your time for studying so that you will not be caught short in the end. Impor tantly, keep up with all classes simultaneously. Letting your studies lag behind may lead to \"c ramming\", insufficient learning, 77 and poor performance. Be proactive Keep a calendar and plan your sem ester in advance so you can an ticipate times when the work load is heavier and when it is lighter. When you anticipate a problem or when problems occur, communica te with faculty proactively and seek help (advice, tutoring etc.) as you need it. Don't let things snowball. Keep and use your sense of humor! It is important each day to enjoy some time engaged in light ac tivities or discussion. Humor will not only brighten other people' s days, it will contribute to yo ur health and sense of balance in your life. Stay healthy To be efficient with your studying and to allow you to enjoy li fe outside of school it is important, even when you are feeling pressed for time, to exercise regularly eat a nutritious diet get adequate sleep keep in touch with your friends and family avoid over-scheduling your life avoid excessive use of alcohol and all drugs (this includes reg ular use or binging) allow some time out for relaxation and recreation. You will be better prepared to perform, your life will feel mor e balanced, and you will be building habits that will make y ou a good role model for your p atients. Seek help when you need it If you find yourself being overwhelmed with the demands of the program or your living environment, seek help from others- your friends or classmates, your faculty, or the Student Counseling Services. Your mental and physical health are both v ery important. Keeping yourself healthy is necessary to treat your patients effectively and saf ely. Talk with classmates if their stress appears to be excessive, o r if it has a halo effect on you or other classmates. DEMONSTRATE PROFESSIONAL CLINIC BEHAVIOR Refer to the Clinical Education Program description. 78 ABIDE BY THE POLICIES INCLUDED IN THIS STUDENT MANUAL POLICIES AN D PROCEDURES Promotion, Due Process, and Academic Honesty It is essential that every student in the Program in Physical T herapy understand the processes by which grades are given and the mechanis ms which guide promotion and g raduation decisions. It is also important that students understa nd their right to appeal any de cision and the steps necessary to accomplish appeal. This section of the student handbook discus ses those areas of the Program policies and procedures. All of the following policies apply to all students for all cou rses in the professional physical therapy program at Washington University unless the course coordinator notes a different policy in the course syllabus. The student should refer to these policies and the co urse syllabi for all classes, assignments, and exams. Course Expectations Attendance and Participation : The goal of the physical therapy program is to graduate compe tent diagnosticians and highly skilled and safe practitioners of phy sical therapy. Therefore, students are expected to attend all classes, prepare for all classes and act ively participate in laboratory sessions and class discussions. Failure to do so may jeopardize your ability to reach this goal and be reason to lower a grade. Students are also expected to report all anticipated abs ences to the class coordinator in advance of the class and determine what i s necessary to make-up the class time missed. All students are responsible for obtaining class materials from another classmate, unless sp ecial arrangements ar e made in advance with the faculty member. Repeated unexcused absences may result in disciplinary action by the Committee on Academic and Profession al Evaluation of Students. Command of previous material: As this is a professional program, you are always responsible f or material covered in pre-requisite or previous PT courses. This includes basic scientific background, screening information, skills n eeded for patient assessment and treatment, and professional behavior. If you find you have deficiencies in these areas, you may consult the faculty for how to enhance your knowledge and skills. Minimal passing levels: Our commitment to high quality performance in our program and t o eventual competence in the clinic has resulted in our electing a general standard of acceptable performance of 70% or above in all academic work. In some courses, certain objecti ves must be met at higher levels than 70%. Faculty members are permitted to require additional conditions for successful completion of courses. Such additional conditions must be noted in the syllabi. The clinical education course cr iteria are set by the Clinical Education Team with consultation from other faculty. Criteria are listed in the course syllabi for these co urses. Failure to meet the minimal passing levels and course expectati ons will result in review at PT CAPES. 79 Grading Criteria A standard set of grading criteria is used for all PT courses. These criteria are based on a strict percentage system as follows. Normal rounding rules to one decimal place a pply and will be strictly applied in assigning grades (e.g. 89.4=B, 89.5=A) A 90-100% B 80-89% C 70-79% D 60-69% F <60% When students do not meet the st andards for each class, promoti on may not occur. At any time, if a student achieves a grade low er than the acceptable standard it is the student's responsibility to contact the course coordinator within one week to discuss actio ns or required grade remedies. Failure to contact the instructor will be considered unprofessi onal behavior by the PT CAPES. Written Exams & Practical Exams In taking all written and practi cal exams, students have the re sponsibility for preven ting and reporting all occurrences of dishonesty. All exam s must be completed independ ently by each student. To prevent dishonesty all students must prot ect the privacy of their own a nd other students' exams and papers. During and after any written exam there will be no discussion a bout the exam in the presence or hearing of anyone who has not completed it, whether you are on or off the premises. During and after practical exams, there will be no discussion a bout the practical exam with any student, whether or not they have taken the exam. This includes discussion during the return of graded exams. The reason for this strict rule is that if a student has not p assed a practical exam, a different case will be used on the make-up exam. Discussion amo ng students may unwittingly expose students to cases they may encounter on a future exam. Fair re- examination can only be offered when students have not been privy to prior discussion about the case . All students and faculty are responsible for reporting violatio ns or the appearance of violations of these rules to the course coordinator or another faculty member. In a ccordance with program policies on due process, any student found to hav e violated the rules will be p enalized. All students must pass all practical exams, with passing being set by the course coordinator and minimally at a 70% level. (Passi ng level expectations that are higher than 70% must be printed in the syllabus.) Additionally, students must pass 70% of the prac tical exams taken in any given school year on the first attempt. Test or Assignment Failure You should become familiar with each course syllabus to determi ne the specific remedial procedure if a failing grade occurs within a course. Rounding rules to one decimal poin t are applied to determine all grades. Students accept the responsibility in the Program f or initiating contact with the faculty member to discuss any grade belo w 70% received on any exam or a ssignment. Students must approach the unit instructor or course coordinator to discuss o r appeal a grade on a test or assignment within one week (5 working days) after the grade is posted.* You will find that the faculty 80 will work cooperatively with you for you to achieve the appropr iate level of learning. Remember that the appeal process may not always r esult in a grade change but shou ld, more importantly, result in a better understanding of the nature of the error(s). *During an appeal of any grade, please treat the faculty and st aff respectfully. Argumentative behavior is considered unprofessional. Depending on the course requirements instructors may elect to r e-test you on a written exam, or have you repeat an assignment, or they may choose some other method for remedy. It is also the instructor's prerogative to deny a make-up test or repeating the assignment. Students will not be permitted to remedy passing grades on tests and assignments for the purpose of impr oving their grades. If a student receives a failing grade on the first attempt of a practical exam, the student must contact the course coordinator to determine the next step. Only one retake is permitted for any one practical exam for each student. Remedial work may b e recommended before a retake is offered. If a student passes the retake exam, he or she will be g iven a grade of 70% (or other s tated minimum passing grade) for that exam no matter what the retake score is. If a student fails the retake practical exam, the student is referred to PT CAPES. Scantron Policies Exams or assignments that require the use of a Scantron answer sheet must be accurately marked by the student. It is a Program policy that Scantron sheets marked in error will not be corrected retrospectively unless agreed on by the course coordinator in advance of exams. Before turning in your exams, please check that all needed informati on and answers have been marked accurately. Sign both the answer sheet and the exam and turn both in to the faculty member. It is the responsibility of the i nstructors and the course coor dinator to make sure the lengths of the exams are appropriate for the time it takes to complete them. If this responsibility is not met, the instructor may make exceptions to the above policies. Though Scantron grading can mechanically be done quickly, there are several steps involved in scheduling the Scantron service a nd in reviewing the analysis o f the results. To ensure that grading is done accurately and fairly, students should allow up to one wee k after a test is taken for scores to be posted. On occasion, when a faculty member sees that it may benefit stu dents to see their preliminary grades (first run grades that hav e not been adjusted for errors or reconsideration) they may be distributed to students. Preliminary grades will be replaced by final grades, which may be higher or lower than the first run grade . Students should be aware that due to its programming peculiarit ies, the cumulative grade that is listed on individual Scantron test reports may not be accurate until all grades for a course have been submitted. (Scantron does not accurately weight the scores until all score s have been entered.) To avoid any surprises, students must monitor their own grades in the course to be informed of their status. Test Return and Review The primary means for receiving test scores is via mailboxes pr ior to the review of the exam. Faculty will make every effort to get tests gr ades to students within one we ek after the test is taken. This allows due consideration to all students' ans wers to tests and is usually a reasonable time limit for faculty to complete the work involved in gr ading tests. Extenuating circum stances, or excessive time needed to 81 hand-grade tests may increase the time it takes to get grades b ack to students beyond one week. In these circumstances, faculty should ann ounce to students the plan for returning tests scores. Policies for student review of graded tests (i.e. after the tes ts are given and before finals) are at the discretion of the course coordina tors. There is some variation among faculty members and course policies should be stated in the course syllabi. If specific policies ar e not stated in the course syllabus, students should expect to have access to t heir exams once they are grade d, on a one time only basis soon after grades are posted. Faculty and students must work together to e stablish mutually agreeable times when students can review their graded tests. It is the student's res ponsibility to approach the course coordinator if he or she is unable to atte nd when the tests are returned. M any faculty members will meet by appointment with students individually to discuss exams. When students do have the opport unity to review an exam it is e xpected they will not reproduce the exam in any manner including \"Xeroxing\" or copying by hand any part of the exam. Errors in grading should be brought to the attention of the course master. Students must not alter their scores on the exams, practical exams, or Scantron forms. Any student caught reproduc ing any part of an exam or discussing the exam with others who have not yet completed the exam will be re ferred to PT CAPES for faculty discussion of their academic misconduct. Assignments Students are expected to follow the directions on all assignmen ts. Assignments may be intended as either individual or group work. If an assignment is to be done by an individual student, it is expected that all students will produce original work independently. If an assign ment is to be completed in groups, all students in the group are expected to participate equally and t he work must be comple ted by the members of that group only. Students ma y not use papers written by prev ious students to prepare their own papers. Students must turn in papers when and where they are due. For l ate papers, faculty members may deduct points or refuse to accept the paper from the student. Each stu dent has the responsibility for reporting to the faculty member any actions in violations of the above polic ies. If the expectations for individual or group work are violated, the actions of the student(s) will be reported to PT CAPES for consideration of academic misconduct. Students who are uncertain as to what constitutes academic dishonesty, i ncluding plagiarism, are refe rred to the Washington University website under academic policies http://www.wustl.edu/policies/students.html . The Writing Center on the Danforth campus is open to help PT students with their writing and citation style. Course Failure Any student failing a course will be referred to PT CAPES for i ts decision on whether opportunities to remedy the grade will be offered and if the student will be per mitted to remain in the program. If allowed a remedy, the course master will design what needs to be done a nd in what time frame. Remedies may delay clinical experiences. . Options for remedy may include ma ke-up tests, additional papers or assignments, repeating individual units during the next school year or repeating the entire course. Students having to repeat a course will incur additional tuitio n costs at the usual rate per credit and typically extend the length of the program by one year. The nec essary sequencing of courses in the curriculum may have an impact on registration for courses in fo llowing semesters and participation in clinical education. The decision for remedy will be made by the Committee on Academic Performance Evaluation of Students (PT CAPES) in consultation with the facu lty member responsible for the course. 82 Students fail a course if a grade of D or F is received. In tha t case, the student's transcript will be handled as follows: 1. At the end of the semester, t he grade earned will be posted on the transcript. It will remain there until the course is successfully completed. 2. If the course is retaken at the Program, the second grade wi ll be posted in the semester in which it was earned and the ear lier failing grade will be repla ced with the grade of \"R\". This grade indicates the course has been retaken and the first course is neither computed in GPA nor does it carry any credit. Appealing course grades Complementing the policies of PT CAPES, the Program has an appe al process for course grades. To appeal a course grade, students must contact the course master in writing, within 5 working days of the posting of grades to inform that faculty member about the reque st for appeal. The course master will discuss failing scores with the appropriate individual instruct ors within the course (e.g. to evaluate the student's test or evaluation for miscalculation or other such t echnical problem). All attempts for the course master and student to agree on the grade should be made. After receiving the final decision of the course master, if the student is not satisfied with the decision, the student may then appeal the decision in writing within 5 working days to the Associate Director for Professiona l Curriculum. In appealing the course master's decisions to the Associate Director for Professional C urriculum, the student must also submit the original written appeal of the grade, which was written to the course coordinator. The Associate Director will discuss the situation with t he student and course coordina tor as needed and mak e a decision. If the student does not agree with the decision of the Associate Direc tor, the appeal may be taken to the Director, again in writing, within 5 working days. The final de cision for a course grade rests with the Director. Faculty members or their designees must respond to th e student under the same time frames. If the appeal process is not initiated within the time frames s pecified, grades are no longer subject to change. Exam Policies: Arriving late to an exam is not consistent with professional be havior and disrupts the faculty member and all students. The following polic ies are in place to provide a professional environment. Arriving Late to Exams: Students must arrive on time to all written exams or quizzes. L ate arrival is defined as immediately after the posted start time. Failure to arrive on time will result in a deduction from the exam grade of 5% for each 10 minute increment of lateness. A student arriving late to a practical e xam where a lab assistant serves as the \"patient\" or subject will be allowe d to begin the exam, but wil l not be given more time than remains for the test. Late arrivals will also result in a deduction from th e exam grade of 5%for each 10 minute increment of lateness, as monito red by the manager of the pract ical exam. A student who arrives late to a practical exam where another st udent serves as the \"patient\" or subject will have 5% deducted from his or her exam grade for each 5 minute i ncrement of lateness. When the student 83 arrives the partner will be allo wed to start first and be given the full amount of the test interval. The late student will have the remaining time to complete his or her exa m. Missed Exams A student who misses an exam due to a valid and excusable reaso n, as determined by the course master (e.g. illness, family emergency) mu st call in to the Program at 314-286-1400 prior to the test time and leave a message and a phone num ber where he or she can be reach ed. It is the responsibility of the student to contact the course master in a timely manner to schedule a d ate and time for the make-up exam. If the course master observes re peated lateness on the part of a student, she or he will bring the issue of unprofessional behavior to the a ttention of PT-CAPES for action 84 Washington University Program in Physical Therapy Practical Exam Grading Scale Number of Points Criteria for Rating 4 Independent, accurate and comp lete performance of item 3.5 Item completed by trial and error ; finds and correc ts own errors independently; no deficiencies noted OR Item completed with 1 minor deficiency 3 Item completed with no more than 2 minor deficiencies OR Item completed by trial and error and 1 minor deficiency 1 Item completed with no more than 3 minor deficiencies OR Item completed by trial and error and 2 minor deficiencies 0 Item not performed at all OR Incomplete and/or inaccurate performance of an item; shows 1 or more major deficiency or deletion of elements of item Definitions: 1.

Major deficiencies or deletio ns include parts of the item wh ich are inaccurate or performed in a manner that would be unsafe or cause inaccurate results. (E.g. Incorrect dosage parameters, doing the wrong test or move ments in the wrong direction) ** If a student starts to perform the wrong test or treatment, the tester will stop them and tell them the wrong test or treatment is being perfo rmed. Students wi ll again be to ld the name of the test o r treatment that is to be performed. If students then pro ceed to perform the correct t est or treatment, one point will be subtracted from the final score of the practical. This cue and opportunity for self -correction will only be all owed once in a test. All subsequent instances of p erforming the wrong test or treat ment will be considered major errors. If the student gets a ze ro after being cued, the one po int penalty will not be subtracted. 3. Trial and Error: any major e rror or several minor errors tha t the student self-corrects immediately; or the overall performance of a skill s howing marked hesitation and/or indecisiveness in excess of the expectations for normal problem solving. 4. Treating the wrong extremity at any time during the test wil l result in subtraction of one point from the total test score. When a test includes separate sections requiring re ading of instructions directing attention to specific different body areas , treating the wrong area will res ult in subtraction of one point from the score for each section. 2002 (current as of 2017) 85 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PROGRAM IN PHYSICAL THERAPY COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL EVALUATION OF STUDENTS (PT CAPES) I. PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY By conferring the professional Do ctorate in Physical Therapy (D PT) degree upon a student, Washington University cer tifies the student as compete nt to undertake a career as a physical therapist. The Unive rsity assesses this competency b ased on each student's technical knowledge and skills, a s well as the student's qualit ies of personality pertinent to an effective professional lif e, such as compassion, commitme nt, and integrity. The Committee on Academic and Professi onal Evaluation of Students ( hereinafter is c oncerned with students' growth a nd health in the professional preparation proce ss. Each student is responsible f or his or her successful completion of the curriculum, a nd the PT CAPES is intended to h elp all students proceed through the curriculum smoothly a nd effectively. Its major act ions are to issue commendations for exceptional perf ormance, to make recommendati ons for additional resources needed for students to succeed, and to prescribe reme dies for academic deficiencies and professional misconduct, up to and including s tudent dismissals and recommendations for suspensions and expulsions. The rigor of the admissions pro cess attempts to ensure that stu dents have the best preparation to achieve success in the DPT curriculum of the Pro gram in Physical Therapy (hereinafter \"Program\" or \"Progr am in PT\"). Subsequently, appro priate efforts are made to retain students to whom this commitment of admission is made . Action to dismiss or expel a student from the Progr am in Physical Therapy will be th e result of a systematic determination that the student i s unable to complete the requir ements of the Program successfully based on that student' s behavior and/or academic, clinical and professional performance. The purpose of the PT CAPES is to provide fair and prompt revie w of student matters. The Committee is not positioned in an adversarial role against students, but serves to review the evidence as present ed and determine its decision reg arding appropr iate action. II. GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES A. Committee Membership . PT CAPES is co-chaired by a PT faculty member appointed by the Director of the Program in Physical Therapy (\" PT Co-Chair\") and a non-voting representative of the medical school faculty appoint ed by the Dean of the School of Medicine. The Director of the Program may attend the meetings as a non- voting member. The remainder of the Committee is comprised of m embers of the Physical Therapy instructional faculty, as selected by the Dire ctor of the Program. Committee membership must numbe r at least seven individuals but no more than fifty 86 percent (50%) of the total numbe r of Program instructional facu lty. PT CAPES membership and meeting attendance records shall be maintained b y the Program's student affairs staff. A list of committee members shall be av ailable at any time upon request to the Director of the Program. Each member of the Committee (with the exception of the non-vot ing representative of the medical school faculty a nd the Director of the Program) shall have one vote. The PT Co-Chair votes only if th ere is a tie among members pres ent. The Director of Student Health, the Director of the Student Counseling Services and other individuals who have contact with the student s may be asked to serve as con sultants or advisors on educationally relevant topics to the Committee. Appropriate student confidentiality will be maintained. When there h as been a change in Committee membership, the PT Co-Chair will have the discre tion to convene a previous members hip of the Committee, if practical, to c onsider ongoing matters heard by t hat previous membership, or to assign further review of such matters to the Committee as currently constituted. B. Meeting Schedule & Procedures . The Committee holds r egular meetings twice each semester to review each student's performance and accompli shments in the curriculum. Regular meetings of t he Committee occur each semest er at midterm and after final examinations for rev iew of each student's performan ce. Notices will be posted informing students when regular meetings will occur. In addition, a member of the Committee may request a meeting at any time when a particul ar student is performing unsatisfactorily or exhibiting unprofessional conduc t. Committee meetings are conducted in accord ance with Robert's Rules of Ord er. Specifically, a quorum is designated as one half ( 1/2) of the membership. A si mple majority vote of the members present shall be r equired for all decisions, except decisions to dismiss a student for academic deficienci es and decisions to recommend th at a student be suspended or expelled for profe ssional misconduct, which requir e a three-quarters (3/4) majority vote of the members present. C. Student Notification & Participation . Any student at risk for immediate, serious, adverse action will receive prom pt individual and written notic e of the date of any Committee meeting at which his/he r performance or professional conduct will be reviewed and the concerns of his/ her case that will be consider ed. Students who receive individual not ice that they are to be cons idered at a PT CAPES meeting may opt to: 1) write a let ter to present to PT CAPES at the meeting, or 2) present themselves in person during the appropriate time they a re to be discussed, or 3) present in writi ng and also present in person, or 4) choose none of these options. If the student wishes to be pr esent in person and cannot be ava ilable, the Committee 87 may either postpone the meeting or conduct the meeting and take action without the student present. Failure of a student to provide reasonable co operation to the PT CAPES, including but not limited t o failure to participate at a scheduled time or failure to provide information re quested by the PT CAPES, may b e considered a separate instance of professi onal misconduct, in addition to th e underlying issues giving rise to the meeting. Meeti ngs may be rescheduled at the discretion of the PT Co- Chair. A student who receives individual notice that he or she is to b e considered at a PT CAPES meeting shall be permitted, upon request to the PT Co-Cha ir in advance of the PT CAPES meeting, to appear b efore the PT CAPES on his or h er own behalf. At the student's request, he or she also may be accompanied at the meeting by one person of the student's choosi ng for guidance and support, alth ough such person will not be permitted to advocate on behalf of the student or otherw ise actively participate in the meeting. The student's c omments should be limited to no more than 10 minutes. PT CAPES members are permitted to ask questions about the student's written or in-person comments to the Committee. III. TYPES OF STUDENT ISSUES A ND ASSOCIATED COMMITTEE ACTION Student conduct evaluated by the Committee falls within two cat egories: (A) Academic Performance and (B) Academic and Professional Misconduct. Each of these two categories has its own procedures , described below. Student con duct will be evaluated in the context of this Policy a nd any other potentially applicable University disciplinary and academic policies (e.g., the Unive rsity Student Conduct Code). A. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE Academic course work for DPT st udents includes didactic and cli nical education courses. Students are expected to achieve grade averages of 70 % or greater for all courses and for all examinati ons (written and lab oratory practi cal) which must be passed to pass a course. Certain courses require higher perfor mance standards, as stated in course syllabi. St udents must maintain a 2.0 or above cumulative grade point average and achieve a 2.0 or better in each semester. Students who do not achieve this standard are consid ered to have course grade avera ge problems. All course averages for this purpos e are computed using standard ro unding rules to one decimal place. In order to pass a course, Stude nts must pass all practical exa ms with no more than one retake per exam. Also, S tudents must pass at least 70% of all practical exams on the first try in any given academic year, or will be c onsidered for dismissal. All clinical educa tion courses must be passed before the student can proceed in the curriculum, alt hough CAPES may offer a remedy fo r failure of a single clinical course which all ows a student to continue with his or her coursework. 88 1. Possible Actions for Academic Deficiencies In the event that a student's a cademic performance does not mee t the academic expectations delineated above, he or she will be refer red to PT CAPES for academic review. Any C ommittee decision to take acti on regarding the academic deficiencies of a student will be commun icated in writing to the student within thr ee (3) working days after the Committee meeting. Remedies such as examination or practical examination retake may not be initiated until the stud ent has received this writte n notice. The following actions may be taken by the PT CAPES: a. Mid-Term Warning A student will be given a writt en warning following the midterm Committee meeting if he/she has co urse grade average problems i n one or more courses. The warning advises the student that he/she is in danger of failing one or more courses and is, therefore, at risk for addi tional action (e.g., probation) after the end-of-s emester meeting. Specific s uggestions for support services and/or remedial activity may be offered in conjunction with the warning to assist the student in correcting deficienci es. Students are expected to take initiativ e in using support services/resou rces and in seeking solutions to id entified deficiencies. b. Probation A student may be placed on probatio n at the end of a semester i f he/she has course grade average defici encies in one or more courses. Students placed on probation will be informed of the specific r emedial action that must be taken to rem ove the probationary status. Ex amples of remedial action include successf ully repeating an examination, a clinical experience, a unit, a course, or an entire semester or year. With the failure of one clinical experience, students may be of fered a remedy and be permitted to repeat the course. If the student fa ils a clinical experience and is permitted to c ontinue in the Program, that s tudent will be automatically placed on probation without waiting until the end of the following semester. Students placed on probation may be asked to resign from holdin g a class office position. 89 c. Dismissal PT CAPES decides whether to dismiss students for academic defic iencies based on the totality of the stude nt's academic performance. S ome examples of circumstances whic h may result in dismissal are: (i) Students who have failed one course in a semester may or may not be offered an opportunity for remedy by PT CAPES. Students may be dism issed from the Program in the event that one course has been failed and PT CAPES does not choose to offer a remedy; (ii) PT CAPES may treat a student 's failure of more than one course in a semester as indepe ndently sufficient grounds for dismissal; (iii) PT CAPES may treat a student's status of being on probation for two or more semesters as independently sufficient grounds for dismissal; and (iv) When a student has been o ffered an opportunity to remedy a course failure and that st udent fails to successfully remedy his/her academic deficiencies in the time frame established by the Committee, he or she may be dismissed from the Program even if cumulative course averages meet Program standards. B. MISCONDUCT In addition to the academic expect ations, DPT students are expe cted to comply with the University' s conduct standards. 1. Student misconduct is governed by the University Student Conduc t Code. Allegations of student misconduct which may constitute an offen se under the University Student Conduct Code will be handled in accordance w ith the provisions of that Code. The Uni versity's Director of the Offi ce of Student Conduct and Community Standards r eceives and investigates alleg ed violations of most forms of m isconduct under the Code, with Aca demic and Professional Misconduct being a noteable exception, as describe d in Section 2, below. See University Student Conduct Code (http://www.wustl.edu/policies/judicial.html ) for a full discussion of the University Student Conduct Code. 90 2. ACADEMIC & PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT. Academic and Professional Misconduct are spec ial forms of misconduct under t he University Student Conduct Code. Often, A cademic and Professional conduct expectations under the Universit y Student Conduct Code also are required to be met in individual programs a nd courses, as noted in the cour se objectives. Accordingly, the University St udent Conduct Code provides that PT CAPES may hear and decide cases of alleged Academic and Professional Misconduct. PT CAPES shall handle such alleg ations using the following proc edures: a. Definition. Academic or Profe ssional misconduct shall inclu de, but is not limited to: breaches of personal confidence and trust, includi ng cheating, unauthorized use of materials dur ing examinations, or other aca demic misconduct; abuse, misrepresentations or other seriously improp er conduct in relation to patients or coll eagues including breaches of confid entiality; illegality; substance abuse; failure of j udgment including that related to non- compliance in the treatment of any personal medical condition; other misconduct in violation of Unive rsity policy or the University Student Conduct Code; and misrepresenta tion or failure in personal acti ons or in meeting obligations, so as to r aise serious unresolved doubts a bout the integrity of the student. b. Procedures for Review i. Matters involving possible bre aches of the University Studen t Conduct Code by DPT students sh all be brought to the attention of the PT Co-Chair. The individua l(s) raising the questions of possible misconduct shall presen t them to the PT Co-Chair in writing, and provide other deta iled written information as necessary. Individuals submitting information are reminded of the need for confidentiality regar ding all matters of misconduct. ii. The PT Co-Chair shall determ ine, in consultation with the c o-chair of PT CAPES, whether the a lleged conduct, if true, could constitute misconduct under the University Student Conduct Code . eIf the PT Co-Chair determines that the alleged misconduct coul d constitute Academic or Professional Misconduct, then PT CAPES may retain jurisdiction to consid er the alleged misconduct purs uant to the procedures described in t his Section III.B.2.b. The PT C o- Chair also has the dis cretion to refer the matter to the Univer sity's Office of Student Conduct and Co mmunity Standards or other applicable University office , based upon the nature of the allegation. For example, a compl aint alleging th at a student h as committed a sexual assault would be handled by the Title IX Office. 91 iii. If the PT Co-Chair deems it appropriate upon review of the alleged Academic or Professional mis conduct, he/she will convene a meeting of the PT CAPES. The s tudent shall be notified of this meeting pursuant to Section II of this Policy. The PT CAPES shall, whenever possible, conve ne within two weeks after the initial meeting between the st udent and the PT Co-Chair (or designee). Should a student be ref erred to the PT CAPES for an issue(s) involving both academic performance and academic or professional misconduct, the proced ures regarding academic or professional misconduct will be followed. iv. The Committee is not positioned in an adversarial role agai nst the student, but serves to review th e evidence as presented and determine its decision regardi ng disciplinary action if necessa ry. The PT CAPES will consider evi dence which tends to prove or disprove the alleged conduct. If the PT CAPES finds that the student engaged in misconduct, it may consider additional evidence of prior conduct, eviden ce as to the charged student's character, the student's academ ic record, or any other evidence which could assist the PT CAPES in determining an appropriate sanction. The PT Co-Chair will ru le on whether or not specific evidence or testimony will be considered. The PT CAPES has neither the advantages nor limita tions inherent in a court of l aw. During the meeting the student will have access to the evidence presented and may present evid ence on his or her behalf, subjec t to reasonable limitations as to a mount, scope, and format, as determined by the PT Co-Chair. v. The decision as to whether the student committed the alleged misconduct will be made solely on the basis of evidence and testimony presented at the meeti ng. Innocence of the student wi ll be presumed. A PT CAPES member must find in favor of the student unless the member is pe rsuaded that it is more likely t han not that the student engage d in the misconduct alleged. vi. If the person who has submitted the charges of misconduct i s a member of the PT CAPES, that member will provide information about the professionalism issue to the PT CAPES, but will then recuse him/herself from deliberation and voting. vii. The written record of suc h proceedings will be held confid entially with access restricted to Committee members, the student involved, and members of the P rogram or WU Administration involved in the proceedings. viii. Unless it is determined by the PT Co-Chair that extraordi nary circumstances exist, the student will be permitted during the P T 92 CAPES proceedings to attend clas s (but not clinical activities) so long as the student does not pose a threat to himself/herself o r others. c. Possible Sanctions for Academic or Professional Misconduct Any Committee decision to sanction a student should be communic ated in writing to the student within thr ee (3) working days after the Committee meeting. i. Warning or Probation A student shall be given a warning and may be placed on probati on by the Committee upon a finding that he/she has engaged in academic or professional misconduct. The Committee may also require some form of remedy and e vidence of readiness to functi on in a professional manner to remove a probationary status, consistent with the options for s anctions in the University Stu dent Conduct Code. Students placed on probation may be asked to resign from holding a class office position. ii. Recommendation of Suspension or Expulsion In cases where a student has e xhibited significant or repeated academic or professional misconduct, the Committee may make a recommendation that the Dean of t he School of Medicine suspend or expel the student. The Dean ha s thirty (30) days from the d ate of receiving such a recommenda tion from PT CAPES to decide whether to suspend or expel the student. The Dean's decision should be communicated in wri ting to the student and to PT CAPES within three (3) working da ys after the decision is made. IV. REQUEST FOR RECONS IDERATION BY PT CAPES A student may request that PT C APES reconsider its decision to take adverse action against that student. Such a re quest may be made for actions c oncerning the student's Academic Performance and/or Academic or Professional Misconduct . Note: actions taken by entities other than the Committee (e.g., the Dean or t he University Judicial Board) are not subject to reque sts for reconsideration under th is Section IV. Within three days of the date on w hich a student receives an ad verse decision from PT CAPES, the student may notify the Director of his/her intent to request reconsideration of that decision by the PT CAPES. A written request and rationale for reconsideration must be received by the Director of the Program within ten (10) cale ndar days of the date the Director receives the student's initial notice of intent to req uest reconsideration. Such a request for reconsideration s hould be based solely on (a) the n eed for PT CAPES to consider additional information which was not previously presen ted; and/or (b) a contention that pertinent PT CAP ES procedures were not followed during the original proceeding. 93 The decision to grant a Request f or Reconsideration is within t he sole discretion of the Director. If the Director decide s to have PT CAPES reconsider i ts decision, the Director shall notify the student in writing of the decision to reconsid er and shall advise PT CAPES to reconvene within thirty ( 30) days of receipt of the wr itten request to reconsider. During the reconsider ation process, the student wil l be permitted to attend class (but not clinical activit ies) so long as the student does not pose a threat to himself/herself or others. The Committee may reverse, modify or affirm its original decision based upon its reconsidera tion and/or input from the s tudent or others. V. APPEALS A. Appeal to the Dean of Decisions by PT CAPES 1. Appealable Decisions. Only one type of decision by PT CAPES is appealable to the Dean of WUSM. A student may appeal to the Dean of the S chool of Medicine following a dismissal for academic performance deficie ncies. The decision of PT CAPES to impose a warning, probation, or any ac ademic action other than dismissal for academic performance deficiencies is f inal and not appealable. In addition, the deci sion of PT CAPES to impose an y sanction short of suspension or expulsion, whic h may only be imposed by the De an, is final and not appealable. If the PT CAPES recommends suspension or expul sion for academic or professional misconduct, and the Dean imposes a sus pension or expulsion, the student may submit an appeal as set forth below in Section V.B. 2. Appeal Procedures . Any such appeal from dismi ssal described in Section V.A.1, above, must be made in w riting to the Dea n within fourte en (14) calendar days after the stude nt receives the final written decision of P T CAPES (either the initial decision, or a decision denyi ng a timely request for re consideration, or a decision after reconsideration, if granted). Students are not r equired to request reconsideration by the Committee prior to appealing to the Dean ; however, if reconsideration is requeste d, appeal to the Dean should not be made until the Director has ruled on the r econsideration request. The appeal must be limited to th e grounds that a fair hearing w as not provided, or that the action taken was exces sive. Such written appeal must clearly state the grounds for the appeal and must i nclude all supporting informat ion which the student desires to be conside red as part of the appeal.

April 2017 95 Procedures for Reports of Academic Misconduct Maintaining academic integrity is a responsibility for all stud ents and faculty. Without it we fail to preserve the rights and safety of our patients and fellow profe ssionals, and we fail to meet the expectations of our profession. Offenses of academic integrity include any action that violates the Judicial Code of the university as reported in University Student Judicial Code , the document of policies and procedures at Washington University (http://www.wustl.edu/ policies/judicial.html#three). One offense of academic integrity is academic misconduct, defined in the Judicial Code : \"Academic misconduct, [includes, but is] not limited to, cheati ng, plagiarism, fabrication of data or records, unpermitted colla on assignments, misr epresentation of student status, and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 falsification. Knowingly making false allega tions of academic misconduct against any student will itself be considered a form of academic misconduct. \" Academic misconduct also violat es the APTA Code of Ethics. Belo w are guidelines for reporting incidents of academic misconduct. Students and faculty observin g other students engaging in activity that is academically dishonest share the responsibility that the inc ident is dealt with appropriately and in a timely fashion. I. Student observes academic misconduct A. If a student chooses to take action at the time of the occur rence (e.g. during a test) the student shall 1. inform the course coordinator about the observed behavior 2. document the observed behavior after the incident and give it to the course coordinator B. If a student chooses to take action after the time of the oc currence (e.g. after a test) the student shall 1. confront the other student using appropriate communication s kills to obtain that student's account of the incident 2. inform the alleged student t hat the incident will be reporte d to faculty because of University and Program policy 3. report the incident to the course coordinator or other facul ty member 4. document the incident in writing for faculty action (see bel ow for the guidelines faculty follow based on the willi ngness of students to document academic misconduct.) 96 II. Faculty member observes academic misconduct with or without stu dent corroboration: A. If a faculty member chooses to take action at the time of th e occurrence (e.g. during a test) he or she shall 1. inform the student about the observed behavior and then foll ow steps under II B. 2-4 B. If action is delayed until af ter the time of the occurrence (e.g. after a test) the faculty member shall 1. confront the student and obta in the student's account of the situation 2. report the incident to the Associate Director for Profession al Curriculum or the Director 3. Follow the policy of PT CAPES III. Faculty member receives a student's report of academic miscondu ct of another student but did not observe the incident directly A. Confront the student reported to be dishonest and share that a report was made to you; then obtain the student's account of the incident B. Ask students who report incidents to you to document their o bservations for PT CAPES and encourage them to confront their peers; inform them that wi thout their documentation of the incident you cannot take definitive action except to cou nsel the alleged student; only with their documentation can the matter be acted upon C. Assess the situation 1. If you agree that academic misconduct has occurred a. Document the incident and discussions with the student b. Report the incident and your proposed action to the Associat e Director for Professional Curriculum I. if you are comfortable with the action to take, proceed and then report what your actions were to the Director II. if you are uncertain about wha t actions to take, report the incident to the Director for a decision 2. If you cannot ascertain if acad emic misconduct has occurred and the reporting student is willing to document the incident a. report the incident to the Associate Director for Professio nal Curriculum or the Director 97 3. If you cannot ascertain if acad emic misconduct has occurred and the reporting student is unwilling to document the incident a. document the incident and submit the report to the Associate Director for Professional Curriculum who will then submit it to the Coordina tor of Admissions and Student Affairs for the student's record b. inform the reporting student that no further action can be t aken Students who report incidents of academic misconduct will be re ferred to anonymously at PT CAPES meetings, e.g. by referring to the m as \"student A\" or student \" B\" etc. Students whom the faculty member believes have been academically d ishonest, or students about wh om fellow students are willing to submit documentation, will be referred to without a name during the in itial discussion of the incident. PT CAPES will be informed of the student's name after agreement has been reached on the actions to take. Policy on Recording Classes To accommodate student absences and for students who would like to review past lectures, all lectures will be recorded and made availabl e for all students. All reco rdings are copyrighted and considered property of the Program. Student s should not share them with o thers nor copy them in any manner. Please note that despite recordings being made available to stu dents, the faculty still expects student attendance in class except in t he case of illness or an excused absence (family emerg ency, critical illness in the family, funerals for immediate family, required court ap pointments, and medical appointments that cannot be scheduled except during class time). Policy on Personal Taping Students may use personal equipm ent to audiotape or videotape a ny lecture only if advanced permission is obtained directly from the lecturer in advance of the lectur e. Copyright Law and the Classroom The Program follows copyright l aw. All members (faculty, staff, and students) of the Program in Physical Therapy are expected to comply with copyright law. Copyright l aw provides the legal right to authors of original works to protect the authors' rights to obtain commerc ial benefit and to control how the work is used. How are Program members expected to comply with Copyright Law? Faculty, staff and students are prohibited from providing multiple classroom copies of the foll owing items unless the publisher of such material has given explicit permission for classroom distributi on: published articles or portions of books figures, tables, text etc. that were obtained from copyrighted material copies of power point presentations that contain copyrighted ma terial Faculty, staff and students are allowed to print out or photoco py one copy of an article for their personal use. No copyrighted material may be posted on course or Program web sites unless explicit permission from the publisher has been obtained. At times faculty members may h ave the library post material on e- reserve. 98 All course materials created by f aculty, adjunct faculty, and s tudents are protected by copyright law. All material distributed in print, via electronic media, or on the Internet by the Program in Physical Therapy is considered copyrighted material. Students are prohib ited from copying materials for distribution without express permission of the author (e.g. pro fessor) and giving credit to the originator of the material. Students may not sell any material or use it for commercial interests. There are significant costs in obtaining copyright permission. Faculty will limit this at times to avoid passing on costs to students thr ough fees or tuition increase. For specific details of copyright law and Washington University policy please refer to the following website: http://www.wustl.edu/copyright/ . Student Authorship Occasionally students will have t he opportunity to co-author a poster presentation, oral presentation, or manuscript with faculty members. Students must seek counsel fr om the faculty regarding who is included as an author and in what order authors are listed. The univers ity has careful guidelines on this practice, as do certain journals. Students will not be considered sole auth ors of any project done during their studies here. Policy and Procedure on Supporting DPT Students for Scientific Presentations 1. Faculty members shall notify the Director and the Division D irector of Education at the time of submission of the abstract and when they have received notice o f acceptance. Faculty member will then be notified is funding is available. 2. A faculty member's name and Washington University Program in PT must be on the poster; if the presentation is a report on the student's own work, the studen t's name should be listed first. 3. We highly encourage students to attend and present at the Mi ssouri Physical Therapy Association state conference. 4. We do not encourage students to miss class or clinical exper ience time to present posters or presentations, but will consider this an excused absence in th e case of CSM or annual conference. Students completing their clinical experiences mus t get permission to take time off from their clinical instructors. 5. The Program will pay for the pr eparation of the poster, regi stration required of presenters at the APTA student member rate, and one night's hotel stay. Any addi tional funds must be negotiated and are not guaranteed. 6. If the work is a result of a fifth semester course and is su bmitted in time for the first possible opportunity to present at CSM or annual conference following t he student's graduation from the Program (e.g. 2017 graduate p resenting at 2018 CSM or June 201 8 conference) the same level of funding will be offered to the recent graduate. 7. Students will be encouraged t o present their posters or othe r presentations to faculty for practice. 8. When grant funds are availabl e, investigators are free to ha ndle funding for student presentations as they wish within the constrain ts of the funding agency's pol icies. 9. PhD students are not eligib le for funding under this policy. 99 Policy on the use of the Washing ton University logo or Program in Physical Therapy name The University has very strict rules on the use of its logo on anything (clothing, stationery, signs, etc.). Please contact Sarah Rands to confirm whether your intention to use the University logo is acceptable. Use of the Program in Physical Therapy name must meet acceptabl e standards of decorum. For example, some classes or teams have creat ed their own t-shirts for speci al events or intramurals. Phrases, wording or drawings must be professional and inoffensive. Please note: The Program in Physical Therapy does not support activities where excessive drinking or risky behavior i s encouraged. If such events are scheduled (e.g. pub crawl), students may not place the University Program in Physical Therapy name on the t-shirt.

Open Lab Policies Purpose Open Lab is designed to give students the opportunity to practi ce manual skills independently and ask general questions in an informa l, student supervised setting. T he faculty will identify and invite students from the second and third year classes to be Student Open Lab F acilitators. Recent graduates may also 103 serve as facilitators. The role of the Student Open Lab Facilitator is to provide feed back on manual skills practiced. Open Lab is a practice session, not a study session; lecturing is not pr ovided. Open Lab is not intended for use as a time for re-teaching material a lready presented to students. Students are strongly encouraged to use their classroom lab tim e wisely and effectively. Students with specific questions are encouraged to make appointments with uni t instructors instead of relying on the Student Open Lab Facilitators. Students are reminded that they can also request a student tutor to assist in their understanding of course cont ent and development of skill if they are in need of more than what Open Lab can offer. Policies Washington University Program in Physical Therapy's goal for Op en Lab is to provide one Student Open Lab Facilitator for every 15 st udents attending (1:15 ratio). Open Lab will be staffed by qualified second and third year students and recent graduates. Open Lab will be held in a Progr am classroom. It is the respon sibility of the Open Lab Facilitators to appropriately staff Open Lab according to the number of student s who indicate interest by signing up on a weekly basis. Procedures In order to appropriately staff Open Lab, students are strongly encouraged to sign up for all sessions they desire to attend. Weekly sign up sheets will be posted on the student bulletin boards at the beginning of each semester. These sign up sheets will indicate the day and t ime of Open Lab. All students who desire to participate in Open Lab must sign their name on the sign up sheet. All students must sign an attendance sheet at the Open Lab sess ion. The attendance sheet must be returned to the Open Lab Fac ilitators, who will ensure these at tendance sheets are delivered to the Faculty-Advisor. Students may attend Open Lab if they neglecte d to sign up. However, the Open Lab staff are instructed to give pri ority to students who signed up in advance. Open Lab will be held on a weekly basis for 1 st year students. The Open Lab schedule varies according to the practical exam schedule for 2nd year students. Each session will last for a maximum of 2 hours . Even if no students sign up for Open Lab, there will be one Student Open Lab Facilitator present for the first 30 minutes of each Open Lab session. If no students arrive during this 30-minute time period, the Student Open Lab Facilitator shall leave. When students choose to sign up f or Open Lab, it is a commitmen t and their attendance is expected. Student Open Lab Facilitators are instructed that they are to l eave if no students arrive within 30 minutes of the Open Lab starting time, the 2-hour time session is over, or if remaining students do not wish to have further supervision. Similar to the semester class sch edule, the time and day of Ope n Lab has been established to best meet anticipated needs of all students during each semester and to m inimize conflicts with course and exam schedules. Frequent requests for changes in time or day are di scouraged. Exceptions are the decision of the Faculty Advisor and subject to staffing availability. 104 In addition to, or in substituti on for, the regularly scheduled Open Lab night, there may be specific evenings designated to specific skill practice as determined by the Faculty Advisor. As always, students are strongly encouraged to keep current on their practice of ma nual skills and avoid waiting until the \"last minute\" to practice. All questions and concerns regarding Open Lab policies or proce dures should be directed to the Faculty Advisor for Open Lab. Policy on Alcohol in the Program The Program adheres to the polic ies of the University on alcoho l and drugs. (see http://www.wustl.edu/policies/students.html). Alcohol may be brought into the Physical Therapy Program space for sanctioned social events (e.g. graduation celebrations, dissertation defense celebrations, fac ulty and student parties) providing no classes or other meetings are in session and permission has bee n given by the Director or any of the Associate Directors. At no time may individuals under the age o f 21 years consume alcohol on the premises or at outside eve nts hosted by the Program WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Policy for Students With Disabilities It is the goal of Washington University to assist students with disabilities in removing the barriers their disabilities may pose and provide support in facing the challen ge of pursuing an education at Washington University. Washington University recognizes and accepts its professional, legal and moral responsibility to avoid discrimination in the acceptance and education of qualified stu dents with disabilities and to provide reasonable accommodations to such students consistent with the principles embodied in the law. These guidelines apply to students seeking admittance as well as to t hose who become disabled while they are enrolled. Washington University makes every effort to insure that all qua lified applicants and students can participate in and take full advantage of all programs and opportunities of fered within the University. Washington University encourages and gives full consideration to all appli cants for admission. Washington University does not discriminate in access to its programs and activities on the basis of age, sex, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion, c olor, or national origin. All students in educational programs at the School of Medicine, those seeking admitta nce, as well as those who become disabled while they are enrolled, must possess those intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculu m and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty and the profession. In this regard, we will be guided by the principles outlined be low. A. Responsibilities of the Student 1. Disclosure of Disability 105 It is the responsibility of a student who has a disability to d isclose it and request accommodation from the Dean for Student Affairs or Program Dire ctor. The School encourages students with disab ilities to identify themselves as early as possible in order to optimize the mobilization of resources and available accommo dations. 2. Diagnosis of Disability Students who are in academic di fficulty that might be a consequ ence of a disability are encouraged to avail themselves of diagnostic services that may lead to accommodations. Furthermore, such students are en couraged to explore with the a dministration of their academic unit the possibility of a disability if the inquiry is relevant to educational performance and there is eviden ce of educational performance pr oblems. 3. Documentation of Disability and Request for Accommodation The disability, its functional impact and requested accommodati on(s) must be documented. If the student di scloses a disability and requests accommodation, the School requires documentation of the disability from a qualifie d professional. The student is financially responsibl e, unless there are extraordin ary and compelling circumstances, for the costs related to the documentation by an appropriately educated and trained professional. The information provided by the prof essional must be factual, objective and technically valid, and must establish clearly tha t the disability substantially limits one or more of the student's major life activities. The professional(s) who evaluate the student should identify options for management of the disab ility. Based on this information, the affected student then should request in writin g the accommodations which he or she requests be made. The Dean for Student Affairs or Program Director and the student should work together to arrive at reasonable accomm odations. The School may also require a second expert opinion for which the School m ay be financially responsible under extraordinary and compelling circumstances. The School reserves the right to request as much detailed information from the student and/or the professional(s) as is necessary to assess the scope of the disability and/or th e reasonable accommodations. B. Responsibilities of the School 1. Review of Requests for Accommodation Requests for accommodations will us ually be reviewed by the Dea n for Student Affairs or Program Director. An ad hoc assessment team may be convened which may include the Dean for Student Affairs, t he educational Program Director (or curriculum supervisor), selected members of the Disabilities Oversight Com mittee (See Section B.5 below) and other consultants as appropriate to the individual c ircumstances. The assessment team usually should include: (1) individuals who und erstand the curriculum in question; (2) a person who is knowledgeable about the Americ ans with Disabilities Act; (3) a person with authority to authorize accommodations an d cause them to be implemented. 106 2. Responsibilities for Accommodation The School of Medicine is respons ible for the costs incurred in making accommodations which are not unduly burdensome or unreasonable. Accommodation s may include but may not be limited to academic modifications which do not funda mentally alter the nature of the program, auxiliary services, modifications of the circumstances and methods of qualification examin ations, classroom modifications and others. The School's responsibility to accomm odate ends when a student with a disability: (1) refuses reasonable accommodations; (2) is unable, with reasonable accom modations, to fulfill the essential requirements of the program; (3) fulfills the essenti al requirements and graduates; or (4) transfers to another institution. The School is not required to provide an accommodation which fundamentally alters the nature of the prog ram, is unduly burdensome or is unreasonable. 3. Confidentiality Information pertaining to a student's disability and accommodat ions will be maintained in a file that is kept confidential and separate from the stude nt's academic record. Appropriate faculty, staff and administrators may be informed r egarding the disability, limitations, restrictions, and accommodations when they have a need to know such information. 4. Application of PT CAPES Policies The policies and procedures of the School regarding promotion a nd retention are contained in the PT CAPES Polic ies for each academic unit. The se policies and procedures govern the relationshi p between the School and all s tudents, including those with disabilities. The School is not obligated to retain a stu dent with a disability who poses a significant threat to the health or safety of others wh en there is no reasonable accommodation that either eliminates or sufficiently reduces th at risk. 5. Disabilities Oversight Committee There shall exist a standing D isabilities Oversight Committee c omposed of members designated by the Dean of the School of Medicine. The committe e shall have the following responsibilities: periodic review of requests for acc ommodations and accommodations granted, provide recommendations regarding accom modations for disabilities, to serve as requested on disability appeals commi ttee. This group serves as a resource regarding issues of significance to the institution an d to students with disabilities. C. Appeals A student with a disability who believes that a request for acc ommodation has been improperly denied or who perceives that he or she has been disc riminated against on the basis of a disability should direct his or her appeal to the De an of the School of Medicine. As needed, the Dean of the School o f Medicine may assemble an a dvisory group to review appeals and make recomme ndations. This group may includ e, but may not be limited to, the following: the chair of the committee that over sees academic evaluation and advancement of students for the particular academic unit, s tudents, and/or 107 representatives of the Disabilities Oversight Committee. Policies for Accommodations Based Upon Sexual Assault The University is committed to o ffering reasonable academic acc ommodations to students who are victims of sexual assault. Dependi ng on the specific nature of the allegation, such measures may include but are not limited to: implementation of a no-contact order, c ourse/classroom assignment changes, and other academic support services a nd accommodations. If you nee d to request such accommodations, please direct your request to Kim Webb ( kim_webb@wustl.edu ), Director of the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center. Ms. W ebb is a confidential resourc e; however, requests for accommodations will be shared with the appropria te University administration a nd faculty. The University will maintain as confidential any accommodations or protective measures provided to an individual student so long as it does not impair the ability to provide such measures. Bias Reporting: The University has a process th rough which students, faculty, s taff and community members who have experienced or witnessed incidents of bias, prejudice or discri mination against a student can report their experiences to the University's Bias Report and Support System (BRSS) team.

Special Considerations for International Service All students, faculty, trainees, and staff should: Assume responsibility for proper immunizations; this may need t o be started 6-8 months prior to travel. Make a travel appointment with student or employee heal th. Read and familiarize yourself with \"SECURITY TIPS FOR TRAVELING ABROAD\" (see next section) Carry the number for ISOS. For more information, https://www.internationalsos.com/ It is highly recommended that International service trips be ar ranged through well-established organizations. Physical therapy students need to be cautious in their represen tation of themselves to national and international agencies looking to recruit physical therapy/reha b aides. The APTA discourages students from taking jobs where t he student represents themselv es as a student physical therapist. SECURITY TIPS FOR TRAVELING ABROAD 1. Familiarize yourself with local laws and customs in the area yo u are traveling. If you are traveling to a high-risk area, get as mu ch information as possible about the threat in your destination before you leave. Information can be obtained from the U.S. State Depa rtment ( http://travel.state.gov ). 2. Make sure all official documents ; i.e. passport, shot records a re up-to-date. 3. Grant power of attorney to an immediate relative/close friend. 4. Establish a point of contact for your family to call in an emer gency. Someone should know your whereabouts from the time you depart the United States until yo u return home. 5. Depending on your personal circu mstances, it may be advisable t o register with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. 6. Carry an extra set of eyeglasses and any necessary medications (along with a copy of the prescription and the generic name of the drug) in your carry-on luggage. Keep all medications in their original containers. 7. Carry identification: make copies of your airline ticket, passp ort identification page, driver's license and any credit cards you t ake with you. Carry this reco rd, along with two extra passport photos, in a separate place from the originals. If your passpor t is lost or stolen abroad, report the situation IMMEDIATELY to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate and to the local police authorities. 116 8. Take all essential personal and me dical identification. Items t o consider are telephone numbers of relatives, health and life insurance policy numbers. 9. Plan ahead to ensure that you will have enough foreign currency . 10. Avoid attracting unwanted attention to yourself. Take a good lo ok at the clothing, jewelry and even reading material that you ta ke. Some items may be consider ed offensive in the country you are visiting. 11. Always be conscious of your su rroundings and avoid any areas yo u believe may put your personal safety at risk. Never travel alone after dark. PREPARING FOR AFTER GRADUATION Employment/Pre-employment Contracts As a result of staffing challeng es in some regions of the count ry, some facilities offer money or the offer of loan repayment to physical the rapy students in exchange for future services as staff physical therapists. While many of these scholarship-employment contracts are of mer it, all students should be aware of the ramifications of such contracts and know what questions to ask before they sign any contract. Any students considering a scholarship-employment contract should h ave the contract reviewed and explained to them by a lawyer prior to signing it. Be aware it is unethical to sign a contract to obtain scholarsh ip money with the intention of never completing the contract. It is unethical to accept multiple sch olarship-employment contracts which require simultaneous full-time completion of the employment cla use. Be aware of any contract that sounds too good to be true. The h orror stories of students accepting positions in far-removed areas with no fellow physical therapis t nearby, of being forced to treat excessive numbers of patients, of having no choice in the selection of lo cation or type of patient population, are often true. Students are respons ible for knowing to what they a re agreeing. Recruiters Recruiters in physical therapy are available in times of short supply of jobs and in times when physical therapists are in short supply. W hen jobs are in short supply, recruiters might be helpful to graduates. When individuals are in short supply, facilities might find rec ruiters helpful. No recruiter places therapists in positions for free. With one type of recruiter the employee (new graduate) has to pay a fee to be placed. In the other case, the facility needing physical therapists has to pay the recruitment fee. Occasionally the facility turns around and passes this cost to the newly hired therapist. Frequently, the new employee is prevented from obtai ning other incentives offered by facilities when a recruiter is involved. O ften recruiters do little more t han graduates can do on their own. Be very cautious in involving a recruiter. Students have recently experienced increased problems with rec ruiters and excessive numbers of e-mail contacts. Read and review with a lawyer any contract you may have to sign. Seek other options. On occasi on a recruiter is helpful to find a therapist a unique position, or a position is in a distant or unfamiliar area. If recruiters call the Program wanting to meet with students, t he recruiter's name and number will be given to the class President or faculty liaison. The students' names and phone numbers will not be provided to recruiters by the Program. The class liaison should poll classmates for their interest in meeting with recruiters and respond to the recruiter directly. 117 If students are contacted by recruiters w ho want to meet with t he classes, it is permissible for students to arrange for the recruiters to u se the Program space provided th at no services of the staff or faculty are required, meetings do not interfe re with classes or other Progr am activities, and meeting space is scheduled in advance with the staff. Students must notify the A ssociate Director for Professional Curriculum when recruiters are c oming. Faculty will not usually attend recruitment meetings. Recruiters are responsible for providing copies of written material. LICENSURE The Federation of State Boards of Phy sical Therapy (http://fsbp t.org) administers the physical therapy licensure exam. A license is required to practice physical therapy; it is illegal to practice without a license and doing so can influence future licensure a s well. While the licensure exam is the same for every state, each state (or compact) has its own l icensing law and procedures. Graduates may only apply for li censure in one state at a time, and each state has its own fees for application. When licensure is desired in more than one state, one must pass the national licensure exam and be licensed in one state before being permitted to app ly for reciprocity in another state. Although the applicant does not have to repeat the exam, there is a fee in every state for reciprocity. Graduates are responsible for learning the licensure requiremen ts in their states or compact license. Some states allow graduates to practice under a temporary license, which is issued after successful application to take the exam has been made and befor e actually taking the exam. Temporary licenses are valid only for a limited time. Many stat es are now requiring a written statement from applicants (and those renewing their licenses) i ndicating they are physically and emotionally fit to practice. If a state has reason to believe t hat a graduate is not fit to practice or has a history that puts him or her at risk for future fitness, that state may impose certain conditions on licensure (e.g. monitoring by a psychiatrist in t he event of current or past emotional difficulties). Generally, to apply for licensure as a physical therapist, students need to have graduated from an accredited program in physical the rapy. Proof of graduation mos t often includes having your diploma. Some states accept attestation letters from the Progra m prior to graduation. The Program will provide attestation letters for only students who are in g ood standing and on track to graduate at an expected time. Students are not encouraged to take the bo ard exam prior to graduation due to the risk that studying for the exam could compromise their a cademic performance during the fifth semester. All students who have completed all graduation requirements will receive their original diploma at the Program ceremony that follows the Danfo rth campus graduation in May, and not beforehand. Students w ho graduate late will receive their diploma at the next cycle of graduation for the university (August and December are the only other times at which diplomas are dated.) Diploma's for students who do not graduate in May a re usually issued two months after the official graduation date. Students should be aware that it is unlawful to share in any wa y what is included on the national exam. Students should only use official website offers from the FSBPT for obtaining sample questions and study advice. Stude nts should be aware that other study guides are commercially prepared and are not official. Students also need to be aware that any violation of the law, b eyond parking tickets and moving 118 violations may be cause for speci al review by the licensing board or refusal to take the board exam. Graduation from the Program does not guarantee that a gra duate will be eligible to take the licensure exam. EVALUATING THE PROGRAM IN PHYSICAL THERAPY The faculty of the Program in Ph ysical Therapy is committed to a flexible curriculum - one which changes with the needs of the profession and the needs of the s tudents. A major source of information that contributes to the changes made i n the program is constructive feedback from students and graduates. You will be asked to participat e in this process to assess the effectiveness of examinations, individual courses, including clinical educa tion, and collections of courses. Though changes cannot always be made immediately, the faculty regards all feedback when making decis ions. You can have an impact on the program in the future. We ask you to be diligent in giving us feedback so that we can continue to improve our curriculum. Students should sign all evaluation forms to gi ve credibility to their comments. Data from the evaluations is su mmarized and shared with those who are appropriate to receive it. All faculty members receive general semester feedback summaries. Al l course masters receive summaries of feedback pertaining to their specific course. All lecturers rec eive all feedback submitted on them. The Director and Associate Director for Professional Curriculum rev iew all semester and graduate feedback. Self-Assessment Profiles : At the Fall midterm and during each clinical experience, the student self- assessment profile regarding professional behaviors will be dis tributed to all student mailboxes. Completion of these assessments is required. The criteria to be self-assessed is included in the section on Student Behavior in this handbook. Examination Evaluations: Students have the option of c ritiquing each written and practi cal examination given. Written test evaluations can be obtained from the exam p roctor. Practical exam evaluations are course specific and will be provided at the end of each practic al exam as determined by the coordinator. The exam evaluations are optiona l. Signatures are not required, but are recommended. Semester Evaluation : At the end of the semester st udents have the opportunity to p rovide feedback on the semester. This evaluation is a course requirement in the first semester and thereafter is highly encouraged. The end-of-semester e valuations are computerized and available ON-LINE. Notice that the evaluation surveys are available will be automatically sent to each student, allowing approximately two weeks for them to be completed. Once the evaluation due date ha s passed, student feedback in other formats is accepted, but the f orms will not be reissued and the student's comments will not be part of the summary. Students will complete a general semester evaluation a s well as an evaluation of each course and the lecturers within each course. Ample room for narrative comments is provided on the forms. Students must be careful to remain constructive in their commen ts and not misuse the opportunity to submit anonymous feedback. End of Program Evaluation : Just prior to graduation students are provided the opportunit y to complete an end of the program evaluation, which they will submit electr onically prior to graduation. Graduate Survey : Approximately one year after graduation students receive a fi nal survey, which allows them to comment on the program and their current practice. Sign atures are not required and data is summarized for all faculty. 119 Washington University Non-discrimin ation Statement (2011) Washington University encourages and gives full consideration t o all applicants for admission, financial aid, and employment. The University does not discriminate in ac cess to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, age, r eligion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, v eteran status, disability or g enetic information.

By matriculating and continuing in the Physical Therapy Program, a student agrees that they may be selected by the instructor and used as a model for class demonstration. A student also agrees to work with fellow students as a lab partner for examination and treatment practice. If for any reason a student believes that they have a medical condition , religious restriction or cultural restriction that w ould prohibit participation, the student has the responsibility to inform the course master and the Associate Director of the Professional Curriculum . The student may be required to o btain documentation to verify the above reasons for limited or non -lab participation. In the event of a medical condition , the student may need to seek disability accommodations to ensure that Program Technical Standards can be met. Continuation in the course and p rogram will be determined on an individual basis and the student is required to demonstrate proficiency in performing all skills on a classmate or tester during practical examinations and clinical education experiences as outlined in each course syllabus .
