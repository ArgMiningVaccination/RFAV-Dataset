I'm a houseman working nights at the hospital, and before duty I make an early evening excursion to the nearby site of someancient burial cairns. The Clava Cairns are a wonderfully preserved collection of stone mounds, thought to have been built by local farming communities in the third or fourthmillennium BC. The cairns are shrouded in mystery. We know little of the social organisation,culture or beliefs of their creators, except that they placed great significance on marking ourexit from this world. Sitting against a lopsided standing stone, I watch the gently swaying branches of an old birch tree, through which the sun's rays shimmer onto the cairns. Moss and lichen grow on its trunk,which reaches skyward, dividing again and again until each shoot ends in a young green leaf.To me, this tree represents the adventure of life ... its boughs reach upwards, spanning out inall directions, corresponding to the innumerable roads not yet travelled. The tree ofpossibilities is always there before us \u2014 but once the responsibilities of adulthood are felt itseems that life becomes increasingly restricted to a single path, and the journey is laid outbefore us, once and for all. Our field of vision is narrowed, steadily and imperceptibly. Buttravel and art feed the tree of possibilities, and with these in plentiful supply I have selectedone path for more detailed exploration. I want to be a GP, a proper family doctor. It could just be youthful idealism, but, to me, general practice seems a wonderful career option, for reasons both wholly selfish and fundamentallyaltruistic. The essential nature of the work \u2014 to sit in a nice room and have intimateconversations with a steady stream of interesting and varied people \u2014 seems a rare privilege.It puts us in touch with the core of existence, representing an exceptional opportunity to findout what life is all about. And to be paid large amounts of money for doing it ... how incredible!Besides this potential for personal enrichment, the work of a GP is of incontestable benefit toothers \u2014 what an amazing and fortunate coincidence. I began my pre-registration year with four months in general practice, and have since worked in hospital jobs. Hospitals scare me, right to the depths of my being. I find that I am incapableof looking squarely at death, particularly in the hospital context. Here it represents failure. Inhospitals it sometimes seems that the purpose of life is simply to prolong it. Maybe it's becausemedicine comes to rule our lives so much that its most immediate goal transforms itself intoour reason for being. We become trapped in the system, it narrows our outlook and the tree ofpossibilities regresses. This domination of our lives by the medical system must subtly impacton our attitudes towards patients, and I fear that it can blind us to the things that really matter. It has been said that young doctors generally come to terms with death at an earlier stage than do other people. But what can it mean to come to terms with death? I don't think it involvesgetting any closer to understanding the transience of an individual existence. More likely isthat we just cease to question the absolute inevitability of its end, and thus it represents animpoverishment of our lives. Paradoxically, this personal acceptance, this acknowledgementof our ultimate powerlessness, has limited impact on the efforts expended in hospitals toprevent or delay the ultimate cure for all illnesses and disabilities. In general practice, I find that medicine can concentrate on issues of living. It's where the uncertainty that makes life interesting is acknowledged and managed, not minimised.Doctoring in hospitals is a different game; hence I feel a desperate need to maintain regularcontact with general practice throughout my training, and have recently been offered anexciting opportunity to do this. A small pilot scheme is in progress in Scotland, where traineesare based in general practice for the whole duration of vocational training. Hospital experiencewill be gained through a series of short secondments into various specialities, decided purelyaccording to the trainee's learning needs. It offers a stable foundation in the continuing,personal relationships of primary care, punctuated by brief and intense exposures to thesupporting hospital expertise. I begin the three-year experimental scheme in August this year,and envisage that it will provide some of the most stimulating and intensely educationalexperiences of my life so far. It's spring, the tree of possibilities is growing, and I have found a brand new branch to explore. The sun is still shining, though the wind has picked up, as it rustles through the canopy above.Some old twigs are dislodged and fall to the ground beside me. I get up and wander around thecairns once more, quietly preparing my mind for another night in the hospital. The work canbe draining, but it is quite bearable and often enjoyable. It's probably just selfishness thatdrives my continual craving for the time when I can be a complete doctor, a real GP.

The population of Hong Kong isapproximately seven million, with 90% ofprimary health care provided by privatepractitioners. Set in the midst of a largelyeconomically deprived urban population,the Unit runs a family medicine clinic for8000 patients at the Government Ap LeiChau Clinic. Having looked forward to theattachment for several months, the durationof my visit was reduced by two daysbecause of the increasing outbreak of SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome. The HongKong Department of Health issued WHOguidelines to primary care physicians on themanagement of suspected cases on 17March 2003 \u2014 my first day in the Unit. Theguidelines focused on the symptoms andsigns of SARS and when to refer. Initially,no information was given to professionals orthe public about preventive measures. Undergraduate clinical teaching was cancelled on my third day and doctors andnurses in the Unit started to wear masks atwork. Colleagues increasingly feared thespread of infection in their community. Asnews of SARS slowly increased, it becameclear that approximately half of thoseinfected in the region were healthprofessionals, particularly those working inhospitals where the first cases were treated.Many colleagues knew at least onehealthcare worker who had been diagnosed.Perhaps for the first time in their lives,family doctors felt a threat to their ownhealth, to their colleagues, and to themedical students they taught. They becamefrightened of infecting their families, andone colleague sent his children to stay withrelatives in Australia, while another madearrangements not to bring a son home fromboarding school in England over Easter. Images from the war in Iraq and academic debates about the strategies employed werebroadcast continually on television.Information about the incidence of SARSand news of infectivity in the communityremained sparse. Initial welcomingcomments were 'it was good of you to stillcome', when initial news of the outbreak athome had been virtually non-existent; I andmy husband had travelled ignorant of anypersonal risk. Our hosts increasinglydisplayed a polite but assertive approach torearranging our flight reservations home.Taking care of invited guests was simplyadding to their worries. For two weeks afterour return, regular e-mails checked on thestate of our health and provided updates onconfirmed cases from the community clinic.The HKCFP also celebrated its 25thanniversary with a scientific meeting duringour visit. The following morning wereceived a telephone call to say that theChief Executive of the Hospital Authority,who had attended the event, had beenadmitted to ITU with suspected SARS. Afrighteningly large number of peoplediagnosed seemed to require early intensivecare. Finally, the story made front page news(although only a paragraph), and the risk tohealth professionals who attended themeeting became real. We were advised thatmasks had been left in an envelope outsideour room and were strongly advised not totravel on public transport and to avoidcrowded places. Shops and restaurants werealready pretty empty. Our masks were neverworn. We remained sceptical of their valueoutside a hospital environment. During the meeting a Fellowship Conferment Ceremony was held jointly withthe Hong Kong College of CommunityMedicine. The Minister of Health of thePeople's Republic of China was one of therecipients. A colleague translated hisacceptance speech as he outlined the manychallenges in public health facing China,particularly the lack of health careinfrastructure in rural communities. Detailsof the escalation of SARS in April have beenaccompanied by news that the Minister hasbeen replaced. Around the world, publicopinion has supported the view that theauthorities were initially keen to keep theemerging epidemic hidden. No-one questioned our fitness to travel at the airport. Other travellers and aircrew woremasks for the duration of the 12-hour flight.We witnessed two passengers receivingoxygen during the journey (one also havinga nebuliser). We prayed silently that neitherwas infected and hoped that no-one wouldask if a doctor was on board. Since then,there has been plenty of information aboutSARS, from editorials in the BMJ , Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine to an array of information on health-relatedwebsites. The current advice is not to travel to high- risk areas. Our hosts are now our friends andalthough our personal fear has receded, ourconcerns for their welfare continue.Academic colleagues are now worried abouttheir own travel plans and whether they willbe able to fulfil promised commitments laterin the year. A hospital colleague recentlytold of his experience of treating the secondconfirmed case in the UK and the need forstringent infection control. No-one knowshow long this outbreak will last, but there isno obvious end in sight. As a doctor you donot expect to contract an infectious diseasethat might kill. Yvonne CarterCeltic Pilgrimage \u2014 rural WONCA 2003 In medieval times, the shrine of St James was the destination of CelticPilgrims, who made their way viathe Bristol Channel, joining theships of the wine trade that workedthe trade route back and forth toPorto. The ships carried woollengoods on the outward leg and porton the return trip. This year, from 24-27 September, you are invited to join the revival ofthe Celtic Pilgrimage to Santiago deCompostela in Spain, by attendingthe Sixth Rural WONCA WorldHealth Conference, which is beingheld at Santiago and organised bythe Spanish Rural GPs with adegree of outside help. Afterwards,there will be a clinical meeting inBraga, in Portugal, whereconference themes will becontinued in small groupdiscussion. This year's revival of the Celtic Pilgrimage will be led by Dr JohnWynn-Jones (Wales), Chairman ofthe Scientific Committee, JohnGillies (Scotland), who is chairingthe new Culture section, and John AJ Macleod (Scotland) as WONCALiaison member. The programme isavailable for viewing onwww.ruralwonca2003.net and registration can be done through thesite. There are speakers from allover the world, including, from theUK, Richard Smith (Editor, BMJ ) and Julian Tudor Hart (TheValleys). Numerous workshops areplanned, allowing much more directinteraction than would usually takeplace at large internationalconferences. There will also bediscussion on some of the WONCApolicy documents and theMelbourne Manifesto. The Spanish are renowned for their hospitality and they have a fineprogramme in hand to cater for allages and tastes. A new concept forour conference is the 'MarketSquare', where the cultural events,with displays of artwork andphotographs, will be staged. So, noneed to queue for deck space on asailing ship, just pack your bag,gather the family and make yourway by car or plane to join thisexciting gathering.

Plant of the Month: Rosa 'Gr\u00fc\u00df an Aachen' Climbing Few roses can match this one for subtle transformations between cream and pink, for scent,and for continuous flowering. But the climbing form is no longer available commercially. Ifyou find one, let me know.NATIONAL and international surveys, government reports and WorldHealth Organisation data all show that palliative services, from home-basedhospice systems to hospital-basedconsultation teams, are inadequate to meetthe growing needs of the world'spopulation': so said Dr Kathleen Foley inthe Floriani Lecture, on the first day of theEighth Congress of the EuropeanAssociation of Palliative Care (EAPC) inApril. Is it the case that patients with a life-threatening disease who need good carehave missed the bus? No, that can't be true.In The Netherlands, policies that thegovernment have pursued for the past fiveyears have focused on encouragingprogrammes for better facilities in palliativecare, adapted to the needs of patients andtheir environment. For me, this Congress indicated that such policies are beginning to bear fruit. Someyears ago, when I attended a Congress of theresearch branch of the EAPC in Berlin, weas researchers argued most of the time thatmore research was needed to improve ourknowledge of the needs of people inpalliative care. Three years later, I find thatsuch knowledge is expanding worldwide.The plenary lectures and sessions of freecommunication were full of new researchresults. The daily poster sessions indicatedthat much new work has been done in thepast years. These were on the subjects ofsymptom control, evaluation of several newinitiatives to improve palliative care,methodology in research, euthanasia andphysician-assisted suicide, and palliativecare in non-cancer patients (for neurologicaldiseases and dementia). The excellent set-up of the Congress programme left enough time for building ormaintaining networking relationships duringthe breaks, made possible by the relativelysmall scale (1500 attendees) of the meeting. Another highlight of the Congress was theeffort made to cover non-clinical subjects.Bereavement, psycho-oncology, and ethicswere themes that received much attention inthe sessions. As Dr Tony O'Brien put it:'Palliative care gives relief from pain andother symptoms, but it should also offer asupport system to help patients live as activea life as possible. Very often this meanslistening to our patients, who can often teachus more than anyone else.' To give the whole meeting a festive touch, the closing ceremony took place in thepresence of Her Majesty Queen B\u00e9atrix.This was a royal ending to an excellentconference, with many new 'take-homemessages' to ponder on. There is still muchto do in palliative care!

Man is tohimself a mysterious creation. This question is the old question about thenature of man, in which, as men, we all havean understandable interest. The psalmistasks God, What is man, that you are mindful of him,Yet you have made him a little less thana God? (Psalms 8; 4-6.) The psalmist ponders finds him awkwardly placedbetween insignificance and near divinity.The same is true today. One minute, in theconsultation, it seems as if a near-divinepower of sympathy and understanding isflowing through me, yet the next minute inthe coffee room I can get thoroughly upsetover some insignificant or imagined slight. How we understand man has a big effect on what we see of him, and therefore how wetreat him. Some people hold anunquestioned model of man, the model thatthey learnt as they grew up. Such people canbe thrown as they realise that other peoplehold a quite different model. This realisationcan be brought about by studying sociologyor psychology, by meeting other cultures, 1 or simply by the infinite variety of generalpractice. It can be a reassurance to realisethat only certain models of man are ingeneral use in our culture. The followingthree models might be held, to some degree,to classify most of the models available tous. 1.Rational man \u2014 man as an individual man, 2.Social man \u2014 man as primarily a member of a group, and 3.Religious man \u2014 man seen primarily in relation to a creator. Each model finds its adherents in contemporary European culture. Rational man This is probably the dominant model now,especially in academic circles. It can bedescribed as follows. Man is seen as arational individual. He chooses his actionsby deciding what is best for him from hisindividual point of view. Society is seensimply as an aggregation of pre-existingindividuals. This is how Hobbes sawsociety. 2 This picture of rational self-interest as adominant force has built up slowly. WhereLa Rochefoucauld 3emphasised that apparent altruism was often hidden self-interest (rather than the opposite of self-interest), Hume 4saw self-interest as one among many motivations. That flower ofthe Scottish enlightenment, Adam Smith,did not see man as purely rational, butappealed to rational self-interest as aprotection against man's pride. 5Only when we reach Bentham6or Nietzsche do we find philosophers who held that altruism couldnot exist, and all was self-interest. Thisemergence is well described by MacIntyre'sA short history of ethics . 7This model of rational man (that is, a purely self-interestedman) is that of most contemporaryeconomics and some political science. It hasproved an excellent model where there is apossibility of quantifying data, and it hasshed light on many aspects of humanbehaviour. However, it is difficult to use itto account for the possibility of man's co-operation with man because each man isseen as making his own self-interesteddecision. Altruism is seen by some as adisconfirming case for the 'rational man'model. A true believer in rational mantheory, if he accepts that altruistic motivesoccur, albeit rarely, has to admit of theexistence of a world beyond the perceptionsof his previous 'view-of-the-world'. Indeed,this is explicitly the journey taken byMonroe 8and Batson (a social psychologist)9 in their rather different books on altruism.Driven to extremes, the 'rational man' viewleads to an extremely poor picture of man,whose ultimate logic is depicted by WHAuden in The Shield of Achilles . 10 That girls are raped, That two boys knife a third,Were axioms to him, who'd never heardOf any world where promises are kept, Or one could weep because another wept. Auden is pointing out that if there is onlyself-interest, then it will be a bleak worldindeed in which we live. The difficulties this model presents have been well described by Hardin's 'tragedy ofthe commons' where the cows overgrazeland held in common. 11A whole volume of essays bringing together current criticism ofthis model, from contemporary economics,politics, and psychology, has beenpublished. 12There have been two contemporary developments of this picture.According to Ogden, 13psychological theory has come from seeing man as a passiveresponder to stimuli to seeing him as anactive appraiser of risk, first in theenvironment, and increasingly within hisown self. Giddens 14has described post- modern man as defining himself by thechoices he makes. By this he means, forexample, that I choose my food in order todefine and declare who I am, rather thaneating what is normal or thought suitable formy state in life. The social model of man In this model, a person is defined by hisposition in society. He is, as it were,constituted by the rights, duties and normsof his position. It is a familiar model toanyone who attended a public school orWhat is man? This article is based a project that was supervised by Dr Jane Ogden.The project was completed as partof a MSc degree in general practiceat Guy's King's and Thomas'sMedical School, London.The British Journal of General Practice, June 2003 505other comparable institution. The essential facts about a boy are stated by his positionin the school hierarchy, not by his personalchoices. A boy is defined by being, let ussay, a fifth-year boy in a certain house withcertain privileges and duties. If one knowsthis, then nothing else is worth knowingabout him. His thoughts and actions, indeedwhere he is at any moment of the day can beconfidently predicted just from thisknowledge. In a similar way Marxistsbelieved that a man's essential being wasdetermined by his economic position insociety, his social class. This was thestructure. Anything else, his religion, hisopinions, was called the super-structure andcould be determined from it. An analogycan be made with language. Language doesnot exist in the absence of human beings,yet it precedes the existence of theindividual. Language moulds and limits theways individuals can think. The same maybe said of the rules of society. (This is oneof the insights of the structuralists 15). Certain goods, especially money, have no'objective' existence, but are essentially'social' goods. 16Within this model altruism is not a problem. Both altruism and 'rationalself-interest' are seen as alternative socialnorms. So this model can explain altruismand much human behaviour. Yet it can betaken too far and lead to the dreadfultotalitarian excesses of Nazism andcommunism, both Russian and Chinese.The engineered famines of Stalin in theUkraine in the 1930s and Mao in China in1958 spring to mind. This last famine,engineered by man, caused many moredeaths than World War II. 17 Religious manReligious man is defined primarily by hisrelation to a creator. Belief in a creator iscommon to most but not all cultures. If acreator exists then one's relation to him is ofgreat importance. Even if we think thatthere is only a small probability that heexists, the stakes are so high that we may bewiser to bet that he does exist. This insightis known as 'Pascal's wager' after Pascal,the founder of modern probability theory,who first set it out. 18Religion provides many people with a meaning for their life,and indeed for suffering and death.However, exclusive attention to thisrelationship with the creator also leads to animpoverished picture of man. In thefollowing passage Thomas Merton, who asa Trappist monk was vowed to a lifetime ofpoverty and silence, opposes an exclusively'vertical' relationship with God: 'For it is the survival of religion as an abstract formality without a humanistmatrix, religion apart from man ...religion without any human epiphanyin art, in work, in social forms: this iswhat is killing religion in our midsttoday, and not atheists.' 19References 1.

London: Whurr publishers, 2002.It was men who believed that only the vertical relationship with God wasimportant who were responsible for theInquisition and for mankind's innumerablewars of religion. From this perspective, ifonly man's relationship with God isimportant, then one can justify 'killing aman in order to save his soul'. In a previous article I contrasted a polyphonic discourse (one where severaldifferent models are heard with mutualrespect) to a monologising discourse, whichcomes from the belief that one model holdsthe full and exclusive truth. 20This, I believe, is our situation with these models of man.Each can tell us something about him, but ifany one is taken exclusively, as amonologising discourse, it leads to danger.Initially it leads to blindness about thingsoutside the model. For example, in themodels above, rational man cannot perceivealtruism, social man devalues personalbeliefs, and an exclusively religiousperspective fails to perceive the value ofsocial life. Eventually, a monologisingdiscourse can lead to tyranny. First, it canlead to a state organised only for peoplewho are willing to fit in with a certainunderstanding of man. Then it cansometimes lead to a state that sponsorstorturers to stretch or chop people until theyfit into, or accept the validity of, theirscheme. In the models above, the rationalman model might lead to unbridled liberaleconomics, the social model might lead tothe totalitarian state, and the exclusivelyreligious model to religious persecution.Different models of man also lead todifferent therapeutic possibilities, asbeautifully explained by the psychiatrist andphilosopher Patrick Bracken in the case ofpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 21 Bracken claims to show that the basis of thecurrent treatment of PTSD by cognitivepsychology is the Western understanding ofan individual rational man who activelyconstructs his personal meaning from hisown life. Trauma is seen as disrupting thislife task, and cognitive therapy makes itpossible again. Bracken found this approachof little use when he worked in Uganda withAfrican survivors of the terrors of Amin'sregime. This was because, for them, theirlife's meaning was given by unquestionedbeliefs, and by their place in society. Hence,for them, the urgent task was to restorebroken social bonds. It was this that restoredmeaning, not intra-psychic work to restorecognitive schema. There is one final distinction to make. To say each insight into the nature of man ispartial is not to commit oneself to thephilosophical position that there is noobjective truth about the nature of man. It iscompatible with the position that there is anobjective truth, which may be partiallygrasped in a number of different ways. Gervase Vernondigest 506 The British Journal of General Practice, June 2003BRUNO Schulz, the Polish-Jewish writer and artist, was born in 1892 inthe Galician town of Drohobycz, then a part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hisfather ran a haberdashery shop; the familywas comfortably off, secular and fairly wellassimilated. 1915, Schulz's father Jacobdied, and Drohobycz's marketplace,including his father's shop, was flattened bythe Russian army. This was the great dividein Schulz's life. Unlike Kafka, to whom hebears some resemblance, he doted on hisfather. All his subsequent writings were tobecome 'The Book lay in all its gloryon my father's desk, and he, quietlyengrossed in it, patiently rubbed with a wetfingertip the top of decals, until the blankpage grew opaque and ghostly with adelightful foreboding and, suddenly, flakingoff in bits of tissue, disclosed a peacock-eyed fragment.' War ended in 1918, and Drohobycz became Polish (it is now in western Ukraine). Schulzwent on to earn his living as an arts andcrafts teacher, and wrote and painted on theside. He was a shy and sexually frustratedman, to judge from his weirdly compellingdrawings, which show dwarfish creaturesfawning on elegantly bored young girls. Itwas only through the intervention of friendsin the 1930s that his stories were publishedat all, in the volumes Cinnamon Shops and Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass . The literary sensation started a franticcorrespondence with established figures inPolish letters such as Witkiewicz (Witkacy)and Gombrowicz (a selection was publishedin English in 1988). He fell out with thelatter when he pointed out that for the'doctor's wife from Wilcza Street' (aninvented philistine) his stories were 'justpretending'. Schulz clearly was a late Romantic: in a letter of 1936, he avowed that wanting to'mature' into childhood was his artistic aim.He sets out to make the modest town ofDrohobycz into something like a modernBabylon: his stories are dominated bypreternatural seasons, the peculiarsplendours of provincial life, and a parentalhome where every door might be the secretpassage to the archives of the cosmos.Almost every story has the same small cast,in particular the enigmatic, impracticalfigure of Father dreaming of demi-urgesamong his bales of cotton, and his arch-enemy, the housemaid Adela, who isefficiency with a broom.

There is adistinctly greedy quality to Schulz's writing. Sixty years is a long time to be in thrall to anyone's work: Jerzy Ficowski, a notedPolish poet and critic himself, has done morethan anyone to bring Schulz's work to lightsince first reading him in 1942. That sameyear Schulz was casually gunned down onthe street by a Gestapo officer who bore agrudge against his protector, a VienneseNazi who had commissioned him to paintfairy-tale 'frescos' in various parts of town.His dismal death, on a day on which 100Jews in Drohobycz were summarilyexecuted in a 'wild action', was nothing atall like the splendidly orchestrated end of theworld announced in his novella The Comet when 'the curtains blew out far into the nightand the rows of rooms stood in an all-embracing, incessant draught, which shotthrough them in violent, relentless alarm'.Hidden behind whitewash and plaster,Schulz's polychromes were accidentallystumbled upon just two years ago. In atroubling coda to his book, Ficowski relatesthat shortly after their discovery thepaintings were pried from their supports andsecretly conveyed to the Yad Vashemmuseum in Israel, which claimed it was theproper place to preserve them \u2014 surely abizarre imposition of identity politics on aman who claimed Drohobycz was his 'oneand only town on earth'. Schulz has remained a kind of open secret, a writer's writer, even: he plays a role in majornovels by Danilo Kis, David Grossman andPhilip Roth. In Cynthia Ozick's The Messiah of Stockholm , the long-lost manuscript of a novel called The Messiah , which Schulz is thought to have been working on in his lastyears, turns up, like the Messiah himself,when least expected. Ficowski's book (inTheodosia Robertson's fine translation) willprobably be of most interest to readersalready familiar with the teeming nursery ofSchulz's imagination. Those who need to bedazzled by his unique stylistic meld ofwisdom literature, Linnean Latin andbiblical allusions should turn to the twovolumes of short stories, or to one of thenovels in which Schulz turns up as a kind ofheresiarch of dreams to enjoy, like his fatherin his own writings, a partial existence'under the sign of the hourglass' \u2014 a life inliterature's mythic time, which settles inpuddles beside the unremitting one-waytraffic of the real.

Bird migration hadhardly begun and rooms were still being made ready for Easter tourists when the swarm arrived and soon filled the beds and took up all the cars available for hire throughout Uist.This was not to follow up the story of the lack of a renal dialysis machine that had theHealth Board paying out some \u00a35000 a week to transport a patient to and from a mainlandcentre of excellence, but were all in the hunt for hedgehogs that were due to emerge fromtheir sites of hibernation, often in the middle of peat stacks and close to houses. For years, Uist has been plagued by flocks of Greylag Geese who now breed locally in profusion. When I was young, the Greylag arrived in majestic 'V' formations from theirsummer breeding in the Arctic. At that time, the local arable crop was short-eared oats andbarley, cut by scythe or mower and then bundled into sheaves that were 'stooked' on end todry before being carted home and built into large stacks beside the byre. Then, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds declared an area in South Uist as a protected reserve for Greylag to stay all summer, nest and raise local broods. This cult hasspread through the Uist island chain and for some years the infestation has been a menacefrom early in the year. From July onwards, crops are eaten as they stand, and the loss, tothe struggling crofter, is at least an average of 10%, with more isolated fields losing 50%.For ages, various committees have met and discussed the problem. A wide variety ofscaring mechanisms have been tried but they just move the birds on to a neighbour'sground. Out-of-season shooting licences can be arranged but only to cull a limited numberand the granting of such a licence is sometimes dependent on a count of 'droppings persquare metre'. There has been absolute refusal by officialdom to permit the simple andlocally advocated solution, which is to prick the eggs in the nests. By doing this, the goosewill continue to sit but the eggs will not hatch and so, for each nest, there will be six lessGreylag to nibble the sparse winter grass. This refusal to forcefully deal with a problem that, indirectly, affects humans contrasts dramatically with the reaction when it was shown that wild mink and hedgehogs werechewing up the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. Uist, with its varied topographyand virtually no trees, is world famous for its wading birds, which all nest on the ground.\u00a31 million was assigned over three years to set up a trapping scheme, to control the spreadof mink and then several thousands became available to cull hedgehogs. No public fussabout mink being despatched to their 'other world' but near hysteria at the concept ofhumane killing of the 'pretty' hedgehogs. Argument continues in relation to culling ortranslocating the hedgehogs and the media from across the world have been here to followthe story. Who would have thought that there was a war in Iraq or that elections to theScottish Parliament and local Councils were imminent? A few years ago, in a debate on theenvironment, one of our local councillors stated 'people are coming here to view the birdsand sea mammals but in twenty years, they will be coming to view the few humans whoare still resident'. Extreme perhaps, but he may well be right. This hedgehog issue (\u00a35 per live animal from one organisation) has truly captured world interest, with even the New York Times (4 April 2003) devoting one-third of a page to a detailed story on local reactions. However, the impending lack of GP cover for an isolatedarea on Lewis has only had minimal brief and short-term publicity.john a j macleod BJGPeditorial subcommittee meeting, Wizard Pool, Loch Skiport, South Uist, May 2002. Photograph by James Willis.INMay 1703 the city of St Petersburg started its glorious history, founded bythe Russian Tsar Peter I as a new capital of Russia. For a while the country had twomain cities. St Petersburg has been for twocenturies modern, fashionable, stylish, new,Western \u2014 the head of the Russian Empire.Moscow was an old-fashioned keeper of thespirit, the mysterious Russian soul, the heartof Russia. Today we can say Moscow is theformal capital \u2014 the centre ofadministration, the seat for the government,while the city of St Petersburg hasdeveloped into a cultural capital of the newRussia. Nowadays St Petersburg looks forward \u2014 in the development of science and of art, and ofsomething that belongs to both fields \u2014medicine. The development of medicinerests with the St Petersburg MedicalAcademy for Postgraduate Studies (MAPS).MAPS is looking brand-new, like manybuildings in the city, and inside we areimproving the quality of teaching medicineto postgraduate doctors. If you happen to be in St Petersburg this summer, marvel at the beautiful palaces, bigbroad squares, straight streets, numerousblue rivers and canals, and our bridges withexquisite cast-iron ballustrades. StPetersburg is cleaned and freshly painted.The renovations of architecturalmasterpieces have not touched the basicinteriors, but they have added to the exterior,the outer look. We have renovated medicine too. Reforms are changing the core of medicine, andchanging the mentality of doctors, so that asthe result, the human being of the 21stcentury will finally get something to pleasehis whole being \u2014 the medical approachthat will bring together the body, the mindand the spirit. Today's medicine is not justdiagnosis and treatment as it used to be. It isalso health promotion and diseaseprevention. 'Mens sana in corpore sano',('The healthy mind in the healthy body') \u2014the Romans used to say. Three centurieshave not passed in vain. They have allowedour 'beautiful minds' to bloom in thebeautiful environment of the great city of StPetersburg. So today we celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of a comparatively young city\u2014 our coming of age. And medicine, andthe medical world in general, celebrates thevictory over dogmas, rigidity, andconservatism. It is not by chance that StPetersburg has been chosen to take theresponsibility for developing the new fieldof Russian medicine: family practice. Olga KuznetzovaThree Hundred Years of Peterreflection 508 The British Journal of General Practice, June 2003The early days Monday the 10 March 2003 started in amanner not dissimilar to other Mondays.There were some problems from the weekendto be cleared up; a patient recently returnedfrom Mainland China had died ofpneumonia, and a number of healthcareworkers from another medical ward hadreported sick with a 'flu-like illness. We hadbeen aware for several weeks of 'atypicalpneumonia' in patients who had recentlytravelled to Guangdong Province just to thenorth of Hong Kong, but at this stage thedisease was a curiosity notable mainly for itsapparently high mortality and obscureaetiology. We did not know at that stage thatthe disease was unusually contagious. I chose to pursue the cluster of staff 'flu-like illness in ward 8A. We discovered that morethan ten staff from the ward had reported sickover the weekend with fever, myalgia anddizziness and there was also an impressionthat several of the patients had spiked highfevers. Feeling a sense of unease that thesituation seemed quite unusual, I decided tohead straight to the office of the Professor ofMedicine, who was standing outside hisoffice being briefed by his nurse manager. Nodoubt he knew it was trouble when Iapproached \u2014 to work in infection control isalways to be the bearer of bad news. By noon of that day our outbreak management group had started work, and itwas clear very soon that our problem wasescalating rapidly. We arranged to recall sickstaff to perform nasopharyngeal aspirates forrapid viral diagnosis, and to our surprise 78staff members presented for sampling. Wewere also aware by then at least five patientshad a similar illness, and infection controlmeasures were introduced in the ward,including closing the ward to newadmissions. I started work the following morning with the feeling that things could only get better, but Iwas quite wrong in this regard. Aroundlunchtime I was called by an irate surgeonwho said that three doctors on his team weresick, and one of these had been admitted withpneumonia. His team members had recentlyvisited the outbreak ward to see a patient.This was the first report of pneumonia instaff, and a sign that our situation wasbecoming very grave indeed. In the early evening of Tuesday 11 March, it was decided to screen sick staff in a hastilyarranged evening clinic set up in a conferenceroom. Still ignorant of the likely cause, weself-medicated from large jars of levofloxacinand packets of tamiflu supplied by thepharmacy, put on our masks, gowns andgloves, and headed into battle. I wassurprised that the clinic attracted around 50staff, as it was arranged at only a few hoursnotice. The clinic proceeded in an eerie calmas the physicians examined and arrangedchest X-rays and blood tests for the sick, mostof whom were doctors, nurses, and medicalstudents from their own department. Afterseveral hours, everyone had been processedand a briefing was held in another room. Onegroup had mild symptoms and negativeinvestigations and were to be sent home withadvice to return if they became sicker (mostdid). The other group had severe symptomsor abnormal chest X-rays and were led off insingle file to an observation ward which hadbeen commandeered earlier in the eveningfrom a reluctant professor of A&E medicine.During the evening we had also receiveddisturbing news; there was an outbreak ofatypical pneumonia in Hanoi, Vietnam,related to a Chinese-American patient whohad recently arrived from Hong Kong. Thesecondary attack rates in exposed healthcarestaff in Hanoi were more than 56%, and thedisease had a significant mortality rate. Thereseemed little doubt that it was the samedisease \u2014 we were not alone. Crisis By mid-week our situation had progressed toa fully-fledged crisis. The number of personsaffected rose rapidly and we saw also morestaff, more patients, ex-patients, visitors ofpatients, and family contacts of all thesepresenting with the disease. By mid-April,124 staff, 25 patients, and 31 ward visitorswere documented as having acquired thedisease. Several GPs who had seen thepatients, their visitors, or their contacts, alsodeveloped the disease. Towards the end of the first week the probable source case was identified; a 26-year-old man who had pneumonia thatresolved spontaneously, but who had beengiven nebuliser therapy. This may have led tomore extensive dissemination of the causalagent in the ward. The WHO had officiallyannounced the Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome and put out an unprecedentedworld health alert. Despite that, we felt ratherisolated. Other Hong Kong hospitals viewedit as a Prince of Wales Hospital problem, theMinister for Health was adamant that SARShad not spread to the Hong Kong community,and the rest of the world was much moreinterested in a war just started in Iraq. Nor was there much more optimism on the clinical front; the typical clinical course wasof a slowly progressive pneumonia, with 20%or more patients requiring care in theintensive care unit. There was also a realconcern that the ICU capacity would beswamped. We had a moment of relief whenour virology laboratory isolated aparamyxovirus from many patients but thiswas short-lived \u2014 another laboratory isolateda coronavirus several days later, and thisappears to be the causal agent of SARS. At about the same time, issues of managing staff became prominent. Many new staff wererequired to operate the SARS wards, andmany of these were from other departmentsof the hospital. They were mainly volunteers.The response of the staff was on the wholemagnificent, but levels of anxiety were high.Most were willing to take the risks associatedwith fulfilling their professional obligations,but were naturally unwilling to expose theirfamilies to these risks. There thus followed adramatic disruption in the domestic lives ofmany hospital staff. Some moved to hotels,Aview from inside the SARS epidemic SARS by numbers... [From: Donnelly CA, et al. Epidemiologicaldeterminants of spread ofcausal agent of severe acuterespiratory syndrome inHong Kong. Lancet2003 (May 7).

It's the body- work I can't get the hang of; it just seems so much algebra for the limbs. When themusic starts I immediately make an inhibition of myself, developing a paralysis so complete that bystanders look around to see who fired the curare dart. I suppose I could always learn. Trouble is, my learning style's against me. By nature, I'm one of those cerebral types who like to grasp the concepts and master the theory beforeattempting a new skill. It's pathetic: my shelf of golf instruction manuals is as long as myhandicap. But you'll perhaps understand why it was with mixed curiosity and trepidation thatI opened a recent BMJ 1 and found it was a special themed edition devoted to \u2014 dancing. Of course, being the BMJ, they dressed things up a bit. Not for them the diagrammed sequences of black and white footprints, or coy references to 'the lady and the gentleman'.Here, the dancing partners were designated 'doctors' and 'managers', and the key teachingpoint was this \u2014 it takes two to tango. But why a special edition? Well apparently, whereasdoctors and managers as individuals and in the separate privacies of their own professionalworlds can be lovely little movers, they've recently started going out together, and thingsaren't looking good in the dancing department. Initial sorties by the doctor-manager comboonto the sprung floor of the Healthcare Delivery Ballroom have been characterised byunseemly fumbling, clumsy footwork, and some very bruised toes. The problem, it seems, is that doctors think managers all have two left feet, and managers think doctors all have two right ones. Or, as the BMJ puts it, there is 'mutual distrust, personal abuse and blame', the protagonists having 'differing world views, steeped inhistorical rivalries that resurface at each encounter'. This should surprise nobody; managerscannot afford to become preoccupied with the needs of an individual patient irrespective ofthe consequences for others, while doctors can't put pre-ordained policy above the interestsof the patient in front of them. We are all familiar with the attrition in the stand-off betweenmedical and management value systems \u2014 the silly targets, the runaway drug budgets, thephoney waiting list statistics, the redefinition of ideals such as quality, effectiveness, and care. The solution, eloquently elaborated by the BMJ's team of dance tutors, is also familiar. Doctors and managers need to quit behaving like prima ballerinas and start hoofing it as aproper twosome. It would be easy to cringe at the clich\u00e9d banalities in mission but wrong; for (we are told) 'only a wellfunctioning relationship can deliver real service improvements.' Uh-oh. Did you clock the 'only'? An 'only' like that usually means someone is trying to slip a fallacy past you disguised as a truism. But surely no-one could quibble with a call fordoctors and managers to stop playing games and start relating like adults? Yet a fallacy thereis. Playing games? Relating like adults? Where have you heard this before? Of course \u2014 Eric (Games People Play ) Berne's Transactional Analysis , with its devastatingly insightful depiction of the human psyche as a Parent-Adult-Child triad. In a refinement of Berne'smodel, Stephen Karpman described a 'drama triangle', 2 where the players of psychological games rotate around the roles of Victim, Persecutor and Rescuer, scoring points off eachother as they go. (Doctors and managers will smile a guilty smile of recognition.) A corollaryof Karpman's analysis is that when two parties are in unstable role equilibrium, cherchez la troisi\u00e8me . And who is the unseen third dancer, neither the deliverer of healthcare nor its organiser? Why, the policy maker! The politician. Add 'politician' to the dyad of doctor andmanager, and (although there may be disagreement over how the roles are to be allocatedbetween them) Karpman's triangle takes on a terrifyingly accurate verisimilitude. And where are the politicians, the draughtsmen of the big picture, in the BMJ analysis? Nowhere; not a single mention; air-brushed out. They are the Teflon tribe, to whom noresponsibility may be seen to stick. They have control without involvement, power withoutexperience. Their accountability to the electorate is, compared with doctors' vulnerability tocomplaint and that of managers to performance review, occasional and perfunctory. So let us call for our politicians too to stop playing games with the NHS and get involved like responsible adults, on an equal footing with the other two parties. Come and join thedance. It would be an unfamiliar sight \u2014 doctors, managers and politicians, arms linked andhigh-kicking. But this much I know about dancing: it takes three to tango. References 1.

For those continuing togo home the hospital gave advice onmeasures (such as wearing a surgical mask,avoiding close contact) to minimise spread athome. I spent only five nights away fromhome after my exposures in the early days ofthe outbreak, but many of my frontlinecolleagues have now not lived with theirfamilies for two months. Stabilisation of the outbreak As the weeks progressed, our efforts toreduce infection rates began to be successful.For some time, we continued to see staffacquiring the disease in SARS areas butcareful implementation of infection controlprotocols and enhanced training led toreducing rates. All those involved in diseasecontrol were under enormous pressure tobring the outbreak to an end, which was allthe more difficult given the limited diseaseinformation available. Given the lack of harddata, there were heated debates onappropriate infection control measures,particularly in relation to the use of masksand gowns. There were also now outbreaks in other countries such as Singapore and Canada, sowe were now part of a very internationalproblem. By this time, SARS was perceived as a problem in our community. Schools wereclosed, restaurants, trains and buses wereunusually quiet, and mask wearing becamethe norm on the streets. Many flights in andout of Hong Kong were cancelled, and somecountries introduced quarantine measures forpersons arriving from Hong Kong. Thetourist industry has been devastated. This hasall occurred at a time when the Hong Kongeconomy is struggling to recover from a deeprecession, and the economic impact of theoutbreak on the local economy is likely to besignificant. The SARS outbreak now affectsthe lifestyle of all seven million people wholive in Hong Kong. The future At the time of writing (6 May), there isfinally some room for cautious optimism thatthe disease is being controlled in Hong Kong,if not in mainland China. The number of newHong Kong cases is declining day by day andfewer healthcare staff are affected. There is, however, a feeling in the medical community here that something has changed,and possibly forever. Never again willdoctors be so blas\u00e9 about their contacts withpatients, and in particular those with fever.We will continue to cohort febrile hospitalpatients in our 'infectious triage' areas bothin the emergency department and the wards.Doctors in the community will continue towear masks and gloves. Whether the SARSoutbreak is controlled or continues, it seemslikely to leave a lasting legacy in the waydoctors interact with their patients.

Before Barbara, primary care was a woolly exercise too, allgive-and-take with, thankfully,some humour. She has methodically and systematically taken primarycare apart and shown us all howit works. She has given uscriteria to measure it and cantell you what works and whatdoes not. She talks of the FourGreat Pillars of primary care:Access, Generality,Longitudinal Care, and Co-ordination. At the Spring Symposium she demonstrated the confidenceshe has given primary care bydaring to look the greatHospital Beast in the eye anddemanding, 'and what exactlydo you do?' I don't think her diagrams are as good as William Harvey'sand she is shorter than Iimagined, but I was there. James CaveONa glorious spring weekend I had some difficulty in dragging myselfdown to the Wills building in Bristol, palatial cenotaph of long-dead tobaccobarons. But after 20 years' membershipwithout attending a conference once, thejourney, as the Michelin Guide would put it,was worth the detour. Dress code varied from academic gowns (briefly disclosed behind closed doors afterearnest group discussion) via formal loungesuits to motorcycle leathers. One or twomembers present wore those trousers youunzip the legs from, as if about to burst intoa surf guitar break. No registrars came,perhaps reluctant to be so sartoriallyoutgunned. Some members loathe arcaneritual and dressing up, but the mace(topically resembling a chrome-plated anti-tank missile) was whipped out amongconsenting adults and rather impressed usall. Most memorable moments: David Haslam reflected on the East Anglian origins of hiscareer; George Alberti told us just what isbeing done about our collapsing A&Eservices, Dame Lesley Southgate (though amember of the anti-dressing-up faction)described what it was like to be transformedinto a Dame, and guided us into someimagery of what Presidents wear underneaththeir robes. Small groups looked at learning pathways with IT, teenage health, and the College'svalues, and they evaluated NHS Direct andWalk-in Centres, academic practice,diseases and non-diseases, and teenagersfrom a local school role-played seeing theGP, putting us firmly in our places. The BBC broadcast 'Any Questions' during the conference, with Liam Fox, FrankDobson, Anne Leslie and Jenny Tonge. Thebest question was 'Would the NHS copewith an epidemic of SARS?' The politicosopined earnestly that, yes, the HMS World' s Envy would as usual cope splendidly ... this was rash in front of a GP audience, as thequestioner then pointed out pithily that theNHS can't cope already, never mind SARS(cue applause). We were finally shown a travelogue commending the fleshpots of Bournemouthfor next year's Spring meeting; certainlyworth a detour. Stefan Cembrowicz WELL, the weather was suitably spring-like for my first attendanceat an RCGP Spring Meeting. It loaned an air of optimism to the weekendthat was a welcome contrast to the rathergloomy oak panelled rooms of the venue. Curious to see what sort of GP turns up to these occasions, I was not disappointed. Youcan see instantly why both the BMA and theRCGP have a devil of a job trying to roundup a collective voice. The expression'herding cats' comes to mind. There were cats in three-piece suits, cats in jeans, cats in Armani, cats with pigtails andearrings, cats wearing Manolo Blahnikshoes, cats trainers, leopards in frocks,civets with wigs, lions, cougars, cheetahsand a few others I hadn't even come acrossbefore. Trying to persuade the cats in mygroup to identify a shared view for the futureof the College proved a challenge. So did attempting to consider the implications of the changing workforce.One can't help but think Mrs Thatcher is stillto blame. She somehow epitomised the ideathat you should forge your own path. To hellwith the collective good \u2014 that was allwishy-washy socialist nonsense. Thisdoesn't sit well with the vocationalaspiration of the GPs of yesterday'sgeneration. But here we were, really tryinghard to identify some common ground. Itbecame evident that there was less of acollective vision and rather more of the crashbarriers either side, of guidelines, protocols,GMC 'What You Must Do Now' booklets.Not helped by the RCGP's own publication('How to be a Good GP') which makes mefeel about as adequate a GP as the 1950sGood Housekeeping Guide ('How to be a Good Wife') makes me realise that I am awholly adequate wife. Perhaps I should giveup now. Actually, my only real frustration of the evening was the parallel sessions. I alwayswaste at least 90 seconds wondering if theothers are more interesting/useful orwhatever. Amidst all this, there were many enthusiastic, entertaining, innovative, andbright folk at that conference who clearlystill harbour that unfashionable belief thatthe whole really is greater than the sum ofthe parts. Perhaps the College should aim tobe the conductor of an orchestral chorus ofcats, whose members are allowed to swapposition and/or instrument as time, the moodor the need arises. I am off to learn to caterwaul in tune. Kirsty Alexander ITwas a great privilege to attend the Spring Meeting of the RCGP in Bristol. Ihave been involved with the Wessex faculty of the RCGP since starting mySpring Meeting, BristolThe British Journal of General Practice, June 2003 511neville goodman vocational training in Winchester and find the contact very stimulating and rewarding.Sharing ideas and discussions withcolleagues who have far greater expertisethan I do has already broadened myapproach to general practice, and increasedmy awareness of issues around and beyondthose of patient and consultation. Thus, to find myself as one of very few registrars at the Spring Meeting wassomething of a disappointment. I chose toattend the College session and my smalldiscussion group consisted of almost theentire spectrum of general practitioners \u2014from registrar to retired. Enthusiasm forCollege activity was mixed. On Sundaymorning I was also interested to hear thatmany of the questions posed to the panelwere 'anti-establishment' and it seems thatthe College is under threat. Call me old-fashioned (and many people have), but doeslong-standing tradition not count foranything? There is a danger that traditionand establishment are being rubbished inorder to keep 'up to date' and attractive toyounger members of the profession.However, can we not maintain the historybut accept change as well? Change \u2014 myfavourite word. I was honoured to participate in the presentation for next year's conference, tobe entitled 'A Sea Change', which is to beheld in Bournemouth. After my experiencesthis year, I am extremely keen to encouragethe attendance of more registrars and GPs intraining. The opportunity to hear from GPgurus and contribute to seminars isimportant at all stages of learning forgeneral practice. The College is not justabout a membership examination, whichsadly seems to be the overriding imageperceived by young GPs. The future of general practice is at an interesting hiatus as we await the evaluationand introduction of a New Contract. Thiscan only be an exciting time to beembarking on a career in general practiceand perhaps we are privileged to be arrivingin the new regimen with little or noexperience of the old system and Red Book.The future is bright \u2014 the future might evenbe an Orange Book! Part of our role is toremain enthusiastic and maintain a visionbeyond the doubts of senior colleagues.Otherwise, how will general practice bemaintained? Barbara Starfield, giving theWilliam Pickles lecture, advocated thatBritish primary care is the envy of manyhealth systems across the world. Registrarsare part of the future of that care. Jo BoughtonWill Barefoot ask Emma?SO, helped by Richard Dawkins' latest book, how are we logical rationalistsgetting on? How have things changed since we last railed against the forces ofunreason? Not well, I'm afraid. The BMJ uses its careers section to let anyone with a missionwrite articles explaining how they were oncejust orthodox practitioners but now they'veseen the light. The Department of Health hasdecided, because lots of folk want them, towaste \u00a31.3 million on researching alternativetherapies. The Daily Mail scored for us by reporting that homoeopathy doesn't work, butperhaps the government doesn't read the Mail. Or perhaps they do but don't believe it. Inwhich case they have at least one thing incommon with me. Rationalism certainly hasn't affected the Barefoot Doctor. He continues to sully thepages of OM, the Observer 's glossy supplement. His branded wares can be foundin Boots the Chemist. He's written books,which may even sell more than RichardDawkins. It makes you weep. 'I read with interest', writes Rachel Parkes (OM, 27 April), 'your recent piece about the value of the gall bladder in decision-making.'And Rachel wants to know how she can go onmaking decisions after her cholecystectomy.Quite a poser, eh? Luckily, the Chinese,currently throwing herbs, needles and thingsto unblock energy channels at the SARS virus,have an answer. As they always do. Therelevant 'orb' contains the liver as well as thegall bladder, so the liver can take over itsemotional functions when the gall bladder isremoved. I wonder how quickly that happens?Laparoscopic cholecystectomy makes theoperation almost a day case procedure: willthe liver be thinking clearly soon enough? The Observer 's stablemate, The Guardian , is onto Barefoot. It now publishes a weeklyscience tabloid ( Life), containing a wonderful column entitled 'Bad Science'. The columnhas been going only a few weeks but alreadythe compiler has asked not to be bombardedwith Barefoot's musings. Except that the The Guardian doesn't even need to look that far. They have their own 'Ask Emma'. EmmaMitchell ('a natural health therapist') , 3 May) for a 50- year old woman who has noticed small lumpsunder her skin that are increasing in size.Emma reckons the most likely culprit is lessefficient fat metabolism brought on by themenopause, or sluggish circulation.

Nev.W.Goodman@bris.ac.uk512 The British Journal of General Practice, June 2003our contributorsalan munro PragueTHEfortifications of Prague Castle, on high ground above the River Vltava, protect not an ancient, squat keep, but a glorious, soaring, gothic cathedral. The symbolism isclinically precise. The earliest stones of St Vitus's heavenward aspiration date, like the Charles Bridge below it, from the Holy Roman Empire. Spanish Kings sought toestablish a pan-European theocracy. Prague was suitably in the middle of their plannedEmpire of God. Castle and Cathedral announce their divine, territorial ambition. From its beginnings, there was a Jewish community in Prague. Jews were a problem. A good Christian Emperor could not properly be too cosy with the race that begat andrejected Christ. On the other hand, their interest rates were competitive. The solution wasthe ghetto, where Jews were regulated and exploited, such that the word came to signifyovercrowding, infestation, segregation, and repression. But, there were Imperial funds for aCrusade or two, and later, for wars to suppress the Hussites, professors of an insufficientlyRoman brand of Christianity. John of Huss was burned at the stake in 1415. Inquisitionssubsequently were up to the same tricks all over Europe, wherever they could get off withit. In the 17th and early 18th centuries, in the religious fervour following the counter- Reformation, lots of gorgeously elegant baroque churches sprung up in still-CatholicPrague. Outwardly all curves and domes, the modest scale and subtle outlines of thesebuildings seem to betoken a gentler approach, in contrast with the Gothic heaven hooks; ahint of humanism, even restraint, in place of determination to impress, or intimidate. Butinside, the senses are assaulted by forests of swirling gilt ornamentation, from whichsquadrons of beefy, less than airworthy cherubs threaten theological saturationbombardment. D\u00e9cor by Tate and Lyle. Nutty cults were fashionable. The very beautifulbuilding of the shrine of Loreto houses a transubstantiated manger, or something like that. Nor was ecclesiastical progress in 18th century Bohemia confined to interior design. Rather than burning those of whom it disapproved, the Church had taken to breaking men on thewheel. This meant that a chap was attached to a St Andrew-type cross and another chapwith an iron bar broke every long bone in his body. Then, in an odd elaboration, the firstchap was transferred to a wheel, on which he was hung out until dead, or more dead. The art nouveau buildings of Novoi Mesto in Prague are reminiscent of the secular, austere, regular, Enlightenment fa\u00e7ades of New Town Edinburgh, with a good splash ofRomanticism. Here there is not only a sense of pride in an ordered, confident, society, but agenerous capacity to enjoy it to the full. In the very early 20th century, coal, steel andcapitalism made Prague rich, at a time when the enfeeblement of the Hapsburgs minimisedforeign interference. I loved it all. The coffee houses were a delight. It must have been agreat time in the city, though less so if you were a provincial miner or furnaceman, I guess. Much of the old Jewish quarter was raised to make way for the fashionable New Town. We were shown round the remaining synagogues, museums and cemetery by a quietlyinformative young woman. We were lucky to have her to ourselves, and she was generouswith her own family's history. Her father survived Auschwitz, how she did not say. Hermother was hidden by a Gentile Czech family for the duration of the German occupation.Now, her brother is determined to be simply, exclusively, a Czech. She is equallydetermined to be Jewish and Czech. She said it was hard to keep Jewishness going inPrague, there were so few Jews left. She was critical of the stridency of Israel. Her attitudesand opinions, so far as we had time to discover, were calmly humane, yet ... glistened withconviction. Under the exquisite ceilings of Prague's art nouveau concert hall, we mingled with the great and the good of the city in the interval, sipping something pleasantly white and fizzy.We supposed that many must have had more or less actively communist pasts, stern highpriests, perhaps, of the fourth great middle eastern monotheism. Then, Shostakovich's 10thsymphony, written in 1953 as the post-war Soviet reality asserted itself in Russia. It is along, hard, steady gaze into a totalitarian abyss. My tears would not stay back. In the airport, there is a black-coated, black-suited, black-hatted, black-bearded young man, closely facing a wall, reading with bowed head from a small book. He rocks back and forthrhythmically, as if entranced. I teeter between sorrowing, incomprehending perplexity, andgusts of rage.
