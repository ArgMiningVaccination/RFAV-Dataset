Each section has an introduction that describes the domain followed by detailed templates of each indicator, including reference to the latest availa ble data, at the time of writing. In some cases, the definitions are still unde r development. In addition, the annex includes tentative lists of the factors (including 'ext ernal drivers') that affe ct the performance of an indicator. Such external drivers are summari sed in a table at the end of this annex. Each domain introduction also describes two measurement 'them es' which are being considered - inequalities and in ternational comparisons. For inequalities, we explain pot ential measures that could be used to support the health inequalities duties proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill. For international comparisons, we will be considering what information is available that can aid our understanding of how Engl and is performing internationally. A separate equality analysis has been prepared that updates the previous Equality Impact Assessment (including the as sessment of data availabili ty) published with the NHS Outcomes Framework 2011/121. 1 Available at http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_122944 4 Domain 1 Preventing people from dying prematurely Indicator Structure 1.1 Domain 1, Preventing people from dying prematurely , comprises two overarching indicators : \"1a Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to healthcare \" and \"1b Life expectancy at 75 \", and seven improvement areas. 1.2 The improvement areas are of two sorts: Sub-indicators. The first four improvement areas relate to particular diseases (Under 75 mortality rates from 1.1 cardiovascular di sease, 1.2 respiratory disease, 1.3 liver disease; 1.4.i-vi one- and five-year survival from colorectal, breast and lung cancer and under 75 mortality rate from cancer), which account for large portions of the disease bur den amenable to health care. Progress in these outcomes therefore prov ides a useful initial anal ysis of what accounts for progress in the overarching indicators . Amenable outcomes under indicator 1.5 Excess under 75 mortality rate in adults with serious mental illness, and under the placeholder indicator 1.7 (which wil l measure excess mortality for people with Learning Disabilities), are also larg ely captured in overar ching indicator 1a. In this case, the reason for inclusion of separate indicators is concern that poor outcomes for these groups may reflect inequity. Complementary Indicators. Neonatal mort ality up to the age of 28 days is not included in the overarching indicator becaus e cause of death is not classified by ICD-10 code for deaths up to 28 days after live birth. Yet deaths up to 28 days and stillbirths, indicator 1.6.ii (Neonatal mo rtality and stillbirths), are amenable to healthcare, and therefore complement in dicator 1a. Indicator 1.6.i (Infant mortality), a shared indicator with public health, subject to final publication of the Public Health Outcomes Framework, is included to register the important contribution of the NHS to the care of all infants up to one year. 1.3 Deaths from causes consi dered 'amenable' to health ca re are premature deaths that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care. The NHS also contributes to reducing prem ature deaths from causes not considered 'amenable'. The inclusion of broader shared indicators, incl uding the mortality indicators for major diseases and infant mortalit y, reflect the contribution that the NHS can make to outcomes where there is shared responsibilit y with Public Health, subject to final publication of the Public Health Outcomes Framework. The NHS contribution will include encouraging healthy behaviours and uptake of screening and vaccination options, in addition to providing appropria te diagnosis, care planning and treatment. 1.4 Together, the overarching indicators and th e improvement indicators provide a picture of the NHS's contribution to preventing people from dying prematurely. 5 Work in Progress 1.5The main issues pertaining to Domain 1 upon which work is continuing are: Isolation of the specific NHS contri bution to: outcomes for the over-75s; to outcomes for infants; and towards surv ival following incidence of major diseases (as well as cancer). Work with the cancer registries to obtain data on the stage of disease at which patients are diagnosed, so as to control for sources of bias in estimates of NHS contribution to survival. Development of an excess mortalit y indicator for people with learning disabilities to complement indicato r 1.5. (Placeholder indicator 1.7.) Inequality 1.6 Outcomes for the overarching and complementary indicators should be assessed from an inequalities perspective. One option is to use a Slope Inequality Indicator (see glossary) capturing correlation of outcomes with small-area deprivation, for indicators 1a and 1.6ii. 1.7 Indicators 1.5 and 1.7 referred to above also capture an important as pect of inequality. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome 1.8 The individual indicator templates set out in this secti on in broad terms the contribution that the NHS can make to outcomes in c ontradistinction from external drivers of outcome. The most general such external driver in this domain is the incidence of the diseases themselves. Unfortunatel y, at the current time estimation of disease incidence is weak, so changes in incidence are not included in definitions. Hence, NHS performance must be assessed in the light of what becomes known about changing trends in disease incidence. Changes in incidence have a double impact: Increased incidence increases the number of sufferers from a disease at risk of death. Increased incidence dilutes the resources available for their treatment by the NHS. 1.9 Conversely, as incidence declines, outcome s should improve for a given NHS resource envelope for the same two reasons. 1.10 Drivers determining incidence by major disease areas are set out under each indicator below. 1.11 Contributions from public health and social care services are also set down in broad terms. For some such contributions, the impact upon outcomes, particularly disease incidence, is lagged by a num ber of years, so that at the time of incidence such impacts are beyond the control of the NHS. The NHS nevert heless has a responsibility to support the improvement of public health to ensure better outcomes in future years for people susceptible to or beari ng the relevant risk factors. 1.12 For other outcomes, the impac t of public health and social care is contemporaneous to that of the NHS (for example, the NHS, pub lic health and social care all contribute to 6 7 good outcomes through the course of matern ity). In such cases, the NHS has a responsibility to engage with social care a nd public health services to increase the effectiveness of its work. International Comparisons 1.13 International comparisons for outcomes in this domain are plentiful. However, definitions vary somewhat. 1.14 Generally, international comparisons of premature mortality fr om defined causes by ICD-10 code are either availa ble or potentially available fr om datasets published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Recent inte rnational comparisons of 5-year cancer survival for breast and colorectal cancer are available in OECD's Health at a Glance bi- annual report, and from ad-hoc academic research. International comparisons of infant and neonatal mortality rates are publishe d by WHO and OECD, but some of the international variation in these rates ma y be due to variations among countries in registering premature infants (whether they are reported as live births or not). In addition, some variations exist in the definit ions of foetal deaths, and care should be taken when making comparisons between countri es. There is currently no international comparison of premature mortality in people with serious mental illness. 1a Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to health care Outcome sought Reduced PYLL from causes amenable to health care. Updated definition Indicator description: Potential years of life lo st (PYLL) rate from causes considered amenable to health care. Indicator construction: Causes considered amenable to health care are those from which premature deaths should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care. The concept of 'amenable' mortality generally rela tes to deaths under age 75, due to the difficulty in determining cause of death in older people who often have multiple morbidities. The Offi ce for National Statistics (ONS) produces mortality data by cause which excludes deaths under 28 days (for which cause of death is not classified by ICD-10 codes). This indicator therefore relates to deaths between 28 days and 74 years of age inclusive. ONS consulted on a proposed list of causes considered amenable to healthcare in February 2011 and is currently undertaking work to update the list. This is expected to be complete by Spring 2012. ONS's proposed amenable causes ar e listed below but these are subject to change. ONS's consultation document can be found at: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about -ons/consultations/closed- consultations/2011/definitions-of- avoidable-mortality/index.html ICD-10 codes Condition group and included Infections A00-A09 Intestinal infectious diseases 0-14 A15-A19, B90 Tuberculosis 0-74 J99 swine flu) 0-74 J12-J18 hernia 0-74 8 Genitourinary disorders 9 Data source Reporting schedule for data source Technical issues remaining to be resolved Changes since December 2010 & Pregnancy, childbirth and the All Complications of perinatal Misadventures to patients during Y84 surgical and medical care All Indicator format: The exact method of calculating PYLL is still to be finalised, but subject to further refinement and consultation with experts it is proposed to moni tor the European age-standardised PYLL rate using age-specific life expec tancies as weights, rather than the number of years of life remaining up to a selected age limit of, say, 70 (as used by OECD) or 75 (as us ed by the NHS Information Centre Compendium of Population Health Indicators, formerly NCHOD). ONS: mortality data by cause and mid-year population estimates: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference- tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-199137http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-223131 Frequency : Annual (calendar year). Timing : 2011 data will be available by Autumn 2012. - Exact list of causes considered amenable to health care. -Exact methodology for calculating PYLL. The Department of Health (DH), in consultation with external experts, proposed Potential Years of Life Lost to amenable causes as a more appropriate measure than standardised mortality rates, as it takes account of the extent of prematurity, and is therefore more consistent with benefit assessment techniques for treatment and policy option analysis employed by NICE and by DH. Standardised mortality rates will be used for disease-specific impr ovement indicators 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4iv (premature mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory, liver disease and cancer) lest the use of PYLL rates for specific diseases appears to inappropriately prescribe clinical prioritisation between individual patients according to age. To the extent that those from disadvantaged backgrounds die earlier from these illnesses, the PYLL measure will be more sensitive to inequalities. Historical - There are several working lists of amenable causes, for example: comparisons Current working definition, with ICD-10 codes, from Table 10 in Nolte and McKee 2008, Does Healthcare Save Lives? www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/ecomm/f iles/21404avoidablemortality2.pdf International comparisons using this definition: http://content.healthaffairs. org/content/27/1/58.abstract NHS Information Centre Co mpendium of Population Health Indicators: time series for mortality ra tes from causes considered amenable to health care availabl e from 1993 to 2009 for England and geographical breakdown: https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/dow nload/NCHOD/Data/03D_171DRT0074 _09_V1_D.xls - Source data available as a continuous time series from at least 1993, enabling the construction of this indicator from that year, once the definition has been agreed. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome Health care contribution: Preventing premature deaths from causes amenable to health care through improved diagnosis and treatment. The amenable causes included in th is indicator are selected on the basis that all or most deaths from a cause (within t he age limits given) could be avoided through good quality healthcare. Public health and soci al care contribution: Tobacco use; salt consumption; alcohol fibre diet; physical activity; screening programmes; prevention, early identification and of risk factors including: >cholesterol, >blood pressure, >diabetes, >chronic C, TIA interventions; vaccination rates; quality of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in re sidential care (e.g. reco gnition of the symptoms of stroke), medication complianc e; teenage pregnancy; mitigation of social isolation; appropriate use of NSAIDs; statins; HRT; oral contraceptives. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, fuel poverty alleviation, env ironmental factors (e.g. air quality, radon gas), occupational risk (e.g. carcinogens), prevalence of co- morbidities 10 1b.i and 1b.ii Life Expectancy at 75, males and females Outcome sought Increased life expectancy at age 75, for males and females separately. Updated Indicator description: Period life expectancy at age 75 for males and definition females Indicator construction: Period life expectancy is the average number of additional years a person can be expected to live for, if he or she experiences the age-specific mortality rates of the given time period for the rest of his or her life. The period life expectancy at age 75 for years to 2010 is based on historical mortality rates for years to 2010.

Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes Life expectancy at 75 for single years will be presented for males and since females separately, rather than a three-year average for persons. December ONS do not produce and strongly adv ise against use of persons 2010 figures as the mortality experience is significantly different between definition males and females. 3-year average Life Expectancy figur es are published annually by ONS in interim life tables, but figur es for single years are considered preferable, even though they ar e only published every two years, because they convey more information relating to the most recent year, and in alternate years they pr ovide a more timely indicator.

NHS vs external drivers of the outcome Health care contribution: Extending life (at age 75 and over) through improved diagnosis and treatment, in particular by improving early diagnosis of long term conditions su ch as ischaemic heart disease, stroke, cancer, COPD, liver dise ase and dementia; care planning and treatment for those diagnosed wit h long-term conditions; and investigation and treatment of patients presenting with acute symptoms, e.g. of heart attack, stroke, hip fracture, pneumonia or with cancer symptoms. Public health and so cial care contribution : Tobacco use; salt consumption; alcohol consumption; drug use; continued physical activity; screening programmes; prevention, early identificati on and management of risk factors including: >cholesterol, >blood pressure, >diabetes, >chronic C, TIA interventions; vaccination rates; quality of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in re sidential care (e.g. reco gnition of the symptoms of stroke), medication compliance; mitigation of social isolation; appropriate use of NSAIDs; statins Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Socio economic status, fuel poverty alleviation, env ironmental factors (e.g. air quality, radon gas), occupational risk (e.g. carcinogens), cohort effect, prevalence of co-morbidities, under lying prevalence of a long term condition. Changes in the levels of these risk factors, including public health and social care contributors, can have a delayed effect on mortality. The cohort born between 1923 and 1940 have experienced greater rates of improvement in mortality ra tes than those born on either side over the past 25 years, and there is currently no evidence that these differentials are declining. This cohor t effect represents an additional driver of this outcome. 1.1 Under 75 mortality rate from cardiovascular disease Outcome sought Reduced premature mortality fr om cardiovascular disease. Updated definition Indicator description: Mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, ages under 75, per 100,000 population.

Public health and soci al care contribution: Tobacco use; salt consumption; alcohol drug use; obesity; 5 a day; physical activity; prevention, early identification and management of risk factors, including: >chole sterol, >blood pressure, vaccination rates; qua lity of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in re sidential care (e.g. reco gnition of the symptoms of stroke), medication compliance; mitigation of social isolation; appropriate use of NSAIDs; statins; HRT. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : These include socio- economic status, prevalence of co-morbidities. In general, changes in the external determinants will have a delayed effect on cardiovascular disease mortality. 1.2 Under 75 mortality rate from respiratory disease Outcome sought Reduced premature mortality from respiratory disease.

NHS vs Health care contribution: Early and accurate diagnosis, optimal external pharmacotherapy, physical interventions, prompt access to specialist drivers of the respiratory care, structured hos pital admission and appropriate outcome provision of home oxygen. Public health and soci al care contribution: Tobacco use; illicit drug use; physical activity; vaccination ra tes; quality of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in resi dential care (e.g. recognition of symptoms), medication compliance; mi tigation of social isolation. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Socio economic status, environmental factors (e.g. air quality, radon gas), occupational risk (e.g. carcinogens), prevalence of co-morbidities, immigration, genetics (especially al pha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). In general, changes in the external determinants will have a delayed effect on respiratory mortality. 1.3 Under 75 mortality rate from liver disease Outcome sought Reduced premature mortalit y from liver disease.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Socio economic status, prevalence of co-mo rbidities, immigration. In general, changes in the levels of these risk factors will have a delayed effect on mortality. 1.4.i-vi Cancer survival Outcome sought Reduced years of life lost from cancer. Updated definition Indicator description: One-and five-year relative survival from the three major cancers: colorectal , breast and lung, will be reported separately. Relative survival is an estimate of the probability of survival from the 17 cancer alone. It is defined as the ratio of the observed survival and the survival that would have been expected if the cancer patients had experienced the same background mortality by age and sex as the general population. Survival is a measure of the number of patients diagnosed with cancer in a year who are still aliv e a number of years after diagnosis. The methodology used to calculate one-year survival is the 'classical' or 'cohort' approach. All patients diagnosed in the diagnosis period are followed up for one year. The me thodology used to calculate the five-year survival estimates is the 'complete' approach. Only patients diagnosed in the first year of t he diagnosis period are followed up for five years; those diagnosed in late r years contribute as many years of follow-up as available. Five-year surv ival is the cumulative result of having survived during all previous intervals of time since the diagnosis, so one-year survival is implicitly included in the calculation of the five-year survival estimate. This is a robust method, and allows 5-year figures to be calculated timeously. Colorectal, breast and lung cancer s are defined in terms of the following ICD-10 codes: survival percentage for adults (15-99 years).

Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes since December 2010 definition Colorectal cancer survival data fo r England are now available and will be published annually alongside data for lung and breast cancer survival. Historical comparisons Historical time series available from ONS at: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/all- Earlier and more accurate diagnosis, external making optimal use of referral pat hways and available interventions, drivers of the support after primary tr eatment for lifestyle changes including outcome changes in diet, smoking and physical exercise. Public health and soci al care contribution: Breast and bowel screening programmes to support the early detection of breast and colorectal cancer; management of ri sk factors including diet, smoking and physical exercise; quality of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in residential care (e.g. recognition of symptoms), medication compliance, mitigation of social isolation. Other contributors and/or those beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, other medical condi tions, previous cancer treatment, family history. Sources of Changes to the indicator may be biased as a representation of bias change to the outcomes sought due to lead time and length time bias. Lead time bias may occur when improved screening results in earlier diagnosis: earlier diagnosis will itself prolong measured survival, irrespective of whether death is deferred and premature mortality is reduced. Length time bias in measuring cancer survival arises because faster-growing tumours generally have a shorter asymptomatic phase than slower-gro wing tumours, and so are less likely to be detected. Faster-gro wing tumours are often associated with a poorer prognosis. Slower-growing tu mours are hence likely to be over-represented in additio nal cases found through improved screening. 1.4.vii Under 75 mortality rate from cancer Outcome sought Reduced premature mort ality from cancer. Updated definition Indicator description: Mortality rate from ca ncer, ages under 75, per 100,000 population Indicator construction: Numerator Number of deaths under 75 from all cancers Cancer is defined in terms of the followin g ICD10 codes: All ICD-10 codes for Malignant Neop lasms in Chapter II - Neoplasms (C00-C97) Denominator Resident population under 75 years ONS mortality data by cause excludes deaths under 28 days for 19 which cause of death is not classified by ICD-10 codes.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Socio economic status, environmental factors (e.g. air quality, radon gas), occupational risk (e.g. carcinogens), prevalence of co-morbidities, previous cancer treatm ent, family history. 1.5 Excess under 75 mortality rate in a dults with serious mental illness Outcome sought Reduced premature mortality in adul ts with serious mental illness. Updated Indicator description: Excess mortality rate in adults with serious definition mental illness, ages under 75, per 100,000 population Indicator construction: Premature mortality in adults with serious mental illness (SMI) will be compared to premature mortality in adults in the general population. 'Adults with serious mental illnes s' are defined as those aged 18 and over listed in the Mental Health Mi nimum Dataset (MHMDS) for the current and previous two years. The MHMDS covers those adults receiving secondary health care for a mental illness. It is proposed to exclude those aged 75 and over to align with the other premature mortality indicato rs in Domain 1, and those aged under 18. Children under 18 are not covered by the main data source (MHMDS). There is no evidence that children with SMI are at particularly high risk of death by disease. The exact method of calculating the i ndicator is still to be finalised by DH in consultation with ONS and the Information Centre for Health and Social Care (NHS IC). Indicator format: To be finalised. This is a shared indicator with the Public Health Outcomes Framework, subject to fi nal publication of the Public Health Outcomes Framework. Data source - ONS: mortality data by cause and mid-year population estimates; - IC: Mental Health tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-199 http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference- tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-223131 data source Frequency: Annual for MHMDS (financia l year), mortality and population data (cal endar years). Timing: 2011/12 MHMDS data will be available by January 2013. 2011 mortality and population data will be available by Autumn 2012. Technical issues remaining to be resolved The method for linking ONS mortality data with MHMDS data is still to be finalised. The method for comparing the premat ure mortality rate in people with SMI with the premature mortality rate in the general population is still to be finalised. The standardisation method is still to be determined. Changes since December 2010 definition Mortality from all causes, not just from preventable or amenable causes, will be examined as all exce ss premature mortality in this particular group could potentially be improved through better quality of care, and through joint working be tween the NHS, Public Health and Social Care. Historical comparisons MHMDS data are not available for y ears before 2006/07, so the first year of the time series will relate to deaths in the year 2008/09. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome Healthcare contribution: Improving mental health care and/or the care of co-morbidities often associ ated with these conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke, respiratory disease and diabetes. Public health and soci al care contribution: Tobacco use; alcohol consumption; illicit drug use; obesit y; physical activity; prevention, early identification and factors including: >cholesterol, >blood pressure, >diabetes, >hepatitis B, >hepatitis C quality of social care in hospital and that supports timely discharge; quality of care received whilst living at home or in residential care (e.g. recognition of symptoms); medication compliance; mitigation of social isolation; suicide prev ention interventions. Health care also has a vital contri butory role in reducing the incidence of these risk factors for these dis eases for those with serious mental illness. In general, changes in the levels of these risk factors will have a 22 delayed effect on mortality. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Socio economic status, prevalence of co-mo rbidities, immigration. Sources of bias Changes to the criteria for inclus ion in the MHMDS over time could change the risk of death for patients included in the indicator and bias the indicator as a representat ion of the outcome sought. 1.6i Infant mortality Outcome sought Reduced infant mortality. Updated definition Indicator description: Infant mortality rate, per 1,000 live births. Indicator construction: Numerator Number of deaths at ages under one year Denominator Live births Indicator format Crude rate per 1,000 live births - (numerator/denominator)*1,000 This is a shared indicator with the Public Health Outcomes Framework, subject to fi nal publication of the Public Health Outcomes Framework.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : This indicator may also be affected by social fact ors beyond the influence of the NHS, including socio economic status , numbers of teenage mothers and/or older mothers (whose babies are at higher risk), and immigration (given that there hav e been shown to be higher rates of infant mortality in babies of mothers born abroad). Trends and variations in multiple birth rates and the inciden ce of lethal congenital anomalies and the extent to which women choose to have a termination or continue with the pregnancy until term will also have an impact on mortality rates. 1.6.ii Neonatal mortality and stillbirths Outcome sought Reduced neonatal mortality and stillbirths. Updated definition Indicator description: Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births and stillbirths. Indicator construction: Numerator Number of neonatal d eaths and stillbirths Neonatal deaths are defined as deaths 0-27 days after live birth. Stillbirths are defined as deaths in babies born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life. Denominator Live births and stillbirths Indicator format Crude rate per 1,000 live births and stillbirths - (numerator/denominator)*1,000 Data source ONS: Mortality Statistics childhood http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vs ob1/child-mortality-statistics-- childhood--infant-and-peri natal/2009/child-mortality-statistics--2009- stats-bulletin.pdf 24 1.7 An indicator needs to be developed Reporting schedule for data source Data for calendar years are updated annually. Source data for 2011 will be available in Autumn 2012. Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes For completeness, we are includin g all deaths 0-27 days after live since birth, not just those 0- 6 days after live birth, so that all amenable December deaths are covered by Domain 1. (Indicator 1a excludes deaths under 2010 28 days as these are not classified by ICD-10 codes.) Expert advice definition suggests that the small number of deaths between 7 and 28 days are increasingly amenable to health care due to the development of neonatal care. Historical comparisons Source data available from 1927: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-213277 NHS vs external drivers of the outcome Healthcare contribution: Care across the maternity and early years pathway, including ante-natal, intr apartum and post-natal care. Public health and soci al care contribution: While public health factors, such as mitigation of smoking, maternal obesity and poor maternal and infant nutrition, are important determinants of this outcome, health care also has a par ticularly significant responsibility in addressing these risk factors during pregnancy and in the home during the post-natal period.

Reduced premature mortality in people with learning disabilities. Outcome sought 25 Domain 2 Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions Indicator Structure 1.15 Domain 2, Enhancing quality of life for pe ople with long-term conditions, comprises: one overarching indicator, \"2. Health related quality of life for people with long-term conditions\", and six improv ement areas. 1.16 The improvement areas are of two sorts: Sub-indicators. The first three improv ement area indicators, (2.1 Proportion of people feeling support ed to manage their condition, 2.2 Employment of people with long-term conditions, 2.3 U nplanned admissions for (i) chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions and for (ii) asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in under 19s, relate to parti cular aspects of outcome for those suffering from long-term conditions. Progr ess in these indicators therefore provides a useful initial analysis of what accounts for progress in the overarching indicator. 2.5 Employment of people with mental illness is included in indicator in 2.2. It is nonet heless monitored separately as poor outcomes for this group may reflect inequity. Complementary Indicators. 2.4 Health related quality of life for carers is not included in the overarching indicator. Yet, the health of carers is greatly influenced by the extent and sensitivity of NHS and social care. Quality of life for those with dementia (placeholder indi cator 2.6) is unlikely to be properly represented in the overarching indicato r given the nature of the condition. 1.17 Together, the overarching indicator and t he complementary impr ovement indicators provide a picture of the NHS's contribution to improving the quality of life for those affected by long-te rm conditions. Work in Progress 1.18 The main issues pertaining to Domain 2 upon which work is continuing are: 2 Development of a methodology to captur e the NHS's contribut ion to preventing incidence of long-term conditions, as well as improving qualit y of life for those suffering from such conditions. 3 Development of a methodology to dist inguish genuine improvements in outcome from spurious effects of changes in casemi x; this might involve estimation of the mix of patients with different conditions according to the period since incidence of disease or condition. 4 Development of indicators for particular conditions and groups that are not well represented in the survey responses, including in particular: oQuality of life for older people wit h dementia, for which a placeholder indicator is specified. 26 oPreliminary work to fill other recognised gaps: - quality of life for those with learning disabilities - functional ability of children with long term conditions - quality of life for children and young people with mental illness. Inequality 4.6 Inequality in outcomes attributable to NHS care in Domain 2 may best be captured by reference to a Slope Inequality Indicator (see glossary) capturing correlation of outcomes (possibly using indicator 2) with sma ll-area deprivation. This option is subject to developmental work. 4.7 Inequalities are also captured by indicator 2.5, as mentioned. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome and sources of bias 4.8 See discussion relating to indicator 2. International Comparisons 4.9 International comparisons of Domain 2 indi cators on a strictly comparable basis are not available from WHO or OECD. However, t he OECD collects inter nationally comparable data on 'avoidable admissions' for asthma, COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes and diabetes comp lications for its Health Care Quality Indicators project. Many of these indicators are published in the Q uality chapter of the OECD's two-yearly report, Health at a Glance. The most recent issue was published in November 2011. 2 Health related quality of life for people with long-term conditions Outcome sought Improved health-related quality of life for people with long-term conditions. Updated definition Indicator description: Average health status score for individuals aged 18 and over reporti ng that they have a long-term condition. Indicator construction: Case-mix adjusted average health status (EQ-5D*) score for individuals aged 18 and over reporting that they have a long-term condition. It assesses whether health-related quality of life is increasing over time for the populati on with long-term conditions, while controlling for measurable confounders (age, gender, disease mix, etc.). Health status is derived from re sponses to Q34 on the GP Patient Survey, which asks respondents to describe their health status using the five dimensions of the EuroQ uol 5D (EQ-5D) Anxiety/depression *EQ-5D is a registered trademark of EuroQol. Further details are available from http://www.euroqol.org . Long-term condition status for indi viduals is obtained from 'yes' responses to Question 30 in the GP Patient Survey: Do you have a long-sta nding health condition? Response options: Yes, No, Don't know/can't say Responses to Question 30 may be influenced by responses to Question 31 in the same survey asking about which medical conditions the respondent has. Question 31: Which, if any, of the following medical conditions do you have? Please x all the boxes that apply to you: Alzheimer's disease or dementia Angina or long-term heart problem Arthritis or long- term joint problem Asthma or long-term chest problem Blindness or severe visual impairment Cancer in the last 5 years Deafness or severe hearing impairment Diabetes Epilepsy High blood pressure Kidney or liver disease Learning difficulty Long-term back problem Long-term mental health problem Long-term neurological problem Another long-term condition None of these conditions I would prefer not to say Indicator format: Number Case-mix adjustment will take these responses into account - this is likely to comprise factors covering age, certain long-term conditions, level of deprivation, smoking status and severity of illness, although we are still evaluating research by t he University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research ai med at identifying an appropriate method. Data source - GP Patient Survey (GPPS) The most recent GP Patient Survey covering 2010, is available on www.gp-patient.co.uk/download/Questionnaires/Y6Q1% 20GP%20Patient%20Surve y%20questionnaire.pdf From 2011-12, health status (EQ-5D) and the questions required for case-mix adjustment have been included in the GPPS ( www.gp- 28 patient.co. uk/). - Health Survey for England (HSE) An alternative source that can be used to corroborate this indicator is the Health Survey for England ( http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publications andstatistics/PublishedSurvey/H ealthSurveyForEngland/index.htm ) (Data from the annual Health Survey for England is available between 12 to 15 months after the end of each calendar year.) Reporting schedule for data source Frequency: Bi-annually from the GPPS ap proximately three months after the end of each dat a collection period. Timing: Data for 2011/12 will therefore be available in the Summer of 2012. Technical issues remaining to be resolved Further evaluation of research conducted on case-mix adjustment method by University of Sheffi eld School of Health and Related Research. Changes since December 2010 definition Details of the specific GP Patient Survey question to identify those with long-term conditions have been added to the definition outlined above. Historical comparisons The EQ-5D question was included in the GP Patient Survey for the first time in 2011. The question was also asked in the HSE from 2003 but this is not directly comparable with the GP Patient Survey. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome Healthcare contribution: Palliating symptoms and mitigating the progression of disease. Public health and soci al care contribution: Public health interventions that may mitigate di sease progression such as reducing salt consumption, tobacco, alcoho l and illicit drug abuse, obesity, encouraging physical activity. Prev ention, early identification and management of risk factors, incl uding high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Other contributions include the quality of support received from social care. The NHS has a responsibility to engage with social care and public health services to increase the effectiveness of its work for people who suffer from long-term conditions. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: The underlying prevalence of long-term conditions, socio-economic status and prevalence of co-morbidities Sources of bias Changes to the indicator may be biased as a representation of change to the outcomes sought due to unmeasured changes in: The average period that the su rveyed individuals have suffered a long-term condition, a major determinant of stage and severity of disease, and hence of health status. If the average period since incidence of the sampled population decreases, 29 for example through earlier diagn osis, the measured health related quality of life of the sa mple will improve without genuine improvement of outcome. Conv ersely, if the period since incidence increases, for example as improvements in care defer mortality, the measured hea lth related quality of life will decline without genuine deterioration of outcome. Readiness to diagnose or r eport a \"long standing health condition\", which might reflect change in tolerance of conditions by different age cohorts. For example, if a current cohort considers itself to suffer fr om a \"long-term back problem\" which an earlier cohort would have considered a normal part of ageing, the average casemix of the sample population will lighten. 2.1 Proportion of people feeling s upported to manage their condition Outcome sought A greater proportion of people aged 18 and over suffering from a long- term condition feeling supported to manage their condition. Updated definition Indicator description: The proportion of people feeling supported to manage their long-term condition. Indicator construction: The indicator will be based on responses to questions in the GP Patient Survey as follows: Numerator For people who answer yes to the Question 30 \"Do you have a long- standing health condition\" (cited in template for indicator 2). The numerator is the total number of 'Y es, definitely' or 'Yes, to some extent' answers to GPPS Question 32: In the last 6 months, have you had enough support from local services or organisations to help you manage your long-term condition(s)? Please think about all services and organisations, not just health services Yes, definitely Yes, to some extent No I have not needed such support Don't know/can't say Responses will be weighted according to the following 0-100 scale: \"No\" = 0 \"Yes, to some extent\" = 50 \"Yes, definitely\" = 100 Denominator The denominator is the total number of 'Yes, definitely', 'Yes, to some extent' and 'No' answers to question 32 above. Indicator format Percentage (weighted num erator/denominator) 30 Data source GP Patient Survey ( www.gp-patient.co.uk/ ) Reporting Frequency: Bi-annual in future. schedule for Timing: Will be approximately three m onths after the end of each data source data collection period in future, so 2011/12 data is expected to be available from Summer 2012.

Other contributions includ e TIA interventions, screening programmes, prevention, early ident ification and management of risk factors, including high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Support fo r those with long-term conditions includes that received from social care, such as supporting timely discharge from hospital, quality of ca re received whilst living at home or in residential care (e.g. recogni tion of the symptom s of stroke), medication compliance, mitigat ion of social isolation. The NHS has a responsibility to engage with social care to increase the effectiveness of its work fo r people suffering from long-term conditions. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: the prevalence of co- morbidities . 2.2 Employment of people with long-term conditions Outcome sought Improved functional ability, and ability to work, in people with long-term conditions. Updated definition Indicator description: Percentage of respondents in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) who have a long-term condition who are classed as employed using the Internat ional Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of employment, com pared to the percentage of all respondents classed as employed. 31 Indicator construction: For respondents in England, Numerator 1. Employment rate of pe ople with a long term-condition Number of people with a health problem or disabilities that they expect will last for more than a year AND who are in employment - either an Employee, Self-employed, in Government employment & training programmes or an unpaid family worker (this is the ILO definition of Basic economic activity) AND are of working age (ages 16-64) 2. Employment rate of population Number of people who ar e in employment - either an Employee, Self- employed, in Government employm ent & training programmes or an unpaid family worker (this is the ILO definition of Basic economic activity) AND are of working age (ages 16-64) Denominator 1.

Indicator format: Percentage points gap between the employment rate for those with a long-term condition and the working-age population. LFS sample adjusted to estimate the difference in employment of people with long-term conditions and em ployment of people in the population as a whole. 32 Data source Labour Force Survey (For information on the survey, consult http://www.esds.ac.uk/government/lfs/ ) Reporting Frequency: Quarterly. schedule for Timing: Datasets are made available by the Economic and Social data source Data (ESDS) service approximately two months after the end of the quarter. See http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=6715 for further details Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes The broad concept of t he definition has not c hanged, but details have since been updated of the LFS questions from which the indicator is to be December constructed as outlined above. The questions included relate to 2010 people identifying themselves as being of working age, whether they definition have a long-term condition and whet her they are in employment according to the ILO definition. Historical For comparable ten year series derived from LFS, see comparisons Department for Work and Pensions : Secretary of State Report on Disability Equality, December 2008 (see table 'Employment rate of disabled people in comparison to the overall rate' on page 29 of the report, http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/ sos-report-on-disability- equality.pdf ). NHS vs Healthcare contribution: Mitigating the progression of disease, and external supporting capability to manage their conditi on, specifically to facilitate drivers of the realisation of aspirations for employment. outcome Public health and soci al care contribution: Public health interventions that may mitigate di sease progression such as reducing tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug ab use, obesity, encouraging physical activity. Other contributions include the prevention, early identification and management of risk factors, including high cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes; the quality of social care including supporting timely discharge from hospital; the qua lity of care received whilst living at home or in residential care (e.g . recognition of the symptoms of stroke), medication compliance, mitigation of social isolation. The NHS has a responsibility to engage with social care and public health services to increase the ef fectiveness of its work for people who suffer from long term conditions. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control . Socio-economic status, prevalence of co-morbidities. The level of unemployment in the overall population is allowed for in the definition of the indicator, in that it considers only the gap in employ ment between those with long-term conditions and the overall population. Ho wever, it is possible that the 33 buoyancy of the labour market has a disproportionate impact upon the employment of those with long-term conditions. Independent changes in the suitability of work available may also affect the chances for a person wi th a long-term condition to find and retain employment. Sources of bias Change in the indicator may be bi ased as a representation of the outcome sought by changes in t he overall number and case-mix of those identifying themselves has ha ving a long-term condition, see discussion on indicator 2. In addition, this indicator may be bias ed as a reflection of the ability to gain work of the population with long- term conditions by changes in financial incentives (including those implicit in the benefits system). 2.3.i Unplanned hospitalisation for chr onic ambulatory care sensitive conditions Outcome sought Reduced serious deterioration in people with ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) conditions Updated definition The proportion of persons aged over 18 with chronic conditions admitted to hospital as an emergency admission.

Other contributions include the quality of support received from social care. The NHS has a responsibility to engage with social care and public health services to increase the effectiveness of its work for people who suffer from long-term conditions. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control : Prevalence of co- morbidities; socio-economic status. Sources of bias Changes to the indicator may be biased as a representation of change to the outcomes sought due to unmeasured changes in: the average case-mix of the people ca red for, as this will not be apparent from the survey responses (so case-mix adjustment will not be possible as it is for indicator 2). readiness to report a \"long standi ng health condition\" borne by those for whom care is provided, which might reflect change in tolerance of conditions by different age cohorts. 2.5 Employment of peopl e with mental illness Outcome sought Improved functional ability, thr ough employment, in people with mental illness. Updated definition Indicator description: Percentage of respondent s in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) who have a ment al illness who are classed as employed using the International Labour Organisa tion (ILO) definition of employment compared to t he percentage of a ll respondents classed as employed. Indicator construction: For respondents in England, Numerator 1. Proportion of people with a me ntal illness in employment Number of people with m ental illness in employ ment are those where the respondent has a health problem or disabilities that they expect will last for more than a year AND has Depression, bad nerves or anxiety or Severe or specific learning difficulties (mental handicap), or Ment al illness, or suffer from phobia, panics or other nervous disorder 39 AND is in employment - either an employee , self-employed, in, Government employment & training programmes, or and unpaid family worker (this is the ILO def inition of Basic economic activity) AND is of working age (ages 16-64) 2.

Indicator format Percentage points - gap between the employment rate for those with a long-term condition and the working-age population. Data source Labour Force Survey (LFS) Reporting schedule for data source Frequency: Quarterly. Timing: Datasets are made available by the Economic and Social Data (ESDS) service approximately two months after the end of the 40 quarter. See http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=6715 for further details. Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes since December 2010 definition None Historical comparisons Ten year series from 2001 can be derived from the LFS dataset. NHS vs Healthcare contribution: Improving the employment rate of people external with mental illness in relation to that of the overall popula tion, either by drivers of the palliating their symptoms or miti gating the progression of their outcome disease. Changes in average severity could result from the quality of care, which the indicator is intended to capture, as quality of care determines the speed of progress of a disease. Public health and soci al care contribution: Public health interventions that may mitigate di sease progression such as reducing salt consumption, tobacco, alcoho l and illicit drug abuse, obesity, encouraging physical activity. Prev ention, early identification and management of risk factors, incl uding high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Other contributions include the quality of support received from social care. The NHS has responsibility to engage with social ca re and public health services to increase the effectiveness of its work for people who suffer from long-term conditions. . Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Overall rate of unemployment, which could conceivably affect the gap between the two employment rates. The quality of working conditions can be a driver of both severity and prevalenc e of mental illness. However, it may also affect the chances for a person with a mental illness to find and retain employment. Sick leave ra te statistics can be a proxy for the quality of working conditions and therefore could be used to take account of this effect. Sources of Change in the indicator may be bi ased as a representation of the bias outcome sought by changes in t he overall number and case-mix of those identifying themselves has havi ng a mental illness or disability Average period that the surveyed individuals have suffered a long-term condition, readiness to diagnose and/or report a \"long standing health condition\", changes in the overall number and case-mix of those identifying themselves as having a long-term condition. In addition, this indicator may be bias ed as a reflection of the ability to 41 2.6 An indicator needs to be developed gain work of the population with long- term conditions by changes in that population's willingness to work , which in turn is affected by changes to financial incentives (including those implicit in the benefit system). Improved quality of life for those with dementia. Outcome sought 42 Domain 3 Helping people to recover from ill-health or following injury Indicator Structure 4.10 Domain 3, Helping people to recover from episodes of ill-health or following injury , comprises indicators both of adve rse outcomes and indicators of the effectiveness of care. 4.11 The three measures of adverse outcomes are: 5 The overarching indicators, 3a Emergency admissions for acut e conditions that should not usually require hospital admission and 6 3b Emergency readmissions within 30 days of discharge from hospital, together with one of the improvement area indicators, 7 3.2 Emergency admissions for children wi th lower respiratory tract infections 7.6 These outcomes may reflect failures in t he effectiveness of care in the total care system. (They contrast with Domain 5 outcomes, which are designed to reflect adverse outcomes attributable to the care itself.) 7.7 These indicators are comp lemented by indicators in fi ve improvement areas, which attempt to capture the extent of improvement in health following ill-health or injury: 8 3.1 Patient Reported Outcome Meas ures (PROMs) for elective procedures 9 3.3 An indicator on recove ry from injuries and trauma 10 3.4 Proportion of stroke pat ients reporting an improvement in activity/lifestyle on the Modified Rankin Scale(mRS) at 6 months 11 3.5 The proportion of patients wit h a fragility fracture recovering to their previous levels of mobility at i. 30 days and ii. 120 days 12 3.6 The proportion of older people (65 and ov er) who were still at home 91 days after discharge from hospital into rehabilitation services 12.6 Together, the overarching indicators and the complementary improvement indicators, combining indicators showing progress in r educing cases in which recovery has been interrupted by emergency admissions with t hose that measure positive progress in recovery provide a picture of the NHS's c ontribution to minimising the adverse impact of ill-health and injury upon the qualit y of life of those affected. Work in Progress 12.7 The main issues pertaining to Doma in 3 upon which work is continuing are 1. Development of the PROMs programme - we intend to expand the number of procedures and conditions for which PROM S data are collected. For example, a pilot for coronary revascularisation should start at the end of 2011. 2. Injuries and trauma - at the time of the first NHS Outcomes Framework there were no indicators to measure this outco me. There is work ongoing in the DH with a number of stakeholders to develop a new indicator to measure outcomes from trauma using data with in the Trauma Audit Rese arch Network (TARN). A new Best Practice Tariff is currently in development using the TARN dataset to 43 demonstrate quality of care. In the next phase, existing outcome measures will be tested for their feasibilit y in the trauma population. 3. A new indicator to meas ure improving recovery from stroke continues to be developed. The indicator to fill this placeholder was chosen as part of the Innovation in Outcomes Com petition that we ran in sp ring 2011. It will be a mRS (measured at the time of the stroke and at 6-months follow-up) as part of a new stroke audit (SSNAP). Data for the first y ear of collection is expected in April 2013. Inequality 12.8 Inequality in outcomes attributable to NHS care in Domain 3 will be explored using a variety of methodologies, according to the availability of disaggregated data. NHS vs external drivers of the outcome 12.9 The principal external driver of outcomes is the volume and severity of incidents of ill health and injury. Not only will changes in t he volume of incidents directly affect outcomes for indicators 3a and 3.2 for a given level of NHS effectiveness, volume will also affect outcomes for all Domain 3 indica tors by its impact upon the availability of resources relative to case load. International Comparisons 12.10 International comparisons of Domain 3 indicators or si milar are not available from WHO or OECD. England is leading the field in the collection and pub lication of pre- and post-operative procedure data in the NHS. There have been PR OMs trials in Canada, Germany, Slovenia and Sweden. 3a Emergency admissions for acute conditions that should not usually require hospital admission Outcome sought Preventing conditions from becoming more serious. Updated Indicator description: Emergency admissions to hospital of persons definition with acute conditions (ear/nose/throat infections, kidney/urinary tract infections, heart failure) usually managed in primary care. Indicator construction: The indicator is defined as the proportion of persons in England aged 19 year s and above with acute conditions (ear/nose/throat infections, kidne y/urinary tract infections, heart failure) admitted to hospital as an emergency admission. The list of conditions included in the definition has been reviewed for the purposes of the NHS Outcomes Framework. Therefore, it is considered the most up-to-date a nd comprehensive list available. The review process took account of the views of expert clinicians. The indicator is standardised by age and sex. 44 45 Numerator The number of spells, excluding transfers, for patients with an emergency method of admission and wit h any of the fo llowing primary diagnoses.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, fuel poverty, prevalence of long-term conditions and co- morbidities. 3.1 Patient Reported Outcome Measu res (PROMs) for elective procedures Outcome sought Effective recovery following elective procedures. Updated definition Indicator description: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for selected elective procedures (procedures detailed below) reported separately. Patient's reported improvement in health status following elective procedures, currently covering groi n hernia, hip replacement, knee replacement and varicose veins. The questionnaires provided to patients measure their health stat us before the procedure and 3-6 months after (depending on the proc edure). A comparison of these measurements shows whether, and to what extent, the procedure has improved their health status. Indicator construction: For the purposes of the NHS Outcomes Framework: EQ-5D - a generic health status measure (see www.euroqol .org/) 49 There are four sets of procedures for which PROMs are collected and these will be reported as the EQ-5D index case-mix adjusted average health gain only for the four separat e indicators for the purposes of the NHS OF. These are: i. Unilateral Hip Replacements (Primary and Revisions), ii. Unilateral Knee Replacement s (Primary and Revisions), iii. Groin Hernia Surgery, iv. Varicose Vein Surgery. All patients receiving one of the relevant Procedures from an NHS- funded Provider are eligible to participate and should be invited to complete PROMs questionnaires. PROMs data is collected for patients aged 15 years and above. Indicator format: The average health gain adjusted for case-mix. The responses to the pre- and post-operative PROMs questionnaires are converted into pre- and post-operative health status measurements by the application of scoring algorithms, where appropriate. The difference betwe en the pre- and post-operative health status scores is a measure of the outcome of the procedure. The risk adjustment model takes into account variables such as patient characteristics, age, sex and the presence of comorbidities.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, prevalence of co-morbidities. 3.2 Emergency admissions for children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) Outcome sought Preventing lower respiratory tract in fections in children from becoming more serious. Updated definition Indicator description: Emergency admissions to hospital of children with selected types of lower respiratory tract infections (bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia and pneumonia). This definition is based on that used for an NHS IC Compendium of Population Health indica tor on children and LRTIs. Indicator construction: The indicator is defined as the proportion of children aged up to 19 years of age admitted to hospital as an emergency admission for LRTIs. Numerator The number of finished and unfin ished continuous inpatient (CIP) spells, excluding transfers, fo r patients aged 0-18 years with an emergency method of admission and wit h any of the fo llowing primary diagnoses (DIAG_01 in the 1 st episode of the spell, ICD-10 codes) in the respective period: Bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia and pneumonia : J10.0 Influenza with pneumoni a virus identified; J11.0 Influenza with pneumonia, virus not identified; J11.1 Influenza with other respirat ory manifestations, virus not identified (bronchiolit is with influenza); J12.- Viral pneumonia nec; J13 influenzae; 51 J15.- pneumonia nec; J16.- Denominator The denominator is the resident population.

Updated definition Further work is required on the definition for this indicator. Data source Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN). See http://www.tarn.ac.uk for further details. Reporting schedule for data source Monthly Technical issues remaining to be resolved This indicator requires extensive development. The work is planned in two phases: Phase 1: Indicators embedded in new Best Practice Tariff (BTP) to be implemented for 2012/13 (see below). Phase 2: Functional and quality of life measures of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) and the Eur opean Quality of Life (EuroQoL) are being feasibility tested fo r this patient population. The development of a Best Practice Tariff for Major Trauma Centres (MTCs) will ensure: - Consultant led trauma team to receive patients - Full set of TARN audit data within 40 days of discharge - A completed rehabilitation prescription at discharge - Non-urgent patients are transferred to MTC within 48 hours TARN are currently establishing inte rnal processes for collection and validation of data for eligible patients. Precise definitions of the best prac tice criteria are in development. Changes since December 2010 definition There is an ongoing programme of work to provide a new indicator to measure progress against th is outcome (see above).

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, prevalence of co-morbidities. 3.4 Proportion of stroke patients reporting an improvement in activity/lifestyle on the Modified Rankin Scale at 6 months Outcome sought Effective recovery following a stroke. Updated definition This indicator was selected as par t of the Innovation in Outcomes Competition and the follo wing definition continues to be developed. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. The mRS score will be taken at diagnosis and at 6-months post stroke at a regular review. This could take place in primary care, elsewhere in the community, or in a hospital clinic. The method of this follow-up will vary but could be done in person at a 6-month review visit, via a postal questionnaire or by phone. It will cover adults with stroke aged 18 and over. The mRS consists of the following scores - Modified Rankin Scale Score Description 0 No symptoms at all 1 No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities 2 Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance 3 Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance 4 Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance 5 Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention 6 Dead Data source Sentinel Stroke National Audi t Programme (SSNAP). A weblink should be available for this new audit from April 2012. Reporting schedule for data source Frequency: Annual (financial year) .

Final details of the audit will continue to be worked up until this time. Changes There was no indicator for this improvement area in the first NHS since Outcomes Framework. The DH ran a competition to find a suitable December indicator to fill this gap (see further det ail in overview text). This is the 2010 winning entry selected and awarded in October 2011. The indicator is definition to be developed further in the coming months. The definition is largely agreed, however, development is ongoing and the audit will be piloted in April 2012 with an intention to start data collection in June 2012, data should be availabl e from April 2013.

Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Prevalence of co- morbidities. 3.5 The proportion of patients with a fragility fracture recovering to their previous levels of mobility at i. 30 days and ii. 120 days Outcome sought Effective recovery of mobility following a fragility fracture. Updated definition The definition for this indicator cont inues to be developed. However, it will be based on the following. Five reporting categories will form the basis for this indicator, measured at 30 and 120 days following a fragility fracture (hip only initially, vertebral and wrist also subsequently), as follows - 1. Freely mobile outdoors without aids 2. Mobile outdoors with one aid 3. Mobile outdoors with two aids or frame 4. Some indoor mobility, but never goes outdoors without help (i.e. 55 effectively housebound) 5. No functional mobility (bed/chair; wheelchair, etc) 6. Data source The National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) (see - http://www.nhfd.co.uk/ ) Reporting Frequency: Annual (national clinical audi t report) financial year data. schedule for Timing: Latest data published in July 2011 for the period 1 April 2010 data source to 31 March 2011. Data for this indicator is likely to be a bespoke extraction and could be available more frequently than annual, e.g. quarterly. Technical Data completeness for part ii of this indicator for follow-up at 120 days issues needs further work. Publication as par t of the NHS OF is expected to remaining to increase completeness. In the future , as data quality improves, it may be resolved be possible to focus on 120 day follo w-up and drop indicator 3.5i (30 days). The NHFD currently only includes ques tions on hip fractures, and not the other two common fragility fractures - vertebral and wrist. However, from March 2012, the NHFD audit is set to merge with the RCP's falls audit and expand to cove r the other forms of fracture suffered by elderly patients in a re -titled 'Falls and fragility fractures audit'. Data from this newly constructed audit will provide a better basis for this indicator going forward.

Updated definition Indicator description: i) The proportion of older people (65 and over) who were still at home 91 days after discharge from hospital into rehabilitation services. ii) The proportion of older people aged 65 and over offered rehabilitation services follo wing discharge from acute or community hospital. Indicator construction: This will be a two-part measure which reflects both the effectiveness of rehabilitation services (i), and the coverage of the service (ii). i) The proportion of older people aged 65 and over discharged from hospital to their own home or to a residential or nursing care home or extra care housing for rehabilitation, with a clear intention that they will move on/back to their own home (inc luding a place in extra care housing or an adult placement scheme se tting) who are at home or in extra care housing or an adult placem ent scheme setting three months after the date of their discharge from hospital. Those who are in hospital or in a r egistered care home (other than for a brief episode of respite care from which they are expected to return home) at the three mo nth date and those who have died within the three months are not repor ted in the numerator. The collection of the denominator will be from 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2011, with a 91-day follow-up for each case included in the denominator to populate the numerator. ii) The proportion of older people aged 65 and over offered rehabilitation services following di scharge from acute or community hospital. This measure will take the denominator from part i) as its numerator (the number of older people offered rehabilitation services). The new denominator will be the total number of older people discharged from acute or community hospitals bas ed on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Indicator format: Percentage of patients.

It will continue to be available annually. Data for ii) has not yet been published. It will be published in Autumn 2012 for the period 2011-12 (relating to the 3-month period to which the collection relates - Oct-Dec, with follow-up 91 days later), and annually thereafter. Technical Work is continuing to expand the measure to include individuals issues assessed only on health needs. remaining to be resolved Over time, we will aim to measure t he success of all whose condition is such that they would benefit from reablement/ rehabilitation services, rather than restricting measurement to those di scharged from hospital only. Changes This indicator has changed into a tw o-part measure, the rationale for since this is to capture the volume of rehabilitation offered as well as the December success of the rehabilitation service offered. This will avoid a situation 2010 such as has occurred in the past wit h the previous indicator where an definition area scores well on the measure having offered rehabilitation to only a very small number of people. The current measure has been expanded to include social care-only placements as well. Previously, th ere was a requirement for someone to have received a joint multi-disci plinary assessment prior to or following their discharge from hosp ital before going on to receive a rehabilitation service. However, those that were assessed just on social care needs would now be included in the data collection. The rationale for this change is that we should be interested in outcomes for individuals irrespective of whether or not they have had a joint assessment of need. Historical comparisons None 58 NHS vs Healthcare contribution: Working with social care to ensure that, external where appropriate, relevant and good quality rehabilitation services are drivers of commissioned for individuals on disc harge from hospital. In some the outcome cases the NHS, social care or bo th will be directly responsible for providing the rehabilitation service. Public health and so cial care contribution: Encouragement of healthy behaviours that support reco very, including reduced use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs, physica l activity, quality of social care at home and in care homes. Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: Socio economic status, prevalence of co-morbidities. Sources of bias Part i) is biased by the need/age of the individuals entering rehabilitation services. However, part ii) of the measure is designed to provide some context on this. 59 Domain 4 Ensuring people have a positive experience of care Indicator Structure 12.11 Domain 4, Ensuring people have a positive experience of care , comprises thirteen indicators based on patients' re sponses to surveys covering both their experience of care in differ ent settings and two measures of access to care in primary care settings. Overarching Indicators 13 4a Patient experience of primary care: o4a.i GP services o4a.ii GP Out of Hours Services o4a.iii NHS Dental Services 14 4b Patient experience of in-patient hospital care Improvement Areas 15 4.1 Outpatient care 16 4.2 Inpatient care 17 4.3 A&E services 18 4.4 Access to i) GP and ii) NHS Dental services 19 4.5 Maternity services 20 4.6 End of life care 21 4.7 Mental health services 22 4.8 Children's experience of care 22.6 Together, the overarching indicators and the complementary improvement area indicators provide a picture of the NHS's contribution to improv ing the experience of care, including reducing frustration and anxiety of not having ready access. Work in Progress 22.7 The Patient Experience Policy Programme, a collaboration between the Department of Health and NHS Northwest, has adopted an approach to short term indicator development that uses data so urces from existing national surveys (where available), and been guided by academic research to focu s upon dimensions of care identified as important to patients. The approach to Domain 4 indicator development is evolutionary. 22.8 Future work will involve refining surv eys and developing new que stions and measures to allow existing indicators to be replaced over time as ne cessary. The aim of this work is: to achieve better alignment of local and national initiatives to ensure the overall architecture de livers accountability, transparency and improvement 60 to ensure patients are ask ed about the breadth of issues that are important to them to ensure that indicators of the qualit y of patient experience adequately embody any evidence of differentia l importance to patients of different aspects of their experience 22.9 The Department of Health and NHS Institute for Innovati on and Improvement recently commissioned research from the Kings Fund and King's College London to establish what matters to patients, re view what is currently meas ured and provide examples of how feedback is used to improve the quality and productivity of health care services. Once published, the DH will cons ider the findings of this research, alongside other inputs in the development of: new models for assessing patient experience along pathways; future NICE patient experience Quality Standards; and the use of a common patient experience framework as support ed by the National Quality Board. 22.10 The DH will consider approaches to measurement both for the specific purpose of assessment of national level progress over time (including handling any remaining issues of changing gratitude bias and changing patient expectations) and to ensure that indicator development is informed by reasoned analysis of what matters to patients. Inequality 22.11 Patient experience surveys are specifically designed to capture the directly-reported experience of patients and service users, as opposed to capturing qu alitative measures of satisfaction or perception. All the surveys used in this domain are based on simple random sampling and are conduc ted using the highest of professional statistical and research standards. This includes careful processes for issuing reminders and checking response rates from different demographic groups in order to avoid any response bias in the results. 22.12 Inequality in outcomes attributable to NH S care can therefor e be evaluated across the indicators proposed for Domain 4, although it is necessary to co nsider the size of any confidence interval or 'margin of error' on survey based measures. Possible sources of bias 22.13 There is potential for results to be influenced by changes in gratitude bias and patients' and service users' sense of engagement and involv ement with the system. Where appropriate and possible (as set out in individual indicator de finitions) this is reflected in the methodology, for example standardising results to take account of the slight tendency for older patients to give more positive responses. International Comparisons 22.14 International comparisons of pati ent experience were published by the Commonwealth Fund in 2007 and 2010 (http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Surveys/2007/2007-International-Health- Policy-Survey-in-Seven-Countries.aspx ; http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Surveys/2010/ Nov/2010-International- Survey.aspx ). The number of countries surveyed has increased from 7 in 2007 to 11 in 2010. The measures used are not exactly comparable to the patient experience 61 measures in the NHS Outcomes Framework, but they can pr ovide a useful context for analysing the relative position of the UK. 4a Patient experience of primary care i. GP services ii. GP Out of Hours services iii. NHS Dental services Outcome sought Improvement in patients' experienc es of GP services, GP Out of Hours services and NHS Dental services. Updated definition Indicator description: These will be presented as separate indicators derived from the GP Patient Survey (GPPS) measuring experience of GP Services, GP Out of Hours services and NHS Dental Services. The indicators are based on the percentage of people responding Good or Very G ood to each of the following questions: Overall, how would you descri be your experience of your GP Surgery? Overall, how would you descri be your experience of out-of- hours GP Services? Overall, how would you describe your experience of NHS Dental Services? Indicator construction: Numerator 3 separate numerators, one for each part of the indicator. Each is the number of people answering Very Good or Good to the questions above. Denominator 3 separate denominators, one for each par t of the indicator. Each is the total number of people ans wering the questions above. Data will be weighted based on dem ographic data to ensure results are representative of the national population. This weighting will be based on a new approach developed by Ipsos MORI which will incorporate elements such as age and gender of the respondent as well as factors from the area where the respondent lives such as level of deprivation, ethnicity profile, ACORN classification and so on, which have been shown to impact on non-response bias within the GPPS. The GPPS is sent to adults 18 years and above. Indicator format: This indicator will take values between 0-100. Data source GP Patient Survey from 2011-12 onwards ( www.gp-patient.co.uk ). Reporting schedule for data source Frequency: The indicator will be based on aggregated data from two collections each year. Although fr om June 2012 onwards data will be published on a rolling six-monthly bas is, the indicator will only be 62 produced annually based on data for the full financial year. Producing the indicator on a six-monthly basis will mean that data will overlap with the previously calculated score. Timing: The 2011-12 survey will provide the first data, to be published in June 2012. Technical issues remaining to be resolved Approaches to removing sources of bias (see below) are being investigated. See introduction to Domain. Changes The GPPS has been redesigned for the 2011-12 survey, this was lead since by the Primary Care team in DH, in consultation with internal and December external stakeholders and ministers. 2010 definition It was decided to separate out the el ements of primary care (GP, out of hours and dental services) into three separate indicators, since they could not be combined sensibly. This was done in consultation with stakeholders and ministers. Historical Data do not currently exist in a directly comparable format, however, comparisons patient experience of primary ca re services has been measured through the GPPS before it was redesigned this year (see - http://www.gp-patient.co.uk/ ) Sources of bias The indicator may be biased as an i ndicator of the outcome sought by shifts in gratitude bias and/or patient expectations. 4b Patient experience of hospital care Outcome sought Improvement in patients' experi ences of NHS inpatient care. Updated definition No changes to the definitio n published December 2010. Indicator description: This Overall Patient Experience score is the average (mean) of five domain scores, and each domain score is the average (mean) of scores from a number of selected questions in the CQC Inpatient Services Survey. Indicator construction: Access & Waiting domain : Q9: How do you feel about the length of time you were on the waiting list before your admission to hospita l? (Scores: \"I was admitted as soon as I thought was necessary\" 100; \"I should have been admitted a bit sooner\" 50; \"I should have been admitted a lot sooner\" 0.) Q11: Was your admission date c times or more\" 0.) Q12: From the time you arrived at the hospital, did you feel that you had to wait a long time to get to a bed on a ward? Safe, high quality co-ordinated care domain : Q40: Sometimes in a hospital, a member of staff will say one thing and another will say something quite different. Did this happen to On the day you left hospital, was your discharge delayed for any reason? (Scores: \"No\" 100; \"Yes 0\". the answer to Q60 \"What was the main reason for the delay?\" is \"Something else\" and not \"I had to wait for medicines\", \"I had to wait to see the doctor\" or \"I had to wait for an ambulance\".) Q67: Did a member of staff tell you about any danger signals you should watch for after you went home? Better information, more choice domain : Q41: Were you involved as much as you wanted to be in decisions about your care and treatment? Q63: Did a member of staff explain the purpose of the medicines you were to take at home in a way you could understand? (Scores: need \"I had no medicines\" are excluded.) Q64: Did a member of staff tell y ou about medication side effects to watch for when you went home? not need an explanation\" are excluded.)

Therefore, this indicator will also take values between 0-100. Only the overall score is being proposed to be used as the high level outcome measure. However, per formance can be disaggregated by each of the domains, and then again at the level of each individual survey question that makes up the indicator.

Updated definition Indicator description: The indicator seeks to measure important elements of experience across the th ree stages of the care pathway: pre-visit; during the visit to the Outpatients department; and the transition/post-visit period. Indicator construction: The indicator is a composite, calculated as the average of five survey questions. Pre visit Q7: Before your appointment, di d you know what would happen to you during the appointment?

NHS Dental services Outcome sought Improvement in patients': -access to GP services; and -access to NHS dental services Updated This will be two separate indicators: definition i) Indicator description: Access to GP Services Indicator construction: This indicator will be based on responses to a single question within the GP Patient Survey (GPPS): Overall, how would you describe your experience of making an appointment? Numerator The number of people responding 'Very Good' or 'Fairly Good'. Denominator All respondents to the question. Responses are measured on a 5 point scale: Very good, Fairly good, Neither good nor poor, Fairly poor and Very poor. This is a new question in the redeveloped GPPS. ii) Indicator description: Access to Dental Services for those who have tried to get an NHS dental appointment in the last two years. Indicator construction: This indicator will be based on the single question: 71 Were you successful in getting an NHS dental appointment? Numerator The numerator will be all re spondents stating 'Yes'. Denominator All respondents who state 'yes' or 'no' to the success question (so it excludes those who state they 'can't remember'). Therefore, the indicator is the % of patients who have tried to get an NHS appointment in the last 2 years and were able to, the last time they tried. The GPPS is sent to adults 18 years and above. Indicator format: For both indicators data will be weighted for non- response bias based on demographic data to ensure results are representative of the national popu lation. This weighting will be based on a new approach developed by Ipsos MORI, which will incorporate elements such as age and gender of t he respondent as well as factors from the area where the respondent lives, such as level of deprivation, ethnicity profile, ACORN classification and so on which have been shown to impact on non-response bias within the GPPS. Data source GP Patient Survey from 2011-12 onwards ( www.gp-patient.co.uk ). Reporting Access to GP Services data do not currently exist. schedule for Frequency: Data will be published on a rolling six-monthly basis from data source June 2012 onwards Timing: The 2011-12 survey will provide the first data, to be published in June 2012. The indicator will be based on aggregated data from two collections each year. For NHS Dental Services data are not aggregated across the year, therefore there is no over lap between December and June publications. The first data that th is indicator can be based on will be published in December 2011. Access to Dental Services data currently exists, however due to the change in weighting (ment ioned above) it would not be possible to compare the current data wit h the data to be published from December 2011 onwards. Technical Following the re-design of the G PPS, there have been discussions on issues which questions should be used to form the basis for this indicator. remaining to These have now been agreed as detailed above in the definition. be resolved The question that underpins indicator 4.4i on Access to GP services is a single generic 'how was your ov erall experience...' question. In order to add granularity to this indicator and explain variation in responses, further analysis will take place of the GPPS questions that 72 may be most closely related to patient experience; statistical analyses will be used to determine the key drivers of performance in the generic question. The technical details of the analyses are being determined in conjunction with the survey provider, Ipsos MORI. Changes The questions from the GPPS to fo rm this indicator have been since selected in consultation with inte rnal and external stakeholders December according to an established assurance process set out by NHS 2010 Northwest (see glossary). definition Historical For GP Access this indicator is based on new questions in the survey, comparisons therefore direct historical comparisons cannot be made. For NHS Dental Access the weighting methodology has changed for 2011-12, therefore, again direct historic comparisons cannot be made as this would not be comparing like with like. Despite no historical comparisons available on a directly comparable basis, patient experience of primary care services has been measured through the GPPS before it was redesigned this year (see - http://www.gp-patient.co.uk/ ). Sources of bias The indicator may be biased as an i ndicator of the outcome sought by shifts in gratitude bias and/or patient expectations. See discussion above under \"technical issues to be resolved\". 4.5 Women's experience of maternity services Outcome sought Improving women's experienc e of maternity services. Updated Indicator description: Women's experience of maternity services definition focusing on the whole maternity pathway. Indicator construction: This indicator will be the average (mean) score from a composite of questi ons from the 2010 CQC survey of women's experience of maternity services focusing on the whole maternity care pathway (antenat al, intrapartum and postnatal).

B24: Thinking about your antenatal care, were you involved enough in decisions (Options: \"Yes, always\"; \"Yes, sometimes\"; involved\"; \"Don't know / Can't remember\".) Intrapartum (labour and delivery) C14: Were you (and/or your partn er or a companion) left alone by midwives or doctors at a time when it worried you? (Options: \"Yes, during labour\"; \"Yes, shor tly after the birth\"; \"Y es, during labour and 73 shortly after the birth\" ; \"No, not at all\".)

Postnatal D4: Thinking about the care you receiv ed in hospital after the birth of your baby, were you treated with kindness and understanding? (Options: Did you feel that midwives and other carers gave you active Indicator format: Individual questions are scored according to a pre- defined scoring regime that awards scores between 0-100. Therefore, this indicator will also take values between 0-100. Individual questions are measured in terms of scores ranging from 0-100. A mean of these is taken and aggregated to form the indicator. Women who have had a live birth and are aged 16 years and older are included in this survey. Standardisation Responses are standardised by ma ternal age, parity (number of previous births) and response rate. Data source The CQC's Maternity Survey (http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/reports- surveys-and-reviews/surveys/maternity-services-survey-2010 ) Reporting Frequency: The survey is currently run on an ad hoc rolling basis. schedule for Timing: Results from the latest ma ternity survey (2010) are data source published on the CQC website: www.cqc.org.uk/aboutcqc/howwedoit/involvingpeoplewhouseservices/ patientsurveys/maternityservices.cfm Technical issues remaining to be resolved None Changes The questions from the Maternity Su rvey to form this indicator have since been selected in consultation with inte rnal and external stakeholders December according to an established assurance process defined by NHS 2010 Northwest (see glossary). definition Historical comparisons The underlying data source is currently published (see above), but no composite indicator yet exists. 74 The survey was conducted in 2007 and 2010. See - http://www.cqc.org.uk/aboutcqc/ howwedoit/involvingpeoplewhouseser vices/patientsurveys/maternityservices.cfm Sources of bias Potential biases of the indicator as a representation of the outcome sought are controlled for as far as po ssible by selecting objective style 'experience' survey questions rat her than overall satisfaction type measures. This is complement ed by standardisation to adjust for mother's age and parity. 4.6 Survey of bereaved carers Outcome sought Improving the experience of care for people at the end of their lives. Updated definition The definition for this indicator continues to be finalised through the assurance process set out by NHS Northwest (see glossary). It will be a national indicator to measure the quality of care experienced by adults caring for those in the final three months of life. It is derived from a new national survey of people who have been bereaved, which has already been piloted. The questions to form this indicator are still under consultation, but will centre on one or more questions from the survey. The survey is for people aged 18 and over. The number of responses in each category will form the numerator, while the denominator will be the total number of responses. Data source VOICES survey of bereaved adults (see -www.southampton.ac.uk/voices/). Reporting schedule for data source Frequency: To be annual. VOICES has been in use extensively in a range of locations but this is the first time it has been used nationally. Data from the pilot have been published on the DH website ( http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publications andstatistics/publications/public ationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_128787 . Timing: Not yet known. Technical issues remaining to be resolved The selection of questions from the VOICES survey to form this indicator continue to be selected in consultation with internal and external stakeholders according to an established assurance process defined by NHS Northwest. Changes since December 2010 definition The pilot of the VOICES survey has been completed successfully and it is now being implemented as a national survey . It has been agreed that this is the appropriate source of data for this indicator. The choice of question or questions to be used for this measure is currently being finalised, as deta iled above in the definition. Historical comparisons VOICES has been in use since 1 993, both in England and abroad, and is internationally recognised as a valid tool for obtaining feedback 75 on people's experience at the end of life, as well as that of the bereaved person. This is the first time VOICES has been used for a national survey and data published. Sources of bias Potential biases of the indicator as a representation of the outcome sought should be controlled for as far as possible by selecting objective style 'experience' surv ey questions rather than overall satisfaction type measures. There is a particular concern to be addressed with respect to this indicator to ensure that views of carers adequately reflect the experience of patients at the end of their lives. Furthermore, the representativeness of carer assessm ent may vary with case-mix in ways that need to be explored. 4.7 Patient experience of co mmunity mental health services Outcome sought Improving the experience of adult (18 years and above) mental health patients. Updated The definition for this indicator continues to be finalised through the definition assurance process set out by NHS Northwest (see glossary). The questions to form this indicator are still under consultation, but will centre a composite of survey q uestions from the CQC's Community Mental Health Services Survey. Each question will describe a differ ent element of the overarching theme of the patient experience. Individu al questions scored according to a pre-defined scoring regime that awards scores between 0-100. Therefore, this indica tor will also take values between 0-100. The mean of the scores for each question is calculated for each trust to give the trust indicator score. The mean of the trust scores is calculated to give the national indicator score. Data source The Care Quality Commission's Comm unity Mental Health Services Survey - from the CQ C nationally coordinat ed patient survey programme. Reporting Frequency: Annual. schedule for Timing: The latest Community Mental Health Survey (2010/11) was data source published in August 2011 by CQC at the following website: www.cqc .org.uk/aboutcqc/howwedoit/involvingpeoplewhouseservices/ patientsurveys/communitymentalhealthservices.cfm The 2011/12 survey will be published around August 2012. Technical issues The selection of questions from the Community Mental Health Services Survey to form this indicator continue to be selected in 76 remaining to be resolved consultation with internal and exter nal stakeholders according to an established assurance process defined by NHS Northwest . Changes since December 2010 definition The choice of question or questions to be used for this measure is currently being finalised, as deta iled above in the definition. Historical The Community Mental Health Services Survey has been run comparisons annually since 2003/04. The underlying data source is currently published (see - www.cqc .org.uk/public/reports-surveys-and- reviews/surveys/community-mental-health-survey-2011), but no composite indicator yet exists. Sources of Changes in gratitude bias/expec tations may be an influence on bias patient responses, however, these potential drivers of the outcome are controlled for as far as possi ble by selecting objective style 'experience' survey questions rat her than overall satisfaction type measures. A combination of questions will be used as the basis of the indicator to understand the experienc es of both client groups in contact with Mental Health Services , i.e. patients on care programme approach (CPA) and those who are not on CPA. 4.8 Children and young people's experience of healthcare Outcome sought Improving children and young peopl e's experience of healthcare. Updated definition This indicator will be constructed fr om questions (to be decided) from a Children's Patient Experi ence Questionnaire. It is in the very early stages of development and the exact definition will be decided in the coming months. Data source Children's Patient Ex perience Questionnaire Reporting schedule for data source To be decided. Technical issues remaining to be resolved This Children's Patient Experience indi cator is in the very early stages of development. When the firs t NHS Outcomes Framework was published there was no children's indicator to measure their experience of healthcare. Th is indicator is the result of the Innovations in Outcomes competition that t he DH ran to fill this gap in the framework. Therefore, although the title and source have been determined, largely the detail of the definition, collect ion and reporting is yet to be resolved. Further development of children's patient experience surveys are planned, this will be focussed separately on the major points of contact they have with the health system. 77 Changes since December 2010 definition As explained above, there was no indicator for this improvement area in the first NHS Outcomes Framew ork. The DH ran a competition to find a suitable indicator to fill this gap (see further detail in overview text). This is the winning entry selected and awarded in October 2011. The indicator is to be developed further in the coming months. Historical comparisons None Potential sources of bias Through the work that is being undertaken to establish a mechanism by which this indicator can be measured we will seek to ensure that potential drivers of the outcome (including potential changes in gratitude bias and expectations) are controlled for as far as possible by selecting objective style 'exper ience' survey questions rather than overall satisfaction type measures. 78 Domain 5 Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm Indicator Structure 22.15 Domain 5, Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm, comprises two overarching indicators and six improvement areas. 22.16 The overarching indicators ( 5a Patient Safety incidents reported and 5b Safety incidents involving se vere harm or death) measure, respectively, the readiness of the NHS to report harm and so to learn from it, and the number severe incidents of harm. 22.17 Given that there is room fo r improving levels of reporting of safety incidents, for the time being overarching indicator 5a Patient safety incidents reported , will be seen as a positive indicator of outcome - reflec ting increased willingness to recognise and to address safety problems. It had been intended that this would be complemented by an indicator of reduction in incidents in eac h safety category in which incidents are reported. (This was marked by a development indicator 5c Number of similar incidents in the 2011/12 NHS Outcomes Framework ). 22.18 However, this aspiration is instead embodi ed in the overall level of patient safety incident reporting, measured by 5a, in conjunction with the development of a number of complementary indicators for each safety area in which incident recording is more robust - see below. 22.19 It is understood that reporti ng of incidents of severe ha rm as a proportion of total incidents is largely reliable, so the outcome sought for overarching indicator 5b Safety incidents involving severe harm or death, is a reduction in the number of incidents recorded. 22.20 Indicators in the improvem ent areas are of two sorts: 23 Sub-indicator. Indicator 5.4 Incidence of medication e rrors causing serious harm and death, is a sub-indicator of indicator 5b. Progress in this indicator therefore provides a useful initial analysis of what accounts fo r progress in the overarching indicator. 24 Complementary Indicators. In several ar eas of poor practice, data collection is sufficiently systematic (or plans to make it so are in hand) to generate reliable information regarding incidence even when little harm may have resulted. These practices represent cases in which patients have been exposed to risk, whether or not it has materialised. Reduction in t he number of such cases is sought. 79 These practices are measured by the following indicators : o5.1 Incidence of hospital-related venous thromboembolism C.difficile o5.3 newly-acquired 3 and 4 pressure ulcers o5.5 Admission of full-term babies to neonatal care o5.6 Incidence of harm to children due to \"failure to monitor\" 24.6 Together, the overarching indicators and the complementary indicators provide a picture of the safety of patients in t he care of the NHS from iatrogenic and other avoidable harm. Work in Progress 24.7 The main issues pertaining to Doma in 5 upon which work is continuing are 25 Improvement in the reporti ng of relevant types of in cident, so that a more comprehensive measure of harm done can be constructed, includi ng particularly harm arising in primary care settings. 26 The potential use of indicators being employed by the NHS Safety Thermometer (see Glossary) are under review. Two of the four harms captured by this source are venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pressure ulcers - which are already covered by indicators 5.1 and 5.3. Two further harms are captured by the NHS Safety Thermometer - falls and urinary catheter infections. However, id entifying the extent to which cases can be attributed to poor quality care, and avoidi ng perverse incentives, is problematic. 27 A proposed definition for indicator 5.6, which captures 'failure to monitor' for children treated in acute care, by the National Patient Safety A gency is under methodological review. Inequality 27.6 Inequality in outcomes attri butable to NHS care in Domain 5 will be explored using a variety of methodologies, according to the availability of disaggregated data for different indicators. 27.7 The domain as a whole addresses pertinent issues for a cross-section of client groups through indicators which are of part icular relevance to those groups. For instance: 28 Children - indicator 5.6 29 Babies and women cared for by ma ternity services - indicator 5.5 30 Elderly - indicators 5.1 and 5.3 NHS vs external drivers of th e outcome and sources of bias 30.6 The principal external driv er of outcomes is the volume and severity of need to be addressed by the NHS. Volume will affect outcomes for all Domain 5 indicators by its impact upon the likelihood of engagement with the healthcare services and upon the availability of resources relative to case load. Increased severity of need (consequent for example upon success in reducing mortality from chronic conditions) will increase the likelihood that an indi vidual will need care and complic ate the delivery of safe care. Conversely, improved public health could reduce demands on the healthcare system, resulting in fewer safety incidents. 80 30.7 However, no attempt is made to adjust fo r changes in the amount of care activity taking place in different settings, as the NHS is expected to take into account safety when determining appropriate care settings for different patients. 30.8 The indicators (other than 5a) may be biased to the extent that recording of incidents varies over time: although the indicators selected are sourced from reliable data, there is a perverse risk that improving the cu lture of reporting in g eneral may result in some spurious increases in inciden t numbers even for these indicators. 30.9 Other drivers and sources of bias are listed in the relevant sect ions of the individual indicator templates. International Comparisons 30.10 This year for the first time the OECD published international comparisons of indicators of patient safety in their Heal th at a Glance 2011 pub lication (published in November 2011). These indicators are based on AHRQ indicators developed in the USA and are not directly comparable to t he NHS OF indicators. However, there are some areas of overlap, e.g. rates of postoperative pulmonary em bolism or deep vein thrombosis 5a Patient safety incidents reported Outcome sought Improved readiness of the NHS to report harm and to learn from it.

Technical issues remaining to be resolved This is a proposed new definition s ubject to methodological review. Changes since The previous definition set out a proposed broad definition related to the delay in acting on deterioration in an infant of child aged less than 92 December 18 years, where the child died or suffered severe harm. The new 2010 proposal from the NPSA identifies the appropriate filters to extract the definition data from the NRLS relating to care setting, age at time of incident, degree of harm and incident categories Historical comparisons This is a new indicator - it may be possible to extract historical data from the NRLS - to be investigated. NHS vs Healthcare contribution: Improvements in the quality and safety of external care of children requiring monitoring.. drivers of the outcome Drivers of the outcome beyond NHS control: The extent of healthcare need amongst children (which in turn will be determined by a number of NHS, public health and external drivers).

The survey is conducted annually between October and January for a sample of patients who had an inpatient episode between July and August. It uses a postal self-completion survey approach, and is conducted among a sample of recent patients w ho spent at least one night in hospital. The survey covers both elective and emergency care patients, but does not include maternity, mental health patients or patients under the age of 16. The annual survey typically achieves responses from around 70,000 patients across England (a total response rate of around 50%). To reduce non-response bias, if patients do not respond initially or to a reminder after a few weeks, they receive anot her copy of the questionnaire after a further few weeks.

From: www.ahrq.gov Arm's length bodies (ALBs) ALBs are stand-alone national or ganisations sponsored by the government to carry out specific functions. The DH works with three kinds of ALBs: exec utive agencies who have responsibility for particular business areas - the agencies ar e still part of, and accountable to, the DH; special health authoritie s which are independent bodies, but can be subject to ministerial direction like other NHS bodies; and thirdly, non-departmental public bodies that have a role in the process of nati onal government, but are not part of government departments. ALBs operate in three areas: regulating the health and social care system and workforce, establishing national standards and protec ting patients and the public and providing central services to the NHS. From: www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/OrganisationsthatworkwithDH/Armslengthbodies/index.htm Best practice tariff Best practice tariffs represent one of the enablers for the NHS to improve quality, by reducing unexplained variation and universalisi ng best practice. With best practice defined as care that is both clinical and cost-effect ive, these tariffs will also help the NHS deliver the productivity gains required to meet the tough financial challenges ahead. The aim is to have tariffs that are structur ed and priced appropriately both to incentivise and adequately reimburse for the costs of high quality care.

They are typically short, self-completed qu estionnaires, which measure the patients' health status or health related quality of life at a single point in time. The health status information collected from patients by way of PROMs questionnaires before and after an intervention provides an indica tion of the outcomes or quality of care delivered to NHS patients. Changes in health status as measured by PROMs, controlling for variation in patient characteristics and the influence of other factor s, are attributed to the healthcare delivered to the patient by the provider and the wider healthcare system. This outcomes data can be used in a variet y of ways to assess the quality of care delivered to NHS patients by providers. From: DH (6 February 2009), Guidance on the routine collection of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), 108 www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalass et/dh_092625.pdf Period life expectancies Period life expectancy at a gi ven age for an area is the aver age number of years a person would live, if he or she exper ienced the particular area's age-s pecific mortality rates for that time period throughout his or her life. It makes no allow ance for any later actual or projected changes in mortality. In practice, death rates of the area are likely to change in the future so period life expectancy does not therefore give the num ber of years someone could actually expect to live. In addition, people may live in other areas for at least some part of their lives.

From: www.shef.ac.uk/scharr Slope Inequality Indicator (SII) The SII summarises the inequality in a specific outcome across England that is thought to be attributable to social inequality. It r epresents the gap in the outcome in question between the least and most deprived areas in Engla nd, to the extent that this reflects the relationship between the specific outcome and deprivation scores (the latter relationship being established by a statistical analysis of sm all area data for the whole population). It is also assumed in general that the relationship is linear (so that linear regression is the appropriate estimation technique). The use of the SII to measure social ineq uality (i.e. inequality attributable to social circumstances) relies upon an assumption that correlation with deprivation implicates deprivation as a causal factor behind inequality of outcome. In general, the extent to which improvement can be achieved by NHS inte rventions (through more equal access or through levelling up quality of care) or through public health interventions or through wider social interventions will vary from outcome to outcome. Special health authorities Special health authorities are heal th authorities that provide a health service to the whole of England, not just to a local communi ty, e.g. the National Blood Authority. They have been set up to provide a national serv ice to the NHS or the public under section 9 of the NHS Act 1977. They are independent, but can be subject to ministerial direction in the same way as other NHS bodies. From: www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/abou t/Pages/authoritiesandtrusts.aspx Spell In general, a patient's entire stay in hospital is a spell. A spell can contain one episode (see glossary entry \"Episode\"), or several epi sodes. For example, if Patient A is admitted for a broken leg, but while still in hos pital is diagnosed and tr eated for diabetes by Consultant B, there would be two episodes (one for the broken leg under Consultant A, and one for diabetes under Consultant B). If the patient is trans ferred to another hospital, dies or is discharged, the episode and the spell end. The vast majority of spells contain only one episode. From: www.hesonline.nhs.uk/Ease/servlet/C ontentServer?siteID= 1937&categoryID=1072 Standardised mortality rates (for age or gender) Populations differ in their demographic com position and these differences should be considered when comparing mortality rates or other health indicators. Age- or gender- specific rates for an event (e.g. deaths) are t he proportion of events in a specific age group or for each gender. To compare populations, age- or gender-specific rates are applied to a single population structure. T here are two approaches to such standardisation: direct and indirect, both of which use a standard populati on structure, such as that of the WHO European standard population.
