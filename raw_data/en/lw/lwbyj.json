In the case of Covid certain things are obvious today. Every system of medicine has its strengths. These strengths become weaknesses owing to the closed minds of practitioners who say my way or the highway. Everyone from allopathy to homeopaths are guilty of this. However the Hippocratic Oath all doctors take adheres them to the healing of mankind and not one system of medicine. What we should be doing is examining all possible solutions under the microscope of clinical evidence. In the case of Covid certain things are obvious today. For starters the current allopathic system of medicine is unable to cope. It has nothing that is directly antiviral against coronavirus and hence patients sit at home letting the virus grow until it is already too late. Natural medicine however has shown direct action against the virus. Artemisia for example has in vitro data showing it breaks the bond Covid makes to a cell. Other plants like alpina galanga and echinacea have now been studied to molecularly dock into the virus. Immunofree and reginmune combine these plants synergistically along with vitamins and amino acids well established for immuno modulation. The proof of these methods is evident in the results seen in comparative randomized clinical trials as these two products have shown significant improvement over the current pharma sop in covid treatment with no adverse events. Hence it is time for all Doctors and Legislators to incorporate these precedent setting natural treatments into their first line of defense against covid. The sp02 level improvements seen in covid patients can possibly eliminate the need for oxygen amongst a significant number of patients. Furthermore reginmune and immunofree virologically cured 88 percent of patients in 5 days and can hence double India's hospital capacity once used. Looking at big data from China, Thailand and Africa one can also see the large scale effectiveness of similar herbal formulas. All countries that used them have ended the covid wave. They have also kept mortality at under 1 percent. The system of medicine that couldn't cure a cold and said a cold can't be cured has hijacked medicine. Everything we used to cure colds has been forgotten. At the start of the pandemic all were open to Ayurveda. By the end fear psychosis has taken over and people only want vaccines and pharma regardless of how ineffective they have been for these kind of viruses. Flu vaccine been around 70 years and hasn't stopped the flu. Hence the sooner we adopt natural medicine for Covid the sooner we will see it go away. This has already been done in china and Madagascar. This isn't just the best way today. It is possibly the only way forward. The quicker we accept the faster we will recover from this crippling wave of Covid.
