Shamos ROGER KLARE 53 Bizarre Beliefs by Simon Hoggart and Mike Hutchinson GORDON STEIN 54 ON THE COVER: Illustration by Gerald Fried Skepticism, Reality, and Science Fiction Many of today's scientists credit science fiction with stimulating their early interest in science. The same is true with some science journalists. I'm one of them. With me it was Heinlein. Bradbury. Clarke. Asimov, Bester. Ballard, Blish, Van Vogt (among many others then and since), and their illustrious predecessors Verne and Wells. They stimu\u00ad lated the imagination and enlarged the world of possibilities, using scientific concepts to ask. \"What if?\" Science fiction has always applied hard science, soft science, and squishy-soft paranormal concepts in exploring future possible technologies and societies. What is the science fiction writer's role and responsibility, if any, in distinguishing between fantasy and reality, possibility and probability, meaning and mcaninglcssncss\u2014between exploring real possibilities and pos\u00ad sibly planting the seeds of paranormal belief? These ate fascinating questions, and in this issue we consider diem. Writer Eugene R. Stewart and distinguished science fiction novelists Greg Beat, Frederik Pohl, and Hal Clement each address the issues in their own way. \"Art, as well as science, tries to find meaning; and science fiction in particulai tries to make the search rational, understandable, and communicable, by thinking ahead, considering alter\u00ad natives, and trying to plan for a realistic mental attitude toward change and adaptation,\" writes Stewart in his lead essay. But he also criticizes some science fiction: \"Gullibility, laziness, and self-delusion, even hoax and fraud, divert some writers from real science, which might require some difficult research, toward the false claims and fake magic of quick-and-dirty wonder\u00ad ments that can be sewn of whole cloth.\" Bear. Pohl, and Clement are renowned for their \"hard science fiction\"\u2014using scienrifk concepts and ptinciples tealistically in their fiction. \"Science fiction writing, at its finest, Is an enormous leap of skeptical imagination,\" writes Bear. \"The art is in choosing which impossibilities to shatter, which future advancements to promote to reality.\" According to Pohl. \"What science fiction can profitably do to counteract superstition is to explore the wonders of real scientific possibilities. . . . But that is precisely what a great many science fiction writers have been doing ... for the last half-century and more.\" Clement describes how \"science fiction plays a demonstrable pan in the development of human ideas,\" starting at the most speculative end of the branch and extending out into the area of hypothesis. We would be interested in heating from other science fiction writers\u2014and their readers\u2014 on the same topic. It's one of those wonderful coincidences (not synchronicity!), but in our Forum section in this issue we also represent Jane Haddam's thoughtful essay \"An, Reason, and Reality,\" asking some of the same kinds of questions about literary fiction. A detective novelist, she wonders why some of today's most respected literary fiction writers arc gratuitously inserting paranor\u00ad mal themes into their books without even attempting to justify them. It's something novelists of the hard-nosed detective genre could never get away with, she says. If you are at all concerned about conspiracy theories, militias, controversial claims of repressed memories of ritual cult abuse brought out under therapy, and the interaction of all these with paranoia and political world views (the Illuminati and the New World Order, for example), carefully read Evan Harrington's in-depth article in this issue, \"Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia: Notes from a Mind-Control Conference.\" It's sobering.

Stein The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER is the official journal of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. an international organization. 4 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER WORLD HIUHI CONGRESS Something for Everyone at World Skeptics Congress It began with a stirring live symphonic performance of Gustav Hoist's The Planets beneath a striking video of spacecraft imagery of the planets and ended with Steve Allen at the piano banging out some boogie-woogie. Between the rousing musical end- points, audiences were treated to riiree days of packed scientific and scholarly presentations on everything from anti- science and alternative health cures to homeopathy, parapsychology, UFOl- ogy, and the mechanisms of self-decep\u00ad tion. The first World Skeptics Con\u00ad gress\u2014also the twentieth-anniversary conference of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, \"Science in the Age of (Mis)Information\"\u2014had a little something for everyone. There was a surprise announce\u00ad ment that asteroids had been named after CSICOP and its founder, Paul Kurtz (see page 8). There was a lively lunchrime question-and-answer inter\u00ad change between Chris Carter, the cre\u00ad ator of the immensely popular X-Files television show, and an audience of skeptics ranging from admiring fans to critics worried that the Fox network drama promotes paranormal beliefs. The conference even featured a surprise visit from Charles Darwin (persuasively played in black cape by biology profes\u00ad sor Clyde Herreid), introducing and briefly upstaging his twentieth-century evolutionary disciple, Stephen Jay Gould. A Council on Media Integrity (sec page 8) was created, a twentieth-birth\u00ad day cake cut, awards presented, confer\u00ad ence T-shirts sold, and a second World Skeptics Congress initiated (in Heidel\u00ad berg, Germany, probably June or July 1998). At least 1,200 people from twenty- four countries attended all or parts of \\ June 20-23, 1996 Amhe*. New Kxt USA <v> <? the congress\u2014by far the largest crowd for any CSICOP conference. (The local newspaper estimated that 2,000 attended Gould's lecture in the university gym\u00ad nasium.) They heard some seventy speakers, themselves a representative roster of internationalism: Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. There was a Nobel laure\u00ad ate (Leon Lederman), two MacArthur Fellows (James Randi and Stephen Jay Gould), an Emmy winner (Chris Carter), and the recently knighted if chronically rumpled (a point amus\u00ad ingly made by Randi in his introduc\u00ad tion) editor emeritus of Nature, John Maddox. The media were there in force as well. The Associated Press sent out an opening-day story. National Public Radios Science Friday did two hours ive from the conference. WGN radio Chicago, Australian radio, C-SPAN, and the BBC were there; CNN did something, NBC's Today Show men- ' tioned the conference, as did David Letterman on his CBS program Late Show, and there was an array of ^ other print reporters and writers ^ from round the world. The Boston Globe did a big feature (July 1), and the New York Times published cxerpts from some of the conference papers (July 7). We begin our coverage of the con\u00ad gress in this issue with Wendy Grossman's lively, impressionistic account and commentary, and several short pieces. Look for more in our next issue and for articles based on several of the most prominent presentations later. \u2014Kendrick Frazier, Editor SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 5 CONCRESS Four Days with the Skeptics: CSICOP 20th-Anniversary Conference Focuses on Science, Skepticism, Media Misinformation WENDY GROSSMAN The guy in the front of the airline taxi from JFK airport to La Guardia was tired: he'd traveled all die way from Costa Rica that day and didn't appreciate the four-hour delay and change of airport due to bad weather. He wasn't too thrilled two hours later either, when the Amherst, New York, Red Roof Inn told him they were sold out. That's when it dawned on me that we were going to the same place. \"You here for the CSICOP confer\u00ad ence?\" I said. gress.\" Aha. CSICOP's conference (\"Science in the Age of (Mis)Information,\" June 20-23)\u2014 billed as the first World Skeptics Congress\u2014drew at least 1,200 people, according to Barry Karr, CSICOP's executive director. The couple at die table next to mine at breakfast the next morning telling the waitress they were going to see Steve Allen at die Saturday night banquet were two of diem. The Danish reporter sitting at die Red Roof Inn waiting for a taxi was another. There were also many dedicated skep\u00ad tics from Germany, die U.K., Belgium, all over the wodd, in fact. And so diey came and (most of them) were scooped up by old yellow school buses and taken to die State University of New York at Buffalo, where Paul Kurtz, CSICOP's founder and chairman, opened die proceedings with the help of four other speakers. While diey were talking, forty black- clad members of the Buffalo Phil\u00ad harmonic waited on stage to play four sections from Hoist's The Planets. Three main themes reappeared over and over again throughout the confer\u00ad ence: First, the mass media are, for many people, the primary form of edu\u00ad cation, and these same mass media do not understand science or present it well. Second, antiscience is growing throughout die land. And, finally, it matters. Or, as Australian journalist Phillip Adams put it, \"We have to deal with die fact that we're involved with the sort of madness that destroys societies, not just makes skeptics irritated.\" At the opening news conference, a reporter from Buffalo radio station WBFO asked the panel why a program on alien abductions is harmful\u2014it's not, after all, 60 Minutes or the evening news. John Maddox, editor emeritus of Nature, pointed out, and psychologist Ray Hyman said later, over lunch, the same diing: it is no longer possible to judge a program or news story by its source. Maddox mentioned the BBC; Hyman mentioned the New York Times. Both are correct in dieir exam\u00ad ples. I've seen an astrologer profiled in die New York Times Magazine, and I've seen plenty of uncritical programs on the BBC about homeopathy and even spontaneous human combustion in addition to the hour-long program on UFOs Maddox mentions. Maddox and Hyman are echoed the next day by Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who adds that there is no TV equiva\u00ad lent of the divisions in book stores between fiction and nonfiction sec\u00ad tions. Carter, who got faxes warning him not to appear in front of such a hostile audience, found himself among auto\u00ad graph-seeking fans. His motives were simple when they started the show: \"I just wanted to scare the pants off peo\u00ad ple every Friday night.\" But now Maddox goes on to say that he thinks the problem started with die end of die Cold War: \"Until then, scientists were respected.\" Now there's increasing acceptance of the notion that science is just another point of view. I am suddenly re-experiencing die generation gap. I am forty-two, and in my lifetime, everything has been questioned. The world is not what anyone thought it was going to be when this over-fifty panel was growing up. The generation on whose cusp I coast through life Wendy M. Grossman is a freelance writer based in London. She can be reached at wendygQcix. compulink. co. uk. 6 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER CONGRESS learned from the protests against the Vietnam War and the Watergate hear\u00ad ings that no authority could be trusted absolutely. Our generation became folk singers instead of middle managers, and seeded the environmental move\u00ad ment. Our images of science include the worst horrors of primate and med\u00ad ical research and Chernobyl as well as the shimmering, Michelin-man shape of Neil Armstrong stepping down onto the surface of the moon. No one has the respect they had before the 1960s, not teachers, religious figures, politi\u00ad cians, royalty, doctors, or lawyers. Why should scientists be any different? Leon Lederman, the Nobel-laureate physicist, in his speech that evening, touched on this when he said that the more you \"raise scientific understand\u00ad ing the more people may criticize it. I think science needs the criticism that results from honest education, but it may turn into skepticism about the usefulness of science.\" After all, as mathematician Norman Levitt (co-author of Higher Super\u00ad stition) argued the next day, \"We will be seen as guiding people to a place which is bleak and cheerless because it is indeed bleak and cheerless. But we make it a tougher sell than it needs to be.\" Skeptics, he observed, \"are inclined to be show-offs about our tough-mindedness, perhaps as a com\u00ad pensatory gesture. But it's dangerous when you're trying to increase respect and attention.\" We need, Levitt wound up, \"to understand ourselves as well as the masses out there.\" Stephen Jay Gould, similarly, in his keynote address ram\u00ad bled through stories to show the social context in which science operates; sci\u00adence is a human activity, if a self-cor\u00ad recting one. The official news of the conference is CSICOP's new Council for Media Integrity. The mission of the Council is to counter more effectively some of the wont and most irresponsible TV pro\u00ad gramming. This was announced to a scattering of journalists by seven prominent skeptics: Kurtz, Adams, Dutch astronomer Cornells de Jager, physician Wallace Sampson, Joe Nickell, John Maddox, Kendrick Frazier, and communications re\u00ad searcher George Gerbner. All but Joe Nickell are over fifty. All are male. I personally probably watch more TV in a week than they do combined.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 7 CSICOP Announces Creation of Council to Monitor Paranormal, Pseudoscience on TV The establishment of a new Council for Media Integrity was announced June 20 at the opening news conference of the first World Skeptics Congress. The Council is sponsored by the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). The charter members of the Council include many distinguished figures from the world of science and academia: Glenn T. Seaborg, Nobel Prize-winner for chem\u00ad istry; George Gerbner, professor of communications. University of Pennsylvania; Stephen Jay Gould, zoologist, Harvard University; Gerald Holton, physicist, Harvard University; Sir John Maddox, editor emeritus. Nature magazine; Eugenie Scott, anthropologist and director of the National Center for Science Education, Berkeley; Gerard Piel, former president, American Association for the Advancement of Science and for\u00ad mer publisher of Scientific American; Wallace Sampson, M.D., Stanford University,\" Kendrick Frazier, editor. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER; Steve Allen, popular TV entertainer and author; John Rennie, editor. Scientific American; Alun Anderson, editor. New Scientist, and Carl Sagan, astronomer, Cornell Univeristy, among others. According to Paul Kurtz, chairman of CSICOP, \"The media have now virtually replaced the schools, colleges, and univer\u00ad sities as the main source of information for the general public . . . the irresponsibility of the media in the area of sci\u00ad ence and the paranormal is a worldwide problem. But it espe\u00ad cially applies to the United States, where the media have been distorting science and, in particular, presenting pseudoscience as genuine science. Indeed, we are appalled by the number of 'documentaries,' which are really entertainment programs. Asteroids Named for CSICOP and Founder Paul Kurtz The contributions to public education of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSI\u00ad COP) have earned both the organization and its founder, Paul Kurtz, cosmic honors. An asteroid has been named for CSICOP, and another asteroid has been named for Kurtz, a surprise announcement at CSICOP's twentieth-anniversary conference revealed. The honor to CSICOP recognizes its contributions to science education and skepticism and was timed to coincide with its twentieth birthday. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that officially names asteroids, accelerated its procedures so that the names would be approved in time to be announced at the conference, says CSICOP scientific and tech\u00ad nical consultant James McGaha, director of the Grasslands Observatory in Tucson. McGaha initiated the process and made the announcement at CSICOP's Saturday night awards ban\u00ad quet, June 22. Kurtz, CSICOP's founding chairman, was not told of either honor in advance. CSICOP's asteroid\u2014its numerical designation is 1982 VA1 (6630)\u2014was discovered November 15,1982, by E. Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station of Lowell Observatory. Although named for CSICOP, its actual name will apparently be \"Skepticus,\" from the Greek word for skeptic. McGaha says the IAU preferred that to an acronym. presenting fringe science as real science. \"The major networks have been running two or three such specials almost every month. Recently there have been pro\u00ad grams on prophecies, astrology, psychic powers, creationism, Noah's Ark, angels, alien abductions, etc. This is in addition to the popular Unsolved Mysteries, X-Files, and Sightings, as well 5 as new programs such as Paranormal Borderlands, and 1 Poltergeist.\" * The Council noted that on June 8, NBC rebroadcast \"The ! Mysterious Origins of Man,\" narrated by Charlton Heston. The ' program promoted pseudoscience and suggested that evolu- ! tion is questionable, that human civilization originated 100 million years ago. and that humans coexisted with dinosaurs. I The program, originally broadcast in February, raised protests I from the scientific community, which NBC ignored. It also r broadcast the fourth in a series of \"Prophecies,\" which pro- ! vided questionable scenarios of the end of the world. The Council also complained about the many talk shows devoted to the paranormal, in which claims in favor of the paranormal are given a platform but skeptical dissent is rarely heard.

Less anciently, What's My Line? and I've Got a Secret were TV staples, and my recollections of these programs are much more vivid. I believe I can report authoritatively that the \"lines\" and \"secrets\" were very often correctly deter\u00ad mined by the celebrity panelists. I believe I can further report, without fear of contradiction, that despite their suc\u00ad cesses week after week, Kitty Carlisle and company made no claims of \"psy\u00ad chic\" ability. A much more pretentious incarna\u00ad tion of these variations of the children's games of \"hot and cold\" and \"twenty questions\" aired most recently on April 29, when Orlando, Florida, \"psychic detective\" Noreen Renier was one of three subjects on the ABC-TV program Put to the Test. The show's purpose, as explained up front, is to \"challenge our basic understanding of what can be, and what we've come to accept as truth,\" by subjecting the guests' claims to \"objec\u00ad tive\" testing. Renier's segment begins with her looking into the camera and making this modest claim: \"If you give me the first name of a victim and something from that crime scene, I can tell you who did it, and how it happened.\" Her resume is then summarized, and testi\u00ad monials of praise are offered by Capt. Robert Miller of the Ft. Pierce, Florida, Sheriff's Department and retired New York Detective Ray Krolak (see refer\u00ad ence to Krolak in my chapter on in Sleuths, edited by Joe Nickell, Prometheus Boob, 1994). Renier's test, at her home \"over a two-day period,\" involved rhree previously solved Glendale, California, homicides. We are informed that on day one \"the results were split,\" although Renier was \"accurate on over seventy- five percent of the facts.\" A \"day two\" case was selected for showing\u2014that of an eighty-nine-year-old woman named Josephine, who was brutally murdered in 1994. Appearing in the room with Renier are Alison Holloway (one of the show's hosts), Glendale Police Depart\u00ad ment Sgt. Jon Perkins, and a retired judge to monitor the proceedings. Renier is handed Josephine's hearing aid, and she then begins to describe the killer: \"I feel some [increased] width to the mouth. Might be a strong overbite. Lips\u2014short.\" To my eyes, she was wrong on all three counts, and her asso\u00ad ciate's composite sketch, unveiled later, seemed to me to bear little resemblance to the killer's face. But her \"psychic\" reading of the crime was more (excuse the pun) dead- on. As Sgt. Perkins, who had worked the case, conducted the questioning, Renier described the place where rhe murder occurred: \"It seems like there's a lot of white in it. And there's some strong slant . . . with the roof. ... A house or church, or a house near a church. Screen door creaks.\" Even if Renier did not research the Glendale newspapers and scout the murder site in advance of the test (how many Josephines could have been murdered there recently?), her description may be reasonably represen\u00ad tative of many homes in the area. (Interestingly, although the actual screen door does not \"creak,\" it does, like many, scrape loudly along the porch sur\u00ad face.) Now rhe game of \"hot and cold\" begins in earnest, as Renier offers bits and pieces of her \"psychic\" vision to Perkins, who plays dutifully along: Renier: In die [killer's] name or associated with him in some way I see [the letter] \"J\" \"Cold.\") R: She was sitting, standing, back turned. There would have been some blows from the back, or from behind. P: I can't confirm that. (Good try, chough.) R: Close together, ot lived together, or close together. I don't know. Is that right? Is that right? P: Yes, I can confirm that. (What? OK, the killer did live very close by.) R: I feel a relative, a friend of a rel\u00ad ative is involved. P: I can confirm \"a relative\" \"friend of.\" (The murderer was actu\u00ad ally a \"friend'/neighbor of the victim, not a relative or a friend of a relative.) At this point, the taped replay of the session is interrupted with a brief description by Holloway of how the murder occurred. When they return to Renier, it cannot be determined if she correcdy found her way into the kitchen without the assistance of Perkins feed\u00ad back. Renier: Maybe some weapon that was in the kitchen could have been used. Perkins: OK. Can you describe the weapon? R: A knife? (Logical deduction, even if tentatively offered. But a \"psy\u00ad chic\" might have discerned the nonobvious\u2014it was a pocket knife!) P: OK, where are we going to move to? Can you see that? R: I think we go through two more doorways. (You mean we move from one room to another one? Given the last hint, even /can confirm that!) P: OK, I can confirm that. I cannot assert with certainty if Renier's \"success\" thus far is the result of mere intuition, prior knowledge, Perkins' feedback, \"psychic\" power, or some combination thereof. What I can assert with certainty is that once she \"psychically\" enters the bedroom, Renier's play-acting becomes painfully absurd. A knife already having been established as one of two murder weapons, rhe viewer is treated to the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 9 CSICOP AT THE CENTER FOR N O U I R Y Martin Gardner Honorary Co-chair Steve Allen Honorary Co-chair An Unprecedented $20 Million Drive for the Future of Science and Reason Human beings have never understood the material universe as thor\u00ad oughly as they do today. Yet never has popular hunger for superstition, pseudoscience, and the paranormal been so acute. CSICOP and die Skeptical Inquirer are leading advocates for skepti\u00ad cism nationally and worldwide. But so much more must be done in the years to come. The New Ten-Year Plan To continue its leadership in the defense of reason, CSICOP has articulated a Ten-Year Plan designed to: Promote science and reason Develop public support ana1 participation Develop The Center for Inquiry as an education and research center Build up the Committees resources Publishing revenues alone cannot fund die bold outreach today's challenges demand. Hence the Fund for die Future Campaign, a ten-year effort to add 20 million dollars to the Center for Inquiry endowments.* Gifts and endowment income will fund projects including: Council for Media Integrity Formed just weeks after its inclusion in the Ten-Year Plan, the Council for Media Integrity will monitor and rebut media programs that convey unfounded claims and mislead the public about sci\u00ad ence. Members include Steve Allen (chair), Carl Sagan, Stephen Jay Gould, and many others. CSICOP will invest in electronic infrastructure to facilitate rapid response to irresponsible pro\u00ad grams. Adult Education The Council cosponsors the Center for Inquiry Institute, which has already expanded its offerings to include a new three-year certificate program in science and skepticism. Sessions are scheduled in Amherst and Los Angeles. Enhancing Library Resources The Center for Inquiry's skeptics' library\u2014already the finest of its kind in the world\u2014needs expanded funding to enlarge its core collec\u00ad tion and add electronic media. Worldwide modem access to the library's catalog is already neady complete. For the Young To present skeptics' message more com- pellingly to the young, CSICOP will develop new materials\u2014ranging from age-appropriate print publications to audio and video cassettes and instruc\u00ad tional courseware. Goals include enhanced understanding of science and improved critical thinking skills. Regional Outreach With the establishment of The Center for Inquiry - West (Los Angeles), The Center for Inquiry - Midwest (Kansas City) and The Center for Inquiry - Rockies (Boulder, Colo.), giant steps have been taken to enhance direct field service to skeptical activists. Additional regional Centers are planned with expanded calendars of activities. How Can I Help? The Center for Inquiry Fund for the Future depends on generous support from each of our readers and friends. Gifts of cash, securities and other assets are sought. A three-year pledge can make more substantial gifts sur\u00ad prisingly affordable. Many forms of planned giving arrangements can be arranged All requests will be held in confidence. I Only financial support from skeptics and other friends of science can place the skeptical movement on a firm financial foundation. At the first World Skeptics Congress in Amherst, New York, participants gave or pledged an unprecedented $201,000 to give the Fund for the Future campaign a vigorous start. We invite you to make your commit\u00ad ment to the Fund for the Future today. For more information, complete and mail the postpaid reply card. ^CSICOP at the Center for Inquiry P.O.

NEWS AND COMMENT spectacle of Renier simulating a repeat\u00ad ing stabbing motion with her right arm: \"I get this motion with him, and I don't quite know what this motion is. But I keep doing this. And I have sort of a lunge-and-pull-back, and lunge-and- pull-back motion.\" She then immedi\u00ad ately makes a series of campy-looking puffing faces and sounds, as if exhausted from reliving the kill. Even if I were ini\u00ad tially inclined to believe in her \"psychic\" powers, diis ridiculous acting and feign\u00ad ing of ignorance would be a dead give\u00ad away. As die test approaches its conclusion, Holloway says, \"Noreen [then] had her most startling vision of the reading\u2014a fact that was never printed in the news\u00ad paper, never testified to in court, a fact no one but the investigators knew. David had hidden one of the murder weapons in the oven.\" Renier to Perkins: \"I diink you had trouble finding one weapon. Uh, there was a little disguise in the one weapon.\" Perkins: \"I can con\u00ad firm tJiat.\" But Renier does not say that the knife had been hidden in the oven. And if diis one \"vision\" was the \"most startling\" of them all because it involved one fact diat had not been previously pub\u00ad licized, does this not imply that Renier indeed had an opportunity (whether or not she availed herself of it) to come up with her other \"visions\" through prior research? When the Renier-inspired sketch of the killer was shown to Perkins at the conclusion of die test, he rated it as \"very accurate ... a strong 7 [or] weak 8\" (I'd give it a \"strong\" 3). He added, \"I think she was probably ninety percent accurate on the facts and the informa\u00ad tion diat occurred during die course of diis murder.\" But even if she was, did she exhibit sufficient evidence of \"psy\u00ad chic\" power to cause a rational, critically thinking person to reassess his or her skepticism of the paranormal? Haven't magicians, psychology instructors, and others regularly performed similarly \"accurate\" readings, to demonstrate for die public how easy it is to simulate \"psychic\" power? In my chapter on Renier in Psychic Sleuths, I describe on page 80 a simple test protocol that would allow, with mathenmtic.il precision, a determina\u00ad tion as to whether or not her \"psychic\" powers are genuine. Renier wanted no part of such a test, not even for die Tampa Bay Skeptics' \"$1,000 Chal\u00ad lenge\" ($1,000 is offered to anyone who can successfully demonstrate psychic powers under scientific, controlled con\u00ad ditions). And not even die lure of James Randi's new \"2000 Club\" jackpot (a similar challenge to anyone who can demonstrate psychic powers under sci\u00ad entific, controlled conditions, now worth more than $600,000) has caused her to change her mind. \u2014Gary P.

Goatsucker Hysteria Mimicking die \"cattle mutilation\" hype beast\u2014El Chupacabras, or \"die goat\u00ad sucker\"\u2014have spread from Puerto Rico to Mexico and, more recently, to Florida. According to the Cox News Service (April 1996), \"The creature supposedly is part space alien, part vampire and part reptile, with long sharp claws, bulging eyes and a Dracula-like taste for sucking blood from neck bites.\" In Puerto Rico, where the myth originated in late 1995. \"the creature has spawned something near hysteria.\" It reportedly attacked turkeys, goats, rabbits, dogs, cats, cows, and horses, sucking all the blood from diem. However, as Reuters reported, the Puerto Rico Agriculture Department dispatched a veterinarian to investigate. Officials then announced diat all the animals had died under normal circum\u00ad stances and diat, contrary to claims, not one had been bled dry. When the scare spread to Mexico in April, a scientific team staked out farm\u00ad yards where the goatsucker had report\u00ad edly struck. Wild dogs were caught each time. A police official remarked, \"I don't know about die rest of Mexico or the rest of the world, but here the goatsuck\u00ad ers are just dogs.\" He added: \"There is just this huge psychosis. You see it every\u00ad where, even though everywhere we go we prove that there aren't any extrater\u00ad restrials or vampires.\" Investigating for CSICOP, Patricia and Mario Mendez-Acosta of Mexico City interviewed several veterinarian pathologists who had conducted numerous autopsies on alleged victims of the goatsucker. Again, in every instance blood was still present in the animal. Some news sources reported that a nurse who lived in a village near Mexico City had been attacked by die goat\u00ad sucker. Actually, she simply fell and broke her arm but her cries for help were misinterpreted by her grand\u00ad mother, and neighbors rushing to her aid saw a black-winged form. In reality, that was a flock of swallows, but thus the tumor was born. In another Mexican incident, a man who claimed he had been attacked by the goatsucker later confessed that was a cover story for his having participated in a brawl (Los Angeles Times, May 19, 1996). Largely through Miami's Latin radio and television stations, the collective delusion spread to the Sunshine State. Prompted by local authorities and sur\u00ad rounded by members of the news media, a University of Miami veterinary professor, Alan Herron, cut open a dead goat to demonstrate that it had merely been bitten, not emptied of its blood. Citing die bite wounds that were \"sug\u00ad gestive of predation,\" Professor Herron concluded, \"A pack of wild dogs did it.\" \"Of course,\" reported the Cox News Service, calm the Chupacabras frenzy.\" \u2014Jot Nickell 12 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NOTES Of k FRINGE-WATCHER MARTIN GARDNER Isaac Newton: Alchemist and Fundamentalist And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The antcchapel where the statue stood Of Newton with his prism and silent nice, The marble index of a mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone. \u2014William Wordsworth, Prelude, Book 3, lines 58-63 T here are three Sir Isaac Newtons. known Newton has been the great mathematical physicist who in his early twenties invented calculus, discov\u00ad ered the binominal theorem, introduced polar coordinates, proved that white light was a mixture of colors, explained the rainbow, built the first reflecting telescope, and showed that the force causing apples to fall is the same as the force that guides the planets, moons, and comets, and produces tides. His dis\u00ad coveries revolutionized physics. His genius is undisputed. Unknown to most people, even today, are two other Newtons. One is the alchemist who struggled for decades to turn base metals into gold. The other is Newton the Protestant fundamental\u00ad ist. Newton worked quietly alone, almost in secret, on his great discoveries. His classic Philosophise naturalis prin- cipia mathematica was not published until twenty years after his youthful achievements, and then only at the insistence of astronomer Edmund Halley, for whom the comet is named, and who funded the book's publication. For a large part of his life Newton's time and energy were devoted to fruitless alchemy experiments and efforts to interpret Biblical prophecy. His hand\u00ad written manuscripts on those topics far exceed his writings about physics. They constitute several million words now scattered in the rare book rooms of libiaiics and in private collections. The American philosopher Richard Popkin is currently working on a twelve-volume edition of these manuscripts. Although other scientists of the time, notably Robert Boyle, were interested in alchemy, none was as obsessively occu\u00ad pied with such research as Newton. He read all the old books on alchemy he could find, accumulating more than 150 for his library. He built furnaces for endless experiments and left about a million words on the topic. He thought of himself as working within a secret occult tradition of wisdom that traced back to Earth's earliest history. He even suspected that the ancients had known the inverse-square law of gravity! It is with Newton's fundamentalism that this essay is mainly concerned. He was a devout Anglican, firmly believing the Bible to be God's revelation, although he granted that the original texts had been heavily corrupted by an unscrupulous Roman Church. He accepted the Genesis account of cre\u00ad ation in six literal days, the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark and the universal flood, the blood atonement of Jesus, his birth by a virgin, his bodily resurrection, and the eternal life of our souls in heaven or hell. He never doubted the reality of angels and demons, and a Satan destined on judg\u00ad ment day to be cast into a lake of fire. Bishop James Ussher, the seventeenth- century Irish scholar, had settled on 41)04 B.C. as the year of creation. Newton revised it in the wrong direc\u00ad tion by making it five hundred years later! Newton's universe was a vast machine operating by laws created and upheld by a personal yet transcendent deity. Infinite space was God's \"Sensoriam\"\u2014the means by which he observed and controlled the cosmos. Although for Kant and later admirers of Newton the universe was deterministic, never deviating from unalterable laws, Newton was convinced that from time to time God needed to adjust the orbits of planets to keep them free of pertur\u00ad bations caused by comets and other forces. This notion that God has to tinker with the universe to repair it struck Newton's German rival, the great philosopher-mathematician Leibniz, as SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 13 blasphemous. If God is perfect, omnipo\u00ad tent and omniscient as Newton believed, why, Leibniz wanted to know, would he create a universe so flawed mat it would require perpetual adjustments? Newton had no use for pantheism. His God was the God of die Bible, in whose image we were created, but so wholly other that we cannot compre\u00ad hend how we resemble him. Newton's greatest departure from die prevailing religion of England was his rejection of die trinity. He was an Arian (forerunner of Unitarianism) for whom Jesus was indeed the divine Son of God, but in no way equal to God. Trinitarianism, Newton believed, was a crude heresy concocted by the Roman Church in die fourth and fifth centuries. He kept this belief to himself, knowing well that if it became known he would be expelled from his Cambridge college, ironically called Trinity, where he was a professor of mathematics for twenty-six years. It later would have endangered his job at the Royal Mint where he worked for the last half of a long life. He was a diligent servant, overseeing England's currency and merciless in sending counterfeiters to the gallows. He was die first to rec\u00ad ommend gold as a monetary standard. For Newton, the beautiful patterns of die material universe were over\u00ad whelming evidence of God's creative powers. As an example, he singled out the fact that all die planets revolve on the same plane, in the same direction. with just enough centripetal force to keep them from crashing into die sun. Newton was puzzled by the fact that gravity seemed to operare instanta\u00ad neously at a distance. He admitted he could do no more than describe it with\u00ad out comprehending how it worked. Not until Einstein's general dieory of relativ\u00ad ity was gravity changed from a \"force\" to the movement of matter along die shortest paths in a curved space-time. As physicist John Wheeler likes to say, die stars tell space-time how to bend, and space-rime tells die stars how to go. Martin Gardner's latest book is The Night Is Large: Collected Essays, 1938- 1995 (St. Martins Press), published in July 1996. Both space and time were for Newton absolute. Space was a fixed, infinite, unmoving metric against which absolute motions could be measured. His proof of this was die centrifugal force produced by rotating bodies, and which he correcdy guessed had caused the earth to bulge at its equator. It would be foolish, he argued, to suppose that a rotating bucket of water, which tossed water over its sides, was at rest with the entire universe spinning around it. There was no way, of course, he could have conceived of general rela\u00ad tivity in which even rotary motion is rel\u00ad ative, but how he would relish it were he to return to earth today! \"Newton, for\u00ad give me,\" Einstein once wrote. Nor can we fault Newton for not undemanding cosmological and biolog\u00ad ical evolution. Like so many theists before and after, he saw the intricate patterns of life forms as another proof of God's wondrous handiwork. He was particularly impressed by bilateral sym\u00ad metry: Can it be by accident that all birds, beasts and men have their right side and left side alike shaped (except in dieir bowels), and just two eyes and no more on either side die face, and just rwo ears on either side the head, and nose with two holes and no more between die eyes, and one mouth under the nose, and either two fore\u00ad legs or two wings or two arms on die shoulders, and two legs on ihe hips, one on either side and no more? Would Newton have accepted evolu\u00ad tion had he lived after Darwin? If so, he would have considered it God's method of creation, though it would surely have demolished his belief in the accuracy of Genesis. I also suspect that Newton, reincar- nared today, would embrace quantum mechanics. Indeed, he thought that light consisted of particles, independent of space though somehow influenced by space. In quantum mechanics, light is both a wave and a particle called die photon. Newton's passion for alchemy was exceeded only by his passion for Biblical prophecy. Incredible amounts of intel\u00ad lectual energy were spent trying to inter\u00adpret the prophecies of Daniel in the Old Testament, and the Book of Revelation in the New. He left more rhan a million words on these subjects, seeing himself as one who for the first time was cor\u00ad recdy judging both books. Having been so successful in solving some of the rid\u00ad dles of God's universe, he turned his tal\u00ad ents toward trying to answer riddles posed by God's Holy Word. Newton was firmly convinced that Daniel and the Apocalypse, when cor\u00ad recdy deciphered, showed that Earth's history was about to end with the Second Coming of Jesus, followed by his judgment of die quick and die dead. In his youdi Newton speculated on 1867 as a possible date for the Second Coming, but in later years decided it was folly to use the Bible for predicting the future. The best we can do is recog\u00ad nize successful predictions after the events occur. Like millions of Protestants in the seventeenth century, he believed the Papacy was the Antichrist foretold in the Apocalypse\u2014 an incarnation of Satan in his last, futile effort to thwart God's plan for cleansing the universe of sin. He accepted the prophecy that in the last days the Jews would return to Jerusalem and become Christians. The coming of Christ would be followed by a Millennium during which the Lord would rule over earth \"with an iron hand.\" In his old age Newton moved the date of the Second Coming to some time after the end of the twenty-first century. Six years after Newton's death his Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John was published in London. It was reprinted in 1922, but amazingly has been unavailable since. The best summary of its contents known to me is a chapter in the second volume of Leroy Edwin Froom's The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers (Review and Herald, 1950-54), a massive four-volume work by a Seventh-day Adventist historian. Froom greatly admired Newton's religious opinions. Many are shared by Adven- tists, including the identification of the Papacy with die Antichrist, and a belief that God created the universe through Jesus. Like the Adventists, Newton took 14 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Sir Isaac Newton the four pans of the metallic image in Daniel chapter 2 to symbolize the suc\u00ad cessive world powers of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. Like the Adventists, he took the growth of the \"little horn\" on the fourth beast in Daniel to repre\u00ad sent the growth of die Papacy. What about 666, the mysterious number of the Beast in Revrlarinn? Like today's Adventists, Newton believed we do not yet know its meaning. It would be inter\u00ad esting to compare Newton's exegesis of Biblical prophecy with the Adventist classic Thoughts on the Book of Daniel and the Revelation, an 1882 work by Uriah Smith. To support his conviction that die Old Testament is accurate history, Newton worked out an elaborate chronology of Earth's history, drawing on astronomical data such as eclipses and star motions, and legend such as that of Jason and the Argonauts which he took to be genuine events. With incredible ingenuity he tried to harmo\u00ad nize Biblical history with secular histo\u00ad ries of the ancient world. It is sad to envision the discoveries in mathematics and physics Newton might have made if his great intellect had not been diverted by such bizarre speculations. Newton's writings on Biblical prophecy are so huge an embarrassment to his admirers that to this day they are downplayed or ignored. The long essay on Newton in The Encyclopaedia Britannica's famous eleventh edition devotes only one brief paragraph to Newton's Bible studies. They are not mentioned at all in the fourteenth edi\u00ad tion, and are allowed one paragraph in the Macropaedia of the current fifteenth edition. What did Newton think of his great discoveries in physics? Amazingly, he seems to have considered them little more than youthful recreations. In a memorable, often quoted, passage he likened himself to a little boy \"playing on rhc seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother peb\u00ad ble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\" Newton's peculiar, introverted, self- absorbed personality is still an enigma. Contemporaries noticed his melancholy countenance. Although he occasionally smiled, he almost never laughed. A life\u00ad long bachelor, he had not the slightest interest in sex. A few Freudian analysts, stressing the death of his father before he was born, have suggested that Newton was a repressed homosexual. The main evidence is that in his middle age Newton became infatuated with Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, an eccentric Swiss disciple twenty years his junior. Gale Christianson, in his 1984 biogra\u00ad phy of Newton, In the Presence of the Creator, strongly doubts any sex activity between the pair took place, but adds: \"On the other hand, their correspon\u00ad dence\u2014with its lavish praise, requited loneliness at separation, and melancholy swings of mood\u2014bears haunting over\u00ad tones of an ill-fated romance. The final break itself appears to have been prefig\u00ad ured in their agonizing desire to share the same chambers, a desire quite possi\u00ad bly overridden by the fear of what might happen if they were to attempt it.\" Newton had no interest in music or art, and once dismissed poetry as \"inge\u00ad nious fiddle-faddle.\" He never exercised, had no recreational hobbies, no interest in games, and was so preoccupied wirh his work that he frequendy forgot to eat or would eat standing up to save time. He had few friends, and even to them he was often quarrelsome and vindictive. In one of his letters to John Locke, his best friend among British philosophers, he wrote: Being of opinion that you endeav\u00ad oured to embroil me wth woemen & by other means I was so much affected with it as that when one told me you were sickly & would not live I answered rwere better if you were dead. I desire you to forgive me this uncharirableness. Locke wrote back to grant forgive\u00ad ness, and to express undimmed love and esteem. Newton seldom credited other scien\u00ad tists with earlier work that had influ\u00ad enced him. Always insistent on getting full credit for his discoveries, he bitterly accused Leibniz, whose metaphysics he despised, of stealing his invention of cal\u00ad culus. It is now known that the two dis\u00ad coveries were independent. Newton's was earlier, but Leibniz had a superior notation. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 15 A few years after die publication of Principia, Newton suffered a massive mental breakdown that took a year or more to overcome. It was marked by severe insomnia, deep depression, amnesia, loss of mental ability, and para\u00ad noid delusions of persecution. In recent years a few scholars have suggested he may have suffered from mercurial and other toxic metal poisoning caused by his alchemical experiments. Odiers have conjectured that throughout his life he was a manic-depressive with alternating moods of melancholy and happy activ\u00ad ity. His breakdown was only the worst of such episodes. When Newton's manuscripts on alchemy were sold in 1936 at a Sotheby auction, the economist John Maynard Keynes was the major buyer. In a bril\u00ad liant speech on Newton, given at the Royal Society's Newton Tercentenary Celebration in 1947, Keynes spoke of having gone through some million of Newton's words on alchemy and found them \"wholly devoid of scientific value.\" Newton's \"deepest instincts were the world\u2014a rapt, consecrated, solitary perusing his studies by intense introspection, with a mental endurance perhaps never equaled.\" As for Newton's discoveries in math\u00ad ematics and physics, Keynes believed they resulted less from experiments than from an incredible intuition. Later Newton would dress them up with for\u00ad mal demonstrations and proofs which had little to do with the insights that seemed to enter his head by sheer magic. Keynes put it this way: In the eighteenth century and since, Newton came to be thought of as the first and greatest of the modem age of scientists, a rationalist, one who taught us to tin nk on the lines of cold and untinctured reason. I do not see him in this light. I do not think that any one who has pored over the con\u00ad tents of that box which he packed up when he finally left Cambridge in 1696 and which, thought pardy dis\u00ad persed, have come down to us, can see him like that. Newton was not the first of the age of teason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of (he Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child bom with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wondetchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropri\u00ad ate homage.

In this column (Spring 1992, 250) you were among the first to read of the tall tales surrounding the supposedly mysterious \"Area 51,\" where UFOs galore could allegedly be seen by anyone who took die trouble to drive out near the tiny hamlet of Rachel along barren State Highway 375. This road is now officially designated die Extraterrestrial Highway by proclama\u00ad tion of Governor Bob Miller, who spoke ar a brirfrwmooy April i;i 1996, and its speed limit is now posted as \"Warp 7.\" Another sign warns of alien encoun\u00ad ters \"next 51 miles.\" When I drove that road in July of 1992, stopping off for lunch at the Little A'Le' Inn, the only evidence of space visitors were the draw\u00ad ings and blurry photos plastered all over the walls. Leaving Rachel for Tonopah, there was a sign reading \"Next Gas 97 Miles,\" so I doubled back to buy a few more gallons just to be safe. I suspect that sign will be coming down soon, if it hasn't already. Twentieth-Century Fox sent from Hollywood a whole convoy of movie stars, reporters, and film moguls to a ceremony in the hamlet of Rachel to pro\u00ad mote its new blockbuster, Independence Day, a film about aliens attacking the earth. A base supposedly beneath Area 51 plays a key role in the movie. The studio is also planning to unveil a \"mon\u00ad ument\" along the Extraterrestrial Highway intended to \"serve as a beacon for possible 'dose encounters' with visi\u00ad tors arriving from the far reaches of outer space,\" according to its press release. While the local UFO hucksters were doing a brisker business than ever, not everybody in the UFOlogical realm was cheering. Area 51 promoter Glenn Campbell, who publishes a newsletter called The Desert Rat (http://www. ufomind.com/area51/descrt_rat), warns that \"the state is setting up naive tourists for jnoi ot film seizure along the tense & poorly marked military border near the highway,\" and he does have a valid point, as the guards who patrol the perimeter of the high-security Air Force test range take a dim view of the cat- and-mouse games being played by ama\u00ad teur points out that Twentieth-Century Fox's \"UFO monument,\" whatever it may be, seems to have completely circumvented the normal process of permits and approvals, as state and federal agencies have nothing on file about it, which would seem to preclude anything being constructed. However, Chuck Clark of Rachel, author of the rival Area 51 Handbook, suggests that Campbell may be \"a government plant\" sent to confuse people. Perhaps giving expression to this discontent, certain pranksters \"ab\u00ad ducted\" the studio's Las Vegas-to-Rachel signs for the \"Extraterrestrial Highway,\" send\u00ad ing them miles out of their way on a wild UFO chase down dusty desert roads, bypassing the paved state high\u00ad way. Campbell reports that at least forty cars and one tour bus were thus \"abducted\" to the edge of the high-secu\u00ad rity area before arriving, covered with dust, at the planned extraterrestrial ren\u00ad dezvous. All the excitement over the new Extraterrestrial Highway has obscured the most exciting development on which Campbell has yet reported: extraterrestrial linguistics. An anony\u00ad mous earthling who uses the alias \"Jarod 2\" (pronounced Jay-rod) claims to have conversed briefly with his original namesake, an extraterrestrial now in res\u00ad idence at Area 51. This Jarod (the origi\u00ad nal) is reputed to be a consultant-alien, one of several who are advising the U.S. government on how to reproduce their flying saucers. That one or more extra\u00ad terrestrials are now resident at that site is not news. Several years ago, John Lear claimed that aliens had violated their treaty with earthlings, resulting in humans at Area 51 being eaten by aliens. Bob Lazar later told a story of a battle being waged by earthly bullets against ET Ray Guns (this column. Fall 1993, 23). However, nothing had previ\u00ad ously been reported about the extrater\u00ad restrials' language. Recently, Jarod 2 asked a group of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 17 UFOIogists, \"What is the most difficult language on earth to learn?\" When some\u00ad body piped up and said \"Hungarian\" (I have no idea whether this is true or not), Jarod 2 said that was right, and claimed that die ETs speak Hungarian\u2014actu\u00ad ally, \"a higher form of Hungarian.\" Or so he claimed to have been told by his supervisor at Area 51. Further evidence of diis is that die extraterrestrials speak English woids in Hungarian word-order during their terse conversations. \"This is something we never ex\u00ad pected,\" Campbell observes wryly. \"The aliens can talk to Zsa Zsa Gabor! But it's a HIGHER FORM of Hungarian, so maybe they can talk to Eva Gabor now diat she has passed on.\" Jarod 2 claims that die Area 51 project employed many skilled human linguists, but all of them were stumped trying to figure out this higher form of Hungarian. Campbell observes diat he had previously suggested that \"prudent investors consider boron as a possible growth commodity, since it is one product that Jarod says the aliens take from Earth. Now we suggest ambitious college students consider the benefits of Hungarian. Take a few introductory classes, and when the aliens reveal themselves you'll be way ahead of everyone else.\" Apparendy eager to place himself at the head of that queue, Campbell recently traveled to Budapest, describing his trip in Desert Rat. While contemporary Hungary is indeed in a state of UFO excitement, Campbell found nothing that would direcdy confirm or refute Jarod 2's statements. Other interesting tidbits from Jarod 2: The aliens keep clean by taking a \"bug bath\" (actually, a microbe shower). They enter a shower stall where microbes are sprayed onto die alien's skin, and \"die good bacteria eat the bad bacteria,\" as he explains. The aliens do not eat as we do, but diey apparendy do drink liquids. Everyone knows that Uri Geller's psy\u00ad chic powers can supposedly bend spoons, but it seems diat the task of psy\u00ad chically deflecting footballs has proven much more difficult. The British news\u00ad paper The Independent reported on April 2 that \"Mr. Geller has forsaken [psy\u00ad chic] espionage and fork-bending to try to help his local football team, Reading FC. After all, if you can bend forks, you can bend free kicks. Last season he con\u00ad centrated all his powers by walking 48 miles to Wembley to watch Reading in a play-off for promotion to the Premier League, but they lost to Bolton and missed a penalty to boot. And diis sea\u00ad son they're staring relegation in the face. What went wrong?\" Mr. Geller answered die question in an interview in Q Magazine: \"It's going to be all right, I tell you. Don't give up hope. I might invite the players over to my home to give them a good surge of psychic energy. You have to do that sometimes because we only use 10 percent of our minds.\" Nonetheless, not only did the season go badly for Reading, but the team's mascot, a hamster named Miss Ellie, died. It was given a fitting burial in one of the goalmouths. However, no sooner was Miss Ellie at rest than the team's for\u00ad tunes immediately turned around, starting with a 3-0 victory over a local rival which saved the team from relegation. More remark\u00ad ably, goals are said to come particularly freely at Miss Ellie's end of die field, and many members of the team are convinced that they are receiving supernatural assis\u00ad tance from the dead ham\u00ad ster, and not Uri Geller. James \"The Amazing\" Randi, who has been debunking Geller's claims for years, writes, \"I trust that Mr. Geller will act in a chival\u00ad rous manner, and will resist claiming diat his powers, working over a period of several months, and not Miss lilie's, achieved this small wonder. Respect for die dead would seem to be called for here, and I, for one, will not cast doubt upon the ability of a dead rodent to lead a football team to victory.\" In the final chapter of the saga of psychic football, the Reading Evening Post reported on June 29 that \"Uri Geller says England would be in the Euro '96 final if police had not stopped him from standing behind die goal. The Sonning psychic was about to move into position to 'beam' Garedi South gate's penalty into die net when Met Police officers barred him.\" A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said, \"our offi\u00ad cers would not have wanted to do any- diing diat would have stopped England winning, but security had to be the first priority.\" They should have used a dead hamster. D IS September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER SCIENCE FICTION, SKEPTICISM. AND Shades of Meaning: Science Fiction as a New Metric Science fiction can, and should, be used to explore paranormal and fringe-science issues in compelling, meaningful ways. EUGENE R. STEWART Man's search for meaning is a primary force in his life. \u2014Viktor E.

Stewart's essay deals with these and other related issues from his particular viewpoint. We then decided to ask three famous sci\u00ad ence fiction writers, Hal Clement, Greg Bear, and Frederik Pohl, for their views on the same topic. our future-shocked, techno- phobic, information-aging world. When meaning is suc\u00ad cessfully made clear, we call it \"sense of wonder\" and feel as if something almost mystical has been revealed. Isn't that feeling a primary force in all literature, all art, all human endeavor? SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 19 mum If that frisson is sparked by fiction based solidly in reality, then meanings are deepened. Science fiction, by including sci\u00ad ence, searches for new expressions of the basic grandeur and wonder of the world as it really is, as it can be understood through science and logic. This search, however, as well as science fictions powerful capacity to use almost anything as grist for its mills, often leads writers into wistful, less-than-scientific inquiries. Gullibility, lazi\u00ad ness, and self-delusion, even hoax and fraud, divert some writers from real science, which might require some difficult research, toward the false claims and fake magic of quick-and-dirty won\u00ad derments that can be sewn of whole cloth. These writers mistake the theatrical stage set for the world they can depict and the gasp of a startled audience for the sign of amazement prompted by real insight. It's the same as mistaking gore for horror or sex for love. The amazing variety of source material and imagery science fiction can accommodate is one of this branch of literatures major strengths, if that variety can be kept under control. As Darrell Schweitzer pointed out in his excellent article, \"The Necessity of Skepticism, Part Two\" {Science Fiction Review, Autumn 1990, pp. 26-30), \"The skeptical writer can take what he wants from those sources, but then deliberately builds some\u00ad thing far richer, far more entertaining, far more meaningful. He can make forceful, convincing speculations or psychologically valid metaphors. He remains in control of his material.\" Obviously, losing control of the search is like casting aside maps, charts, and native guides in favor of thrashing about ran\u00ad domly. Columbus may not have known what he'd found, but he knew how to get there and back again. Every good writer must navigate through treacherous waters where crystals heal, revenants speak, and magic means more than a chosen MacGuffin (term used by Alfred Hitchcock for any device that triggers anion in a story). Consider as an example that oldest and least substantial of companions from the supernatural realm, the ghost. Out of fashion, oft ridiculed, and better dressed than his or her invisi\u00ad ble means of support would seem to allow, still the ghost lingers, haunting us. One of the publishers of Alison I .uric (Pulitzer Prize-winning author of adult and juvenile fiction and nonfic- tion that includes folktales, fairy tales, and legends), sponsored a ghost story contest recently. Is even science fiction a match for the ghost? The ghost survives, defying skepticism, logic, and science. It provides a convenient jumping-off point for a discussion of things that go bump in our heads as we reach high or crouch low, as we try to find meaning in our fiction, our lives. After all, ghosts represent all those fogbanks of irrationality, credulous- ness, and worse, that threaten each seeker of meaning. They're the surrogates for everything Dianetics claims to deliver, every\u00ad thing New Age channelers pour forth, and for all the hokum holographic universe theories. So what can be said with any cer\u00ad tainty about these resdess spirits? Ghosts exist, but we don't know what they are. Stories of sightings, encounters, and even relationships with osts have been around as long as human memory serves. History may have more ghosts crammed into it than does liter\u00ad ature, and many family histories have eerie stories of uncanny events. Ghosts abound. Debate about what ghosts might be is as old as ghost stories themselves. From each teller of a ghosdy tale, a skeptic, a doubter, or an unconvinced but interested investigator might be born. With each telling, every ghost story kindles new flames from that spark that keeps people wanting, needing to know. All that remains from a cold analysis is the fact that people report ghosts. Some are hoaxers, some are in error, but many such people believe what they say. Does it matter whether a ghost is an external, objective phenomenon or an internal, sub\u00ad jective manifestation of our humanity? The answer depends on how one feels about what ghosts mean. For an atheist, ghosts promise only mockery and self-indul\u00ad gence, the wishful thinking of true believers. For a theist, how\u00ad ever, ghosts may mean evidence of an afterlife, of angelic help, or continued love from loved ones long gone. Agnostic minds, poised between extremes and awaiting further evidence, admit either possibility in theory, but claim data insufficient to deter\u00ad mine which way to lean. Few people are purely atheist, theist, or agnostic, however. Most of us just plain don't know what to think, but we might know, in our secret hearts, how we'd like it to turn out. Our hopes, dreams, and wishes combine into knots of faith difficult to unravel with blunt, clumsy words. Our lives, loves, and losses all clamor to convince us that existence simply must mean some\u00ad thing. And it's that conviction of meaning that most infuses ghosts with perennial appeal. Meaning, however, must be based on reality if it's to be any\u00ad thing other than self-delusion or blind faith. How, then, is real\u00ad ity determined? Is it decided by simple belief, or by the applica\u00ad tion of logic and scientific method? Science fiction can help us think about these matters. In the deft plotting and insightful characterization of a good science fiction story, even ghosts may be considered from revealing angles, in ways perhaps not per\u00ad mitted to the scientist. In other words, science fiction can be a form of thought experiment. When Steven Spielberg's film Poltergeist appeared in 1982, viewers were treated to a quick overview of almost the entire field of parapsychology. Spielberg's approach to the subject mat\u00ad ter of his films seems encyclopedic and all-inclusive, if not terri\u00ad bly skeptical. All's fair in entertainment, especially when it suc\u00ad ceeds. In all modern films, technological advances allow new realism in the portrayal of the supernatural and impossible. George Lucas is revamping the special effects of his 1975 release Star Wars because technology now allows him do what he could only imagine 20 years ago. Neither Lucas nor Spielberg lets real\u00ad ity hinder or curtail his imagery. The science content of their films is low. 20 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER In Poltergeist, it is the family's emotions that arc centered on the loss and recovery of the youngest child, a pattern with mythic resonance and eternal layers of meaning. (This is a hor\u00ad ror movie of a family whose 5-year-old girl is abducted by a spirit that comes through the television set from a Native American burial ground beneath the family's home.) Each fam\u00ad ily member responds as an individual to the wild happenings, with the mother at first curious, even delighted, and the elder sister dubious, frightened, and ultimately disassociated, if not alienated. The father fights back any way he can, and in baffle\u00ad ment, turns to authorities and self-proclaimed experts, but only after he's exhausted his own resources. In short, he capitulates control of his search for meaning and casts his (ate into odier hands, other game plans. This parallels the dogmatic religious impulse and the true believer phenome\u00ad non. In these behaviot patterns can be seen society's structure: The charactets seek meaning by performing standard roles, by fulfilling stereotypic duties. The mothet is supportive, the siblings are at odds, and the father seeks control. Thus is a wild story line or plot hitched firmly to familiar, quotidian experience. Borrowing from myth, old frights meet new doubts, ancient angst is brought to mod\u00ad ern suburbia, and so a kind of downscaled epic is launched. A descent into hell and the hero's return are presented in modern idiom as a kind of reinforcement of our humanity. In the end (the family gets back the girl and flees to a motel as their house is annihilated by the poltergeist), the father, rec\u00ad onciled to having experienced something no one really under\u00ad stands, and ever seeking control, puts the motel room television set (Ky nmy 2 symbol of chaos) <> inside the room. Viewers laugh at that final irony, even while recognizing it as somediing we would all do. Order is restored, and meaning assured, even at the cost of a bit of rationality, a dollop of healthy skepticism. Spielberg opted for yet another of Hollywood's anti- intellectual, antiscience, antitechnology, pro-faith denouements. Remember Star Wars and die casting aside of technology in favor of trusting \"the force\": The science in fiction is often routed by myth. A confirmation of die validity of family ries, of caring, of love, and the willingness to sacrifice self for others is the tangle of meanings gleaned from Poltergeist. In other words, a stamp of approval is placed on our general humanity. Beyond compe\u00ad tence (as represented by the father), and unconditional love (the mother), luck sees us through, and we're grateful when things E. R Stewart has published fiction, nonfiction, criticism, maps, photography, cartoons, and poetry in various publications, including Kendall/Hunt's Pegasus textbooks.

APO AE 09012. haven't changed beyond all recognition by die time our latest barde with chaos is done. If not quite a paean to entropy, it's at least a respectful nod to the inertia, the fake stability, found in die established order. In diis, it shares traits with folktales and fairy tales. It endows die ghost with believability, not science. Faith counts more than fact. And consider the film's initial premise: Underlying all the floating toys, hungry trees, indoor lightning, illusory maggots, disfigurations, regurgitated coffins, screaming demons, and ectoplasmic goo is the elegant and unsettling simplicity of the fact diat reality might not behave always as we've come to expect. It's H. P. Lovecraft's crawling chaos, Nyarlathotep; it's the heart of a Stephen Hawking black hole; it's the core of Benoit Mandelbrot's fractals; in fact, it's Albert Einstein's asser\u00ad tion that, after all, physics as we know it might well be a local enomenon. By the end of Poltergeist, however, order is restored, as it must be if we're to go on trudging through our well-filtered world. Rifts between family members and society are all repented, reconsecrated, and repaired. As in most things, the audience members ultimately seek reassurance that they're okay. Their parking has been validated once again. Thus ghosts arc seen as manifestations of chaos, the unknown, and dieir unknowable effect nn our lives; foes to be fought if never quite defeated. And this is how too many people feel about science: That it's incomprehensible, beyond their control, and quite probably malevolent. They need better exam\u00ad ples, it seems. Our popular fiction is often blatantly meaningful, stridently significant, albeit on a lowest common denominator level. Why don't we use it more often for science? All things may ultimately find common ground in the human search for meaning, for significance. So Hamlet sees his father's ghost. What's it to me? Until the simple sighting of a long-dead monarch walking casde ramparts can be analyzed and comprehended, it seems superfluous: Another in-step charlatan and dupe eaget to offer the latest explanation, usually a rehash of old nonsense. Shall pscudoscience then stake out the sole claim to our search for meanings on life's fringe? With traditional reli\u00ad gion crumbling, and cults proliferating, we need rationality now more than evet (See SI, \"Principles of Skepticism,\" May-June 1995). And if one impossibility is discussed then all are tacitly under discussion, whether or not it's Lewis Carroll's breakfast time. When the normal rules of exclusion and usual categories are exceeded, or tossed out, then no one can limit the discussion to defined terms and nothing can be declared irrelevant. That's \"How, then, is reality determined? Is it decided by simple belief, or by the application of logic and the scientific method? Science fiction can help us think about these matters.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 21 FICTION why cranks are so difficult to exorcise from serious inquiry into things paranormal and mat's why established, \"legitimate\" sci\u00ad entists rarely want to wander far afield of their disciplines. They dare not risk being called undisciplined, or worse, fall into the trap of trying to prove a negative. Art, as well as science, tries to find meaning; and science fic\u00ad tion in particular tries to make the search rational, understand\u00ad able, and communicable, by thinking ahead, considering alter\u00ad natives, and trying to plan for a realistic mental attitude toward change and adaptation. But of late too many seem to prefer thrashing about, hoping to stumble upon something. It's craft versus inspiration, Baroque versus Romantic, the scientific method versus divine revelation. That doesn't mean the search for meaning is necessarily invalid, however, if, as many assert, it is die journey that counts most. We should cover our mouths when we scoff sponta\u00ad neously, and beg pardon. After all, an insistence that there be room for ghosts, as well as for many other unexplained things, permeates humanity. We apparently want mystery, and we always have. As Einstein wrote in his essay \"The World As I See It,\" \"The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fun\u00ad damental emotion which stands at the cradle of true an and true science. We want meaning, too, that can be seen as counterpoint to mystery. And who could deny the importance of the search for meaning; these days, there seems a particularly desperate need for meaning in all too many lives. Consider Einstein again from the same essay: \"The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow-creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.\" Science fiction can be a method of bringing such meaning to the needy. If our lives and this world mean nothing, then all is futile\u2014 and that thought is intolerable. Groups of scientists deny and dismiss such things as ghosts, yet talk about quantum mechan\u00ad ics as if Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland were a blueprint. \"In the world of quantum mechanics, the laws of physics that are familiar from the everyday world no longer work,\" scientist and writer John Gribbin tells us in his excellent book In Search of Shrodinger's Cat. Some of it, such as fractals and chaos theory, is downright counterintuitive and even scary. It's hair-raising when quantum mechanics starts talking about the observer creating the observed, and it requires real work to link the quantum with the cosmological, the singularity with the quotidian. People sense a conflict of meanings when sober scientists tell them that Schrodinger's cat is neither dead nor alive, but poten- 22 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FICTION. tially both, and only observing one or the other affects the cat's state. As Niels Bohr said, \"Anyone who is not shocked by quan\u00ad tum theory has not understood it.\" People sense a dichotomy of meanings when they compare what science seems to say to what their life experiences seem to hint. That's when admitting ignorance helps. Ghosts are not defined. We don't know what they are, whether they are hallu\u00ad cinations somehow hardwired into the human brain, or glimpses of other worlds, or afterlives, or tricks of light and shadow, or ripples of interference from some pure frequency realm, or more of gravy than the grave. That's the simple truth. We don't know. And admittedly some of the stories and ideas are so darned appealing. Tests cannot be performed on anecdotes, however, and although demographic, statistical, and other analyses can be per\u00ad formed on anecdotal evidence, the results are descriptions, topographies, and inconclusive overviews. The nitty-gritty remains unreached, if it's there at all. Maybe someday someone will come up with a new way of investigating such things, a way that answers more questions than it prompts. Until then we're stuck with being honest and that means, unfortunately, being undecided because to leap to a faith and decide on an answer would be to wallow in prejudice at this stage of our knowledge. \"Undedded\" is another way of saying \"open-minded,\" meaning the question remains open. It may never be closed. And that possibility shouldn't stop us from checking into unusual claims as carefully and honesdy as possible. In literature, science fiction as a way of thinking helps us do that very thing in the same way that the scientific method as a way of thinking can help decide more tangible questions. It's in our nanirp m i\u00bbjnt jtruc i c. This doesn't stop us, though, from wanting, and experienc\u00ad ing, and maybe even projecting meanings, too. Ay, there's the rub. The fact that inexplicables have been widi us for as long as we can remember, combined with the fact that they have never yet been defined, let alone explained, leads us to wonder why they hold such attraction for us. Why do supernatural ideas seem to hold such potential meaning? They attract like static cling and spark like lightning, such wonders. Can the meaning be the mystery of ourselves? Alone each anecdote of ghosdy encounter sounds like a dream, and like a dream, it's of compelling interest to, and seems to hold the inexpressible meaning for, only die person who experienced it. \"After a while these stories of ghosts all sound alike, and they don't add up to much,\" says Daniel Waltimire, writer and researcher of strange events. \"I keep checking into them because there must be something to them, some meaning in all the madness. And I guess the search means something, too.\" It's exactly that search for meaning the science fiction can illuminate. In aggregate the anecdotes convince us only that something's going on and that people are involved. Anecdotal evidence is never the best, but it's the best we have. That fact alone speaks volumes. Be fair. Certainty shouldn't stem from pressure, no matter how graceful we prove to be while enduring it. Cool analysis shouldn't be attempted in the heat of the moment, and experi\u00ad ence is but raw material for thought and meaning. Consider Ernest Hemingway's out-of-body experience when the bomb came down near him as he sat eating cold pasta with cheese. He captured the raw material of experience, then employing the facts as best he could, wrote it as truthfully in fiction as possible and left the finding of meaning to the reader. Science fiction's tropes permit just diis sort of approach. We must stress the difference between fact and truth. Great trudis are to be found in much art, even in science fiction, lowly though that art may be, even as the factual content varies wildly, widely. And how often have we read ostensible nonfiction\u2014 today's newspaper will serve as example\u2014that failed to convince us of its truth regardless of how stuffed with facts it might have been? And have you ever had an anxiety attack? Try telling your\u00ad self intellectually that everytJiing's fine. Your emotions don't believe you. Parents know this dichotomy well, and often must struggle against feelings in order to do what they know intellec\u00ad tually to be rational, orderly, and right. And of the argument that we'll believe it when we see it, con\u00ad sider that even ghosts, no matter what sort comes to mind, in or out of machines, are of relative importance only. If there are no atheists in foxholes, tJien the converse must also be acknowl\u00ad edged, that precious few people in foxholes can spare a moment to ponder metaphysical or philosophical questions. Like most of us most of the rime, they're busy. We rarely give ghosts and their iik tame to affect our lives. Ghosts, while bereft of fact, are fraught with meaning. Yet the nature, depth, and intensity of rhe meaning vary from individual to individual and perhaps even from moment to moment. Hauntings are not repeatable, ghosts don't stand still for mea\u00ad surements or other analysis, and they aren't predictable. Science fiction as a new metric can take such anomalies and fit them into orderly, rational, and at least human-controlled environments. This is one of science fiction's greatest services. As a way of drink\u00ad ing, as a tool for thought, science fiction can open closed minds. Science fiction seeks meaning, even with ghosts, but it puts its money on the writers, readers, and thinkers among us. It employs restraint and form to release creativity, as in a sonnet. Ancient astronauts aren't needed in order to explain ancient monumental construction, because man is capable of more than the Erich von Danikens among us admit or imagine. And just because we can't do something now doesn't mean people could\u00ad n't have done it back then, all on their own. Extraordinary things flow every day from ordinary people. It's not a matter of whether we believe in ghosts. What mat\u00ad ters is whether we believe in ourselves. Both exist, but only one deserves a chance of proving the other a fake. What a grand SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 23 SCIENCE FICTION what if' such a Quod erat demonstrandum would be. Science fiction can act as a new metric for measuring mean\u00ad ing in our world. In this way, science fiction can be more than just popular. And it is popular. Most of die all-rime popular movies have been science fiction. Isn't it rime for the science in science fiction to reach out to its vast audience of seekers-after- meaning? Or will we let it all go Celestine soft? Scientists in particular ought to rally. They ought to write sci\u00ad ence fiction with emphasis on science and show how astounding reality can be when clearly perceived, and use science fiction's elbow room to offer some balance to fringe science and die para\u00ad normal. Tackle die things real science won't touch. Fear no sub\u00ad ject matter, and write as honesdy as they can. Say what diey mean, and meaning will accrue with interest in what they say. Despite its garish, pulpy genesis and tendency to go soft and hollow, science fiction can remain relevant and continue to be die leading-edge literature of the possible and the real, if the sci\u00ad ence is emphasized by knowledgeable writers. Each time we read or write science fiction, we ought to take responsibility for a new aspect of humanity, and make sure it measures up. Our resdess shades exist in shades of meaning, shades as var\u00ad ied, subde and complex as humanity itself. \"The question is,\" said Humpry Dumpty, \"Which is to be master, that's all.\" \u2014Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass Skepticism and Science Fiction GREG BEAR Is science fiction writing a guilty plea\u00ad sure, or a social necessity? Bodi, I'm sure. Like sex and a good many other natural phenomena, an must be a little disreputable to be any good, and science fiction writing is nothing if not an art. But too much ill repute, and the an, like sex, turns sour. The aim of science fiction (we must cry out again and again) is to entertain, but of course different audiences find dif\u00ad ferent things entertaining. The audience I write for is particularly intrigued by die notion that we can chink and feel our way into forward times, mat we can open the daddy wrapped package of the future before die allowed Christmas morning. The enjoyable shiver of realization comes from a willing (but thoroughly skeptical) suspension of disbelief. Every step of the way, my audience is analyzing, correct\u00ad ing, criticizing\u2014in short, playing a won\u00ad derful, interactive game of ideational ten\u00ad nis. If I falter at any point in my serve, the audience gives audible groans of dis\u00ad belief, and die game is over! It's a tough game. Perhaps die audi\u00ad ence is not always as critical as I imagine, but I still watch every serve carefully. I know diat someday a respected scientist or fellow science fiction writer is going to deliver a smashing return, shouting tri\u00adumphantly: \"Gotcha! If charge isn't con\u00ad served when you create matter and anti\u00ad matter, it violates basic rules ...\" or \"No isolated farming-based society would ever function diat way, because ...\" or \"Your female character is completely unbeliev\u00ad able in diat situation, because.. ..\" In many respects, die rules for writing science fiction are similar to diose for writing any kind of fiction. We just have to create many more aspects of die world. To create diose aspects, we have to understand, at the very least, the gram\u00ad mar of reality: die syntax of real events, which helps us decide how future events might be constructed. I believe diat science fiction writing, at its finest, is an enormous leap of skep\u00ad tical imagination. It is also a test of die writer, tougher dian any odier aesdieric test I know, for not only do we go up against a tough-minded audience (in principle, at least) but reality itself! In diis respect, science fiction writing is quite perishable; as perishable as modem scien\u00ad tific knowledge, which is vulnerable to replacement and improvement. If science fiction frequendy deals widi notions considered impossible by current science, diat is hardly unscientific; we are reminded again and again of advances diat destroy the impossibilities of past diinkers. The art is in choosing which impossibilities to shatter, which future advancements to promote to reality. Some writers lovingly cling to time travel and faster-than-light travel; others, to some form of psionic energy. I'm more doubtful about psionic energy than faster-dian-light travel, but I'm willing to be persuaded\u2014and not by some oppor\u00ad tunistic self-deluding charlatan, but by a magnificent, entertaining, truly talented charlatan\u2014that is, a real artist! The true artist, in science fiction at least, knows the difference between his or her fiction and reality. The delusional, no-talent charlatans may scoop in more money, but die game is truly not worth the coin. I sleep much better at night than diey should. This brings up a case in point that illustrates the real role of skepticism in science fiction. Rumor has it diat L. Ron Hubbard, a pretty good science fiction writer of die 1940s, made a conscious decision that science fiction was a mug's game, and that die real money was in starting a religion. So he did, using sci\u00ad ence fiction magazines and a gullible, diough very famous, science fiction edi- Greg Bear is a Nebula and Hugo award- winning author of such novels as Beyond Heaven's River, Eon, The Force of God, Eternity, Anvil of Stars, Moving Mars, and Legacy, and short stories such as \"Blood Music,\" \"Hardfought,\" and \"Tangents.\" 24 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FICTION tor to get his start. No one knows whether he eventually came to believe in what he wrote and sold to others as revealed truth. If 1 had been Hubbard, I would not have been able to convince myself. I suspect most charlatans realize that diey have perverted very real, very useful aesthetic instincts to hoodwink large numbers of gullible people into believing and paying. When we stop being artists, and start being money-grubbing pseudoprophets, me net is down, the ball can go anywhere in the court, and the audience has changed. This audience knows so little, and cares so litde about the truth, that it oohs and aahs at every random serve, every double bounce, every net ball. It does not perceive die difference between an earned point and a flub. The charlatan on the court smiles and receives applause for all. That's not our audience. That's not my game. The Goulden Twig HAL CLEMENT The late John Arrend Timm, most memorable of my chemistry pro\u00ad fessors, had the common difficulty with students who wanted to carry analo\u00ad gies like me solar-system image of die atom a trifle too far. I don't know how many rimes I heard him say with empha\u00ad sis, and sometimes with a bit of annoy\u00ad ance, \"Every analogy has its limitations; if it didn't it would be an identity.\" Analogies seem to be a teaching neces\u00ad sity; learning something new that has no connection whatever widi earlier experi\u00ad ence is very, very difficult, and \"Proceeding from the known to the Uiikiiown\" is an aimost universally accepted teaching technique. Even die fact thar our imaginations have great difficulty in merging die wavelike and parriclelike aspects of light has not, as far as I know, inspired any physics teacher to try to bypass both analogies entirely. (Observational selection may be operating here, of course; efforts simply may not have succeeded, so I never heard of diem.) At primary, secondary, and popular teaching levels, where die customer is likely to be unfamiliar with much mathe\u00ad matical symbology, we have to fall back on verbal and pictorial analogies. One of my favorites of diese is used often by Stephen Jay Gould in his efforts to point out that evolution is not a simple tree trunk lead\u00ad ing from \"lower\" to \"higher\" life forms. He pictures a bush, and employs various verbal techniques to convey the complex\u00ad ity and randomness of its branching, the essentially endless variety of directions the growdi may take, and lack of preference for any particular one of diese\u2014diat is, the absence of an upward-dirusring trunk. I like to apply die same evolution anal\u00ad ogy to die growdi of human knowledge. It applies nicely to my personal interest, sci\u00ad ence. I may be grazing one of Dr. Gould's analogy limitations when I do this, because there does seem to be a direction of sorts to the knowledge growth\u2014toward greater probability of correctness\u2014but maybe diis is an illusion and, like life vari\u00ad eties, we are merely expanding in all avail\u00ad able directions. I tend to concentrate on the individual twig. It follows a process of growth, start\u00ad ing widi a bud of speculation. This grows to die length of a hypothesis, where test\u00ad ing of the increasingly detailed idea becomes possible. If it doesn't get nibbled off by a dinosaur (in other words, fail in testing), it reaches the status of a theory (\"only\" a theory, as die creationists put it) and becomes a real branch. The analogy does not extend to die idealistic level of representing a completely established fact, of course. This is all right; real life seldom does this either. It is conceivable, after all, that die earth is a cube embedded in a set of force fields which so alter gravitational, electric, and magnetic lines of force and die paths of electromagnetic waves and momentum vectors dial we are deceived into thinking the planet neariy spherical (you could probably find someone who would regard diis suggestion as sheer inspiration; please don't blame me for someone's misuse of an illustrative exam- pie). In die bush analogy, my self-support\u00ad ing hobby of science fiction plays a demonstrable part in the development of human ideas. It operates at the base of the branch, at die speculative start and a litde way\u2014sometimes quite a respectable way\u2014 out into die hypothesis sections. There are speculations about parallel worlds, personality transposition, and life in die sun that, at least until recendy, no one would have wanted to publish in any other form and for which no suggestions for testing have been offered. There are hypotheses, quite testable, on why crater- lets on the floor of Plato (a 100-km-wide crater on die moon) are sometimes visible dirough a giver, telescope am! sometimes not, under what seem to be identical view\u00ad ing conditions. I suggested one, involving magnetic focusing of solar particles, some decades ago in The Strolling Astronomer, organ of the Association of Lunar and Hal Clement (Harry Clement Stubbs) is one of the most scientifically oriented sci\u00ad ence fiction writers. His first story, \"Proof,\" appeared in the June 1942 Astounding Science Fiction (now Analog) magazine, and his first novel Needle was serialized there in 1949. His best-known story (unfortunately, he feels), \"Mission of Gravity,\" appeared in 1953. Other novels are Iceworld, Close to Critical, Star Light, Still River, and Fossil. He was a B-24 pilot in World War II and later a technical instructor, retiring as a full colonel in 1976.

It produced a resounding silence among professional astronomers. However, 1 based a science fiction story, \"Dust Rag,\" on die same idea a few years later, it sold readily, has been anthologized more dian once since, and 1 have been told of its use in sec\u00ad ondary school science classes. As far as I know, diere has been no attempt to check die hypothesis direcdy, but die moon's more recendy established lack of a signif\u00ad icant magnetic field does make it unlikely. I can live with this. Science fiction about space travel, sometimes with much detail about propulsion systems and orbit mechanics, by people like Willy Ley and Robert Heinlein, are far enough along the branch to let one hold on and climb. I invented for science fiction purposes in 1960 an astronomical body I called a \"Superjovian.\" It has since become quite respectable under die name of \"brown dwarf.\" (Discovery of the first brown dwarf, an object known as Gliese 229 B, has recendy been confirmed by astronomers.) I would say not to worry about the limits of this or any odier analogy. It's bet\u00ad ter to have fun with die intellectual ecol\u00ad ogy to be found in and around the bush. Science Fiction and Scientific Possibilities FREDERIK POHL Eugene R. Stewart proposes an agenda for science fiction writers, but his article makes me wonder if he knows what science fiction is. The only work he discusses at any length is Poltergeist, which is not science fiction at all. Poltergeist is a kind of horror-fantasy, and that is a whole other breed of cat. The themes of fantasy derive from myth and superstition. Science fiction is reality- based. It deals with events that haven't happened yet, to be sure, and may well never happen at all. But the reader should be able to believe, while reading the story, that under some circumstances some\u00ad thing very like diose events just might come true ... and no well person believes th.it about fantasy. Can science fiction be used, as Stewart urges, \"to explore paranormal and fringe- Frederik Pohl is award Master\" Nebula awarded for lifetime con\u00ad tributions to science fiction), a six-time Hugo award winner (he is the only person ever to have won the Hugo both as writer and as editor), and a past president of both World SF and the Science Fiction Writers of America. His most recent sci\u00ad ence fiction novels include Mining die Oort and The World at the End of Time. science issues ? Perhaps. Despite what I said above, some science fiction writers have tried to apply die more or less orderiy procedures of science fiction to die diemes of fantasy. Among odiers, James Blish attempted to provide a scientific rationale for telepathy in his novel Jack of Eagles; Larry Niven and Robert A. Heinlein tried to do die same for magic in various works; others have occasionally tried to do so for were\u00ad wolves, vampires, and even astrology. Some entertaining stories resulted from diese attempts. However, diey could not have done much to further die objec\u00ad tives of CSICOP, namely: to counteract beliefs in superstition or die occult. In fact, I fear diat stories of this sort must inevitably go some way toward rein\u00ad forcing these beliefs. Any attempt to use such stories to counteract superstition is foredoomed by the fact that, in order to discuss these paranormal phenomena in rational terms, the writer has to pretend diat the ghosts and goblins and psychic phenomena are real in die first place . . . in effect, validating diose beliefs diem. Poltergeist suffers from one other prob\u00ad lem in that it is a film, not a book or short story. Film does not offer a hospitable venue for intellectual discussion, because that is the nature of film: movies wonder\u00adfully stimulate die senses and excite the emotions, but of rational intellectual con\u00ad tent diere is seldom very much. What science fiction can profitably do to counteract superstidon is to explore the wonders of real scientific possibilities as they relate to the real wodd\u2014even some possible future real world very far removed from present existence. But that is precisely what a great many science fic\u00ad tion writers have been doing\u2014in print media, if not in film\u2014for the last half- century and more. If diere is anyone not familiar with the field who is interested in seeing how this is done, she or he would be well advised to stay away from die moviehouses and go to a bookstore or the public library. I am reluctant to recommend specific works because to name a few is to leave out scores of others diat are equally deserving, but some recent novels worth a look would include works by Ursula K. LeGuin, Kim Stanley Robinson, Greg Benford, Vernor Vinge, and many others. (They might even include some of my own books.) It is true diat, even in print science fic\u00ad uon, diere is a vast number of stories which are as meretricious in dieir own way as any horror flick, but that's not sur\u00ad prising; it is only an example of Sturgeons Law. That is die dictum laid down long ago by die late Theodore Sturgeon, one of die most gifted of sci\u00ad ence fiction (and also fantasy) writers. What Sturgeon's Law says is: \"Ninety per\u00ad cent of science fiction is crud. But dien, ninety percent of everything is crud.\" IZI 26 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 2) This is the second of a two-part report of a recent CSICOP delegation to the People's Republic of China. In this article the authors describe their participation in a symposium on pseudoscience in China, held in Beijing and their further interactions with practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shanghai. WALLACE SAMPSON AND BARRY L. BEYERSTEIN Tn Part 1 of this report (SI, July/August 1996) we dis- . cussed the principles of Traditionai Chinese Medicine JL (TCM) and our observations of how it is practiced today in the Peoples Republic of China. We also described research we had observed during our visit to China that is attempting to identify those empirically verifiable portions of TCM that could be incorporated into scientific medical practice. This opportunity was afforded us by an invitation from the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) to visit various centers in China and to participate in a symposium on pseudoscience held in Beijing in June of 1995. In this article we address the broader topic of the growth of pseudoscience in China, and present additional SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/OctoOer 1996 27 observations of TCM as seen in centers in Shanghai. The CAST Symposium Part of our stay in Beijing was occupied by a seminar spon\u00ad sored by CAST and the State Science and Technology Commission. There, Chinese scholars and physicians described the problems created by pseudoscience in their country. These authors and their fellow membet of the dele\u00ad gation (Andrew Skolnick of the Journal of the American Medical Association) traded similar experiences from the U.S. and Canada. We had expected this to be one of the highlights of our trip, and we were not disappointed. CAST had assem\u00ad bled an impressive roster of social, physical, and medical sci\u00ad entists from various parts of China who described the obsta\u00ad cles that belief in Qigong1 and some of the extreme claims of TCM have put in the way of their efforts to improve scientific literacy. From these presentations we achieved many insights that would otherwise have been much more speculative. All Chinese speakers at the symposium made a clear distinc\u00ad tion between \"internal Qi\" and \"external Qi.\" The former equates roughly to what we would call \"psychosomatic medicine\"; while believers consider the latter to be a supernatural life force that, like psychokinesis, can affect matter outside one's body (believers refer to this as \"special ability\" or \"extraordinary functions of the human body\"). Belief in this dubious power was repeatedly defined at the symposium as Chinas major pseudoscience problem. Qigong was briefly out\u00ad lawed during the cultural revolution (1966\u20141976) because it seemed too spiritual for die reigning Marxist materialists. It has since managed to stage a comeback by masquerading as a sci\u00ad ence. Qigong masters and their disciples routinely defraud the public with conjuring tricks and falsely present themselves as spiritual healers (Lin et al., in press). Honest practitioners of TCM eschew such deceptive practices, but they still adhere to the mystical notion that an imbalance of internal Qi energy underlies all illness. Many of the TCM doctors we interviewed still believe that specially gifted healers can use their external Qi to cure diseases by restoring the balance of a sufferer's internal Qi. A few Chinese scientists we met maintained that although Qi is merely a metaphor, it is still a useful physiological abstraction (e.g., that die related concepts of Yin and Yang parallel modern scientific notions of endocrinologic and meta\u00ad bolic feedback mechanisms). They see this as a useful way to unite Eastern and Western medicine. Their more hard-nosed colleagues quiedy dismissed Qi as only a philosophy, bearing no tangible relationship to modern physiology and medicine.2 The first group of speakers at die CAST symposium con-Brain research laboratory at the Department of Neurobiology, Shanghai Medical University. centrated on external Qi. After Chinese investigators and the earlier CSICOP delegation had exposed several prominent Qigong masters as charlatans (Alcock et al. 1988), die govern\u00ad ment was persuaded to crack down on their ilk (some have gone underground, but many still continue to enjoy protec\u00ad tion provided by high-level state officials). We did not deter\u00ad mine the extent of the crackdown, but we learned that many Qigong masters are still active, especially in the countryside. We were also told that we would not be able to observe any masters or \"special ability\" children because diey would no longer cooperate. This was disappointing but it is a tribute to our hosts' debunking efforts that local performers are now too wary of being caught, as they were when exposed by James Alcock, James \"die Amazing\" Randi, and the other members of the first CSICOP delegation. Mr. Lin Zixin, the retired editor of China's Science and Technology Daily and a CSICOP Fellow, was one of our prin\u00ad cipal hosts. At the symposium, which he helped organize, he discussed die extent of belief in pseudoscience in China. He credited the 1988 CSICOP dele\u00ad gation with helping to tarnish the reputation of the Qigong \"super\u00ad man,\" Xiao, but admitted much remains to be done. He com\u00ad pared widely held superstitions about the power of external Qi in China to the beliefs that inspired the Japanese sect, \"Aum Shinri Kyo\" (the cult that attacked the Tokyo subway with nerve gas). Mr. Lin, one of China's top sci\u00ad entific journalists and policy experts, described the extent of superstition in China as shameful and a threat to die nation's technological develop\u00ad ment. Scientific literacy is more important than ever as China tackles die arduous task of modernizing its economy, he said, but superstition continues to impede progress. Mr. Lin firmly reiterated his organization's support for CSICOP's efforts to combat pseudoscience worldwide. Professor Qui Renzong of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences compared the development of American and Chinese pseudoscience. He drew parallels between the concept of external Qi and the mysterious nonmaterial forces posited by parapsychologists, such as psychokinesis and extrasensory per\u00ad ception. Professor Qui echoed Mr. Lin's assertion that the Qigong movement has had a negative influence on Chinese society. Professor Qui lamented the fact diat it has also been psychologically damaging for some devotees, and that even some scientists have been duped into believing in the power of external Qi\u2014for example, an ardent promoter is Professor Qian Xuesen, China's foremost rocket scientist and a former professor at the California Institute of Technology. Professor Qui concluded with die memorable phrases: \"It's only your private experience, if it is not tepeatable,\" and \"pseudoscience is an infinite regression of excesses.\" 28 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Professor Wang Guozheng of the China Society for Dialectics of Nature continued the dieme that pseudoscience is becoming a major social problem. He described his investiga\u00ad tion of \"seeing wirJi ears,\" a trick similar to the \"blind reading\" exposed by Martin Gardner in his famous article on the \"peek- down-the-side-of-the-nose\" ruse.' Professor Wang ended this inquiry when he concluded that it was a wortJiless fad that would disappear on its own. Apparendy it did not, despite its affront to official Marxist dialectical materialism. In ten years, not one claim had been substantiated, yet popular belief con\u00ad tinued to grow. Such concerns led Professor Wang to found the Society for die Protection of die Scientific Spirit. Its aim is to promote scientific attitudes and combat the growing influence of pseudoscience. The society has encountered opposition from paranormalists, such as when a Qigong advocate who was rejected as a speaker at one of its meetings disrupted the pro\u00ad ceedings by trying to force his way onto die program physically. It seems Chinese skeptics are vulnerable to many of the same tactics as diose endured by their Western counterparts. Dt. Zhang Tongling, profes\u00ad sor of psychiatry at Beijing Medical University, presented her research on negative effects of Qigong practices. She believes that diere is no such thing as Qi, but she found that some vulnera\u00ad ble people, drawn into the Qi subculture, have been harmed psychologically by obsessional involvement with diese brearh- j. .

Forty-four were classed as workers, thirty-nine were government employees, thirty were students, and thirty-one were engaged in scientific research. The group was found to be highly suggestible and their symp\u00ad toms were related to various alleged effects of Qi contained in books they had read. Dr. Zhang described dieir responses as a form of mental illness, probably the result of latent psychiatric problems that were exacerbated by fanatical immersion in Qigong exercises. Many of these problems looked like those we would call hysterical or psychosomatic symptoms (Shorter Wallace Sampson is clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine (Division of Hematology!Medical Oncology, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, 751 South Bascom Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95128). He is hoard chair\u00ad man of the National Council Against Health Fraud and a Fellow of CSICOP. Barry L Beyerstein is associate professor of psychol\u00ad ogy and member of the Brain Behavior Laboratory at Simon Fraser University (Burnaby B. C, V5A 1S6, Canada). He is a Fellow and member of the Executive Council of CSICOP 1992). For example, they reported feeling Qi surging through various parts of their bodies, and some would experience over\u00ad whelming lassitude that they attributed to Qi suddenly drain\u00ad ing from their bodies. In other cases, experiences were pro\u00ad voked that were psychotic, including visual and auditory hal\u00ad lucinations, delirium, and feelings of being possessed by ani\u00ad mal spirits. Some exhibited symptoms we would classify as paranoid, such as the conviction they were being harmed by the master's power or that Qi had imbued them with extraor\u00ad dinary skills and a mission to cure diseases or save humanity. Some patients felt elated, perhaps manic, after their prolonged exertion, while others were left uncomfortably anxious, depressed, and suicidal. The severity was the worst in those who spent many hours per day immersed in Qigong exercises and in those with a long history of preoccupation with reli\u00ad gious or superstitious pursuits. Dr. Zhang's portrayals were reminiscent of people we had encountered who were obsessed with alien-abduction fantasies or had become fanatically immersed in Transcendental Meditation, Scientology, or irra\u00ad tional health schemes, leading at times to behavior that bordered on the delusional. Professor Guo Zhengyi, deputy director of CAST, has vis\u00ad ited the United States where he studied organizations dedicated to spreading pseudoscience. In his talk, he compared them to similar movements in China. He described a Mafialike network in China that has spread its influ\u00ad ence by promoting (allegedly real) magical powers and fortune- teiiing in conjunction with acrobatic shows. These shady fig\u00ad ures bill themselves as the future of science but, like pseudo- scientists everywhere, they mangle all valid scientific princi\u00ad ples. Their lucrative scams include Qigong demonstrations composed of fake acts of clairvoyance, superhuman physical strength, and \"possession by animals.\" Professor Guo likened the practices of these roaming hucksters to practices that were common in feudalistic times, a theme that was taken up by his colleague, Dr. Yuan Zhong. Dr. Yuan emphasized that official materialist doctrines have merely suppressed, not eliminated, the strong desire of the masses to believe in ancient spiritual entities and magical powers. The pseudoscientific patina of Qigong has allowed these old religious beliefs to reemerge in a way that is less likely to arouse official ire. Dr. Yuan referred to Qigong as a pseudoreligion, one that is growing as the regime relaxes its demands for strict ideological conformity. Occasionally, the chicanery of some of these impostors reaches proportions that spur the government to intervene. The offi\u00ad cial responses were not spelled out, but we discovered in pri\u00ad vate conversation that these tricksters are usually warned and fined. Professor Zu Shuxian of Anhui Medical University was one Andrew Skolnick with two of n Hai Qiang, Andrew Skolnick, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 29 of the most trenchant critics of Qi as a medical concept. Having done postgraduate training in epidemiology at the University of Virginia, he was well qualified to discuss why problems of medical quackery are worse in developing coun\u00ad tries. Particularly in rural areas, folk-healing traditions and modest education make it difficult for people to distinguish between legitimate and bogus doctors. In addition, developing countries have as yet little in the way of consumer movements that could help protect citizens from quacks. Dr. Zu denounced die press for promoting quackery and for its appar\u00ad ent inability to disdnguish between scientifically valid and sham treatments. He lamented the tendency to credit patient satisfaction instead of rigorous testing as the measure of ther\u00ad apeutic success. Fraudulent medical institutions are now com\u00ad peting with legitimate ones for money, while government funding for university research is diminishing. Once again, Chinas problems parallel our own. Also familiar to us was an interruption by a student at this session. He complained that sci\u00ad entifically trained Chinese physi\u00ad cians do not spend enough time with patients and do not offer enough emotional support, and that diis feeds the popularity of quacks. Beyerstein, Sampson, and Skolnick delivered papers dealing with various aspects of fraud and pseudoscience in health care and the proper methodology for test\u00ad ing putative treatments. The CAST conference made it apparent, as Michael Fumento has tided his recent book, that science is under siege\u2014not just in North America and Europe, but in China, as well.' There, as here, superstition, quackery, and pseudoscience have infil\u00ad trated academia, and some prominent scientists and philoso\u00ad phers are among the leading apologists. Their appeal to ancient magical ways of thinking, cloaked in pseudoscientific language, sounded depressingly familiar to us. In China, pseu\u00ad doscience is becoming increasingly competitive with science for public support and government funding. The extent to which Chinese criminal elements have used superstition and pseudoscience to bilk the gullible public was news to us, how\u00ad ever. Chinese academics are becoming more aware of possible psychological harms resulting from involvement with pseudo- science and quack sects and cults. In 1994, awareness of these growing problems led the Chinese government to issue a proclamation decrying the rise of superstition and pseudo- science and the erosion of science education (Sagan 1996). It seems that for many Chinese, the concept of Qi supplies an all-encompassing vision of life and its role within the cosmos as a whole. Qi has become a comfortable explanation for everything. Unfortunately, something that purports to explain everything explains nothing. On to Shanghai After a day spent trekking the Great Wall, our tour of China then moved on to Shanghai. There we were hosted by friends of CAST officials who were academics, but not themselves associated with scientific institutions. They were able, however, to introduce us to a variety of practitioners of TCM. Before exploring local TCM facilities, we were given a chance to inter\u00ad act with conventional biomedical scientists during a most interesting tour of the brain research laboratories at Shanghai Medical University. The research problems, techniques, and apparatus we encountered at this well-equipped institute were familiar to us; and the work we discussed with these Chinese neuroscientists revealed that they are working at the forefront of their fields. After this tour, our focus shifted back to TCM. We next visited the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its affiliated Shu Guang Hospital\u2014the largest TCM complex in China. The views expressed there were somewhat different from those we had encountered at the Beijing TCM Institute (Beyerstein and Sampson 1996), especially with regard to integration of scientific and traditional medicine. At the Shanghai institute, where the pri\u00ad mary mission was the teaching of TCM, the president, Dr. Wang Ling Tai, was also a gastroenterol- ogist who practices scientific bio- medicine. As in Beijing, we were told that TCM was requested by less dian twenty percent of the patient population. (It seems that self-medication with herbs is more pervasive in the country as a whole, however. The fifteen-to-twenty-percent figure refers to those patients who choose to see a TCM doctor.) After a long and enjoyable meeting with Dr. Wang, we were shown through the complex, which appeared similar in setup to the clinic com\u00ad plex in Beijing. We were shown a major manufacturing facility for antibiotics that we were told were derived originally from traditional herbal medicines. This aspect of TCM made sense to us because we knew diat penicillin, for example, was derived from molds that had long been used in European folk remedies (there are frequent historical references to use of moldy bread for dressing dirty wounds). While in Shanghai, we also toured die largest herbal phar\u00ad macy in China. TCM diagnosticians occupied booths around the periphery of each floor in this multistory building, while herbalists busily moved about the center, filling prescriptions according to die diagnosticians' recipes. With rapid, animated movements, they grabbed handfuls of dried vegetable and ani\u00ad mal matter from rows of drawers stacked in massive cabinets that resembled floor-to-ceiling library card files. The ingredi\u00ad ents were dropped somewhat unceremoniously on hand-held balances and then mixed on large sheets of paper. These were Meeting with the President of the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. L. to r.: Tai Zischer (one of the dele\u00ad gation's hosts), unidentified TCM physician, Andrew Skolnick, Xiao Wan Quan (delegation host), President Wang Ling Tai, Wallace Sampson. 30 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER ilicn folded into dispensing packets and sold to waiting patients, mosdy for preparation as herbal teas. The measure\u00ad ments struck us as radier imprecise by Western pharmaceuti\u00ad cal standards, but greater accuracy might have been illusory because a perennial problem with herbal remedies is that the concentrations of active ingredients in the raw materials can vary greatly from source to source (due to climate, soil condi\u00ad tions, etc.). Also on sale were a variety of over-the-counter remedies that we also saw in department stores, corner phar\u00ad macies, tourist centers, and airports throughout China. Some of these, to our dismay, included preserved bear gall bladder, ground horns and penises of various wild animals, and other animal parts apparendy sold primarily for their alleged ability to enhance sexual potency.' We also saw North American ginseng prominendy displayed in diese stores\u2014it is highly valued in China. Although many bold therapeutic claims are made for ginseng, its scientifically demonstrated effects are more modest. Its complex chemistry stimulates several bodily systems. Ginseng can act as a pick-me-up in a number of ways: it produces caffeinelike effects in die central nervous system, enhances carbo\u00ad hydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis, and may stimulate die heart because it contains some digitalislike components (similar to those found in die common foxglove). It also has histiminic activity, and it contains steroids diat can affect die hormonal sys\u00ad tem (Siegel 1979).' At the Shanghai traditional pharmacy, we encountered for the first rime TCM doctors who still use die ancient technique of pulse diagnosis (see Wallnofer and von Rottauscher 1975). People are said to have fifteen dif\u00ad ferent pulses detectable by traditionally trained healers aldiough these have never been demonstrated scientifically. For us, die doctor placed his fingers on die pulse, stared vacandy into die distance for about a minute, as if absorbing its meaning, and then told us our diagnoses (none of which was accurate). He then wrote a TCM prescription for an off-the-shelf concoction that we filled at die counter. We were also diagnosed by a woman who held our hands and placed a small electrical probe at various points on our palms. From our muscle spasms, grimaces, and verbal descriptions of die tingling sensations, she arrived at a diagnosis, again one that would be news to our family physicians back home. A Meeting with Professors of TCM Our main conference in Shanghai was with about a dozen prominent TCM physicians affiliated with Shu Guang Hospital. Here, die flavor was quite different from die CAST symposium in Beijing, skepticism being much less pro\u00ad nounced. The Chinese doctors, most of whom had scientific The dispensing table at China's largest traditional herbal pharmacy, Shanghai. medical training in addition to their traditional specialties, each gave brief introductory statements. The session was men opened for discussion and questions. We can best describe the event with a sample of our questions and the answers given. We asked our questions as naive Westerners, but widi a per\u00ad spective of scientific inquiry. The answers, as will be evident, highlighted the differences between the scientific oudook and that of TCM. The answers are not verbatim in every case because some were conveyed through a translator. Q: How are the roles of Western-trained and TCM physicians different? A: One example is a woman with cancer who failed with Western treatments and was then treated with TCM and lived four years longer than expected. [This exemplifies one of our major conclusions, namely that TCM still relies predomi- nandy on anecdotal evidence\u2014its practitioners exhibited very little understanding of the need for controlled clinical trials. Most of the group seemed to lack knowledge about how to do sci\u00ad entifically valid evaluations of their techniques.! Q: Do you treat different cancers differently, or do you use the same treatment for all? A: Every case is different, and treatment is different. [Ironically, TCM sees all disease as resulting from the same cause (Qi imbal\u00ad ance), but it sees each patient's case as unique. This answet also illustrates TCM's preoccupation with surface manifestations rather than trying co reveal a more limited number of undedy- ing pathological processes that might manifest themselves in a wider variety of symptoms.} Q: How do the different cancer remedies work, and what are the biochemical mechanisms for combatting cancer cells? A: We arc trying different methods to prevent cancer, espe\u00ad cially in high-risk breast cancer patients\u201417,000 professional women. [Perhaps something was lost in translation.] Many traditional medicines are static TCM is developing. We are examining curative effects and theoretical basis. We regard the patient as oneness. Every patient is \"a small world.\" A major reason for interest in natural developments is traditional Chinese herbs. People are panicking about environmental chemicals, effects now being reversed by TCM. There are breakthroughs. Look at TCM from the Chinese perspective. We say, \"Water the ponies [peonies?] well.\" [For example, pay attention to internal stresses of the patient.] Rather than killing cancer cells, increase internal factors to bring one into balance. TCM doctors see a change in the patterns of things. TCM treats imbalance of the negative and positive sides of things. [In other words, it does not treat disease processes per se.) TCM works well in circulatory disorders\u2014it corrects blood circulation. [This was typical of many answers we received in that it sidestepped the original question and sub\u00ad stituted a rambling string of metaphors instead.] Q: How about ephedra\u2014herbs containing ephedrinc\u2014arc SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 31 there two concepts of how it works\u2014pharmacological and TCM? A: We have adopted several new ways of treating, and that is one [a probable translation problem, so we tried again]. Q: What is the rationale for the treatment with ephedra? A: We have a division here\u2014TCM and Western ways. Doctor recommends the method\u2014sutgery, medicine, or TCM\u2014and the patient decides. Most doctors would use Western medicine first for acute problems, then TCM if needed. Such as with gallstones: opctation first, maybe we would use TCM after\u00ad ward. Same with cancer. Doctors agree on how to combine them. [It was apparent we wete not going to obtain a ditect answer, and so we moved on. The gist of the remainder of this part of the discussion was that TCM is seen as a way of strengthening the body to resist disease in general, not a means of combatting specific diseases.] Q: [To a ncphrologist (kidney specialist) who also uses TCM.] How does TCM tteat a new dis\u00ad ease or change as new concepts of disease atise? Does TCM change? A: We combine TCM and Western medicine in tteatment of kidney disease, but we have dif\u00ad ferent ways in different phases of the illness. At first, we use TCM to prevent progression. In later stages, we also adopt Western ways. We also use TCM in trans\u00ad plants. [Again, we did not the . . Andrew Skolnick having his pulses session, several TCM physicians physician, Shanghai. tried to clarify earlier comments with the following statements: Because of difficulties with cults, we have different definitions [for Qi, etc.]. TCM and Western medicine have sharp differ\u00ad ences in their concepts. Practice speaks the loudest. Results count most. Science is not absolute; it has its limitations, and is also developing. So, each has its own advantages. Fot example. Western [medical] science used to be [exclusively?] biological. Now it is biological and societal. Combining the biological, psychological, and societal occurred 1,500 years ago in China. Western medicine is devel\u00ad oping in die same way. TCM was ahead of Western medicine. TCM works and cures where Western medicine does not; Western medicine is more toxic,7 so they are complementary and can leatn from each other. We hope TCM and Western medicine can help and understand each other. Western proponents say diey know what wotks and now pre\u00ad sent a body of knowledge. Another way to look at it is diat TCM considers the macro or whole body; Western medicine considers the micro. TCM does not apply to all cases; it is bet\u00ad ter for recuperative and chronic cases. Patients understand diis and know where to go. TCM has not only a philosophy, but a background. It is bidirectional. Both TCM and Western medicine concern homeostasis; TCM includes heatt and spirit. From die lab perspective, TCM an improve senile dementia, especially Alzheimer's [disease]. Some biochemical levels return to baseline. We also see aging retarded in humans and animals, and thete ate othet neuro\u00ad chemical and immune changes as well. A notable exception to the generalities presented by most of die rest of this group of TCM physicians was a discussion we had with Dr. Yan De Xin. A scientist who studies the chemistry of traditional herbs, he expressed the belief, in pri\u00ad vate conversation, that many traditional medicines will be found to contain active ingredients of interest to scientific medicine (some of this has already happened\u2014see, e.g., Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 1977). But, unlike most of the sentiments expressed during the Shanghai conference, Dr. Yan was only willing to grant that efficacy on the basis of scientific trials. He has been trying to extract possibly active ingredients from a number of traditional herbs and to subject them to proper dou\u00ad ble-blind tests. His understand\u00ad ing of what needs to be done was impressive but, like researchers everywhere these days, he has been hampered by funding short\u00ad ages. Our meeting with this group of TCM experts ended with a formal dinner, each of the numerous courses flavored by a different Chinese herb used by traditional Chinese physicians. It was explained to us that TCM makes little distinction between the health-giving properties of foods and medicines. External Qigong Although we saw no external Qi demonstrations in China, both of us have observed such exhibitions in the large immi\u00ad grant Chinese communities in our home cities. One was at an American Medical Student Association meeting in San Francisco, April 8, 1995. It was performed by Effie Poy Yew Chow, R. N., for an audience of about one hundred students. She seemed to advocate a combination of Ju Jitsu, suggestion, and \"applied kinesiology.\"' She also claimed (but could not demonstrate), as we heard in China, that Qigong masters can transport Qi energy several thousand miles to alter the molec\u00ad ular structure of water. The students seemed to enjoy the lec\u00ad ture and, surprisingly, none challenged Ms. Chow's rather extreme claims. Barry Beyerstein had an equally unfulfilling encounter with a famous Qigong master in Vancouver.' Previously, this author's brother. Dale Beyerstein, had investi\u00ad gated some prominent TCM practitioners in the Vancouver area and found them dangerously wanting in medical knowl\u00ad edge (D. F. Beyerstein 1990).10 read by a traditional Chinese 32 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Conclusion Looking back at our discussions with TCM proponents in China, it often seemed that our questions and their answers came from two different worlds. It soon became apparent to us that this is equally true when die scientific and traditional med\u00ad ical communities in China try to communicate. This was obvi\u00ad ous in the wide gap between the remarks of the academics and physicians gathered by CAST in Beijing, and the answers given by most of the TCM physicians we encountered in Beijing and Shanghai. The former spoke in terms we could understand, emphasizing the requirement to support claims with evidence and the need to understand such demonstrable effects TCM might produce in terms of scientifically verifiable biological mechanisms. Although the speakers at the CAST meeting in Beijing tended not to demean TCM during their presentations, several of them dismissed it in private conversations. The rest refrained from making rationalizations for TCM. The statements of the TCM physicians, on the other hand, tended to be rambling, global, and tangential (this was not merely a language barrier, for many of them spoke excellent English). The traditionalists were difficult to pin down because when they had no available answer, the question would be redirected. While TCM physi\u00ad cians downplayed the impor\u00ad tance of approaches d_i i_ ii j i. i Andrew Skolnick being diagnosed placebo-controlled clinical ( ,or trials, they did not hesitate to enlist such data when it seemed to their advantage. We came away with the strong feeling that the TCM community, with a few exceptions, does not really understand the power of the placebo effect nor the need for double-blind clinical trials. They seemed not to comprehend why we were not impressed by testimonials or anecdotes about individuals who had recov\u00ad ered after TCM treatments. Many claims seemed inflated, such as that for TCM's effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease and AIDS (see, e.g., Hou 1991). In the end, we were left with the same sense of frustration we often felt after arguing with advo\u00ad cates of \"alternative medicine\" at home. Both exhibit an essen\u00ad tial vagueness when explaining the mechanisms presumed to underlie their treatments. Both are prone to assume that metaphors count as explanations and that anecdotal evidence can substitute for systematic verification of claims. Several speakers in both Beijing and Shanghai laced their discussions with political references, for example, to the evils of feudalistic times, the unwillingness to be subjected to logic (dialectics), and inhibitions to social progress. It seems that the practice of TCM and the concepts of internal and external Qi place China in a dilemma. Advancement of these ideas, espe\u00ad cially overseas, increases China's prestige and is a matter of cul\u00ad tural pride. Yet the inherent mysticism and magical thinking in these notions are an embarrassment to the Marxist ratio\u00ad nalism of the government and to the scientific community as a whole. Furthermore, the growing involvement of criminal elements in paranormal spheres, as occurs to some extent in all countries, is considered a growing threat to social order. Overall, we perceived a delicate balancing act, between tolera\u00ad tion and encouragement of TCM on the one hand, and attempts to restrict its more extreme manifestations, such as external Qi quackery, on the other. We ended our tour unconvinced that Traditional Chinese Medicine has objectively proven its claims to cure any specific diseases. Acupuncture has some mild analgesic [lowered sensi\u00ad tivity to pain while conscious] properties and Chinese herbs have already yielded to scientific analysis some useful drugs\u2014 undoubtedly more will follow. We could find no scientific support for the use of cupping, moxibustion, and acupuncture for infectious diseases, deafness, and congenital deformities. We acknowledge the emotional comfort Chinese patients suf\u00ad fering from chronic or fatal disor\u00ad ders receive from TCM ministra\u00ad tions, but we saw no evidence to back up the oft-heard assertion that TCM actually works where Western medicine has failed. Insofar as TCM offers a degree of comfort and hope for those in difficult situations, it seems to perform a similar role to those of vitamin supplements, chiroprac\u00ad tic, homeopathy, naturopathy, and therapeutic touch, our homegrown Western pseudo- medicines.\" by a TCM electrical palm stimu- Notes 1. \"Qi\" is the name Chinese philosophy gives to a scientifically unde\u00ad tectable \"force\" or \"energy\" believed to permeate everything in die universe. TCM asserts that imbalances in the flow of Qi in anatomically unverified \"meridians\" are responsible for disease, fatigue, etc. Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, massage, etc, supposedly restore well-being by rebalancing die flow of this mystical essence. Qigong is a set of mental and physical exercises akin to those of Tai Chi Chuan and Ai-ki-do that also promise spiritual and physical benefits by channeling this mysterious energy. With its mental disciplines and postural and breathing exercises. Qigong has long been practiced as a form of self-hypnosis that claims to promote relaxation and general health, much in the manner of certain yoga exercises. These days, practitioners of this aspect of the discipline call it \"internal Qigong\" to distinguish it from the much more dubi\u00ad ous \"external Qigong,\" which has enjoyed a dramatic rise in popularity in China and in the West. Devotees of external Qigong claim they can control die Qi force beyond their own bodies to debilitate their foes, achieve the sorts of allegedly psychic feats familiar to Westerners, and diagnose and cure physical ailments. Qigong masters have become rich and powerful in China, filling massive sports arenas for their demonstrations of magic and faith healing. Chinese skeptics who have exposed these Qigong hoaxers were among the hosts of die delegation that included diese authors (Lin ct al., in press). 2. As an example of why scientific physicians consider external Qigong to be quackery, take the following advertisement for a \"Qigong Herbal Pillow\" that appeared in the September 1994 issue of the English-language magazine. Chin* Today, published in Beijing by the China Welfare Institute. The pillow, which sells for U.S. $198, is claimed to be effective for high and low blood pressure as well as for \"insomnia, diseases of the heart, brain, and blood ves- SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 33 sels.\" It also allegedly rheumatism, aids digestion, and \"energizes the mind.\" According to the manufacturers, it is a \"small-radar Qigong bionic device\" that \"works by utilizing the synchronicity of global and human magnetic fields and of trace elements, and through the magnetization of Chinese herbal medicines.\" Invented by the Qigong master Wang Shibo, it incorporates a \"high-energy Qigong tube\" that is supposed to generate its own power from the user's speech, breathing, and heartbeat. This causes it to vibrate in therapeutic ways; and its radiant power can help users \"develop their special bodily abilities\" (a common euphemism for psychic powers). The pillow is sanctioned by the Bai Zi Yuan Shen Qigong Research Institute and, according to the ad, it is effec\u00ad tive for three years. 3. Gardner, M. 1981.

While we are quite prepared to accept that certain herbal remedies con\u00ad tain biologically active ingredients that could be useful in medical practice (some have already met this criterion of scientific proof\u2014see Lewis and Elvin- Lewis 1977), we see no such value in those concoctions made from organs of endangered species. Their rationale, as we point out in Part 1 of this report, is purely that of \"sympathetic magic,\" the basis of all superstitious practices (see Note 6). 6. A good example of the \"sympathetic magic\" aspects of TCM (the belief that \"like begets like\") is that the price paid for ginseng root is not determined by the concentration of its active chemical ingredients. Rather, it is deter\u00ad mined by the degree to which the variegated root structure resembles a human body. Roots with a greater number of distinct parts that can be seen as a head, torso, appendages, etc., fetch a higher price. 7. Wherever we went, TCM doctors tended to emphasize the toxic side effects of Western drugs while glossing over the well-known fact that herbal medications have potential toxicities of their own (Tyler 1985). Many \"nat\u00ad ural\" plant substances are virulent poisons; others can have serious side effects for the digestive, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems. A major drawback among traditional herbalists of all ethnic stripes is their insuf\u00ad ficient education concerning these potential harms. 8. \"Applied kinesiology\" is a scientifically discredited technique for read\u00ad ing the \"muscle weakness\" that allegedly follows (instantaneously) exposure to certain presumed pathogens (refined sugar, food dyes, preservatives, and fluo\u00ad rescent lighting arc favorite culprits). This pscudoscience should not be con\u00ad fused with the authentic discipline of kinesiology, which is the scientific study of the control of bodily movement. 9. A recent meeting of the B.C. Skeptics in Vancouver, B.C., Mr. Ge Yingcai, a famous Qigong master and healer who had immigrated to Canada. Mr. Ge had promised to demonstrate, under double-blind conditions, his ability to make distilled water taste sweet by irradiating it with his Qi energy. The audience was disappointed and annoyed, however, when, after a rambling two-hour lecture, the master announced that he was now too tired to partici\u00ad pate in the controlled test. Mr. Ge said he had a degree in nuclear physics from Beijing University, but his interactions with several professors of physics in the audience revealed significant gaps in his understanding of basic science. Likewise, in discussion with Dr. Kirsten Emmott, a physician member of the B.C Skeptics, Mr. Ge exhibited deficiencies in elementary medical knowl- . For instance, he had no comeback when Dr. Emmott pointed out that his claim to diagnose disease in his clients' organs by feeling pain in the cor\u00ad responding ones in his own body was doubtful because the organs he referred to have no nerve supply that could signal such sensations (even if his organs could somehow magically resonate with those of his clients). Although Mr. Ge had specifically agreed to produce scientific studies to substantiate his con\u00ad ceptions of disease and his claimed cures, all he could deliver were the usual testimonials from satisfied customers. The B.C. Skeptics were similarly frustrated when they issued a challenge to be scientifically tested to die Qigong master Yan Xin during his North American tour in 1990. Yan's associate, Wu Xutian. wrote saying that the skeptics only remained dubious because they had never seen a real Qigong master in action, but he declined to show them what his supposedly real col\u00ad league could do. In his letter of rejection addressed to Dale Beyerstein. Wu condescendingly dismissed the skeptics' challenge: \"... Dr. Yan Xin and I arc not interested in the very low level test which was very popular in China ten or fifteen years ago. He is busy on some cooperating research subjects with several important organizations in U.S.\" Wu suggested the skeptics should be content with some \"scientific\" papers by Yan which he enclosed. As usual, the claimed effects of Qigong were extremely unlikely by conventional scientific standards but were not published in peer-reviewed journals of any interna\u00ad tional scientific standing. 10. Dale Beyerstein, who suffers from diabetes, dropped several obvious hints in describing his complaint for each TCM doctor he visited (he listed the textbook symptoms but did not mention the word \"diabetes\"). He even prominently displayed his \"Medic Alert\" bracelet while having his pulses read, but none of the TCM doctors picked up on his diabetes (none even asked what the clearly marked bracelet was for!). The herbal remedies that wcte pre\u00ad scribed for Dale differed at the different offices and some of them would have been medically dangerous for a diabetic to take. 11. Many scientifically trained physicians accept that chiropractic manip\u00ad ulations could be beneficial for certain purely musculoskeletal complaints. However, medical scientists remain dubious about the underlying rationale for chiropractic still espoused by most of its practitioners. These theoretical \"explanations\" continue to fly in the face of scientific knowledge in the fields of anatomy and physiology (Jarvis 1987). Chiropractors who still insist that all diseases stem from spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\"), and can there\u00ad fore be cured by joint manipulation, remain open to charges of pscudoscience. The same is true of the many chiropractors who continue to reject the germ theory of disease, oppose basic immunization, and use scientifically discred\u00ad ited diagnostic devices.

EVAN HARRINGTON The debate over \"recovered\" and \"false\" memories continues to be one of the most contentious issues in the field of psychology today. The debate is extremely polarized with very little amicable communication among members of the opposing camps. While such a dis\u00ad pute may eventually be beneficial to science, in that both sides are clearly being spurred on to produce original research at a frenetic pace, at the moment the clearest man\u00ad ifestation of this dichotomy is miscommunication and fric\u00ad tion between factions. Such miscommunication has been exacerbated by a tendency of some theorists on both sides to make sweeping generalizations and use vague terminology. An example of such miscommunication is the use of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 35 term recovered memory therapy, used frequendy in books such as Making Monsters by Richard Ofshe and Ethan Waiters (1994). The term as they used it is not without its critics (e.g., Dalenberg 1995) who complain that the term is over- generalized. Conversely, in a televised debate, Charles Whitfield, a trauma therapist, stated that there is no such thing as recovered memory therapy. The true state of affairs likely rests somewhere in between. While some misunderstandings may be rooted in seman\u00ad tics, odiers are more difficult to trace and harder still to describe adequately. It is very difficult to get quantitative data in the area of the beliefs held by therapists regarding topics that may manifest in the form of false memories in their patients. And although some surveys have attempted to obtain quantitative measures of therapists' beliefs, practices, and experiences regarding traumatic memory recovery and therapy (e.g., Poole, et. al- 1995), such surveys fail to fully inform the reader of the quality of those beliefs. In an attempt to obtain a qualitative analysis of the beliefs of therapists with regard to recovered memories of traumatic events, I have fre\u00ad quendy attended sexual- and ritual-abuse conferences. Some of these conferences have afforded me valuable insight into the dynamics of a scientifically informed trauma therapy. At other times I have gained valuable insight into the beliefs of some \"fringe\" therapists who believe in vast and nefarious conspira\u00ad cies organized to harm children. My purpose here is not to argue whether such beliefs are accurate or not; rather, I simply wish to oudine what some of those beliefs are. The following is not meant to be representative of all therapists in this field. I offer only a description of what some therapists believe. The reader will please keep in mind that any qualitative descrip\u00ad tion, such as this one, may not be used to infer anything about the population as a whole, but it may be illuminating in that there is a certain subpopulation that clearly is represented. This article describes my experiences at a conference held in Dallas, Texas, March 23-26, 1995, by a group calling itself the \"Society for the Investigation, Treatment and Prevention of Ritual and Cult Abuse\" (SITPRCA). SITPRCA may be reached at P.O. Box 835564, Texas 75083-5564. The 1995 SITPRCA conference was tided \"Cult and Ritual Abuse, Mind Control, and Dissociation: A Multidisciplinary Dialogue.\" The word dialogue is misleading because there were no skeptics or critics among the speakers and, as will be demonstrated, any dissension from the audi\u00ad ence was strongly discouraged\u2014it was essentially a mono\u00ad logue. The 1995 conference offered continuing education Evan Harrington is a graduate student in social psychology at Temple University, e-mail evan-h@vm.temple.edu. credit available through the Texas State Board of Examiners of Licensed Professional Counselors. The conference was attended by 150 to 200 people. A sig\u00ad nificant minority of the audience consisted of patients who claimed to have had recovered memories of ritual abuse (sev\u00ad eral of whom I spoke with) and who were allowed access to even the most advanced professional training sessions, some\u00ad times at the recommendations of their therapists. The SITPRCA organization was created by Dallas therapist James Randall \"Randy\" Noblitt, currently the president of the group, and Pamela Persian, its executive director. Noblitt lec\u00ad tures widely on the existence of ritual cults and mind-control techniques, and has served as an expert witness in a number of child-abuse cases. In the 1992 Austin, Texas, day care case of Fran and Dan Keller, he helped obtain a conviction by informing the jury that cults across America regularly ritually abuse children through torture and sex\u00ad ual abuse and that the cults make child pornography with these victims. Noblitt stated that these children will often not be able to recall the events because they are so highly trauma\u00ad tized, and that the severity of the abuse causes the amnesia. This testimony, combined with Noblitt's statement that he was \"convinced\" that the child in this case had experienced extreme trauma, apparently helped convince the jury that the Kellers operated a ritual-abuse cult in their day care center. At the time of that trial, Noblitt testified that in addition to supervising his own clinical employees he had been sought to consult in 15 similar cases and that he provides supervision for therapists individually and in groups. Noblitt and Persian (1995) recently released a book outlining their beliefs about ritual abuse. While some mainstream therapists may conclude that those associated with SITPRCA represent a fringe ele- ment, I would point out that such organizations are able to have a dramatic influence on society. Opening Remarks The conference opened wirh a panel consisting of Walter Bowart (author of Operation Mind Control Dell, 1978), Mark Phillips (who claimed to have inside information on govern\u00ad ment mind-control techniques), and Alan Scheflin. Scheflin is a lawyer who has for years documented the Central Intelligence Agency experiments wirh \"brainwashing\" in the 1950s and 1960s and who spoke on a panel at the 1993 American Psychological Association (APA) meeting with memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus and again at the 1995 annual meeting along with Richard Kluft and several others. Bowart opened the conference with a direct appeal to the ther\u00ad apists. Bowart claimed that \"the False Memory Spindrome [sic] Foundation ... is a Central Intelligence Agency action. It is an action aimed at the psychological and psychiatric mental health community to discredit you, to keep you in fear and terror.\" Bowart stated that everyone connected with die False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) will be shown to be \"According to Bowart, the CIA is currently conducting a campaign of mind control against the American pub\u00ad lic and wants to discredit victims of these experiments so that their stories will be seen as false memories.\" 36 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER \"spooks or dupes.\" According to Bowart, the CIA is currently conducting a campaign of mind control against the American public and wants to discredit victims of these experiments so that their stories will be seen as false memories. Phillips spoke for a while about how he would reveal the trade secrets of mind control. Scheflin gave a lengthy talk about how therapists can pro\u00ad tect themselves against the lawsuits brought by former patients who retract memories of childhood abuse. These lectures were warmly received, especially Scheflin's. Perhaps because several speakers at the conference had been successfully sued by for\u00ad mer clients, the therapists in attendance seemed quite fearful that their clients would retract their memories of abuse and sue them for instilling false memories. I felt that the opening remarks were overtly political for what was purported to be a scientific gathering. Racist Conspiracy Theories and the Militias Doc Marqui, a self-described former \"school teacher and witch,\" lectured about the satanic \"llluminati\" conspiracy, which he alleged President Bill Clinton was part of, serving as the \"anti-Christ.\" Marqui assured the audience that this the\u00ad ory is not racist; but the fact is the llluminati theory is the same one advocated by most members of the American mili\u00ad tia movement, and it was utilized by the Nazis in their effort to justify their campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe (Cohn 1966). The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an anti-Semitic document (based on the llluminati conspiracy theory) that purports to document plans for Jewish world domination and which first appeared in Russia in 1903 in a by Richard Hofstadter (1965). While the llluminati conspiracy theory is widely endorsed by militia members, it is also embraced by reactionary groups such as: the Lyndon LaRouche organization (political analyst Chip Berlet [1994] stated that in the early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche \"took his followers .. . and guided them fascist politics\"); die John Birch Society (which Berlet [1994] said believes \"Insiders\" have for years controlled the U.S. and for\u00ad mer Soviet Union governments); and the Liberty Lobby. The Liberty Lobby, with its newspaper Spotlight, was created by Willis Carto, who also founded the Institute for Historical Review, which asserts that the Holocaust was a hoax (Berlet 1994). Author Linda Blood, who spoke later in the day, protested that she was \"unhappy to be following someone [Marqui] who is pushing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" which she said was anti-Semitic trash. Blood's protest deeply angered some and bewildered others, while about four of Blood's friends clapped in support. Perskin, who moderated the session, announced that although she is Jewish she found nothing offensive in Marquis lecture. Marqui appeared to me to be connecting existing tacist conspiracy theories with the thera\u00ad pists' theories about satanic cults. Marqui was followed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Ted Gunderson, who highly praised Marquis lecture. Gunderson is well known for his claims that an archaeological dig under the McMartin preschool showed evidence of tunnels, through which the children were allegedly spirited to other buildings to be prostituted in the community (Summit 1994). The results of this dig have for years gone unpublished while calls for funds to self-publish the results newspaper edited by Gunderson and Marqui seem to me to be attempting to introduce therapists to racist conspiracy theories and reactionary propaganda, while at the same time groups such as the LaRouche organization endorse satanic conspiracy theories to draw in new members.\" have been issued in newsletters such as the Survivor Activist The book was instituted as mandatory reading in German schools bv die Nazis in 1933 (Cohn 1966). Marqui touted the overall validity of the Protocols while replacing the word Jews with the word satanists. The llluminati conspiracy holds, in part, that large Jewish banking families have been orchestrating various political revolutions and machinations throughout Europe and America since the late eighteenth cen\u00ad tury, with the ultimate aim of bringing about a satanic New World Order. Members of the militia movement have said they believe that the United Nations has been infiltrated by these \"demonic forces\" and is poised for a violent overthrow of the American government, after which American rights to own firearms will be removed and American citizens will be enslaved by the introduction of a cashless society, as foretold in the Bible's book of Revelation (see, e.g., Constantine 1995; Kelly 1995; Springmeier 1995; Stern 1996). Marqui stated that the llluminati is essentially a shadow government that has controlled the United States since its inception, controls the Masonic order, and commits all manner of occult crime cul\u00ad minating in human sacrifices on eight days of each year. Much of this paranoia was chronicled more than 30 years ago (1994). Meanwhile, the integrity of the dig has been strongly disputed (Earl 1995). Gunderson presented what he called \"new evidence\" in the 1984 McMartin preschool sex-abuse case in Manhattan Beach, California. He produced a number of photographs of the foundation of a house in the hills above San Bernadino, California, that had burned down, he claimed, the night the charges were filed in the McMartin case. He alleged that the McMartin children were flown to this house and ritually abused, and that the house was torched to destroy evidence. The sum total of the evidence he presented to sup\u00ad port this allegation was the existence of spray-painted satanic graffiti on the foundation stones and on boulders on the prop\u00ad erty. Apparendy, several years had gone by between the time of the alleged fire and the time Gunderson snapped the photos. Yet Gunderson was dismissive of the idea that die house foun\u00ad dation on die lot, with its hillside vista of San Bernadino, had SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 37 \u00ab\u00a3-> <. * \u00bb * v < * * \u00bb ^ been used by teenagers who might have painted the graffiti after the fire. The therapists were enraptured and later asked if Gunderson was planning to publish his photos or if there was any chance of using diis evidence in a new trial. The McMartin preschool case resulted in the longest criminal pro\u00ad ceeding in American history and failed to produce any con\u00ad victions (see e.g., Nathan and Snedecker 1995). Gunderson then described a conversation he had with a witness, Paul Bonacci, from an alleged satanic-ritual abuse case in Nebraska that was detailed by former Nebraska state Sen. John DeCamp (1992), who was also a speaker at this confer\u00ad ence. The grand jury of Lincoln described this case as an attack by DeCamp \"for personal political gain and possible revenge\" (Dorr 1991 p. 1), a \"smear campaign,\" and a \"carefully crafted hoax\" (United Press International, September 18, 1990). The grand jury jailed one and indicted two others (including Bonacci) for perjury, and was so critical of DeCamp that he sued die grand jury for ridicule, though he quickly lost (Dorr 1991). A church in die area, the Nebraska Leadership Conference, responded by publishing a tract (no date) named The Mystery of the Carefully Crafted Hoax, with a foreword by Gunderson, in which he continued the allegations of satanic- ritual crime. At die conference Gunderson related Bonacci's description of a slave auction in Las Vegas in which 25 to 30 vans pulled up, airplanes landed, and foreign men widi tur\u00adbans bought children and took them away. According to Gunderson: \"Nobody knows what happened to those kids. They use them for several things: body parts, diey use diem for sacrificing, for sex slaves. But this is a big market. Does anybody have any idea what a blue-eyed, blond-haired eleven- or twelve-year girl would sell for? Fifty thousand dollars.\" Gunderson claimed that there are currently 500 satanic cults in New York City alone, each averaging eight sacrificial murders a year, for a total of 4,000 human sacrifices every year. Gunderson did not explain how die cults remove bodies in the asphalt jungle of New York. Gunderson believes in the threat posed by the New World Order, as do Marqui and militia members. Gunderson has appeared on Dateline NBC, at militia conferences (Witt 1995), on Michigan Militia member Mark Koernke's short\u00ad wave radio program, and on the cover of Spotlight (May 13, 1995), stating that the U.S. government intentionally bombed die Oklahoma City federal building in April 1995, in order to remove our rights through anti-terrorism bills. Gunderson informed die audience that Spotlight \"tells it like it is,\" and urged audience members to call die subscription number, which he read aloud. On top of this, Gunderson gave an inter\u00ad view to Lyndon LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review (May 25, 1990), in which he described FBI special agent Ken Lanning as \"probably die most effective and foremost speaker 38 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER for the satanic movement in this country, today or at any time in the past.\" Gunderson and Marqui seem to me to be attempting to introduce therapists to racist conspiracy theories and reactionary propaganda, while at the same time groups such as the LaRouche organization endorse satanic conspiracy theories to draw in new members. Political analyst Chip Berlet's argument that radical right elements are seducing the left should be taken seriously. In his monograph Right Woos Left (Berlet 1994), he describes, among other examples, how the LaRouche organization has persis\u00ad tently destabilized legitimate leftist activist organizations by infiltrating these groups and then claiming that these groups endorse LaRouche. The LaRouchians also gain credibility through their association with legitimate political activists, which enables them to draw new converts. The cult-ritual abuse field is a prime example of such infiltration. Many ther\u00ad apists who specialize in treating ritual or other forms of abuse identify to some degree with feminism and other liberal ideals. When radical right conspiracists get such liberals to believe in the New World Order or \"Operation Monarch\" (a similar movement, described later) they gain a boost in credibility far beyond what they could expect by printing their stories in Spotlight or the Executive Intelligence Review. Former Nebraska state Sen. John DeCamp, mentioned ear\u00ad lier, has been on the ritual-abuse circuit for some time now, talking about his 1992 book The Franklin Cover-Up, which purports to document a satanic organization in Nebraska that abused children and prostituted them within the White House. DeCamp gives a favorable mention to a fact-finding mission sponsored by LaRouche (DeCamp 1992, p. 241). The editors of the Executive Intelligence Review repeat DeCamp's claims and praise his book as \"important\" in their virulently anti-Semitic party tract tided The Ugly Truth About the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) (Editors of the Executive Ingelligence Review 1992). The July 27, 1990. issue of the Executive Intelligence Review stated that the FBI in Nebraska covered up child abuse and murder. On June 15, 1995, DeCamp appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on domestic terrorism chaired by Arlen Spector. DeCamp appeared as a lawyer representing the American militia movement and the four militia leaders testi\u00ad fying diat day. At a Washington, D.C., news conference, DeCamp glowingly described die militia movement as \"a political movement in the birthing . . . painful, con\u00ad fusing, and exciting\" (Janofsky 1995, p. 10). DeCamp also has clear ties with the Nebraska Leadership Conference. A call to the church office confirmed that the Nebraska Leadership Conference had \"contributed significantly\" to DeCamp's book. DeCamp delighted the therapists at this conference during a luncheon session in which he described the allegations put forth in his book. Conspiracy Theories in Action I struck up a conversation with a woman and het son and learned that the woman claimed to have recovered memories of being abused in a satanic cult. She drove across two states to attend the conference, she said, in the hope that she could learn about Nazi scientists being brought to the United States after World War II. She knew nothing about this topic but seemed to suspect that it had something to do with her. The conversation drifted to the topic of treatment for sex offenders while they are incarcerated. At this point we were joined by a man, whom I'll call Felix, and his companion, who said that treatment for sex offenders is unnecessary because when the New World Order takes control of the country, members are going to shoot all prisoners and also eliminate three-quarters of the world's population. Felix described to us how the New World Order operated, manufacturing multiple personality disorder through torture and creating sex slaves and drug mules under the mind control of the CIA (this is the basis for the alleged \"Operation Monarch\"). Felix also described how the black helicopters of the New World Order landed in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, and black-suited storm troopers illegally searched all the homes in the neighborhood. There was a total news blackout of this because, Felix said, the media are part of the conspiracy. Later, Felix confided to me that his companion was wrong: the New World Order would not kill all the prisoners, but would use them as slave labor. Felix said he did not like to disagree with her because she was a former \"Monarch\" mind-control slave. Felix sold me his newsletter, as big as a book, in which he makes some very strange claims: Charles Manson was pro\u00ad grammed by die Illuminati, the Anti-Defamation League is controlled by Jewish satanists, and Marilyn Monroe was a mind-conttol slave. According to Felix, virtually anyone who disagrees with Felix is a Monarch slave, including prominent militia leader Bo Gritz, who talked Randy Weaver into sur\u00ad rendering at the 1992 incident at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Most disturbingly, Felix told me that he works as a counselor and has helped \"a lot\" of people suffering from multiple personal\u00ad ity disorder. Felix apparendy has no mental-health counseling credentials, and his name badge identified him as \"clergy.\" Nevertheless, he said he counsels dissociative clients and guides them through the intricacies of international cabals. By this time a crowd had gathered around Felix and me. After Felix's monologue, a social worker from Nonh Carolina informed the group that in the day care sex-abuse case she was investigating, she thought she remembered the kids talking about black helicopters. She said she would look into it. Secrets of Mind Control Revealed Felix's claims paled in comparison to what came next. Mark Phillips claimed to be a former government agent involved in mind-control experiments. He was always vague, never giving any information that could be checked. His companion, Cathy O'Brian, claimed to have survived years of torture and abuse at the hands of her CIA handlers in Operation Monarch (these two seem to be the source of most of the Monarch material). O'Brian maintained she had been tortured in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 39 unimaginable ways since the time she was a child, and that her cult handlers successfully created dissociative identity disorder in her, which was cured by Phillips, who also managed to hide her from the CIA. She was so savagely tortured, she said, that her back was a complete mass of scar tissue. Phillips added that he had once tried to count the scars but lost count somewhere in the hundreds. We never saw the scars, photos of the scare, or doctors' reports about the scars. O'Brian stated diat she was forced to have sex with a piediora of political figures including George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford (whom she said she knew as \"the neighborhood porn king\"). She also said she was abused by Hillary Clinton (but not by Bill). Politicians were not the only ones involved\u2014O'Brian stated that a number of baseball figures were in this satanic/CIA mind-control plot. She told me personally that virtually the entire country music industry is set up by the New World Order to make money. According to O'Brian, most popular country singers are Monarch slaves who had alter-personalities created with good voices for singing. Phillips and O'Brian, along with Bowart and ouSere, claimed that the CIA is currently abusing people through Operation Monarch. Phillips claimed 20 years of experience in genetics and said that the cults would breed slaves selectively to create musical geniuses. To test his vast experience with genetics, I asked him what he thought of the Human Genome Sequencing Project. He had never heard of it. It seems impossible for anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of genetics to be unaware of the biggest project ever in that field. Nevertheless, one author claims that Phillips is \"currendy deprogramming at least six Monarch slaves\" (Springmeier 1995, p. 243). It seems that a number of people in the audience were accepting of Phillips's and O'Brian's claims, although Persian (of SITPRCA) informed me that this duo will not be asked back in die future because diey failed to produce evidence of Operation Monarch. In a personal conversation with me (July 12, 1995). Scheflin stated that he had been able to obtain internal CIA documents corroborating the existence of mind- control experiments in the 1950s and 1960s. (The documents demonstrate that die CIA conducted unethical experiments to try to create multiple personalities in people for the purpose of creating a super spy who could keep vital information sub\u00ad merged in an alter personality [Thomas 1990].) But, he said, the paper trail completely died out by 1976. According to Scheflin, there are no credible reports of mind-control experi\u00ad ments after 1976 and no credible reports of any nature on Operation Monarch. Catherine Gould gave an advanced workshop in which she described the mechanics of cult mind-control, extensively uti\u00ad lizing the mind-as-computer model. At one point she puzzled over the idea of cult members catching AIDS. She said that no one can figure out why the offenders are not \"dropping like flies, because we know they don't practice safe cult sex.\" Widi all the blood, cannibalism, and unprotected sex, diey ought to be catching a lot of sexually transmitted diseases. Therapist Jerry Mungadze offered a unique explanation. He suggested that mind-control programming boosts the immune system, making the victim resistant to die HIV virus, and that is why children in day care satanic-ritual abuse cases do not have ele\u00ad vated levels of sexually transmitted diseases. Well, if diey've found a cure for AIDS, why do they bother making money with pornography? Such a cure must be worth several billion dollars! In the grand tradition of conspiracy the\u00ad ories, discrepant information is explained away or, as in this case, incorporated into die scheme. Amazingly, chis solution to die AIDS conundrum appeared to be taken seriously by most in the room. Alternate Views Not Welcome Chrystine Oksana lectured on her experiences of recovering memories of ritual abuse and her subsequent search for cor\u00ad roboration (see Oksana 1994). Oksana stated that she had read some 500 books on the topic of trauma and child abuse. For this reason I asked what she thought of die recent study by Linda Meyer Williams (1994). Oksana said she had not heard of it. The report by Williams is a pivotal study that demon\u00ad strated that a substantial minority of adults failed to disclose their documented emergency room visits when they were chil\u00ad dren, which ostensibly occurred because they had been sexu\u00ad ally abused. The study demonstrated that some people may forget such events. There is a mistake in the text of die paper that states the existence of a nonsignificant trend such that, as the amount of force used in the commission of the abuse increases, recall decreases. The trend in the data actually shows that as the amount of force used in the commission of the abuse increases recall increases, which is opposite from, and fails to support, the theory of repression of traumatic memory (Harrington 1995). My description of diis data set visibly angered several in the audience. One woman voiced disbelief of what I had said (preferring to believe that greater trauma typically was related to nonrecall), while a second woman shouted at me twice to read Lenore Terr's Unchained Memories. After a couple more rebuffs, the session ended in a stony silence. Yet another woman approached me and bluntly stated that she did not believe what I had said. I told her that I had a signed letter from Williams affirming my observations. This woman shrugged her shoulders and walked away smiling, as if to say diat she still did not believe me. This appears to be an example of the resistant nature of strong beliefs toward dis\u00ad crepant information. In die final analysis of the Williams data, die nonsignifi\u00ad cant trend of force being associated widi greater recall is prob\u00ad ably a confound wherein both greater force and greater recall are associated with older age at time of abuse. Nevertheless, mine was a legitimate question to raise during a session on traumaric memory where it was stated that events that are more traumatic are more likely to be dissociated from con\u00ad sciousness. The scalding reaction I received from the audience supports the view that group social representations are not amenable to contradiction (Guerin, in press), and indicates that these are not issues open for discussion. 40 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Skepticism and Satanism The next session featured lawyer John Kiker and therapists Noblitt, Michael Moore, and Jan Maclean on the topic of the travails of being sued. Moore described in detail how violated he felt by being sued by former patients. Maclean stated you can always believe the stories children tell of being abused\u2014 children might make up other diings, but they never make up traumatic events. I asked the panel what they thought of Steve Ceci's work. There was a moment of dead silence. None of die four panelists had ever heard of Ceci, who is one of the top developmental psychologists in the country and is well known for his recent experiments demonstrating die suggestibility of children. Ceci's \"mousetrap\" experiments (Ceci 1993; Ceci and Bruck 1995) demonstrated that repeated interviews regarding a false traumatic event (getting a finger caught in a mousetrap and being taken to the hospital) can result in a por\u00ad tion of children saying (and apparently believing) that the fictional traumatic event occurred. After I described this experiment, the panelists concluded (without reading Ceci's papers) that \"these analogue studies\" cannot be gener\u00ad alized to the real world. It seems incredible that a psychological conference could be constructed with a seminar focusing on legal issues and the testimony of children in court, widiout a single person involved ever having heard of Ceci, who has contributed so much in this area. Indeed, this was the third day of the confer\u00ad ence and there had been much talk of children's accusations of abuse, but not one mention of Ceci's research, which was why I felt obliged to pose the question. Often when I attend lectures I ask the speakers what they think of criticisms against them. Immediately after the session a man cnnnrrrrA with the conference demanded to know who I was, where I was from, and why 1 had asked the question. He was not satisfied with my answers and became visibly agitated when I tried to describe Ceci's experiments in greater detail. He soon gave up and informed me in a brusque tone that \"everyone here thinks you are a plant.\" Perturbed, I entered the main hallway where I was confronted by Perskin, who asked if I had set out any lit\u00ad erature in the bathroom. Apparendy, someone had set out fly\u00ad ers from the Temple of Set, a satanic church, in the men's room! Conclusion Conspiracy theories have operated in many societies at many times and may be seen from a social-psychological perspective as serving certain functions within society. Conspiracy theories may of course represent real conspiracies, but they may also act in a manner similar to racist stereotyping in which the targeted group is seen as deviant and deeply immoral (Moscovici 1987). Conspiracy scholarship is on the one hand irrational, while on die other \"far more coherent than the real world, since it leaves no room for mistakes, failures, or ambiguities. It is, if not wholly rational, at least intensely rationalistic\" (Hofstadter 1965, p. 36). Conspiracy theories offer individu\u00ad als well-organized enemies against whom the self is defined; this offers them a guiding structure and purpose (Farr 1987). I frequently observed a categorical rejection of the possibility that thete could be \"false\" memories of traumatic events, and that anyone who made such claims must be \"dirty\" or a part of the \"backlash,\" and that such claims could be dismissed without serious consideration. There was dearly an assumptive woddview or social representation that unified the audience and speakers, deviation from which would brand one as a spy. Actual debate was an anathema. The assumptions mat united the group often veered toward conspiracism, though the particular dements of the conspiratorial plots could change from person to person (satanic cults, New World Order, etc.). Most, though by no means all, of die therapists appeared to be previously unaware of New World Order conspiracy, though some appeared receptive \"Immediately after the session a man connected with the conference demanded to know who I was, where I was from, and why I had asked [my] question. He was not satisfied with my answers and became visibly agitated... He soon gave up and informed me in a brusque tone that 'everyone here thinks you are a plant'\" to such ideas. Many seemed to be familiar with and believe in the Operation Monarch conspiracy, despite the lack of credible evi\u00ad dence for this. Of course, bdief in conspiracies does not neces\u00ad sarily indicate therapeutic incompetence. However, I would be worried if those dierapists interviewing children who are sus\u00ad pected of being victims of sexual abuse bdieved that the biblical revelation was coming in the form of satanic U.N. troops sweep\u00ad ing up children in black helicopters. We cannot know what effect these therapists' conspirator\u00ad ial beliefs may have on their clients. What we can see from these anecdotes is that strong beliefs are highly resistant to dis\u00ad crepant input and they do have a certain persuasive power. An indication of the influence of this conference can be seen in a quote from Jerry Leonard, a physicist who attended and wrote a review of the conference (Leonard 1995), in which he stated: I came away with the opinion that cults are for more prevalent, well connected, sophisticated and dangerous than I had ever dreamed ... apparently, this type of cult activity is fairly wide\u00ad spread. Police departments have stumbled on well organized nationwide child kidnapping rings. Ted Gunderson . . . described one case in which he personally uncovered an ele\u00ad mentary school which had been built on a system of tunnels through which children were taken into neighboring houses ... to participate in Satanic ritual abuse. .. . It is my personal view that the larger satanic cults arc being manipulated by the tcderal intelligence and law enforcement agencies from behind the scenes. Leonard informed me that this was his introduction to claims of cult child abuse. This testimonial demonstrates the persua\u00ad sive power of the rumors that were put forth at this confer- SKEPT1CAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 41 ence, at least to someone who was receptive to hearing them. We have no way of knowing the percentage of practicing therapists who are represented by this style of thinking. Even if only a very small minority of the therapeutic community is represented, it is troubling to think of the effect these thera\u00ad pists may have on their colleagues, to say nothing of their clients. The theories presented at this conference may at times find wider appeal among more traditional therapists who are searching for evidence of cults, and it appears that such theo\u00ad ries have enjoyed fairly wide popular circulation in the recent past (Victor 1993). Sherrill Mulhern (1991, 1994) has out\u00ad lined the role played by conspiracy theories both historically, and at prestigious gatherings of psychologists. While the majority of psychological trauma specialists are not \"conspir- acists,\" they may at times be influenced by conspiracy claims, such as the claim that tunnels existed under the McMartin preschool, because such claims resemble or circumstantially support in some way the memories reported by clients. The possibility of right-wing racist organizations using the present mental-health dilemma for their political gain is some\u00ad thing therapists working in this area should be aware of. Therapists who only seek what is best for their clients may at times be vulnerable to propaganda put out by such groups. In the end it is the client, along with the client's family, who suf\u00ad fers. Whether motivated by such groups, claims that critics are active CIA agents who are engaged in a secret war against the American public, or that they are part of a nationwide back\u00ad lash against belief in child abuse, only serve to make some therapists antagonistic to all forms of criticism, regardless of the motives of the critic. This is unfortunate because, as trauma therapist and researcher John Briere stated at the 1995 APA meeting, many of the criticisms have merit, and the field will be made better, not worse, because of them.

U 42 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER We Need Science and the Humanities Science and technology will serve humanity well only if our hearts and heads work in concert. Critical, rational thought (of a physical-science style) and respect for the world in which we live (seeking truth and beauty in the tradition of the liberal arts) are both needed. JOHN W. WHITE Antiscience attitudes have been around for a long *__\u00bb time, particularly in religious organizations. A new -I. JL. development has been the emergence of antiscience within a part of academia, traditionally a strong supporter of science. This antiscience movement has been centered in the arts, humanities, and social science departments. I lump these under the title \"humanities\" for brevity in this article. Academic antiscience has been described in a book titled Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt (Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1994). It has also been discussed by many others in a variety of media, including articles in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER by Paul Kurtz and Gerald Holton SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Sepl.mber/Ociober 1996 43 (both in Spring 1994) and by Gross and Levitt (March/April 1995). This academic antiscience problem is easy to describe. Some college teachers in the humanities are seriously misrepre\u00ad senting the nature of science: its current state of knowledge, the methodology of science, and its philosophical foundation. Their message is that physical science (I include biology) is not sig\u00ad nificantly more reliable than other areas of knowledge; that it is a search for knowledge dominated by politics, bias, ambigu\u00ad ity, and uncertainty. One example (generalized and para\u00ad phrased) follows. Since perfect objectivity is not possible, all knowledge is equally reliable. In other words, any given physics topic is no more dependable than a branch of literature or sociology. Since objectiv\u00ad ity cannot be perfect, relative degrees of objectivity don't matter, and one might be well advised to fotget the attempt to try for objectivity. These academics think that seeking knowledge through the use of observation and logic is illusory. The vast majority of physical scientists disagree. These misguided scholars in the humanities simply do not understand physical science; specifically they do not understand the role of operational definitions. (Quantities are defined by the operations that are performed when we measure them. Example: Length is the quantity that you obtain when you use a meter stick in the following way, etc.) The \"etc.\" stands for a lot of carefully described detail, but it is readily provided in an unambiguous form. The uniformity with which physical scientists pursue their work throughout the world provides testimony that operational definitions are relatively unambiguous. The human mind and human senses can be trusted to perform reli\u00ad ably when used with this type of carefully prescribed opera\u00ad tion. Physical science is based on experiments performed in the natural world. By limiting our investigations to those quanti\u00ad ties mat allow the use of operational definitions, the response of nature to experiments is independent of national borders, the gender of the experimenter, and so on. Models that scien\u00ad tists develop to explain nature must match experimental data with a high level of precision or the model is discarded, even if the proposer of the theory has a great reputation. Decisions about theories are decided by nature! In one sense, physical scientists have defined dieir disci\u00ad pline in a realm that ensures objectivity and reliability. This is done by restricting their interests to those quantities mat are John W. White has been a physics staff member at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for the past 30 years. He has a Ph.D. in Applied Science from the University of California at Davis. appropriate for operational definitions. However, it is also true mat the botders of topics mat are amenable to operational def\u00ad initions continue to grow rapidly. Science is continually mov\u00ad ing into realms that were previously the sole domain of the arts or the humanities. One recent example is die research into the human mind and how it works. Science appears to be able to shed light on thought processes and emotional responses that were formerly considered a pan of other (nonscientific) disci\u00ad plines. There are many similar instances throughout history, such as that which occurred when the heliocentric model of the heavens was proposed. The real measure of the reliability of knowledge is how that knowledge permits people to make predictions about future events. In mis regard, no other field of human endeavor has come close to the record achieved by physical science in recent centuries. This ability to predict accurately also is evidenced by the performance of modern technology that provides count\u00ad less (literally) specific examples of the reliability of science. Our model of the electron (its charge, mass, and other prop\u00ad erties) is the same for every application: chemistry reactions, toaster design, cathode ray tube design, radar performance, and others. A similar case could be provided by die many applications of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. The list of successful scientific models and their applications goes on and on. Operational definitions provide pow\u00ad erful concepts that can be expressed with unusual clarity; researchers around die globe can communicate and discuss issues with each other from an unusually uniform perspec\u00ad tive. Use of operational definitions also makes the scientific mediod (comparison of theory and experi\u00ad mental data) more precise and effi\u00ad cient; it makes peer review (orga\u00ad nized skepticism) more objective and reliable. The conclusion is that quantities in physical science (length, time, mass, etc.) can be dis\u00ad cussed with a relatively high degree of accuracy and in a relatively {much) more objective manner than the quantities (love, loyalty, greed, etc.) that arc encoun\u00ad tered in other research disciplines such as the humanities. By die same token, die sciences are limited to diose topics diat are amenable to operational definitions. Aldiough the degree of objectivity obtained is not perfect in science, it is quite remarkable when compared to other dis\u00ad ciplines. There is a significant gain in the knowledge obtained when the area of study can be examined more objectively. The degree of objectivity is the whole story with respect to reliabil\u00ad ity. Objectivity is harder to achieve for the humanities than for the sciences. This very point argues in favor of an attempt to attain a high degtee of objectivity for practitioners in the Humanities continued on page 56 44 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Testing the ESP Claims of SORRAT The Society for Research in Rapport and Telekinesis (SORRAT) claims to be in contact with spirit \"entities\" that can divine the order of sealed decks of cards. A test was designed using a sealed deck of ESP cards and carried out after the protocol was approved. Here are the results. RICHARD WISEMAN, JOHN BELOFF, and ROBERT L. MORRIS The Society for Research in Rapport and Telekinesis (SORRAT) claims to be in touch with spirit \"enti\u00ad ties\" that produce a vast range of paranormal phe\u00ad nomena including rapping, table levitation, apports (the appearance of objects through objects), and the movement of objects inside carefully sealed containers or \"minilabs.\" This Missouri-based group was founded in the 1960s by John Neihardt, a respected academic and authority on the Plains Indians. After Niehardt's death in 1973, the leader\u00ad ship of the group was taken over by Tom Richards and Alice Thompson (John Neihardt's daughter). In 1977, William Cox, a well-known parapsychologist (since deceased), moved to Missouri to study tiie SORRAT phenomena and has done much to publicize its activities (see, e.g., Cox 1983). A few years ago Cox contacted us and claimed that the entities had developed a new skill, and were now able to divine the order of sealed decks of ESP cards (twenty-five playing cards widi either a square, cross, star, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 45 circle or lines on their faces) with almost one hundred percent accuracy. Cox explained that he simply placed the decks into the cellar of a home of a well-known SORRAT member, and the entities were able to write the order of the cards in the deck on a piece of paper. Cox asked us if we would like to send him a sealed deck and test the entities' abilities. Such an investiga\u00ad tion appeared worthwhile because although SORRAT has generated much anecdotal evidence of ostensible psi phenom\u00ad ena (see, e.g., Richards 1982), the group has rarely been sub\u00ad jected to controlled testing (but see Phillips and McBeath 1982; Hansen and Broughton 1991; and Stillings 1991). For this reason we decided to carry out the following test. Our experiment involved sealing a shuffled deck of ESP cards and sending them to Cox, from Britain to Missouri. Cox would ask the entities to divine the order of the cards in the sealed deck. He would then return to us this card order listed on a piece of paper, along with the scaled deck. The actual order of the cards would then be compared with the order dis\u00ad cerned by the entities. To be successful, the entities must score at least fifteen out of twenty-five possible hits. This was well within the range of the claim (Cox had claimed that many pre\u00ad vious trials had obtained twenty-five hits) and clearly above chance. In past tests of this type, claimants who have failed to pro\u00ad duce ostensible paranormal phenomena have stated fiiat the experimental conditions were not favorable to their psychic abilities. To help prevent such misunderstandings, we asked Cox and Richards to examine our protocol prior to the exper\u00ad iment. After a few minor modifications mey wrote back to say that the experiment had their approval and that they were looking forward to receiving our sealed deck. The test was on. We thoroughly shuffled a deck of ESP cards, made a list of iheir order, and placed this list in a secure location at a uni\u00ad versity. The ESP cards were then placed inside a commercially available, high-security, \"tamper-evident\" envelope. This enve\u00ad lope is constructed from polyethylene and cannot be slit and resealed without detection. It is sealed with a special self-adhe\u00ad sive strip that reveals any signs of tampering including attempts to peel off the strip, the application of heat or cold, and the use of various solvents. Each envelope carries a per\u00ad manent, and unique, six-digit number to help prevent it from being opened and then replaced by a second duplicate, but undamaged, envelope. Next, die sealed envelope was encapsulated in transparent industrial embedding resin. To prevent someone from break\u00ad ing up the entire block (e.g., by melting it), and then replac\u00ad ing it with an identical but undamaged block, a number of drops of chemical dye were placed in the resin. These formed Richard Wiseman is senior research fellow in the Perron- Warrick Research Unit, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield Herts AL 10 9AB., U.K. John Beloff and Robert L. Morris are at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K., where Beloff is in the Department of Psychology and Morris holds the Koestler Chair of Parapsychology. small dark spots of different shapes and sizes, which fell to dif\u00ad ferent depths in the resin. The exact position and diameter of these dots were recorded such that it would have been very dif\u00ad ficult to duplicate. The encapsulated deck was then placed inside a second tamper-evident envelope. We realized that if the returned deck showed signs of dam\u00ad age or tampering, it may be difficult to decide if this would constitute evidence of cheating, damage in transit, or opening by another individual (e.g., a customs official). This was an important consideration, as Cox (1986) has claimed that pos\u00ad sible signs of tampering on a similar package used in a previ\u00ad ous test (see Hansen and Broughton 1991) may have been caused by a dishonest postal employee, possibly looking for jewelry. To minimize this possibility, a strip of paper was placed around the package. This explained that the package was part of a parapsychology experiment and asked individu\u00ad als not to open the package. In addition, the labels carried our addresses and that of William Cox, noting that more informa\u00ad tion about the experiment could be obtained from either of these sources. Cox was asked to replace this strip of paper around the parcel when returning it to us. We also thought it important that the entities make their predictions regarding the order of the cards in the deck in a completely unambiguous way. For this reason, we asked Cox to have the entities complete a call-sheet consisting of twenty- five sets of the five ESP symbols, each set corresponding to a position in the ESP deck. Cox had to ensure that the entities circled one of the symbols in each set, indicating their call for the card in that position of the deck. Any missing or ambigu\u00ad ous calls would count as a miss. The secured package and call-sheet were dispatched to Cox. A few weeks later Cox informed us that the package had arrived and did not appear to have been damaged in transit. Two months later, we received both a completed call-sheet and a handwritten letter, allegedly from the entities. These docu\u00ad ments had been mailed to another member of SORRAT (res\u00ad ident of California), who had then kindly forwarded diem to us. The call-sheet contained twenty-five unambiguous calls (each circled in black ink). The letter read: Friend Richard- We have tried to rearrange the cards in your packet to approx\u00ad imate the calls we have marked. We often fail, of course. Shanti-expeditor/Rector/J.K. Cox then returned the sealed deck to us. We inspected it for any signs of damage or tampering. To counter the idea that we may have damaged the package while opening it, we carefully filmed our examination. Both the outer tamper-evident bag and resin block were found to be free from signs of damage. The actual order of the cards was then compared with the calls allegedly made by the entities. They had obtained only eight hits. As the entities had claimed also to reorder the cards, it was SORRAT continued on page 61 46 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER nge Vibrations: An Afternoon with a New Age Psychic It all sounds so convincing. Or does it? J. D. LASICA r ihis is very, very unusual,\" Emma says, leaning closer to inspect the whorls on my fingertips -I- and the lines on my right palm. She pauses, then raises her eyes. \"This is going to just knock you out of the water, Joseph.\" I ease forward in the cream-colored armchair, keeping my feet fl?t -- \u2014 \u2014 ~w-f,v, wuuui nui IU ciu^s my energy, i peer down and study the lines of my palm. I look for pat\u00ad terns. Instead, I see a jumble of cracks and creases. Mostly, I see chapped skin. But what do I know? I'm not the expert here. Emma is. Emma is a spiritual counselor, a palm reader, a numerolo- gist, a clairvoyant, a practitioner of divine sciences. She is, in a word, a psychic\u2014by reputation, one of the bright rising stars of the psychic community in Northern California, I am told. Emma fixes me with a soulful stare. \"Arc you ready for this, Joseph?\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER S.ptember/October 1996 47 I am ready. I'm sitting here today, in the sun-splashed liv\u00ad ing room of Emma's ranch-style home near the San Francisco Bay, for precisely this reason: to get in touch with my inner path. I had briefly met Emma at a business function early last year. A vibrant, vivacious, life-hugging woman in her 40s, she has a bright, chipper voice, soft hands, and dark eyes that lock onto you and won't let go. A crystal necklace dangles loosely around her neck. This is my first reading. And going in, I am just a bit skep\u00ad tical. But I am also open to the possibilities. My older sister believes in die paranormal. And close friends have told me tales of readings they've had by strangers, strangers who knew things about their pasts that no one could possibly know. Later, after today's session with Emma, I'll contact two experts in the field of para\u00ad psychology to get their takes on this. But for the moment, I want to get my own impressions. At die beginning of our ses\u00ad sion\u2014Emma is letting me tape- record what turns out to be a 100- minute visit\u2014I pay the $75 fee and, as instructed, smear black ink on my palms. While Emma goes ofF to meditate with my palm prints, I study a piece of paper that I'm instructed to sign before we can pro\u00ad ceed. It's a legal waiver. Apparently, there have been cases of psychics being sued by clients who were bad sports about their bad karma. I sign the form. Welcome tc fortune-telling in die nineties. We chat for a while. I ask about her back\u00ad ground, and Emma tells me she has had \"die gift, some people call it ESP,\" since child\u00ad hood. She has studied at the International Institute of Hand Analysis in Sausalito and at Psychic Horizons in San Francisco. She taught a workshop last spring at the international astrologers' convention in Anaheim. On a radio program last year, she read \"the energy\" of palm prints faxed in by listeners. She's currendy coauthoring a book on astrological physiog\u00ad nomy (judging character by facial features). Emma now sits directly across from me and asks my per\u00ad mission to do a reading. She recites a meditation prayer, repeating my full birth name three times. She invokes \"the consciousness of the entire universe\" so that she may be \"an instrument for Joseph Lasica today and read what's up for him on a soul's level.\" She gives me the 30-second crash course in the divine sci\u00ad ences: \"Everything in the universe is energy; it just changes shape into different molecular structures. The DNA and RNA in the physical body is affected\u2014changed\u2014by astrological forces. This body you have is a skin bag to house your soul. CID> And the earth is our big university. We all come many times. Basically, my role is to get people connected with what their mission's about, with what they're really here for.\" I nod. We get down to some serious energy-reading. Emma directs me to hold my palms up and press forward, as if against an imaginary window. She meets my hands with hers. She closes her eyes. \"There are influences in your per\u00ad sonal life that are blocking your energy, interfering with what you're here to do in this life. Whatever it is, you're not com\u00ad pletely in control. There are influences and circumstances that are holding you back.\" She pauses, as if waiting for me to jump in. But I'm not sold yet. I'm waiting to hear some solid, specific evidence. I want a smoking karmic gun. Emma forges on. \"You like to control events. But you're not a con\u00ad troller of people. You can be the most stubborn person in the world, if you set your mind to be, but there's also a part of you that can be easily manipu\u00ad lated by other people.\" \"Um-hum,\" I say. I'm still waiting for some snippet of insight that doesn't hold true for 95 percent of the popula\u00ad tion. \"You go, 'Um-hum,'\" she says, a litde impatiently. \"Do you see that in your life?\" I feel a twinge of guilt for not being a team playet. So I prattle on a bit before we move on. Next, Emma inspects the curve lines at the base of my right forefinger. \"See these lines?\" she says. I peer closer. \"Which lines?\" \"Right here,\" she says, running her finger across them. \"These ate the rings of Solomon. This is very, very unusual, Joseph. Very rare, only one or two out of a hundred people have rhis. It means you're extremely intuitive. You've got several gift markings\u2014look at all this water energy! This curving energy, right here\u2014\" She pauses dramatically. \"It means you're clair\u00ad voyant,\" she says at last. \"Are you in touch with that?\" I'm surprised by this news. \"Well,\" I say, \"sometimes I do sense things before they happen. But I've never felt any special powers or abilities.\" \"You're just shut down,\" Emma says without missing a beat. \"You're a closet clairvoyant. Your energy's blocked, you don't have a handle on it yet. You've got all these bursts of energy in your moon, in your spiritual realm, but you're resist\u00ad ing it. You have to learn to use that, it's meant for your higher good on the planet.\" I'm still trying to get a handle on all the new buzzwords I'm hearing\u2014\"soul agenda,\" \"karmic debts\"\u2014but Emma is already plunging into more personal spheres. She runs a finger across my right palm. \"You've got trouble on your heart line. 48 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER sweetheart. See this bubble right here? Lots of emotional scars.\" I draw back a little. She's hit on something, and her words resonate deeply. I feel my palms begin to dampen. I peer into her eyes and wonder, What does she see? What does she know? Has she tapped into some cosmic pipeline to the truth? But a moment later the thought intrudes: I'm not wearing a wedding band. And the skeptical side of me thinks, What 39-year-old single guy doesn't have emotional scars? Emma runs a finger across my right palm. \"Somewhere when you were a child you had humiliation and embarrass\u00ad ment, whether you're aware of it or not. It affected you so much that the energy created these lines.\" She shows me the bubbles on my heart line. \"See? This is energy imprinting. You've got some issues that have not been resolved in the heart arena. This has to be healed. The emotional arena is not easy for you. It's not easy for you to express your feelings. Are you in touch with that?\" \"Yes,\" I say. Still, I am waiting for a revelation, an epiphany, a moment of spiritual eureka. Instead, I am hearing general\u00ad izations that could be applied to any male in America. Emma now takes my left hand. \"Things have never come easily for you. You've had a tough life, things never seem to work out\u2014whether it was your mother, your father, your fam\u00ad ily, the church, or whatever. You've got a lot of repressed feel\u00ad ings\u2014hurt, anger, pain. You didn't have a 'Father Knows Best' childhood.\" Well, no. Not exactly. But in fairness, my childhood fairly brimmed with humdrum. I had an uneventful upbringing in a typical middle-class suburban neighborhood. I'm unusually close to my parents; they just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. But I don't mention this. I haven't come here to argue. An ex-girlfriend, who believed in the supernatural, once related to me some of her psychic's findings: that she had a very old soul, and that she had an important mission to accomplish for the planet that would reveal itself within five years. (This other psychic also confirmed that my ex-flame\u2014who had a special kinship with dolphins and whales\u2014had originally come from another planet. This revelation did not do wonders for our relationship.) The rest of my session with Emma races by. She discusses my numerology. She reads my fingerprints. I ask about my life line and what the future holds. But Emma won't talk about that, not at a first reading. Instead, she speaks vaguely of \"closures, endings, comple\u00ad tions\" that took place two years ago. This doesn't ring any bells. My last serious relationship ended four years ago; I've been in my job for eight years. \"You're now entering a period of illumination,\" Emma says. \"The vibration over you for the rest of your life is a nine; it's about expanding you, stretching you. If one is in denial during this vibration, it's a hellacious life. Nothing flowers. If people with nine paths don't wake up, they're the most miserable peo\u00ad ple on the planet when they're seventy, eighty years old. But if you are open and you follow the truth about this path, then you can get over this hurdle. You'll look upon this day and rec\u00ad ognize what it was all about.\" She springs up and disappears into the bedroom. \"I want you to be open to new ideas,\" she calls out. \"I want you to accept personal growth and do some serious healing stuff\". I want you to really dig deep and do the inner child work. If we work on our souls' growth, then our lives will flourish.\" Emma reappears and hands me a brochure for a \"Life F.mma nnw moves into the mcaning- of-life realm. \"You have a very old soul,\" she says. The room goes quiet, the sec\u00ad onds swimming past. \"You've been hang\u00ad ing around this planet for a long time. Are you in touch with what you're here to do yet in this life?\" \"No,\" I say, bracing myself. My pulse quickens. Souls, life missions\u2014I haven't talked about this sort of thing for years. \"Your life in this time is about being an artist with some\u00ad thing to say\u2014writing, art, music. You have an enormous gift that you're not fully utilizing yet. Your time here is about car\u00ad rying out the message to the world, to serve the higher good of the planet. The message you're here to bring out is to heal peo\u00ad ple. You're here to be a leader and to pass on new concepts. You're here to help the planet. This is big-time stuff, Joseph.\" Instantly, I regret the fact that I'd mentioned my writing career to Emma when we met briefly several months ago. But something else bothers me.

As I prepare to leave, she has one last parting gift: a rose- colored stencil cutout of the word \"love.\" Across the bottom of the stencil she has penned, \"I love you!\" \"I want you to tape this to your bathroom mirror,\" she says. I thank her. We hug. I walk outside into die bright after\u00ad noon sunlight, feeling a bit dazed, clutching the leaflets and die bright-colored love note. Later, I convey die gist of my encounter with Emma to Charles T. Tan, an internationally known authority on para\u00ad psychology. Tart, a senior fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Sausalito, has written 11 books on parapsychology and altered states of consciousness. He tells me that most psychics absolutely believe in the legitimacy of what diey're doing. \"The vast majority of psy-dressed, your Then they go general, univi work, m.irriai you.

More commonly, they go to get some counseling with what to do with their life, to get some feedback on their problems, whether it's about love, relationships, money, sex, the meaning of life.\" Tart believes that certain aspects of psychic ability\u2014occa\u00ad sional flashes of telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition\u2014do take place in everyday life. But he doubts that these abilities can be summoned at will or controlled during a psychic read\u00ad ing. \"There's no evidential value to those sorts of claims,\" he says. Ray Hyman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene and a respected critic of parapsychology, takes a more emphatic view. He says that researchers have con- sistendy failed to find any evidence of psychic phenomena when controlled laboratory conditions are in place. \"They've tested psychics and none seem to be able to do what they claim,\" says Hyman, a Fellow and member of the executive council of the Committee for the Scientific Investi\u00ad gation of Claims of the Paranormal. \"There's no scientific evi\u00ad dence that psychics have any paranormal powers of any son\u2014 other than good observational powers.\" But it's not surprising, Hyman says, that a lot of people buy into these psychic parlor games. \"Anyone who's been to a reading knows that it's quite a powerful experience. A psychic has the upper hand right from the start. You're entering their world, using their language, fol\u00ad lowing their rules.\" What really makes it all work, Hyman and Tan both say, is this: Psychics are tenifically keen judges of character. Hyman says: \"The psychic reader can make an educated guess about your background by observing the way you're weight, posture, body language, speech patterns, into their basic spiel, making it sound as if these :rsal problems we all have\u2014about childhood, ;e\u2014is a very personalized experience unique to diile, they're picking up on subde cues you give act, gestures, the way you move your hands\u2014to i they're hitting home or when they're cold, in being read, meantime, is doing all the work, r nature to make sense out of nonsense, to find \u00bbthan is really there.

But Hyman also says that many psychics \"mean well and believe in what they're doing.\" Hyman knows about the power and allure of the \"divine sciences.\" He used to be a palm reader himself, as a teenager in Boston. He tells this story: \"After doing it for years, I actually came to believe in the 'science' of palmistry. Until one day, when a friend whom I respected, a professional mentalist, said it would make an interesting experiment if I would deliberately give readings that were the exact opposite of what the lines on the palm indicated. I tried it out. And, to my horror, my read\u00ad ings were as successful as ever.\" Hyman chuckles at the memory. \"Of course, it had noth\u00ad ing to do with the lines on people's hands. They're the ones who were creating the meaning, shaping the reading to make it fit into their lives.\" I ask Tan and Hyman to make a judgment call: Do psy\u00ad chics serve any beneficent purpose? Tan thinks they may. \"We have a spiritual nature that's largely repressed in our society. We're not sure of what values and beliefs we can depend on anymore. We are desperately hungry for deep meaning. So we'll take this kind of spiritual junk food, tied in with all the mumbo jumbo, because we're looking for these litde cores of truth. So in that sense, psychics are filling a social need, if you put the science aside and approach it from a therapist's perspective.\" But Hyman thinks psychics contribute to Americans' sense of disillusionment. \"We're the least scientifically literate soci\u00ad ety of any country in rhe civilized world, and this just feeds into that trend. Look at what's popular on TV: Unsolved Mysteries, In Search Of\u2014 all these pseudoscientific shows. It all gives people a false idea about where the source of our health and well-being comes from. It opens up all sorts of dangers of people being manipulated and deceived and exploited. Ultimately, it perpetuates the popular appetite for irrational\u00ad ity.\" 50 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS A Scientifically Based Encyclopedia of the Paranorma WENDY M. GROSSMAN The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Edited by Gordon Stein. Prometheus Books, Amherst, NY, 1996. ISBN 1-57392-021-5. 859 pp. Hardcover, $149.95. Any skeptic who gets called with any regularity to represent the movement on radio or TV longs for a solid encyclopedia on the paranor\u00ad mal to crib from. The other night, I got a call from an astronomy type who had been asked to go on BBC Radio One to debate a prominent British astrologer. He wanted information about die astrologer, which was no problem. But then he asked a question that had me stumped: By what authority do astrologers claim to speak? What are die origins of beliefs about the characteristics of particular \u00abig\"? of die zodiac? I've done countless debates on astrology, and I didn't know this most basic information about die discipline. Gordon Stein's The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal could have provided an answer to my astronomer's question. The section on astrology, written by Geoffrey Dean, Arthur Mather, and Ivan W. Kelly, traces astrology from its Mesopotamian origins through the Alan Leo-inspired rebirth in the early 1900s to the advent of today's personal computers, which make days' worth of calculations die routine work of a second. Along die way, they analyze the main arguments for and against, and critique the most signif\u00ad icant evidence. If Geoffrey Dean's name sounds familiar, it should: he was die author, back in 1987, of a two-part series on astrology for die SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Many of the other contribu\u00adtors' names should be just as familiar to SI readers: James Alcock, Paul Kurtz, Larry Kusche, Bernard Leikind, Persi Diaconis, Martin Gardner, and Terence Hines. The editorial board for the book THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE includes Carl Sagan (who also wrote the foreword), Antony Flew, and Stephen Jay Gould. Many of die book's odier topics have also been covered in SI: crop circles (writ\u00ad ten by Joe Nickell), palmistry (Ray Hyman), biorhydims (Terence Hines), and skepticism and die paranormal (Paul Kurtz). What's difficult to figure out is how the particular topics were chosen. There are entries for the mediums Leonora Piper, D.D. Home, Margery Crandon, and Eusapia Palladino, and 1960s guru Carlos Castaneda, but no separate entry for Uri Geller. Geller does get a couple of pages in die entry on CSI- COP itself, and another under psychoki- netic metal bending. The Society for Psychical Research, Charles Fort, and Harry Houdini get entries, but not James Randi (although he is quoted in a num\u00ad ber of articles). There are vampires, exor\u00ad cisms, coincidences, and miracles\u2014but only a single paragraph on homeoparhy. and no separate section or index listing for either the scientific method, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, or quantum mechanics. This book loosely shares its category with a number of other tides. Leslie Shepard's two-volume Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (Gale Research, 1991) is much more complete on paranormal topics and claimants, but much less skeptical. James Randi's An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (St. Martin's Press, 1995) covers much of die same ground but in a series of short, pop\u00ad ularly written entries. Simon Hoggart's and Mike Hutchinson's Bizarre Beliefs (Richard Cohen Books, 1995), reviewed Wendy Grossman is a writer and the founder of The Skeptic (U.K.). She lives in Richmond, Surrey SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 51 BOOK REVIEWS in this issue, is aimed at the mass market of people who have never thought about these issues rather than at informed skep\u00ad tics. But die best all-round introduction is probably still Terence Hines's textbook- style Science and the Paranormal (Prometheus, 1983), which manages to be both readable and thorough. But Stein is trying to do something different from all of these: His goal is to produce a scientifically based encyclope\u00ad dia. This explains many of die puzzling gaps in coverage. Stein says for some sub\u00ad jects he was unable to find suitable schol\u00ad arly experts. Rather than commission articles by people whose credentials or background were, he felt, insufficient, he preferred to leave some subjects out. At the same time, he limits his definition of \"paranormal\" to include only phenom\u00ad ena\u2014or anomalies\u2014whose truth would depend on a violation of currently known principles of science. This means he sticks to phenomena that are scientifi\u00ad cally testable, leaving out purely religious phenomena. Exceptions like the Shroud of Turin are included because science is used to justify the claims made for it. Fair enough. The result, though, is to leave you frustrated when the subject you want isn't covered. The sections on statis\u00ad tics and assessing coincidence are really useful, but most of us would really be glad to have a convenient place to grab briefings on die scientific principles that paranormal claims violate. How do you argue against die often-repeated claim that quantum mechanics supports a number of parapsychological claims? It's inevitable that a book of this size and scope will be somewhat uneven, since no two authors will approach their topics in exacdy the same way. So die graphology article (Barry Beyerstein) details die history and claims of graphol\u00ad ogy and summarizes the relevant research, but the Castaneda piece (Jay C. Fikes) is disappointingly diffuse. For a layperson who doesn't understand the methods and accepted practices of scien\u00ad tific anthropology but has read Castaneda's books and found their metaphors valuable, it's difficult to accept the dismissal of Castaneda's stories on the grounds that his reports are untypical. That example illustrates why con\u00ad structing an encyclopedia like this is such an ambitious and difficult project. Much of this encyclopedia is really excellent. I've already mentioned the astrology sec\u00adtion; there are many other well- researched sections such as graphology and psychic healing (Chris French) that lay out the history and significant research relating to a particular topic. I'd like to think that this encyclopedia is only die first version of a work that will be regularly updated and enlarged. D The Paranormal As a Search for the Soul GORDON STEIN Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation. By Nicholas Humphrey. Basic Books, New York, 1996. ISBN 0-465-08044-8. 244 pp. Hardcover, $23. Nicholas Humphrey was a real surprise to the people who awarded the Perrott-Warwick Fellowship in Psychical Research at Cambridge University. Although he did get the fellowship (despite fears that he might be a skeptic), it turned out that he has produced a book. Leaps of Faith, mat is strong critique of the whole idea of psychical research. Humphrey feels that the goal of most (if not all) psychical researchers is to search for the soul. In other words, diere is a stricdy religious motivation present. While I am certain that some psychic researchers (and prob\u00ad ably most psychic believers) have diis as their motivation, it is quite possible to be motivated to do psychical research merely because you are interested in whether there are new natural phenom\u00ad ena that we do not at present under\u00ad stand. Humphrey sees a strict dichotomy of motivations here, which docs not allow for a middle ground. Of course, Humphrey's skepticism about phenomena of a new sort in die world or universe is perfectly proper. All scientists should be skeptical. The result of Humphrey's skepticism in Leaps of Faith will delight some readers, for it certainly tries to downplay the likeli\u00ad hood that psi phenomena are real. Again, I do not fault the book for this, but I do think that the choices possibly ought to be a little broader. Humphrey writes well, and the book holds the reader's attention. Humphrey does take some strange positions (\"strange\" in the sense that they seem to contradict some of his other ideas). Among them is the proba\u00ad bly true idea that even the most fervent of skeptics (deep in his or her heart) hopes on occasion that the nontn.iten.il world really does exist. Of course, wishes and hopes are not the same as facts. People can hope that the soul exists without a single fact to support its existence. Humphrey feels that many who believe in the paranormal are on what he calls a search for the soul. Their motiva\u00ad tion is to have the world become a bet\u00ad ter place by harnessing the force of the paranormal, even though some would say that by its very nature the paranor\u00ad mal can never be explained or under\u00ad stood by science. He posits what he calls \"The Argument from Unwarranted Design,\" by which he means that //\"an explanation of a phenomenon provides us widi no real reason why it should occur as it does, then die real explana\u00ad tion of die phenomenon probably lies 52 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS elsewhere. He gives the following exam\u00ad ple: Suppose your explanation of why a parrot speaks in English to you as you go by is that it has mastered die English language. Then it is pointed out that the parrot only says two things: \"Who's a pretty boy then?\" and \"Strike a light.\" Had the parrot truly mastered the English language, it certainly would be able to say more than these two things. Therefore, your explanation is unlikely to be correct. Humphrey feels that a similar case can be made for the (non) existence of the paranormal. Although Humphrey recognizes that the position of the skeptic would be much stronger if that skeptic could sug\u00ad gest how a particular effect was achieved, and could, in fact, duplicate the effect, he claims that there is no real obligation on the skeptic's part to do so. Another clever point made by Humphrey is that if you really had para\u00ad normal powers, would you demonstrate Gordon Stein is a physiologist, editor of The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal (Prometheus Books, 1996), and director of the Center fir Inquiry Libraries. them by doing effects that conjurors could do by trickery (for example, bend keys or spoons)? Among the other topics Humphrey discusses are: why people tend to accept a paranormal explanation of things when it is not the proper, logical thing to do; whether \"traditional\" science has actually been testing many of the major postulates of parapsychology all along; whether the actions of Jesus, as described in the New Testament, bolster the case for the existence of psi forces or not; and whether the abilities of con\u00ad jurors to duplicate many of the results that so-called psychics claim are pro\u00ad duced by their special \"powers\" says any\u00ad thing about the genuineness of those powers. Leaps of Faith is a very thoughtful and instructive book. Humphrey has mar\u00ad shalled his arguments carefully and illus\u00ad trated them well. It is the kind of book that both skeptics and believers in the paranormal would do well to read, and it holds a unique place in the literature for that reason. It should be mentioned in passing that this book has the tide Soul Searching in the United Kingdom. issues. Shamos asks if this is a reasonable goal and concludes that it is not, for only about 5 to 6 percent of adults in this country have the detailed knowl\u00ad edge of the workings of science to have this kind of scientific literacy. Will this number change dramatically any time soon? The author shows that this is extremely unlikely. Why this is so forms the heart of the argument presented in the book. First, thete is the nature of science itself. The author shows that for most people, science is interesting, but it is also hard to learn. Science, like any worthwhile human endeavot, takes some effort to master. Learning the lan\u00ad guage of mathematics adds another layer of difficulty. Of course, it is possi\u00ad ble to teach much of science without mathematics. Yet it is through mathe\u00ad matics that one comes to see clearly the nature of science. For me, science became more interesting as I learned more about mathematics. Then there is the difference between scientific thinking and what we would call \"commonsense thinking.\" The author notes that while commonsense thinking works well for everyday living. a different kind of thinking is necessary for science. The idea of a black hole is certainly remote from anything we meet in our normal lives. Finally, there is the way science is taught in schools. Science seems to be something \"cut and dried,\" a subject presented as a package with no loose ends. Shamos points out that befote sci\u00ad entific ideas reach textbooks, the scien\u00ad tific community has reached consensus on them. So the nature of science causes it to appear to be a done deal. What about the majority of students not destined to become scientists and engineers? And what about the majority of adults who do not have scientific lit- Roger Klare is a science writer in Athens, Ohio.

Rutgers L^~^A^' University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1995. ISBN 0- 8135-2196-3. 261 pp. Hardcover, $27.95. What does the term scientific literacy mean? Does it mean knowledge of science facts and ideas? Does it mean familiarity with how science works? Does it mean hav\u00ad ing sufficient understanding to make independent judgments on science- based issues in society? Ot does it mean all the above? Morris Shamos has taken on the monumental task of sorting all of this out in his book The Myth of Scientific Literacy. He is professor emer\u00ad itus of physics at New York University. In addition, he has been president of the New York Academy of Sciences and the National Science Teachers Association. In today's usage, scientific literacy has come to mean an understanding that enables the public to make inde\u00ad pendent judgments on science-based SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 53 BOOK REVIEWS eracy? Throughout the book, Shamos builds the case for radically changing the goals of science education. He argues for science awareness in place of science literacy. He describes three prin\u00ad ciples of science awareness. They are: 1. Teaching an appreciation of sci\u00ad ence as an ongoing endeavor and a part of our culture. 2. Focusing on technology and how it affects personal health and safety. 3. Emphasizing the wise use of scien\u00ad tific experts. The aim of science awareness is to get an idea of how science works. The stress is more on process and less on facts. Technology becomes a way to dis\u00ad cuss something that is directly relevant to people's lives. It also serves to intro\u00ad duce the nature of science. The use of scientific experts may seem controversial to some. Yet since it is impossible for everyone to be a scientific expert, learn\u00ad ing to use genuine experts is a necessary skill. Several avenues to science awareness are open. All have their own strengths and weaknesses. As Shamos reminds us, there are no simple solutions. Elementary school is a promising place for developing an appreciation of science. Children are naturally curious and full of imagination. In my own experience as a teacher at an after-school science program, I found the students very excited about the subject. I taught them what I knew, and they were ready for more. I functioned as a science men\u00ad tor. That is one way Shamos suggests to fulfill some of the potential for science education at the elementary level. Another way is to take a look at how we prepare elementary teachers to teach science. With all the subjects these teachers must teach, it is perhaps not surprising that science preparation is limited. Yet the preservice training is vital. As the author points out, the teacher, not the curriculum, has the pri\u00ad mary role in shaping science education. Television, magazines, and newspa\u00adpers are vehicles for developing science awareness in adults. Informal science education in the mass media does have potential. On closer inspection, how\u00ad ever, the problems with the mass media approach become apparent. Isolated sci\u00ad ence facts are given without context. Often journalists search for conflicting views that end up confusing the audi\u00ad ence. And there is an ever-present fasci\u00ad nation with pseudoscience topics as soft news and entertainment. Not all the news about science pre\u00ad sentations in the mass media is bad. But the public often ends up with a very limited view of science. A limited view of science may have an unforeseen effect. Public opinion polls appear to show an inverse relation\u00ad ship between knowledge about science and knowledge about pseudoscience. The battle against pseudoscience is one reason for developing science awareness. Combating spurious arguments and beliefs demands constant efforts. Science awareness is important for another reason. Science is fascinating. Shamos defines it as \"a very special way that humans have devised for looking at ordinary things and trying to under\u00ad stand them.\" A few scientists, such as Einstein or McClintock, have seen fur\u00ad ther than most. To appreciate just part of what they saw is worth the effort. The Case of the Disappearing Mysteries GORDON STEIN Bizarre Beliefs. By Simon Hoggart and Mike Hutchinson. Richard Cohen Boob (7 Manchester Square, London V/1M 5RE), 1995. ISBN 1-86066-022-3. 224 pp. Oversize paperback, \u00a313, cloth, \u00a320. The authors of Bizarre Beliefs, written for the layperson, exam\u00ad ine and review the evidence for a number of supposedly paranormal phe\u00ad nomena. Included are such perennial favorites as the Bermuda Triangle, Nostradamus, crop circles, astrology, fire walking, dowsing, ghosts, and the Loch Ness monster. There is not much that is totally new or original here, but the authors do a fine job in objectively sum\u00ad marizing material. They have examined the skeptical literature, as well as the credulous material. In many cases, as is well known to skeptics, the \"mystery\" disappears as soon as all of the facts are presented. Once you know, for example, that there was a storm in the area and the wreckage was found later, all of the mys\u00ad tery about a ship's disappearance in the so-called Bermuda Triangle vanishes. It's easy to make mystery out of anything by withholding (intentionally or uninten\u00ad tionally) all of the facts about a case. The authors properly point out that Occam's razor is a powerful tool for examining alternative explanations. Many times there is a simpler, naturalis\u00ad tic explanation, and that is the one we should accept if we are forced to make a choice. A healthy skepticism pervades the author's presentation. Again, this is the proper attitude for scientists and philosophers, especially when results in one direction will cause many thor\u00ad oughly tested explanations to have to be reevaluated. The usefulness of Bizarre Beliefs will be largely for the nonspecialist who wants a brief, accurate, and clearheaded summary of the present knowledge about the various phenomena men\u00ad tioned, plus some very nice color pho\u00ad tographs and drawings.

Science has not yet shown promise for measuring \"greed\" or \"generosity\" via operational definitions that are unambiguous and widely agreed upon. Perhaps science will never do so. I sus\u00ad pect that most scientists would agree that greed and generosity are real and important; as well as being difficult to understand. The ambiguity involved in measuring crucial concepts like greed and generosity brings into focus the challenge encountered when trying to achieve academic progress in the humanities. The humanities also are handicapped by the fact that the number of impor\u00ad tant variables can be large, and the effects of many variables are difficult to isolate. Some of them may even be unidentified. The fact that many schol\u00ad ars in the humanities and social sciences are nor well versed in physical science means that they may not see their own knowledge base in a sensible perspec\u00ad tive. This can result in misguided views about physical science that, in die long run, can only damage the very disci\u00ad plines diat they cherish. They may fail to offer insights where their perspective is unique; and they may try to provide understanding where their knowledge is least reliable. The humanities are extremely impor\u00ad tant to our society; and they are fasci\u00ad nating. The same can also be said for physical science. Still, physical science can claim to be more objective and more reliable. This relative degree of objectiv\u00ad ity and reliability matters a great deal, but it is not sufficient to provide all of the solutions for humanity's problems. Science and the humanities must collab\u00ad orate. In fact, it is impossible to fully sepa\u00ad rate science from an. It is silly to try to separate diem. Everyone can (and must) understand and employ both approaches in almost every aspect of life. Learning to discriminate the degree of reliability associated with ideas is a real test for an educated individual. Each issue should be examined on an individual basis regarding its reliability. In terms of value, research is appropriate on all topics; and all knowledge is important. Still, knowledge that is of low reliability may be held to be of less value; and this creates a problem that the humanities and the social sciences must address by educating the populace and its political leaders. There are many issues that the arts and humanities should bring to the attention of society with both a persuasive and positive mes\u00ad sage. In die long run, launching silly attacks on science can only be self- destructive for the humanities. The point is that science and tech\u00ad nology will serve humanity well only if our hearts and heads work in concert. Critical, rational thought (of a physical- science style) and respect for the world in which we live (seeking truth and beauty in the tradition of die liberal arts) are both needed. Put simply, we need all the knowledge we can get. This is the goal of a classical education in which we learn how to think broadly, rather than what to think narrowly. A philosophical or political position that assigns the same degree of reliabil\u00ad ity to all knowledge equally is dangerous for society. The flight from science, rea\u00ad son, and objectiviry is cowardly; and it is a matter for serious concern. The acqui\u00ad sition of knowledge is a serious task that requires thought that is caring, thor\u00ad ough, and critical. In the future (as was true in the past) courage will be needed to perform this task. 56 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FORUM Art# Reason, and Reality JANE HADDAM The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke. The only thing that bothered me was that none of the reviews I'd read had warned me. There, right at the center of Alice Hoffman's otherwise relentlessly mun\u00ad dane novel Seventh Heaven was a witch. Norma could cast spells to make people smaller and communicate teleparJiically with runaway housewives and grade school principals. She could do this while standing in line at Sears, worrying about the brand of snow shovel she was buying that she didn't know how to use anyway. Finding elements of the supernatural in American fiction U. ofcoaoe, nothing unusual. From Nathaniel Hawthorne to Stephen King, there has always been an element of the Gothic in the American imaginative landscape. During most of the twentieth century, however, American literary fiction has been determinedly real\u00ad istic. With one or two exceptions\u2014Joyce Carol Oates comes to mind\u2014the writer who wanted to produce fiction-as-art over the past eighty years dedicated himself to a naturalist tradition. Dreiser wanted to show what life was like for the poor and disenfranchised. Hemingway wanted his readers to understand what it really felt like to be in a war. Roth committed him\u00ad self to recreating the experiences of American Jews, without favor. Every once in a while one of these writers would pro\u00ad duce a fantasy, like Roth's about the man who turned into a gigantic breast, but it was clearly Libeled a fantasy. There was no confusion about what you were to believe could happen in the real world. American popular fiction, on the other hand, has always been enamored of the fantastic, the religious, and die para\u00ad normal. Even the hard-boiled private eye novel, diat quintessential home of \"gritty realism,\" has really been a fantasy, the daydream home of people who would Why is literary fiction seemingly giving up on the naturalistic tradition? prefer So 11nnk of themseives as possessed by cynicism rather than the devil. Still, hard-boiled private eye novels were con\u00ad sidered \"literary\" exacdy to the extent to which diey were considered realistic. The more obviously unrealistic productions\u2014 die vampire and werewolf novels, the ghost stories and tales of religious conver\u00ad sion\u2014spent a great deal of space setting die stage to make their premises more believable. 1 have written fourteen detec\u00ad tive novels, and in only one of them did I have an element (highly ambiguous) that might be considered paranormal. I spent three pages preparing the reader for it and hedging around it in every way I could think of, because I didn't want my work to be treated as a joke. All the popular writers of the fantastic, from Stephen King to Dean R. Koontz, treat the para\u00ad normal as in need of vigorous defense if it is to be acceptable in fiction. No modern writer of ghost or horror or detective fic\u00ad tion would assume her reader's willing\u00ad ness to swallow the existence of ghoulies and goblins and beasties. Even Frank Peretti's religious novels, aimed at an audi\u00ad ence of born-again and Pentecostal Christians, surround their miracles with explanations and theories, to make the unscientific sound scientific and dierefore acceptable for belief. In Alice Hoffman's Seventh Heaven there is no attempt to explain or justify the use of the paranormal at all. It is just there, like the Bosco chocolate syrup and the Metrecal weight-loss milkshakes that turn up in every one of the neariy identi\u00ad cal houses in her 1959 Long Island sub- urt>. In Turtle Moon, the Hoffman novel that followed Seventh Heaven, there is a lovesick ghost and a dog with telepathy. In Practical Magic, the two old women who serve as foster parents to the girls whose stories are at the center of the novel are witches with a vengeance. It's what they do for a living. If this phenomenon were restricted to die work of Alice Hoffman, there wouldn't be anything to worry about. I could either decide not to read Alice Hoffman's novels, or only to read them when I wouldn't mind if the fat middle-aged housewife checking out the price of Kraft Singles in Safeway is also able to move large objects just by thinking about it.

What is more discomforting is that none of the high\u00ad brow journals of review has thought it important to mention that they have. In the reviews of Ann Beatrie's Another You, there were complaints of a lack of the usual fire in Beanie's writing, but no men\u00ad tion of the fact that two of the characters arc connected in some cosmic, unspeci\u00ad fied way that involves telepathy across decades. Sometimes these books are attempts to address the differences between Western and Eastern ways of looking at the world, with the Eastern (predictably) coming off the winner. In Amy Tan's The Hundred Secret Senses, one of the two main charac\u00ad ters is a ghost come to earth to return the reincarnated spirit of her friend to rhe iness she was not able to achieve when the two of them were together in a former life. This is presented as the silly nonsense of an uneducated Chinese immigrant untii the end of the book, when it turns out to be true. In the nov\u00ad els of Louise Etdrich, Native American healing rituals fight valiantly against the rationalistic excesses of the white scientific Jane Haddam is the author of fourteen detective novels. Ijust finished teaching an astronomy course at Sacramento City College on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Students were expected to turn in weekly writing assignments on various topics related to the subject. As their final such assignment, I asked them to explain whether they felt the govern\u00ad ment was engaging in a grand UFO civilization rhat is destroying a noble peo- pie. Most of these novels, however, throw in elements of the supernatural simply because they do. Unlike popular horror fiction, the supernatural is not the point of the stories they tell. It's just another detail, like the brand names and car makes and suburban street names (Maple Way, Lilac Lane) that dot the prose like pats of butter. When one of the three women in Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres lies down on the bed in her childhood room and gets up with a recovered mem\u00ad ory so paranoically complex it could have done duty as an Oliver Stone screenplay, none of the othet characters is even sur\u00ad prised. My question is this: at what point did we become a society in which reports of the paranormal ceased to be remarkable, in which even highly educated people were willing to accept telepathy and spells as easily as they accept Big Macs and fries? The readers of these booh an* assumed to be at the top of the intellectual pyramid. Licensed practical nurses and waitresses at Denny's don't get their advice from The New York Review of Books. Licensed prac\u00ad tical nurses and waitresses at Denny's have more sense than the present cultural elite. Nobody is going to present them with an ambulatory zombie without giving them WAYNE R. ANDERSON cover-up. They were told to state their conclusion, give evidence for it, and explain why they thought the govern\u00ad ment might be doing this. We had not yet discussed this topic in class, so all ideas were their own. About half of the class was skeptical of a cover-up and of UFOs (as alien vis\u00ad itors) in general. The other half some plausible explanation as to how a dead man could walk. It might not be an explanation rhat impresses scientific peo\u00ad ple, but it will at least be an explanation. Alice Hoffman gives no explanation for her witches and telcpaths at all. Other people worry about the reli\u00ad gious right. I worry about a climate of unreason where the world is no longer wanted as a rationally knowable place. I worry about a highly privileged group of people with a great deal of influence over the content of theit culture who have given up any pretense of fidelity to ratio\u00ad nality or even common sense. I worry about what it means that Harper's and The Atlantic and even Vanity Fair know what is dangerous about fundamentalist Baptists and militant creationists, but don't know what is dangerous about ram\u00ad pant acceptance of the paranormal as fact. In the meantime, I have some advice for anyone in the skeptical community who wants to read contemporary American Pinion: go for the popular stuff. If there are elements of the super\u00ad natural in the plot, the cover copy will tell you so. If there aren't, you may very well find yourself reading one of the last great crusaders for the primacy of logic in human affairs. All the people I know who could fit that description write crime novels. expressed varying degrees of credence, ranging from openmindedness, leaning toward belief, to absolute conviction that rhe government knew of alien visi\u00ad tors but was keeping this knowledge a secret. Up to this point, I was not really surprised. It was the evidence cited by die believers that shocked me. Only one person cited a book as evi-What Constitutes Scientific Evidence? SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 59 dence, in this case Above Top Secret by Timothy Good, published in 1988 by William Morrow and Company; this person cited no other evidence except the book. Almost all the other evidence came from television programs: the made-for-television movies Fire in the Sky and Roswell; and \"Alien Autopsy,\" on the Fox network. Abductee interviews were also cited, but it was unclear whether they came from television, tabloids, or other written sources. Although no one used it in their papers, the X-Files was cited in class discussion Wayne R Anderson is in the Physics/ Astronomy Department, Sacramento City College, Sacramento, California 95822. Conference from page 7 one numbers of people who will talk to them quickly when they're researching relevant topics so they can make their daily deadlines. They are frustrated, too. When they try to cover a story responsi\u00ad bly, too often they find themselves calling scientists who won't talk to them, either because they disapprove of the topic being written about, or through lack of trust. The suspicion between scientists and the mass media appears to be mutual, by the way. Mathematician John Allen Paulos tells us during die afternoon panel that his academic colleagues were deeply suspicious when he wrote some\u00ad thing that was \"read by more than nine people.\" (His Innumeracy was on the bestseller list for five months.) This may be partly another generation gap. The UK's young psychologist Richard Wiseman, whose Saturday morning talk was one of the few where you could actu\u00ad ally read the slides, fields an annual experiment with and through the UK media. But in general, everyone agreed. Science needs better PR. Science has an image problem. Perhaps it does. By the second day, attendees were still talking about the first panel, which concentrated on science's need to communicate itself better to the mass media. Featured were Paulos, Gerbner, Adams, Italian TV journalist as presenting a credible account of a gov\u00ad ernment cover-up. Why would the government be hid\u00ad ing the existence of aliens from us? Most felt that it was to prevent societal chaos and to garner the benefits of alien tech\u00ad nology. Yet none of the students (save one) suggested any type of technology that might have resulted from this secrecy. The lone person who did suggest technology cited computers, color televi\u00ad sion, and \"medical advances,\" apparently totally unaware of any genealogy of research leading up to these develop\u00ad ments. What astonished, even frightened, me about these papers was the almost total reliance on television entertainment pro- Piero Angela, and moderator Milton Rosenberg, a professor of psychology from the University of Chicago. All but Paulos are over fifty. All are male. Rosenberg has an unmistakable radio- quality voice; he hosts American Reader on PBS for WGN Chicago. What grabbed conference attendees' attention was not Paulos's rundown, with digres\u00ad sions, of the contents of his latest book, or Angela's careful statistical records showing that his skeptical TV programs do affect people's beliefs but that some of the effect wears off over time. It was the moment when medical broadcaster Dean Edell phoned through from his call-in radio show with his audience of five mil\u00ad lion people via four hundred radio sta\u00ad tions to invite the panel to talk to America. Rosenberg said hello, and passed the microphone to George Gerbner, who didn't realize this was a planned part of the session and told Edell, \"We are not talking to you. You are eavesdropping on our session. . . .\" One audience member later pasted the panel for this, advising them that if they really wanted to understand why science gets short shrift on television they should look in the mirror. Some agreed with Gerbner; one audience member was so offended by the interruption he walked out. (Some people, though, were far more offended by the interruption the following day, when four CSICOP officials took the stage halfway through grams for evidence on a controversial and complex subject\u2014by college students. To be fair, in discussion some students were openly dismissive of considering televi\u00ad sion entertainment as evidence of any\u00ad thing. And the class members did look quite sheepish when I drew their atten\u00ad tion to the low-quality evidence they had used. Nevertheless, nearly half of the members of this college class were unable to cite any other evidence except televi\u00ad sion entertainment on a science topic. Now who says that television is innocu\u00ad ous entertainment but nothing worse? If many of these students have been getting all of their information on UFOs from television entertainment programs, can it be much different with other subjects? LJ the morning panel for an unannounced spot of fund-raising. CSICOP reports, however, that the fund appeal was very successful, raising over $200,000 in cash and pledges.) But the Edell fan at my lunch table the following day was still upset. By then, a day and a half of largely theoretical presentations had left me hungry for practical demonstrations and reports of work in progress. 1 am not good at passively consuming skepticism. I am normally either a working skeptic, irregularly called in to respond to claims on TV shows, or as journalist chasing after information. So the session on therapeutic touch was especially interest\u00ad ing, as it covered a new topic under active investigation by the Rocky Mountain Skeptics. I longed for more sessions like that\u2014the skeptical equiva\u00ad lent of scientific \"poster\" sessions\u2014espe\u00ad cially after the Australian Skeptics announced at the World Roundup on Sunday morning that they had, three weeks earlier, busted a psychic scam by infiltrating a member onto the scam out\u00ad fit's staff. Meanwhile, I have a question I wish someone would answer. How do you explain to a challenging questioner the difference between a \"good\" and a \"bad\" scientist when both skeptics and believ\u00ad ers quote scientists' findings to bolster their points of view? It's bad science, though human, to judge the quality of 60 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER scientists by whether or not one agrees with their conclusions. This came up Saturday morning, when statistician Jessica Utts and Ray Hyman went head to head over the future of parapsychological research. Utts is bright, clear, and easily under\u00ad stood, and she thinks it's time for para\u00ad psychology to move on from meta\u00ad analyses and statistical proofs that psi exists and focus on possible mechanisms. Which, she asked the audience, is more likely to convince you? Which, there\u00ad fore, should we research? Ray Hyman. who reviewed Utts's work, praising it a.s some of the best work done in parapsy\u00ad chology, ended up agreeing on this poinr even though his critique concluded that a psi effect was not proven. Hyman out\u00ad lined numerous problems with the experiments she cites and said her con\u00ad clusion that psi had been demonstrated was \"a big leap\" and unjustified. \"If Jessica's right, she's given us a promissory note, not data. We don't do science on a promissory note. We do science on what we produce.\" I've lost track now of who it was that SORRAT from page 46 decided to open the resin block itself. Again, this was carefully filmed. An industrial circular saw w\u00ab used re cur off three sides of the block. The block was then pried apart, and the card case removed. We then removed the card1, and compared the order with the deck order made before the cards were mailed to Missouri. All twenty-five cards were in the same order: The entities hac failed to reorder the deck. In short, SORRAT failed on two counts. First, the entities obtained only eight hits. This is not statistically signif\u00ad icant; it falls below the fifteen hits required by the experiment; and it is considerably below the rwenty-five hits that Cox claims has occurred on past occasions. Second, the entities claimed to have rearranged the order of the cards in deck. However, when the deck was opened, all twenty-five cards were in tht same order as when we sent them from Britain. compared a skeptics' conference to a Star Trek convention without the cos\u00ad tumes (and without the coffee breaks, parties, informal late-night sessions, public bulletin boards, and participants' list). But I was reminded of it when an English skeptic told Utts her results were due to \"an excess of female power.\" It would be less fair to apply that to the Florida-based retired candyman from Minnesota next to me on the bus on Saturday. (\"Why did you want to come?\" \"I have nothing else to do.\") Then there was the graduare student who paid his way to the conference by selling \"genuine Big Foot tracks\" over the Internet. There was even a guy who slipped me a copy of the history of CSI- COP he wrote for the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, and seemed almost proud to tell me CSICOP never refers to it. After the conference I go back to Ithaca, New York, where I lived for eleven years. The occasion is 2 hands-on science workshop for journalists that includes presentations from sociologist Trevor Pinch and psychologist Daryl This failure does not agree with the results obtained by at least two other experiments reported by Cox, both of which obtained a much larger number of hit* (Cox 1992a). This disccpancy could be interpreted in several ways. It is possible that the security precautions used in those previous studies were not as effective as the controls used in this study. An alternative view was presented by Cox (1992b), who noted that he was disappointed with the results and believed them due to either Richard Wiseman's unfavorable attitude toward SORRAT's research, or the fact that: The provision of an unfamiliar printed form for entering calls via the encircling of symbols from among five columns of them . . . presented problems ... which had not occurred to me when we agreed to the proce\u00ad dure. Either way, given the time and resources that we invested in this study, we must agree with Hansen and Broughton Bern, as well as the Virginia Polytechnic Institute's Henry Bauer. Bauer says the scientific method is a myth. Bern claims success in replicating the Ganzfeld experiments (and says in passing that Hyman is the most knowledgeable critic of these studies). Pinch spends his pre\u00ad sentation talking about CSICOP, saying that CSICOP has done many good things, but he is unhappy about the case of Jacques Benveniste (of \"remembering water\" notoriety), who he says was a seri\u00ad ous scientist whose career was destroyed by a \"kangaroo court.\" (Whether that's the case or not, I pointed out to Pinch that CSICOP was not involved in any way with Nature's investigation at Benveniste's lab in France other than to report on it after it was published in Nature.) Pinch sparks a protective instinct. CSICOP is not perfect, but it's all we have in the way of organizations doing this work. This gets reinforced when I 1..1I! an old friend to say hi.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 61 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR It's Not Journalism I'm afraid Bryan Farha went to a lot of trou\u00ad ble for nothing with his analysis of the jour\u00ad nalistic errors in Fox TVs Sightings (SI, May/June 1996). The show is not journal\u00ad ism. It is true that \"journalism requires a mas\u00ad sive effort for accuracy,\" but entertainment programming about litde green men does\u00ad n't. The semantic errors discussed in die article would be obvious to a good journal\u00ad ist, and I suspect a good entertainment pro\u00ad ducer would nonce also. The difference is diat die journalist at least intends to be truthful and objeoive, while die entertain\u00ad ment producer has no such obligations. Dissecting die show for journalistic errors is like criticizing Home Improvement for not showing you how to fix your water heater. Go ahead and criticize Sightings for being a slipshod compilation of scary sto\u00ad ries, all presented with the obvious inten\u00ad tion of making you believe. And dicrc's room to address die fact that die producers don't mind if lazy viewers think it is jour\u00ad nalism. But don't criticize it as poor journal\u00ad ism. I'm a professional journalist, and I know bad journalism when I see it. That's not journalism of any son. Greg Freeman Decatur, Ga. Allen Abductees and Fantasy Proneness Before responding to Joe Nickell's article on alien abductees and fantasy-proneness (SI, May/June 1996), I should state that I do not accept die extraterrestrial hypothesis, and do in fact think that some form of fantasy experience most likely accounts for die phe\u00ad nomenon. That said, I must find fault with Nickell's article. First, he says diat Wilson and Barber did not include alien abduction in their study because only a \"handful\" of cases had been reported. But three years before dieir article, an anthology of selected cases had appeared (Alien Abductions, ed. D. Scott Rogo, 1980); this only skimmed die surface of published accounts. Many dozens of cases had appeared by then. His mediodology also appears lacking. He picks out diose \"indicators\" of fantasy- proneness which die subjects of Mack's book display, and omits die odiers; and dien, why, he discovers diat diey do have tlio.se traits. Then he makes up more \"indi\u00ad cators of fantasy-proneness\" from other traits diey have, which seem to include any interest in religion or spirituality, to die point of listing have been raised as a Roman Catholic Labeling diese people \"fantasy-prone\" follows a clear agenda: having labeled diem dius, we can discount dieir experiences, just as in die past we could by caUing them \"crazy,\" or asking how much diey've been drinking, or what diey've been smoking. Worse, he fails to understand that Occam's razor does not simply prescribe die simplest hypothesis, but die simplest one diat accounts for all the facts. We need a theory diat accounts for die production and the content of die fantasies (assuming diem as such), not one diat merely labels them fantasies but explains nothing. Why did these individuals fantasize? Because they're fantasy-prone! So answers Nickell. Remember die doctor in Moliere who explained diat a sleeping-potion makes you fall asleep because it has a \"soporific property\"? Don't use Occam's razor to cut your own throat. As for die content of die fantasies (if such), Nickell has no explanation, except to hint diat Mack \"may be leading his wit\u00ad nesses.\" The culprit covers his tracks weU, considering diat Nickell does not seem to have found any evidence of die crime in die hundreds of pages in Mack's book. Finally, what does it say diat Carl Jung attempted precisely die task of understand\u00ad ing die fantasy content of UFO experiences fifty years ago, and diat neither die true believers nor die true disbelievers have ever foUowed up on his work? Rev. Dan Clore St. Helens, Ore. Joe Nickell replies: Rev. Clore faults my study, yet believes \"some form of fantasy experience most likely accounts for the phenomenon.\" On what basis does be \"think\" that is so? Intuition? Communion with angels? If he knows of some evidence to that effect, why doesn't he mention it? He did find space to cite a work that Wilson and Barber probably had not seen and that virtu\u00ad ally no one took seriously at the time, includ\u00ad ing many ufologists. Wilson and Barber did foresee that awareness of the existence of fan\u00ad tasy-prone people would have important implications to investigations of paranormal phenomena. Rev. Clore says my methodology \"appears\" lacking. In fact, 1 was able to pick out the indicators that I did because diey were pre\u00ad sent I did not \"make up more\" and I did not list being raised a Roman Catholic as an indi\u00ad cator of fantasy proneness. (Wilson and Barber found that religious \"visionaries\" like those who talk with the Virgin Mary were fantasy- prone types.) If the Rev. Clore finds objectionable my labeling certain abductees fantasy prone, why is his label of \"some form of fantasy experi\u00ad ence\" less so? Does it not also tend count\u2014publicly and even without founda\u00ad tion\u2014the abductee experience? As to Occam's razor, given the books and textbooks I have written that discuss the dic\u00ad tum, I hardly think I need be schooled on the subject by one who appears not to understand evidence. One can establish the fact that some\u00ad one is a murderer without proving motive. I did not discuss the why of Mack's sub\u00ad jects' fantasy proneness because that was beyond the scope of my study Why people fan\u00ad tasize was addressed by Wilson and Barber, and why people fantasize alien abductions has been addressed by Robert A Baker\u2014both of whom I cited Aromatherapy and Chemical Sensitivities Lynn McCutcheon's article decrying unfounded and exaggerated claims for aro\u00ad matherapy (SI, May/June 1996) brought to mind die problem of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, which may represent aro- madierapy in reverse. These patients are chronicaUy iU widi an apparent multisystem disorder. They are fre\u00ad quently intolerant to some foods, chemicals, and environmental agents at much less dian usually tolerated levels. Morbidity varies from mild discomfort to total disability. They are usually free of objective findings and diere is an absence of any generally accepted explanation. In a recent paper (Spyker, D. A 1995. Multiple chemical sensitivities\u2014syndrome and solution, Clinical Toxicology 33[2]:95- 99), Spyker describes this problem and points out diat many of diese patients trace dieir problem to an experience widi some 62 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR presumed toxic material where there was also an associated odor. He presents a per\u00ad suasive case that this syndrome may repre\u00ad sent a conditioned reflex where odor has become a conditioned stimulus triggering a variety of physiologic symptoms. He has had success on this basis in treating several patients with a desensitization program. If this works out, might not not the reverse also be true? Might an aroma, per\u00ad haps serendipitously, become a conditioned stimulus for a favorable physiologic response and under certain circumstances become an actual healing agent? I bring this up only to complement and not to contest McCutcheon's thesis. Albert Rauber, M.D. Professor Emeritus Emory University Atlanta, Ga. Lynn McCutcheon is somewhat in need of a new database.

U.K. Battery of Baghdad In the matter of \"The Enigmatic 'Battery of Baghdad\" (SI. May/June 1996), I offer the following comments. I think that the superficial resemblance of the Baghdad artifact to our own axial ly- symmetric, carbon-zinc-manganese-diox\u00ad ide-sal-ammoniac paste, not quite dry cell, has unduly influenced many opinions con\u00ad cerning the device. While it is apparent that the thing could have been an electric-current-producing device of sorts\u2014and I even believe that the ancient technicians and craftsmen of 2,000 years ago could have had access to at least one strong mineral acid, namely, sulfuric acid (read of the vast quantities of sulfuric acid created in some volcanic eruptions [Science May 10, 1966, p. 817])\u2014I do not think that it is necessary to name the artifact \"battery\" when there may be simpler solu\u00ad tions to the enigma. The supposedly one-time iron rod of the device is quoted as being \"completely oxi\u00ad dized\" and is no longer metallic iron. Could it be that the iron rod was not a rod but a tube having a single hole or even capillary holes that are now obliterated by the oxida\u00ad tion of the iron? If such were the case, the Baghdad artifact becomes something from the occult\u2014a \"spirit\" lamp (alcohol or petroleum spirits, of course). I have in my possession a sketch of an alcohol burner. An iron tube could replace the brass tube, an asphalt plug could replace the cork plug, and the cap layer (relic) of the Baghdad artifact resembles the glass cap of the alcohol burner, which serves to snuff the flame and prevent evaporation of the alcohol. My supposition would require the ancients to have discov\u00ad ered how to concentrate or refine fermenta\u00ad tion liquors or petroleum liquids to make volatile, burnable fuels, however. Would a porous or capillary rod of iron or even iron oxide work as a wick? I don't know. Food for thought, or experiment, however. Hadley Wellborn Powder Springs, Ga. Gerhard Eggert replies: The 'Battery of Bagdad' is really fasdnating. Who could resist to speculate about its use? But I know of no evidence for the existence of alco\u00ad hol or petroleum spirits or of iron rods with a thin hole or capillaries at the time in Mesopotamia. The just took plant oil and a textile wick for their lamps. Ficchiy Together a Mystery In \"Exhausting the Mundanely Possible\" (SI, May/June 1996), Ralph Estling wrote about a \"paranormal\" experience he had with an envelope that transported itself through time. His point was that such odd occurrences can rectify themselves with a lit\u00ad tle thought. I'd like to mention my own recent fall into the \"supernatural.\" If was night and I was alone in the house. The video I was watching had ended, so I shut off the TV and hit the rewind button. As I was getting ready to go to sleep, I began hearing a strange noise from downstairs. (Home alone, remember!) Cautiously I tiptoed down to the kitchen, when- 1 found the water flowing in the sink. The water was whooshing from the faucet, and plink- plinking into the suck of dishes left behind from dinner. Ghosts had turned on the faucet! (Certainly it wasn't /who had turned on the water, for I had not been downstairs in 110 minutes\u2014the length of the movie). A believer would immediately get the willies and reach for the Sightings phone number, but I had rational thought on my side. I thought back to an hour and fifty minutes earlier when a human being (me) had last stepped foot in the kitchen; and I remembered washing out a bowl so 1 could enjoy some ice cream with the movie. Clearly I had left the water running. But that seemed unlike me! I'm usually very attentive! Why hadn't I heard the whoosh and the plink of the water falling in the sink? Looking at the arrangement of dishes. 1 saw that they were \"leveled out.\" When I first left the water running, the water made litdc or no sound. But after a while, a bowl had filled with water, which made it shift to one side of the plate it was resting upon\u2014 and the resulting arrangement of plates was quite different from the original setup. By doing this \"kitchen-sink archaeology,\" I saw clearly that certain Hish tracking: produce noise, while others produce almost no noise at all. 1 couldn't hear the noise from the sink until almost two hours later, not because ghosts had turned on die faucet two hours later, but because it took a while for the noise to form. By then I was upstairs and watching an engrossing movie. I think it's quite fun and wonderful and exciting to be able to use scientific thought to piece together a mystery. I don't under- aiiiiu why some people would rather live in a creepy, scary world of ghosts and buga\u00ad boos when they can instead live in the sane, predictable\u2014and thrilling and mysteri\u00ad ous\u2014world of science. Dennis Fiery Princeton, N.J. Sagan's Does Truth Matter?' The article by Carl Sagan \"Does Truth Matter?\" (SI, March/April 1996) was very instructive not only for Russian skeptics, but. I think, for the whole skeptical com\u00ad munity. It is not necessary for me to say how much Russian intellectuals appreciate Sagan as a thinkei, scientist, and writer. But, as a Russian, I was especially touched by the pan of his article relevant to my country. \"Under the tsars,\" writes Sagan, \"religious superstition was encour\u00ad aged, but scientific and skeptical think- SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September/October 1996 63 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ing\u2014except by a few famous scientists\u2014 was ruthlessly expunged.\" [Sagan's word was tame, not famous\u2014ED.] The first half of this affirmation is true, but die second not. I must say in connection with this that, personally, I am an ardent enemy of monar\u00ad chy in general and Russian monarchy espe\u00ad cially. But excepting the reign of Nicolas I (1825-1855), the critical and skeptical thinking in Russian science and humanities during die nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries was not ruthlessly expunged. Even under Nicolas I, the works of our greatest poet and thinker, Pushkin, were not suppressed, but were inspired by a profound free thought. The reign of Alexander II (1855-1881) was especially rich in independent, criti\u00ad cally minded writers. The philosophers and literary critics Chernishevski, Dobrolinbov, Pisarev (a most radical freethinker) were favorites of the Russian public at large\u2014 not only at Petersburg and Moscow, but in the oudying provinces also. The works of such eminent (but not privilegedly famed) scientists as Sechenov (neurophysiologist), Vassie; Struve (astronomer, Lebedev (physicist), Daniel Khvolson, senior (Hebraist and historian of antique Judaism) are examples of the salutary intellectual atmosphere of that epoch. Characteristically, when academician Butlerov became an enthusiastic follower of medium Hume and participant in his spir\u00ad itualist seances, a special investigating com\u00ad mission was formed in the Petersburg University, headed by Mendeleev himself. Hume and Butlerov were exposed and blamed as mystifiers and deceivers. It is interesting to note that this positive intellectual atmosphere in Russia in the late nineteenth century was colorfully described in the contemporary American literature, namely in the autobiographical book by the famous concert pianist Samuel Chorzinoff (A Lost Paradise, Aero Press, New York, 1975). The Chorzinoff family left tsarist Russia and settled in die United States in the end of the century. Reading this remarkable book, we meet the great figure of Chernisheoski and his famous novel What Must be Done?\u2014a manifesto of free thought addressed to the younger genera\u00ad tion of the epoch. Concerning rhe communist era, I must give some commentary to Mr. Sagan's affir\u00ad mation that . was pun\u00ad ished This is absolutely true only for the sci\u00ad entists engaged in Soviet military nuclear and rocket works. Of course we know rhe tragedy of Soviet biology. We know also the troubles experienced by such great scientists as Kapitsa and Landau. But in general the Soviet era in the physico-technical domain was fruitful, and this is unanimously recog\u00ad nized by the world community. The works of Semenov (Nobelist in chemistry), of Tamm, Frank, and Cerenkov (Nobelists in physics), of Freed man, Seldovich, and Linde (cosmology), of Nicolas Vavilov and Koltzov (genetics, before the Lysenko affair), of Tsiolokovsky (father of space flight)\u2014all this testifies to the powerful dan of Russian science during the post-rev\u00ad olution era. This part of the article in question tells us, alas, that even for such great American thinkers as Sagan, the history of Russian culture remains terra incognita. What a pity for all us Russians! Vladimir Lvov Science Writer St. Petersburg, Russia Sagan Responds to Letters I'm very pleased that my recent book. The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in die Dark, briefly excerpted in the March/April 19% issue of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, elicited so many thoughtful letters (July/August 1996). Here is an abbreviated response to some of them: R H. Davis worries that a non-supersti\u00ad tious use of the word \"spirituality\" could be confused with an endorsement of mysticism. This is readily prevented by a single cautionary sentence, and the benefit I think far outweighs the cost. Gary McGath argues that some meta\u00ad physics must underlie all of science\u2014at least the idea that there exists a consistent external reality I entirely agree, but the acceptance of such a reality comes from the fact that science works. My concern about metaphysics is not just what McGath describes as \"the bizarre metaphysical theories philosophers have pro\u00ad posed \" but the fact that there is no way to adjudicate between conflicting metaphysical views except by science. Brian Templeton admonishes me for criti\u00ad cizing easy pseudoscientific targets and avoid\u00ad ing more difficult Judeo-Christian targets. The excerpts from The Demon-Haunted World printed in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER were chosen by the editor. If Mr. Templeton will look at the full book, I think he will find at least a little of what he's looking for. Thomas Munden says I have \"left no doubt\" about my \"belief\" in extraterrestrial life. Let me state clearly, as I have done repeatedly that there is no compelling evi\u00ad dence for extraterrestrial life, and therefore it would be absurd for me to \"believe\" in it. Belief in the absence of compelling evidence is called faith. Belief after acquiring compelling evidence is called knowledge. The two are quite distinct. What I have argued is that the search for extraterrestrial life is an issue of such surpassing importance, both scientifi\u00ad cally and philosophically that it is worth a sizeable effort to try and find it, and that the idea is not so implausible as to be rejected out of hand. Finally as to Vladimir Lvov's thoughtful letter [received later and published in this issue\u2014ED.]: Of course there was a brilliant intelligentsia in nineteenth-century Russia and world-class science and technology in the Soviet era. And of course there was ruthless suppression in both regimes of those few polit\u00ad ical activists who called for the overthrow, and especially the violent overthrow, of the regime. But I was writing about something different\u2014the absence of widely available direct and non-allusive criticism of doctrines with which the regime has identified; for example, dialectical materialism and the reli\u00ad gion of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet era, or the divine right of kings and the sanctity of the Russian Orthodox Church under the Tsars. My limited knowledge of nineteenth- century Russian literature and the 1839 memoirs of the French traveler the Marquis de Custine may have led me astray but I know of no Russian equivalents of Mark Twain's or H. L Mencken's religious writings. Nor do I know of any publication like McKay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, or Martin Gardner's Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. As I mentioned in The Demon- Haunted World, Russia today is awash in pseudoscience and mysticism, as well as a resurgence in superstition and religious mysti\u00ad cism. It remains to be seen how this situation will work itself out. 64 September/October 1996 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Web Is Even Weirder The article \"The Weird World Web\" (SI, May/June 1996) only barely scratched the surface of bizarre web sites on the Internet. The information superhighway is littered with misinformation trash and detritus, cast upon the byteway by zealots of a hundred different sorts. . .. Rev. David Michael Rice Dana Point, Calif. Egging Things On Regarding Martin Gardner's column \"The Great Egg-Balancing Mystery\" (SI. May/ June 1996)\u2014a wonderful article, clearly deserving a standing ovation. (Sorry, couldn't help myself!) Joseph Mockus Columbus, Ohio The ManiC nf An&igrSKIS In May/June's News and Comment column you reproduced Scott Kim's \"Inversion\" of Martin Gardner's name. Readers interested in studying this an form, also known as \"ambigrams,\" further should look for a copy of John Langdon's book Wordplay, from Harcourt-Brace. For skeptics, the art form itself is a fascinating application of the mind's proclivity for finding disregarding infor\u00ad mation it considers extraneous. It's almost magic. W. L Orlicki Hemet, Calif. Johnson and Articles on Evolution Tom Morrow (Letters, May/June 1996, p. 63) challenges my statement that Phillip Johnson had not read articles on evolution present in publications. Morrow says diat I overlooked the Research Notes at the end of Johnson's book diat he had read such arti\u00ad cles. Morrow cites die fact that Johnson had read \"an article by Kenneth R. Millet in the February/March 1994 Technology Review (\"Life's Grand Design\").\" Miller's article is questionable, as Morrow notes; therefore it is not a good example of an article on evo\u00ad lution. However, Morrow quotes Johnson as saying that his \"very capable associates\" have investigated all such examples. This is fascinating. Who are Johnson's \"very capa\u00ad ble associates\"? Law students widi a passion for anonymity? In my review I was referring to more reputable articles on evolution such as, per\u00ad haps, \"Concerted Evolution in Protists: Recent Homogenization of Gene in Trichomonas Vaginalis,\" by R J. Keeling and W F. Doolitde (Journal of Molecular Evolution 41:556-562, 1995). Johnson's Research Notes show that he lias read widely, but in fields of minor con\u00ad troversies rather dian in die substantive liter\u00ad ature of evolution, which he does not tackle. Thomas H. Jukes Berkeley, Calif. More on vampire Lore Paul Barber was, of course, correct when he wrote (SI, March/April 1996) that we can never know for sure about die origins of vampire folklore. After all, it's not even reli\u00ad able asking the very person who has an orig\u00ad inal idea how it came about. However, we can speculate, and it occurs to me that vampire folklore about \"cantan\u00ad kerous peasants who came back as spirits to torment their nearest and dearest\" could be seen as a development of \"sightings\" of deceased relatives. From a belief in these spirits as entities \"out there,\" it might seem to be a logical solution to re-open the grave of one such denam-d ro rri^ke ;urc the phys\u00ad ical body was dead. This dien gave rise to the genuine observation of the vampiric phenomena in the corpse and the plot was complete. Even today, sightings or \"ghosts\" are rou\u00ad tinely explained as \"restless spirits\" who need to be laid to rest, although today there is a more charitable attitude towards the departed souls, and there are solutions which do not require exhumation and a stake through the dead body. However, both are extraordinary ways of rationalizing extraordinarily unsettling experiences, and are examples of the way in which die attribution of a cause \"out dicre\" is so often seen as a more acceptable expla\u00ad nation dian die possibility that one's own brain is playing nasty tricks, even when it requires an acknowledgement of occult and paranormal forces. Brian Martin Waterlooville, Hants. U.K. Medicine Considering Therapeutic Touch The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), die governmental agency diat dis\u00ad tributes Medicare payments, is currently monitoring four Community Nursing Organization (CNO) demonstration pro\u00ad jects. These capitated home care projects are focusing on nurse-driven case management of health care in patients' homes. These dirce-year projects are to end in December 1996, but Congress may vote to extend them. Eli Research recently cited Ruth Mitchell of Visiting Nurse Service of New York, one of the CNOs: \"[She] reports that her organization is using complementary therapies such as therapeutic touch, visual\u00ad ization, self-massage ... to address an older population with chronic care problems.\" She admonishes care providers to avoid \". . . 'cookie-cutter home health' by making a complete of environ\u00ad mental, psychosocial, and behavioral fac\u00ad tors, just of condition Bullough Bullough reported in \"Therapeutic Touch: Why Do Nurses Believe?\" (SI, Winter 1993) that our gov\u00ad ernment spent $200,000 for therapeutic- touch training for nurses. If HCFA ulti\u00ad mately authorizes reimbursement to nurses for such pseudoscientific practices as thera\u00ad peutic touch and self-massage instruction, that $200,000 grant will become utterly insignificant. More to die point, such reim\u00ad bursement would needlessly exacerbate the already dire financial condition of Medicare. Robert R. Weilacher Palestine, Texas (See also our Special Report, \"Science or Pseudoscience' Pentagon Grant Funds Alternative Health Study,\" SI, July/August 1996\u2014ED.)

Box 703, Amherst, NY 14226 (716) 636-1425 The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal encourages the critical investigation of paranormal and fringe-science claims from a responsible, scientific point of view and disseminates factual information about the results of such inquiries to the scientific community and the public. It also promotes science and scientific inquiry, critical thinking, science education, and the use of reason in examining important issues. To carry out these objectives the Committee: Maintains a network of people interested in critically examining paranormal, fringe-science, and other claims, and in contributing to consumer education Prepares bibliographies of published materials that carefully examine such claims Encourages research by objective and impartial inquiry in areas where it is needed Convenes conferences and meetings Publishes articles that examine claims of the paranormal Does not reject claims on a priori grounds, antecedent to inquiry, but examines them objectively and carefully The Committee is a nonprofit scientific and educational organization.
