This 5,000-year-old, holistic medical system has improved the lives of billions of people, and welcome the chance to share our dedication and expertise with you. As practitioners of TCM we use its time-proven, effective and drug-free methods to support your body's natural healing process. This system of health care uses multiple modalities, such as acupuncture, Tuina Massage, cupping, moxibustion, and herbal therapy. Symptoms, as well as primary causes of your illness, are treated. In addition to symptomatic relief, you will feel an increase in vitality and an overall state of well-being from your treatments Our Health Care Philosophy We believe that acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be integral to anyone's health and wellness. There are many different ways to treat the body, and we want to help our clients find their unique formula to achieve well-being. We recognize that most people in the U.S. utilize Western Medicine, and believe that TCM is a fruitful way to integrate natural holistic health care into your current medical regimens. We take an all-encompassing approach to wellness and treatment. We have found incorporating TCM with other modalities of medicine is, by and large, very successful. In fact, TCM is often combined with Western Medicine in China to give an individualized holistic treatment. If you are looking for a practitioner who believes their style of medicine is the only way to receive the best healthcare, our services might not be the best fit. However, if you want to add comprehensive tools to your healthcare toolbox, you have clicked on the right page. This clinic will never ask you to choose between what you are doing now and the treatments we offer. Integrating Eastern and Western Medicine Our health care approach is always holistic. This means we always provide options to our clients that could enhance their current treatments. Most of our patients come to us with pain and discomfort, at their wit's end. Where else can they turn? So here they are, giving this weird needle thing a try. For some, acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine may be a fantastic alternative to western drugs; for others, it may increase the effectiveness of the drugs they are already taking. We have witnessed many patients experiencing decreased pain, which helps lessen the use of pain killers or muscle relaxers. Many patients suffering from migraines 2-4 times a week, forcing them to take Imitrex or numerous doses of Excedrin Migraine, will find that their migraines occur less frequently; and may now require an Advil only a few times a year. By incorporating Eastern techniques, patients may take fewer drugs as a result of their bodies using Western Medicine more effectively. How does acupuncture work? Think of the human body, your body, as a small ecosystem. We have blood flowing in our veins, electrical impulses running in our nerves, hormones traveling in our bodies, and interstitial fluid flowing through us. Acupuncture uses \"channels and meridians\" as descriptors for our body's super highways. Qi & blood are the forces that move in those super highways. The earth is a large ecosystem. We know that the weather in Hawaii will affect our climate on the Oregon coast, Portland, and even Colorado. Although it seems far-fetched, we know this is true of our weather patterns. Acupuncture works in a similar way by manipulating the body's ebb and flow through carefully selected points. So a needle, acupressure, moxa, or Tuina massage may be used to disperse stagnation in your low back, while another point might be used in your hand or foot to draw the excess stuck energy away from your low back. It can be much more complicated than this, but you get the idea. Acupuncture is a safe, painless alternative for treating: - Arthritis, fibromyalgia, back pain, and carpal tunnel - Sports injury - Allergies, asthma, and other respiratory problems - Gastrointestinal issues - Gynecological problems like infertility and PMS - Depression, and anxiety - Insomnia - Stress - And many more physical, emotional, and neurological issues Integrating Eastern and Western Medicine Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a wonderful way to integrate natural holistic health care into your current medical regimen. Most of us use Western Medicine in the United States. I believe there are many different ways to treat the body, some work better for certain people than others.
