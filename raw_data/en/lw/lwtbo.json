Various attempts have been made to explain the subjective human response to [homeopathy](/pages/homeopathy-for-patients); however, there is no consensus. Avogadro's number occurs around 12CH. After 12CH, the probability of there being a single remaining molecule of the parent compound becomes increasingly slight. To the homeopathic principle of efficacy, this does not matter. This is highly suggestive of a placebo effect because one cannot rely upon molecular dose to explain any effect near, at, or above this potency. Several hypotheses circulate to explain the effect of homeopathy despite these facts. There is no consensus amongst homeopaths or scientists. Best possible physical-analytical techniques cannot distinguish high potency homeopathics from placebo preparations and only processing appears to differ. Homeopathy was developed in a prescientific time, from crude observations around toxicology; however, homeopathy remains today as a very popular traditional system of medicine. Homeopathy provides millions of people with comfort, and products licensed for sale in Canada pose no obvious safety concerns when used appropriately. The value of homeopathy in a given treatment is largely subjective. If it makes one feel better, there is no harm in its use. Homeopathy cannot provide the level of protection afforded by [vaccination](/pages/vaccinations). Truly, this is a scientific fact that persists beyond opinion or belief. Do not attempt to vaccinate with homeopathy. Do not treat an active infection without first seeing a physician. We will not recommend homeopathy alone for purposes of preventing infectious disease, and strongly advise against the un-accompanied use of homeopathy for purposes of vaccination. As an add-on to vaccination or anti-infective treatments, we can facilitate suggestions based on traditional homeopathic texts; however, no compelling evidence exists to suggest any homeopathic product makes a significant impact on the immune system. We take this stance to protect individuals from harm that can arise from misunderstanding the role of homeopathy in Canadian healthcare. Infectious diseases are transmissible; therefore, they demand best possible practises. Important Message from our Pharmacist: If your condition is serious, whether chronic or acute, or if your condition is undiagnosed - please see a licensed medical physician before attempting to self-treat with homeopathy (or any other treatment). Do not attempt to diagnose yourself, even if you are medically trained and adequately equipped to do so. Modern, conventional, evidence-based medical practise is an indispensable tool that should be a key part of everyone's approach to health and treatment. Disregarding medical advise issued by a physician or pharmacist is not recommended. If you are uncertain about a physician or a pharmacists advice, seek a second opinion from a colleague or specialist who has experience with the condition or symptoms you experience. It can be dangerous to avoid the medical treatment of some conditions. Homeopathy is suitable as an add-on therapy, or when other treatments are not accessible. Homeopathy is generally suitable for mild to moderate self-limiting conditions, or for obscure issues that are troublesome, but do not immediately threaten your health and wellbeing. Homeopathy is safe when it is used with these facts in mind. Side effects are likely equivalent to placebo. There is a critical lack of statistically valid study to define product specific efficacy. All studies I've read with regard to homeopathy, and homeopathic products have been critically flawed in method, size, and power. This is common to all scientific disciplines, but is not acceptable in medical science. Collaborate, and leverage the strengths of those on your team! Multidisciplinary approaches are often more effective than single discipline approaches, and lead to better patient satisfaction. Respectfully yours, Andrew Formosa, "}
