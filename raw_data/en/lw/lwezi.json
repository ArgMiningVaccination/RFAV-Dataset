It is an edited version of previous protocols that have been used to apply for funding and to facilitate the study group's internal discussions about the study design and practical arrangements. We had considered submitting the protocol to a scientific journal for publication. However, at the time of finalizing the manuscript, the data collection was already completed and the first results had been reported in scientific journals. On this basis journal editors advised against publication. However, we believe that the design of a study that evaluates the personalized outcomes of an individualized intervention will have wider interests, and we have therefore chosen to bring the protocol into a form that may be useful for other researchers who endeavor similar type of studies. Consequently, we have chosen to make the protocol available through the home page of CCESCAM. The authors September 2014 3 Abstract Background: A growing number of cancer patients use various forms of complementary and/or alternative medicine (CAM) during and after cancer treatment. While some forms of CAM are relatively well-researched, the outcomes of other types such as \"energy healing\", where treatment is usually individualized and the outcomes personalized to address the needs of the patient, are generally poorly documented. The aim of the present cross-disciplinary study was to evaluate the personalized outcomes of individualized energy healing for patients who have completed treatment for colon cancer. Methods/Design: The study was designed as a clinical trial with randomization to a self-select and a randomization arm. Patients randomized to the self-select arm were free to choose either the healing or control group while patients in the randomization arm were randomized to either the healing or control group. Patients in the four groups completed self-reported questionnaires at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks. Patients in the healing groups also completed questionnaires before the first and after the third healing session. Additional data were collected through patient diaries of physical activity and qualitative interviews. Discussion: The present study is an example of a cross-disciplinary collaboration to assess personalized outcomes of energy healing as an individualized intervention. Based in the data collected through the study it is possible to produce empirical evidence to assess the outcomes of energy healing and may inform future research designs of personalized outcomes of individualized interventions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01434264)4 Background Energy healing is among the most commonly used forms of complementary and alternative medicine among cancer patients [1]. The term 'energy healing' refers to a wide variety of therapies which are based on the premise that the healer transfers energy to the patient [2]. Among the most researched forms of energy healing are reiki, therapeutic touch, and healing touch. In a recent systematic review of studies on the effects of energy healing for cancer and cancer-related symptoms, it was concluded that none of the included studies were designed with a sample size or data quality that allows reliable conclusions on effectiveness to be drawn [2]. It was recommended that future studies should adhere to current standards of research on efficacy and effectiveness of a treatment i.e. the extend that the intervention is truly producing the effect in controlled circumstances (efficacy) and the extend that the effect can be observed in 'real-world' circumstances (effectiveness). Given the complex character of potential effects, applications of cross-disciplinary methodologies may be relevant. Qualitative studies on energy healing suggest that such interventions are often individualized to the individual person and that the targeted outcomes are personalized in relation to the issues at stake for this individual [3, 4]. Assessment of outcomes of energy healing thus requires a research design that facilitates the analysis of personalized outcomes of individualized treatments, and at the same time adheres to standard requirements of high internal and external validity, i.e. the extent to which the observed effect of intervention truly relates to the intervention (internal validity) and the extent to which the observed effect can be generalized to other people (external validity). The aim of the present study was to test the effectiveness of energy healing as an individualized rehabilitative intervention to improve personalized outcomes among individuals who had completed a conventional treatment for colorectal cancer with curative intent. The study design took into consideration that the intervention was individualized to each individual patient and allowed them to identify what they considered to be the most important outcomes. Furthermore, in addition to assessing personalized outcomes, the study also evaluated outcomes based on standardized, self-reported health outcome measures, and included the collection of qualitative research data from a sub-sample of participants. 5 Methods Study design This study was designed as a pragmatic clinical trial [5] of individualized interventions with personalized outcomes. First, the design allowed healers to customize the intervention (energy healing) individually to each participant and to undertake treatment-related communication similar to their usual practice. Second, participants were allowed to identify what they considered to be their primary outcomes through the completion of the \"Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing\" (MYCaW) questionnaire [6], a check list of nine potentially important outcome aspects, and semi-structured interviews in conjunction with validated, standard measures. Third, to explore the effect of patients self-selecting, participants were randomized to a self-selection arm or a randomization arm, each arm with similar intervention and control groups. Finally, the study design included assessment of a number of possible effect moderators, e.g. socio-demographics (gender, age, spiritual habits), previous experience with complementary and alternative treatment, and expected efficacy, and mediators, e.g. healer-patient relation. Taken together, the study aimed to maximize external validity by using a design that incorporates important features of energy healing administered in real-life settings by: 1a) allowing participants self-selection to healing and non-healing control, 1b) assessing individual participant-selected treatment goals, 1c) allowing the treatment to be performed in the private clinics of the healers. To maximize internal validity similar to that obtained in a randomized, clinical trial design, the study: 2a) randomized participants to self-selection and randomized groups of intervention and control; and 2b) supplemented the assessment of personalized treatment goals with assessment of outcomes with standardized measures. Participants Based on a search of records from the Danish National Patient Registry [7], a total of 783 persons were considered eligible to participate in the study. Eligibility criteria included: 1) primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer (defined as C18-C20 according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10)); 2) completed treatment with surgery, or surgery and chemotherapy, or radiotherapy in the Southern or Central Region of Denmark between 1 March 2010 and 31 July 2011, and no current cancer; and 3) aged 80 years. Patients were excluded if they: 1) were unable to comply with the data collection protocol; 2) had poor understanding of 6 the Danish language; or 3) received palliative care or had a recurrence of cancer prior to inclusion. Using a centralized, computerized procedure, Minim (Minimization Program for Allocating Patients to Treatments in Clinical Trials [8, 9]), eligible participants were randomly stratified according to gender into a self-selection arm or a randomization arm prior to initial contact. Eligible participants were mailed a package containing: written information about the study; a leaflet containing information about the healers in the study; an informed consent form; a pre-paid return envelope; and the first part of a questionnaire package. If willing to participate, participants were instructed to complete the informed consent form (with an indication of two preferred healers) and the enclosed questionnaire package, and to return it in the pre-paid envelope. Three to seven days after mailing the invitation, a research assistant made a semi-structured telephone call in order to answer any possible questions concerning the study, and to ask for possible reasons if the person was unwilling to participate. If an eligible participant had not returned the questionnaire within 2-4 weeks, an additional reminder call was made. Hereafter no-response was considered non-participation. Following the research team's receipt of the completed informed consent and the first questionnaire package the participants in the randomized arm were further randomized to healing intervention (RH) or control (RC) groups, and the self-selection arm chose self-selected healing (SH) or self-selected control (SC). This resulted in a four-arm design (see Figure 1). A total of 247 individuals participated in the study (participation rate 31.5% of the initially identified population; men n=115, 46.6%; women n=132, 53.4%). Of these, 82 participants (33.2% of the 247 participants) chose to be in SH, 52 participants (21.1%) chose SC, 58 participants (23.5%) were randomized to RH, and further 55 participants (22.3%) randomized to RC (see Figure 1). Intervention The intervention, energy healing, took place in the clinic of the healer. The energy healing provided was not restricted to a particular form of energy healing except that it should be based on a general concept where the healer provided some kind of energy to the participant by their hands. Usual conversation between the healer and patients was encouraged, but no other form of therapy could be provided. For each participant, the intervention consisted of four sessions of energy healing over a period of two months planned according to agreements between the participant and the healer. 7 Participating healers The participating healers were recruited through \"Healer-Ringen\" the national association of healers who practice energy healing (www.healerringen.dk). Healer-Ringen provided a list of suitable healers i.e. healers that have an educational background fulfilling the requirement for formal registration as providers of alternative and complementary therapy in Denmark (Registreringsordning for Alternative Behandlere1). They had to have facilities that served solely as the clinics for the healing practice. The identification of suitable healers should also provide a network of healers across the regions of Central and Southern Denmark in order to reduce the transport time for patients. A total of 31 healers agreed to be included in the list. Participants selected their preferred healers on the basis of a catalogue in which the healers had provided a brief presentation of themselves. Assessment The data were collected through self-report questionnaires, diaries of physical activity, semi-structured interviews, and relevant registries. Questionnaire data were collected from participants at study inclusion, before the start of the healing sessions (baseline), after the third healing session (approx. 6 weeks after baseline), and 8 and 16 weeks after baseline. The data collection time schedule and included measures are shown in Table 1. Background data Background data for the participants included cancer diagnoses, co-morbidity, conventional cancer treatments completed (surgery, chemo-therapy, etc.), date of completion of the conventional treatment, and date of the last control visit obtained from the national patient registry. Outcome measures Personal treatment goals After inclusion in the study and prior to the first energy healing session, participants completed the MYCaW questionnaire, in which they in their own words stated two illness-related concerns that they hoped to be relieved from, and to score the severity of the two concerns on visual 1 http://sundhedsstyrelsen.dk/da/uddannelse-autorisation/autorisation/registreringsordning-for-alternative-behandlere 8 analogue scales (10 cm VAS-scales). In addition, they were asked to prioritize one area of concern from a list of items representing areas covered by validated standard questionnaires included in the main questionnaire package. Late complications Presence and severity of late complications was assessed by a symptom check-list that covers the 18 most frequently reported symptoms associated with cancer adapted from the FOCARE study with 2379 Danish cancer survivors [10, 11]. Participants with one or more symptoms were asked to rate the severity of the symptoms on a four-point scale. Physical activity Changes in physical activity was measured according to the participants' self-reported physical health (questions adapted from the SF36 Health Survey) [12] and Physical activity level (Physical Activity Scale PAS1) [13]. To acquire further information on measurable effects on daily physical performance, an open diary was used for reporting the date, time, and physical activity involved in. The aim of the activity diary was to provide a more nuanced picture of participants' activities over the day/days, and allowed for comparing results with data obtained from PAS1. Health-Related Quality-of-Life Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the Danish version of FACIT-Sp [14]. This scale is widely used within biomedical and health psychology research thus allowing for international comparisons to be made. To enable cost-utility analysis, the 5-item EQ-5D, a five-dimensional instrument for measurement of health related quality of life was used in the recognized and validated Danish version [15]. This instrument encompasses 3125 health states which can be assigned a health state utility index based on a valuation algorithm derived from a large Danish validation study [16] and the recommended mapping technique between the three and five level EQ-5D instrument. Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), which is commonly used in studies regarding cancer patients both internationally and in Denmark [17, 18]. Mood (POMS) 9 The level of positive and negative emotions was assessed using an adapted version of the Profile of Moods States (POMS) [19] combined with a scale of non-active positive emotions (Passive Positive Emotions Scale - PPES) previously used in a study of Expressive Writing Intervention with cancer patients [20]. Sleep quality Sleep quality was included as a possible mediator of any effects of healing and measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [21], which has previously been used in studies of Danish patients [22]. Use of conventional health care and public service Participants were asked to report their use of general and specialized medical services, hospital services, municipal social and health service and conventional and alternative medicine within the last four weeks. Resource use and costs related to the intervention The cost of interventions was determined by assessing duration of individual healing sessions and counting the number of actually provided healing sessions. The number of sessions was obtained from the financial records of reimbursement of healers and validated by questionnaires completed by participants. Participants' use of time to sessions and associated transport cost as well as their use of municipal health care services was collected by questionnaires. Experience during treatment and the following days In order to obtain information on general patterns regarding experiences during and after treatment, all participants in the intervention groups were invited to write in their own words what they had experienced during the third treatment and in the days following. These data supplemented the data generated by semi-structured interviews and participant-observation. Subjective experiences of effect Participants' subjective experiences of the healer, the treatment and possible changes in health status were explored through semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Moderators Socio-demographics 10 Socio-demographic data from the registry included year of birth, gender and municipal of residence were available together with participants' self-declared civil status, family structure, schooling and vocational training, labor market attachment/(early) retirement, personal and house hold income. Previous use of CAM Based on a questionnaire developed for a European survey on CAM use among cancer patients [1], a new Danish version was developed and validated. The questionnaire covered previous use of CAM, reasons for CAM use and no use, experienced benefits, disclosure and side effects. Attitude to CAM One question regarding the attitude towards complementary and alternative medicine was included. Expectations and wishes for symptom relief Expectations or wishes for symptom relief/problem solving were included as they have been found to predict placebo effects and were measured using a Visual Analogue Scales (10 cm VAS) [23-25]. Illness perception Illness perception, including degree of worry, experienced control, and degree of influence on life, was measured using an adapted version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) [26]. Absorption Absorption is a personality trait related to openness to experience and unusual thoughts and imaginations. It has previously been shown to be related to the use of CAM, and was measured using a validated Danish version of the Tellegen Absorption Questionnaire (TAS) [27, 28]. Faith and meaning Faith conviction has previously been related to CAM use. Faith in God, faith in a spiritual power and the experienced influence of that faith on quality of life and cancer itself was measured using items comparable to those of previous studies [29]. The experienced meaning with life, cancer and the experienced contribution of healing hereto was further registered. 11 Mediators Healer-participant relation (WAI) The quality of the healer-patient relation was measured using a healer and patient version respectively of the short version of the Working Alliance Inventory [30]. The short version appears to make good predictions of the effect of psychotherapy and consists of 12 questions measuring three dimensions: 1) consensus of treatment purpose, 2) consensus regarding treatment tasks, and 3) emotional bond between the parties [31, 32]. Disposition, experience of the sacred and elaboration of alternatives Central in the qualitative interviews were an exploration of the disposition towards the treatment, experiences of the sacred/extra ordinary, and the healer's elaboration of alternatives, all considered to be mediators of subjectively experienced effects. Pilot study The main aspects of the study design, including recruitment procedures, intervention, and quantitative and qualitative assessments were tested in a pilot study of 38 participants with various cancers recruited from the departments of oncology at Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) and Odense University Hospital (OUH). The final study procedures, measures, response rates, drop-out rates, and expected outcomes were adjusted on the basis of results from the pilot study. 12 Procedures Data Collection Procedure Persons who agreed to participate were asked to complete an informed consent form declaring their acceptance with participating in the study. At the same time they completed a questionnaire with baseline information. Those selected for interviews (a mix of participants with different characteristics) were subsequently contacted before their first session with a healer. Questionnaires Questionnaire packages were administered to all participants at inclusion, after 10 days (baseline), 8 weeks and 16 weeks after inclusion. Additionally, participants in the two intervention groups completed questionnaire packages immediately before and after their third healing session. Measures included in the individual questionnaires described above and shown in Table 1. Diaries A sub-sample of 65 participants representing all four study groups completed a diary asking them to describe their physical activities (from sleep to strenuous activity) and time spent on these activities (minutes and hours). The participants completed the activity diaries for seven days around baseline, seven days around week 8, and seven days around week 16. Qualitative semi-structured interviews Four qualitative semi-structured interviews lasting on average one hour were conducted with 32 participants selected strategically to cover a range of ages, occupations, living conditions and prior experience with complementary and alternative medicine. The first and last interviews were conducted in the participants' homes, and the second and third interviews were carried out through telephone or Skype. One participant dropped out after the first interview, reducing the interview sample to 31 participants Healing procedure The energy healing took place in the clinic of the healer. The energy healing provided was not restricted in respect to form of energy healing, provided that it was based on a general idea that the healer provided some kind of energy to the participant by the hands. Conversation as usual was accepted, but no other form of therapy could be provided. For each participant, the 13 intervention consisted of four sessions of energy healing over a period of two months, distributed as decided by each participant-healer pair. The healers contacted the participants who had been assigned to receive energy healing within two days to agree on a time for the first healing session. The healers were asked to complete a questionnaire on their personal data and qualitative interviews were conducted with a strategic sample of 18 of the participating healers in order to obtain information of their methods of healing. Follow-up procedure Participants were reminded by telephone of any missing questionnaires two weeks after the questionnaire was sent. Participants who wished to discontinue their participation were asked for their reasons, and the reasons were registered in a drop-out database. After two consecutive reminder calls and no response, the participant was considered a drop-out. Data management procedure Questionnaire data were recorded and maintained in an encrypted database. Information on names and addresses of participants were kept in a separate database. All interview transcripts were kept in password protected files separately from names and addresses. Data analysis The quantitative data were prepared for statistical analysis, and the qualitative data according to the analytical method. Statistical analysis The personal preferences for outcomes, as stated in the MYCaW questionnaire and on the list of preference areas for outcomes provided right after inclusion, constituted the primary outcomes for all participants in intervention and control groups. Primary personalized outcome effects were evaluated according to prestated hypothesis using linear mixed models (p=0.05). Secondary outcome effects was evaluated according to prestated hypotheses using linear mixed models with a corrected level of significance (p=0.05/number of outcomes + 1). Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 19 and STATA version 13. 14 Statistical power and sample size A statistical power analysis showed that with the expected sample size of 200 individuals, it would be possible to detect a score change on the primary outcome scale (MyCaw) with a significance level of five percent and a power level of eighty percent. This was based on modeling of the longitudinal data exploiting that the responses from individuals were correlated over time, i.e, within individual dependency [33]. The estimated variance and within individual correlation over time was based on the pilot-study (with a single follow-up). Analysis of the qualitative data The qualitative data material consisted of questionnaire data on experience of the treatment during treatment and the following days, transcripts of interviews and notes from the interview situation. Data were coded in correspondence with a theory on cultural phenomenology in order to identify participants' subjective experience of therapeutic processes and outcomes encompassing: 1) the participant's disposition for the therapy; 2) the participant's capacity for experiencing the sacred (in a broad sense); 3) alternatives elaborated during the healing sessions; and 4) actualization of change [34]. Secondly, the interview data were coded and analyzed in regard to what concerns participants had and hoped to get relieved from in order to compare these with statements in MYCaW and choices on the priority list. Comparing data across datasets In order to cover the personalized concerns as registered and measured by MyCaW and personal preferences of impact areas, it was necessary to employ a range of different research tools and perspectives. In addition to analysis of quantitative and qualitative datasets on their own, a comparison between participants' subjectively expressed attitudes, expectations and evaluations of their own progress (with or without intervention) compared to the results of statistical processing of questionnaire data. The comparison across datasets informed about the personal processes behind statistical fluctuations, and thus provided an understanding of how the participants themselves conceptualized the change (or lack of change) registered in questionnaires. The complex outcome measurement used in this study made it possible to compare and specify effectiveness within different fields of study, also demanding that methods of evaluation of the 15 individualized treatment was developed both within and across disciplinary fields. Based on these findings specific hypothesis were developed regarding causal relationships, as well as to further the development of a model of cross-disciplinary comparison. Ethics and permissions The study adhered to the ethical requirements of the Helsinki Declaration. The participants received both written and oral information about the study, and were instructed that they were free to withdraw from the study at any time during the study period. The questionnaires were assigned a unique ID code making the individual participant's responses as well as other personal and medical data unidentifiable to anyone but the researchers responsible for the data-base. The ID-key was kept under lock separately from the data files. The study was presented to the regional Committee of Research Ethics in Southern Denmark. They responded that the study should not be formally registered in the national system of Research Ethics. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency, and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01434264) prior to data collection. Predefined hypotheses The cross-disciplinary approach to the effectiveness of energy healing aimed at testing a number of predefined hypotheses related to primary and secondary outcomes as well as to explore anticipated relevant issues (exploratory objectives) related to primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes. Primary outcome and related hypotheses The primary outcome was to investigate whether \"energy healing\" as an individualized form of intervention can improve personal concerns identified by the individual participant in the MYCaW questionnaire. Hypotheses: The effects found will be larger for the primary, personalized, outcomes (MYCaW) than when assessed with standardized measure Patients that self-select energy healing will experience larger effects for primary outcomes than patients randomized to the intervention 16 The primary, personalized outcomes will change more during the course of the treatment in the intervention groups than in the control groups. Secondary outcomes and related hypotheses Secondary outcomes concerned the following independent but related areas: 1) will energy healing have a statistically significant (p < 0.05) effect on secondary outcomes assessed with standardized, validated instruments, including physical health survey, physical activity, cancer-related QoL, depressive symptoms, and mood?; 2) Will energy healing have a positive impact on daily physical performance as subjectively described in dairies?; 3) Will energy healing influence participants' subjective experience of their illness and recovery?; 4) Will energy healing influence participants' self-reported burden of late effect after cancer treatment?; 5) Is energy healing a cost-effective from a societal and health service perspective? Hypotheses: No significant effects of healing on secondary, standardized, outcomes (physical health survey, physical activity, QoL, depressive symptoms, mood) are anticipated No significant effect on levels of daily physical performance as reported in diaries is anticipated Participants that self-select energy healing will report significantly larger effects on secondary outcomes than patients randomized to intervention No significant effect on participants' self-reported burden of late effects is anticipated. No evidence for the healing intervention is cost-effective in comparison with no-healing was anticipated. Further, it was expected that the qualitative analysis will inform whether the energy healing provides participants with images that are embodied in their perception of self, illness and recovery, and whether this is acknowledged by participants as meaningful for them in their particular situation. Objectives and hypotheses related to mediation and moderation of effects A number of factors were anticipated to mediate and moderate the effects of energy healing. 17 Hypotheses: The effect of healing will be larger, if participants o report higher levels of \"absorption\" (i.e. \"openness to experience\") o report higher expectations of benefits o report previous positive experience with CAM o report a positive attitude towards CAM o report prior experience with energy healing o report faith in God or a higher spiritual power o experience a better healer-patient relationship. Those that change their primary selected outcome over the course of treatment will score higher on the questionnaire relating to the healer-patient relationship. Further, it was expected that the qualitative analysis will shed light on: Whether and how the participants subjectively express a change in their perception of self and illness corresponding with the healer's recommendations; Tertiary outcomes Finally, a number of issues were explored relating to the value attributed to the treatment by the participants. This included: How much money are the participants in the intervention groups willing to spend on this kind of therapy How far a distance participants are willing to drive to receive this kind of therapy Further perspectives The comparison of quantitative and qualitative data may point to specific hypothesis regarding working mechanisms that can be tested in future efficacy trials. The experiences gained from this study will inform planned development of guidelines on research designs with high levels of external and internal validity that can be used in the investigation of personalized outcomes of individualized treatments. 18 Competing interests None to declare.
