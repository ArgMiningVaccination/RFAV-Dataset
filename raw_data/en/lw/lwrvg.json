These amazing little berries have been used for centuries due to their immune-boosting properties and ability to reduce upper-respiratory and flu symptoms (1). In this article, I'll explain what makes elderberry such a powerhouse and share two ways to make elderberry gummies: one using dried berries and the other using Dr. Green Mom's [USDA Organic Elderberry Elixir](https://drgreenmom.com/shop/organic-elderberry-syrup-for-kids-adults/). Does Elderberry Support Immunity? I'm asked this question often. There is quite a bit of research on the benefits of elderberries. Here is what we know: Elderberries (Sambucus nigra) can reduce the duration of cold and flu symptoms (2). Additionally, research has shown that elderberries have immune-boosting properties, helping people stay well during cold and flu season (3). Elderberries are packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals (4). They are also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin A, and quercetin (5, 6). Furthermore, elderberries contain prebiotics, which enhance the growth of healthy bacteria and benefit the microbiome (7). The benefit of making homemade gummies with a gelatin base is that you can take advantage of the gut healing properties of gelatin, control the type and amount of sweetener, and adjust the potency and flavor so that it is just right for your family! Elderberry Elixir Gummies For kiddos who may not love the taste of elderberry, this recipe is great because YOU choose which flavor of juice to use as the base. Ingredients: - 10 servings of [Elderberry Elixir](https://drgreenmom.com/shop/organic-elderberry-syrup-for-kids-adults/)(10 tsp) - 1 cup juice of choice (any flavor but pineapple*) - \u00bc cup Grass Fed Gelatin Steps: - In a small saucepan, heat the juice until it's almost simmering. - Reduce the heat to low. - Add the [Elderberry Elixir](https://drgreenmom.com/shop/organic-elderberry-syrup-for-kids-adults/). - Gradually sprinkle the gelatin powder into the saucepan while whisking continuously. - Remove from heat and allow to cool. - Pour the mixture into silicone molds or a shallow dish. Refrigerate until set. - Once firm, pop the gummies out of their mold or if using a dish, slice the gummies into 10 bite size chunks. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Dosage: This elderberry gummy recipe yields approximately 10 single serving gummies. Children under 4 years old can take one per day and children over 4 can take two per day. *Bromelain in pineapple breaks down the proteins in the gelatin, making the gummies liquidy. Homemade Elderberry Gummies (Using Dried Berries) This recipe is more labor intensive, but you also get the medicinal benefits of honey! Ingredients: - 1/2 cup dried elderberries - 1 cup filtered water - 1/4 cup raw honey (no honey for babies under 12 months) or maple syrup - 1/4 cup grass fed gelatin powder Steps: - In a small saucepan, combine dried elderberries and water. Boil and simmer for 20 minutes. - Remove from heat and let cool briefly. - Strain the mixture into a clean bowl, pressing down on the berries to extract liquid. Discard solids. - Measure the liquid and ensure you have 1 cup of elderberry juice. Add water if needed. - Pour the juice back into the saucepan over low heat. - Add raw honey or maple syrup and stir. (This is essentially elderberry syrup.) - Gradually sprinkle gelatin powder into the saucepan while whisking continuously, until the mixture is smooth. - Remove from heat and let cool briefly. - Carefully pour the elderberry mixture into silicone molds or a shallow dish. - Refrigerate for 1-2 hours until set. - Remove gummies from molds or cut into desired shapes. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Dosage: With this recipe, it is harder to determine an exact dosage. I would still cut the gummies into about 10 chunks and give younger kids one a day and older kids and adults two a day. Who Should Avoid Consuming Elderberry Gummies? Elderberry is a safe, commonly-used, and well-studied remedy. However, there are a few precautions to keep in mind. If you are using honey in your recipe, do not give the gummies to babies less than 12 months old due to the risk of botulism. If you're giving homemade gummies to a young child, please be sure to supervise them because the texture can make the gummies a choking hazard.

Elderberry is an herb that has been used for generations as an immune-booster and to reduce the severity and length of upper respiratory illnesses and influenza.
