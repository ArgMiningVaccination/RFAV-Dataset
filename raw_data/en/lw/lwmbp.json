For example, Dr. Avigan created an adendritic cell vaccine that has proven to am-plify the body's immune response to fight myeloma; Dr. Seely used a natural, non-toxic product to improve cancer patient's quality of life; and Dr. Lin's novel method of attacking cancer stem cells to treat late-stage colon cancer has shown very encouraging results. The Gateway is funding exciting and innovative research in traditional and integrative therapies at renowned research centers including UCLA, Sloan-Kettering, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins and MD Anderson, among many others. We are committed to funding research with the potential to produce unique and innovative cancer treatments that move rapidly from the lab to the bedside to help patients who need them, via Phase I and II clinical trials. With our voices rising, we continue to demand change within a broken system that compels us to stand up and fight, so that patients may live longer, feel better or be cured ToDAY . In the pages that follow, we will update you on our efforts to win the war against cancer. We are extremely grateful to the patients who have allowed us to share their courageous stories of hope and life. We are also grateful to you for uniting with us in this cause. We also extend continued and heartfelt thanks to the Cancer Treatment Centers of America for their generous underwriting, so that 99 cents of every dollar received can go directly to research and treatments that can help people noW. For cancer patients and their loved ones, there is no time to waste. Together, we will continue to discover and fund leading edge cancer research that empowers patients, and rewards your continuing support.

I feel so fortunate to have participated in this trial; not just for me, but to possibly help find cures that will save the lives of others.\" \u2014 Michelle Ashby, cancer survivor and mom, stage 4 breast cancerMichelle Ashby is a nurse and mother to two young children. On December 23, 2009, she was diagnosed with a rare and ag-gressive form of inflammatory stage 4 breast cancer. She had no lumps in her breasts, no history of breast cancer in her family and a recent mammogram was normal. The only reason Michelle even visited her primary care physician was because she had experienced unusual weight loss and had some back pain. By the time she was diagnosed, Michelle's cancer had already spread to her pelvis, spine, skull and liver. By Christmas Eve, her pain was so unbearable that she could hardly walk. She was overwhelmed and terrified, imagining this could be the last holiday she would spend with her husband and children. Michelle received her first radiation treatment and course of chemotherapy at Washington University in St. Louis. She was accepted into a breast cancer vaccine trial being funded by The Gateway and led by Dr. William Gillanders and Dr. Timothy Fleming. Timothy Fleming, PhD, was part of a team that first identified mammoglobulin-A as an effective breast cancer marker. This natural protein is expressed at low levels in normal breast tissue, but is dramatical-ly overexpressed in 80% of primary and metastatic breast cancers. Dr. Fleming joined the immunology team at Wash-ington University to develop a vaccine to prime the patient's im-mune system to attack breast cancer with the right self-antigen: mammoglobulin-A. The custom vaccine was constructed from DNA segments that encode mammoglobulin-A in order to trigger T cells to recog-nize the protein as a foreign body on the surface of tumor cells. The vaccine is designed to be especially good at destroying hid-den cells not detected by traditional radiation or chemotherapy. Michelle continued traditional treatments while also receiving three vaccines. She and her family are overjoyed to report she has been cancer-free for just over two years. The results of Dr. Gillanders' study have been extremely promising\u2014he is in the process of preparing for a large-scale clinical trial to attempt to achieve the same results on a larger scale. As a mother of two small children, Tiffany Heigle was devastated to hear she had cancer. At the young age of 33, Tiffany was faced with the challenge of battling stage 4 colon cancer. With no family history of colon cancer and a young family to care for, Tiffany was nervous about the journey ahead. The first step in Tiffany's cancer journey was surgery. She had 10 to 12 inches of her colon removed, as well as numerous lymph nodes that tested positive for can-cer. Under the care of her oncologist, Dr. Brian Geister, Tiffany underwent six months of chemotherapy. This was just the beginning of Tiffany's cancer jour- ney. What followed for Tiffany and her family would be two more rounds of surgery and chemotherapy. Yet, the cancer continued to re-appear in Tiffany's lymph nodes. After three surgeries and multiple courses of chemotherapy and radiation, Tiffany's oncologist made a life-saving decision for Tiffany. Dr. Geister referred Tiffany to Dr. Edward Lin at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Dr. Lin, who was one of the first oncologists to specifically tar-get colon cancer stem cells, was investigating a new therapy that could help patients just like Tiffany. After consulting with Dr. Lin, Tiffany was enrolled in a clinical trial. Dr. Lin's study, a Phase II ADAPT Therapy, was a unique treatment regime involving a novel combination of chemotherapy, radiation and celecoxib, an FDA- approved arthri-tis drug. The results were promising. For three and a half years, which included 23 sessions of radiation paired with chemotherapy and celecoxib, Tiffany's scans were clear. No cancer. Although Tiffany needed another round of chemotherapy to address a swollen lymph node and inflamed kidney, she returned to the study's treatment regime soon thereafter. Today, Tiffany is do-ing well, her scans remain clear and she appears to be in full remission. Throughout Tiffany's enrollment in the clinical trial, both Drs. Geis- ter and Lin worked closely together, discussing treatment plans, exchanging test results, and sharing updates on Tiffany's health and progress. As a result of Dr. Lin's clinical trial and his innovative approach for treating colon cancer, Tiffany has been a part of her children's lives, spending valuable time together and watching them be-come young adults. She now has an 19 year-old freshman in col-lege and a 16 year-old freshman in high school. \" I credit Dr. Lin for the past 10 years of my life.

Plagued by stomach troubles, Tom underwent a colonos-copy. He learned he had cancer upon awakening from the anes-thesia. Tom will never forget his shock in receiving the news. Tom's cancer had already metastasized to his liver. He met with Dr. Edward Lin, an accomplished researcher and expert in gastrointestinal cancers, who had also just moved to Seattle from MD Anderson in Texas to join the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Dr. Lin informed Tom that he had stage 4 colorectal cancer, with a five percent chance of surviving for five years. Lin also said that they would \"throw everything at it,\" and began Tom's treatment. What followed was three months of intensive chemotherapy, six weeks of radiation, and then colon and liver operations in Octo-ber and December. With each surgery, Tom was back to work within days. His goal was to keep going, no matter what. Following his second surgery, Tom continued treat- ment for another two years on a unique combination drug therapy created by Dr. Lin. The treatment proto-col, called ADAPT Therapy, activates cancer stem cells that tra-ditionally hibernate during chemotherapy\u2014a main cause of treat-ment failure\u2014so the cancer stem cells can be destroyed. After two years on Dr. Lin's protocol, Tom had a clean CT scan. At 54, Tom is five years cancer-free. He is healthy and able to enjoy his life and time with his family. \" My youngest daughter was nine at the time of my diagnosis.

Cures. Life.We are proud to seek out medical researchers devoted to finding breakthroughs in all areas of cancer research for all types of cancer. During FY 2012, Gateway funded studies focused on sarcoma, leukemia, myeloma, brain, colorectal, lung, blood, cervical, prostate, breast and skin cancers. Believing patients' best option to fight cancer is through an integrated oncology model, Gateway funds Phase I and Phase II clinical trials and strives for a balanced research portfolio consisting of 40% novel use/combination of existing drugs, 40% complementary and alternative therapies and 20% new therapy/drug discoveries. NOVEL USE OF ExISTING DRUGS It normally takes about one billion dollars and 10 years to develop a new drug\u2014an unacceptable timeline for people who need help ToDAY . Dr. Lin's treatment course targets and destroys colorectal cancer stem cells by combining chemotherapy with celecoxib, an FDA approved arthritis medicine. Celecoxib has been available for years, it is potentially faster and cost-effective to make this new combina- tion therapy available to other colon cancer patients who may not have ten months, much less ten years.

It is a term used to describe a wide range of healing systems that are not considered part of mainstream or conventional Western medicine, such as natural products, mind-body medicine and ma-nipulative and body-based practices. It is rarely, if ever, funded by mainstream organizations because there is little or no profit in the use of existing natural remedies. It is particularly important to fund CAM research because it can offer patients potentially non-toxic therapies to battle cancer, improve quality of life and maximize the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapies.

Thanks to generous underwriting by Cancer Treatment Centers of America, 99 cents of every dollar received goes directly to fund research. We are proud to fund research- ers who focus on speed-ing results to patients who need them noW. Accountability to donors and cancer patients eve-rywhere is the corner - stone of our research funding model. We di- rectly oversee every research grant to ensure that we understand the progress, and where and how donations are being spent. We withhold some of the grant money until the research is final, en-suring that we know the full outcome of the trials you have helped us fund. The Gateway uses a pay-per-patient model. Unlike most founda- tions, we do not provide lump sum payment in advance. Instead, payment to the researcher is triggered whenever a new patient is enrolled and treated in the clinical trial. These aspects of our funding model incentivize our research teams to move more quickly instead of slowing the research pro-cess, and potentially needing more funding. We truly care about patients and the long-term effects of all cancer treatments we fund and we follow up with each study by requiring quarterly pro-gress reports.Accountability to Cancer Patients...and Their Loved OnesReseARCH 12 Treatments.

For the last eight years, Ken was a devoted fundraiser and board member at The Gateway for Cancer Research, serving as the board's Vice Chairman for the last several years, as well as a member of the Ex-ecutive Committee. Together with his loving wife Maryl, Ken raised over $650,000 for cancer research, specifically to fund clinical trials to help cancer patients feel better, live longer, and in many cases, succeed in their fight against cancer. Ken was an \"all-in\" kind of man. He liked to take the time to focus on what was impor-tant, and then pursue it with all of his being. Supporting cancer research, years before he had it, was one of those passions. The greatest tribute to Ken is that in his short lifetime Ken made a difference.
