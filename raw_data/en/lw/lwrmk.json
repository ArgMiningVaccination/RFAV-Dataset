Are you stressed, exhausted, burnt out, and living life in survival mode? Have you been told \"you seem healthy\" or \"your labs are normal\" but you feel like a mess? Are you having difficulty conceiving naturally, have irregular menstrual cycles, PMS or pain with menses? ...And so much more! Most of my patients are struggling with some level of hormone imbalance. Now saying \"hormones\" makes everyone think of stuff like PMS, but it's SO much more than that. I'm talking about more than just estrogen and testosterone. The thyroid hormones, adrenal hormones and sex hormones are all playing off of each other, so if one is out of tune, it's likely everything else is getting thrown off too. When any or all of these hormones are out of balance then our energy, sleep, metabolism, immune function and fertility can all be affected. This applies to both men and women- yes, men can have hormone imbalances too! There are also many factors that can affect hormones- including your gut health and environmental exposures-and these factors typically aren't addressed in traditional medical settings. I found naturopathic medicine the hard way - after coming to a point in my own health where my conventional physicians said they had \"reached the end of the road\" in their treatment options. The irony was that this statement marked the beginning of the road leading me to a career devoted to getting to the root cause of disease and utilizing compassionate medicine that treats the whole person. After completing a Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences at The University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ, I continued my education at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, AZ with an emphasis in women's health and endocrinology. I now practice in Tucson, AZ. My interests outside of medicine include gardening, cooking, enjoying the outdoors and my beautiful family. I currently see patients at [Nature Medica Naturopathic Clinic](http://www.naturemedica.net). I had struggled with my weight and blood sugar issues for years before I found Dr. Katie Rose through a friend. It turned out I had PCOS and thyroid issues which no other doctor had addressed even though I had also struggled with fertility, suffering multiple miscarriages. With diet changes, supplements, acupuncture, and a whole lot of education, I am so happy to say I feel amazing and am now the proud mama of a baby girl! I truly don't think this would have been possible without Dr. Rose's help! I've been post-menopausal for 7 years. Gynecologists had tried to balance my hormones without success and were suggesting surgery although they weren't sure what the problem was. Frustration drove me to look for an alternative. I found Dr. Katie Rose. She took the time to listen to me and looked beyond the data. Not only is she well versed in western medicine, she's a naturopath and a second-generation acupuncturist which allows her to draw from multiple knowledge bases. She's logical and is great at communicating with me so I understand my treatment and why it's necessary to make changes. I'm happy to say that within a few months, Dr. Rose has my hormones balanced (no surgery needed), thyroid levels are in the optimal range, my adrenal insufficiency is under control and I'm sleeping well. For the first time I can remember - I'm controlling my health instead of it controlling me. We have been seeing Dr. Katie Rose since we moved to Tucson a few years back. She is an amazing doctor that is always willing to dig in deep to help you with your issues. She sees our whole family helps us with a wide variety of medical problems, from food allergies to anxiety to well woman checks, and everything in between. We are very thankful that we found her! After years of struggling with health issues, Dr. Katie Rose has been my dream doctor come to life. She zeroed in on symptoms that had been ignored or overlooked in the past and successfully set me on the path towards greater health. She is knowledgeable, kind, resourceful, and dedicated to looking at alternative paths towards healing when traditional methods fail. She is amazing! She goes above and beyond in researching my health issues. I trust her implicitly and recommend her without hesitation. Where can I possibly start on the most amazing doctor in Tucson!!! She has changed my life so much! Dr. Katie Rose found me stressed, sick, and grieving from the loss of my first baby. Not only did she change my health but she helped me conceive my beautiful, healthy, baby boy! Dr. Rose is incredibly thorough she checked me for things my other docs had neglected. Dr. Rose put me at ease when I was terrified about my health and my miscarriage. I seriously do not know where I would be in my life without her guidance, encouragement, and patience. If you need an amazing doctor with an amazing heart go see this woman, she will change your "}
