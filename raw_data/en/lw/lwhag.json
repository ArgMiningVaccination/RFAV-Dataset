The $280 million Translational Science Hub will be located in Queensland, initially utilising the laboratories and infrastructure at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au) and [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au). The Hub will focus on developing new vaccines and health care solutions. The Hub will link Queensland's world-class researchers with [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com.au) scientists in France and the US, placing Queensland at the forefront of global vaccine development and biomedical research. The unique global research and development network will initially focus on the evaluation of a new generation of mRNA vaccines and the development of a world-first chlamydia vaccine. Who is Sanofi? Sanofi is one of the world's largest global healthcare companies focused on researching, developing and manufacturing potentially life-changing treatments and vaccine protection for millions of people. With a heritage spanning 100 years, Sanofi has a presence in 100 countries and a global footprint extending to almost 70 medicine and vaccine sites and 20 research and development sites. The company is responsible for a lot of common vaccinations such as the flu vaccine. In Australia, Sanofi is one of the top five medicine and vaccine companies with: - over 50 medicines on Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - six Rare Disease therapies on the Life Saving Drugs Program - 17 vaccines available, with seven on the National Immunisation Program. Why this is such a big deal for Queensland? This agreement positions Queensland squarely at the heart of a global biomedical industry dedicated to developing new vaccines to fight diseases sooner and faster. The creation of a scientific network across Queensland's world-class universities, research institutes and specialist healthcare facilities will bring jobs, investment and interest to Queensland, and bolster our reputation as a biomedical industry hub. The Translational Science Hub will immediately boost the capability of Queensland's immunologists and vaccine researchers residing at some of the best universities in Australia, giving them direct access to their scientific peers located at the Sanofi mRNA Center of Excellence in Lyon, France and Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States. The Hub will also deliver 200 new highly-skilled science, research and healthcare roles, along with increased pathways for young people studying or considering entering the biomedical sector. As the anchor tenant of TRI's Translational Manufacturing facility, Sanofi's presence in Queensland is the \"missing link\" in our aim to build a biomedical ecosystem that will power jobs, investment and research. Sanofi's decision to set up their business in Queensland lends legitimacy to our [biomedical expertise](https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/news/what-is-the-biomedical-sector-how-were-prioritising-your-health-and-the-health-of-queensland), critical mass to our translational research capability and a beacon for further private sector investment. The Hub will mean more Queenslanders dedicated to protecting and improving the health of Queenslanders. What is the biomedical industry? Biomedicine is a field of study and research that explores the biological factors of health conditions and associated treatments. [Queensland's biomedical sector](https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/news/queenslands-biomedical-future) comprises the collaborative efforts of government, educational and research organisations, hospitals and industry partners to deliver ground-breaking biomedical research, innovative products and dedicated facilities for the clinical treatment of health problems in Queensland. Earlier this year, a refreshed [Queensland Biomedical 10-Year Roadmap and Action Plan](https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/73984/biomedical-10-year-roadmap-and-action-plan-october-2022.pdf) was released, highlighting Queensland's successes in enhancing existing industry strengths and opportunities while positioning our state as a leader for this world-changing industry in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the original roadmap launched in 2017, the biomedical sector has grown to: - Employ an estimated 12,400 people, an increase of the equivalent of 3000 full-time employees - Contribute $2.11 billion to the economy - a 47% increase - Deliver an export value estimated at $450 million What is an mRNA vaccine? The next generation of vaccines to protect against serious diseases is expected to come from mRNA vaccine technology. mRNA works by instructing certain cells to produce proteins that are recognised by the immune system to mount a defence. New generation vaccines based on mRNA technology have the potential to prevent serious illness, avoid hospitalisation and reduce the overall burden of disease. The Translational Science Hub will initially focus on mRNA technology to advance new vaccine candidates for chlamydia. Case study: Chlamydia Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world, and the most reported among young people in Australia. In 2021, there were 22,000 reported cases of chlamydia in Queensland, and some 129 million infections reported worldwide in 2020. While chlamydia [can be treated](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/staying-healthy/sexual-health/chlamydia-test), there is currently no vaccine to prevent infection. If left untreated it can lead to infertility and in pregnant women can result in foetal eye and lung infections. The importance of investigating chlamydia vaccine candidates has obvious potential social and economic benefits locally, but the real benefits will likely be seen in low- and middle-income countries where accurate diagnostic testing is largely unavailable. The Translational Science Hub is proudly supported by Sanofi, Griffith University, the University of Queensland and the Queensland Government.
