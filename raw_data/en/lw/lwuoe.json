At some point during his childhood, his hair turned blue. [[2]](#cite_note-2) During his childhood Toriko was a starving orphan living alone in a poverty stricken nation with no one to care for him or his friends. That was until a collapsed Toriko was discovered by the [IGO](/wiki/IGO)'s top members [Ichiryu](/wiki/Ichiryu) and [Mansam](/wiki/Mansam), who came to their nation to distribute food to the poor. Ichiryu offered the starving Toriko a piece of bread, but instead of consuming it for his own survival, Toriko headed to his village to try and share it but collapsed. With his great insight and wisdom, Ichiryu noticed Toriko's generosity, kind heart, and his vast potential, [[3]](#cite_note-3) thus deciding to take him under his wing along with four other children named [Coco](/wiki/Coco), [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny), [Zebra](/wiki/Zebra), and [Rin](/wiki/Rin) to try teaching them the ways of the [Bishokuya](/wiki/Bishokuya) and train them to their physical peaks. At an unknown point during or after their training, it was mentioned that Toriko and the other children were [chain animals](/wiki/Chain_animal) in the [Gourmet Coliseum](/wiki/Gourmet_Coliseum); however, the full details behind this have yet to be explained. Eventually Toriko, Coco, Sunny, and Zebra became the [Four Heavenly Kings](/wiki/Four_Heavenly_Kings), some of the most well known Bishokuya in the [Human World](/wiki/Human_World), and Rin became the right-hand assistant of Mansam. Toriko went on to discover countless ingredients and make many achievements in the Gourmet Era; however, at a later point in his career he started being less active and spent his days hunting without drawing the attention of the media. Galala Gator Arc[ ] Toriko was first seen fishing in a far off rocky cliff-side where he was attempting to capture a [Pincer Fish](/wiki/Pincer_Fish). While there he is found by a young chef named [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu), who on behalf of the IGO, sought Toriko's services in capturing a level 5 [Galala Gator](/wiki/Galala_Gator) for a special dinner party being held at a restaurant for the IGO. Toriko happily agrees to Komatsu's terms, but is more enthusiastic about tasting the high-class meat of the Galala Gator. The next day Toriko prepares to set off to the [Baron Archipelago](/wiki/Baron_Archipelago), the home of the Galala Gator, with the aid of his boatman friend [Tom](/wiki/Tom). He is also accompanied by Komatsu who hopes to learn more about being a chef by seeing the animals in the wild and watching Toriko hunt. When they arrive at the [Baron Bog](/wiki/Baron_Bog) he noticed that most of the bog's inhabitants have been behaving strangely, with some even leaving their usual habitat. While Toriko and Komatsu camp out for the night they find a group of starving animals, as it appears that something has been devouring a large amount of the island food, thus forcing most of the herbivores to flee and the carnivores to starve, Toriko then suspects that a powerful beast is behind the change in the ecosystem, Komatsu then reveals that the IGO suspected that the Galala Gator in the bog actually has a capture level of 8 due to its advanced age of 300 (as their capture level grows as they get older and so does their aggressiveness) and because of this Komatsu suspects that the Gator is indeed the cause of the island's change, however this only makes Toriko more excited as the meat of a Galala Gator gets better with age. They are soon confronted by a dying [Swamp Snake](/wiki/Swamp_Snake) covered in [Baron Leeches](/wiki/Baron_Leech) that appears to have been attacked by the Galala Gator, but before they can confirm their suspicions the Galala Gator finally appears and tries to attack Toriko. During their fight Toriko realizes that the Galala Gator has been tracking them and the animals of the island by using a colony of Baron Leeches in its mouth (as Baron Leeches leave hard to heal wounds, the Garara Gator is able to sniff out the wounded prey), after realizing this, Toriko decides to end the fight quickly and uses his \"Fork and Knife\" technique to decapitate the Galala Gator, thus restoring balance to the Baron Bog and fulfilling his duty to the IGO. In the anime, a bonus scene is shown, revealing that the battle was being monitored by the [Gourmet Corp.](/wiki/Gourmet_Corp.) and they have decided to keep watch on the Four Heavenly Kings' actions. After the Garara Gator's defeat, Toriko and Komatsu divide up the meat for the IGO and decide to sit down and taste some of the meat for themselves, which they both find delicious. However the next day Komatsu wakes up to find that Toriko has eaten all of the Garara Gator meat but he still doesn't find it good enough for his [Full Course Menu](/wiki/Full_Course_Menu) which he someday hopes to complete. Rainbow Fruit Arc[ ] Some time after the Galala Gator incident, Toriko is shown having a relaxing day while enjoying the luxuries of his delicious [Sweets House](/wiki/Toriko%27s_Sweets_House) when he decides to go hunt a [Sharkenodon](/wiki/Sharkenodon) and sell it for a nice profit in the [Gourmet Wholesale Market](/wiki/Gourmet_Wholesale_Market). Toriko arrives with the beast he captured and agrees to sell it for a lower price for poor customers. During his transaction, [Johannes](/wiki/Johannes) an agent of the IGO and Komatsu arrive and request Toriko's aid in the capture of the legendary [Rainbow Fruit](/wiki/Rainbow_Fruit) which is being protected by a group of Troll Kongs who have built their nest around the tree of the fruit in [Biotope 8](/wiki/Biotope_8), Toriko gladly agrees and prepares for his adventure. As he and Komatsu make their way into the enclosed Biotope, Toriko encounters a [Troll Kong](/wiki/Troll_Kong) scout and knocks him out with a [Knocking Gun](/wiki/Knocking), in order to avoid killing it as he does not enjoy killing creatures he has no intention of eating, however as the Troll Kong falls it spews saliva all over Toriko causing him to smell like a weakling Troll Kong. This soon causes trouble for him as he encounters the group of Troll Kongs guarding the Rainbow Fruit tree and he cannot scare them away with his intimidation due to smelling like a weak Troll Kong underling. A fight soon ensues and Toriko tries his best to knock as many of them as possible without killing them but soon enough things become troublesome. Luckily a rainstorm soon commences and the rain washes off the scent of the underling from him, allowing him to use his intimidation against the others and gain dominance over their [leader](/wiki/Silverback). Toriko then takes a single fruit from the tree and promises not to take more than that as to not harm the Troll Kongs way of life. Upon his return to the World Kitchen, Toriko sells half the fruit for little pay so that it may be sold at a fair price to customers. He then goes back with Komatsu to [Hotel Gourmet](/wiki/Hotel_Gourmet) so he may prepare the Fruit of Rainbow. Upon tasting it Toriko becomes so moved by the ever-changing flavors of the Rainbow Fruit prepared by Komatsu that he declares the Rainbow Fruit as the dessert dish on his Full Course Menu. He then proceeds to celebrate and buy drinks for Komatsu and all the hotel's staff. Puffer Whale Arc[ ] Toriko and Komatsu met once again and planned a trip to [Gourmet Fortune](/wiki/Gourmet_Fortune), the location of the [Labyrinthine Cave](/wiki/Labyrinthine_Cave) where the fabled [Puffer Whales](/wiki/Puffer_Whale) are set to appear as they do every sixteen years. While on the train, Toriko comes across a [drunk old man](/wiki/Jiro) begging for booze, he happily gives him a bottle and the man swears eternal gratitude to him and Komatsu. Upon arriving to town, they meet up with Toriko's old friend and fellow Heavenly King, [Coco](/wiki/Coco) who happily greets his old friend and Komatsu. They then make their way to Coco's [home](/wiki/Coco%27s_House) where he reveals [Zebra](/wiki/Zebra)'s recent incarceration, which does not surprise Toriko very much. They then meet Coco's animal partner [Kiss](/wiki/Kiss) who escorts them to Coco's isolated home. There they ask Coco for his aid in preparing the Puffer Whale as he is the only one skilled in its preparation. He complies and the group set out to Labyrinthine Cave. After journeying into the cave, they come across several obstacles but was easily conquered. Things begin to look grim when Komatsu suddenly disappears causing Coco to fear for his life as he sensed Komatsu's death would come soon. Before they can search for him, they are confronted by the dominant species of the cave, the [Devil Serpent](/wiki/Devil_Serpent). The two then engage in battle against the monstrous fiend. Meanwhile it turns out Komatsu had been kidnapped by [Buchichupon](/wiki/Buchichupon) so he could be used as bait. However his plans fails when another Devil Serpent arrives and he himself is devoured leaving Komatsu to try and scare off the beast with his [Toriko Cracker](/wiki/Toriko_Cracker), but due to the intense blast of sound from the popper's explosion, it caused Komatsu's ear drums to pop and go into cardiac arrest. He is luckily saved by the same drunk old man they met on the train, who turns out to be the famous Knocking Master Jiro. After an intense battle with the Devil Serpent, Toriko and Coco come out victorious and soon manage to find Komatsu who tells them what happened. Soon enough they arrived at the [Sandy Beach in the Cave](/wiki/Sandy_Beach_in_the_Cave) where the Puffer Whale will appear and proceed to attempt the difficult capturing methods without startling them. They manage to catch a few but Coco's skills are not enough to prepare the Puffer Whale so he entrusts the task to Komatsu, who after many unsuccessful attempts finally manages to remove the poison sack from their body and the group enjoys a feast of Puffer Whale delights in celebration of their victory. But their celebration comes to an abrupt halt when they come face to face with a mysterious and powerful [entity](/wiki/GT_Robo) that appears to be neither man nor beast. Fearing the worst, the two kings power up to take it down, however the being shows no interest and simply walks off with a large net full of Puffer Whales, leaving the group in startled states. Despite tensions they eventually return outside and prepare to leave for home on a job well done, however just then an IGO helicopter appears with Johannes inside, who requests of Toriko's aid over at [Biotope 1](/wiki/Biotope_1), for a special mission. Regal Mammoth Arc[ ] |This article or section is a stub!| | | Help Sunny and Toriko Wiki by beautifying and A few days after the events of the Puffer Whale Arc, Toriko and Komatsu along with Johannes are seen on a helicopter heading to Biotope 1. Toriko, as per usual, is seen eating a hamburger from the Devil Serpent's meat naming it the \" [Toriko Burger](/wiki/Toriko_Burger)\". Soon afterwards, Johannes reveals the requested ingredient by the IGO this time around being the Regal Mammoth. Just as they arrive at the 1st Biotope, Toriko and Komatsu are welcomed warmly and are told the \"chief\" awaits. After exploring the facility and analyzing the food production taking place, the pair then attempt to enter the main lab. However, before they are granted permission to enter, they must undergo a series of purification requiring them to take a shower and their clothes to be sterilized thus cleansing them thoroughly. Once they arrive at the main lab, they stumble upon the keeping place of the Chain Animals, a species of hybrid clones, bio-engineered and under supervision of the IGO. A Muscle Crab escapes causing turmoil amongst the workers but the beast easily taken down by none other than the IGO Chief Mansam using his Fry Pan Punch. As him and Toriko reunite by shake hands, he reveals the [Gourmet Coliseum](/wiki/Gourmet_Coliseum)'s main event being the legendary [Battle Wolf](/wiki/Battle_Wolf)! When the three entered the arena stands, they're shown a battle between the Troll Kong and a Galala Crocodile. As the Troll Kong reign victorious over his opponent, Toriko explain why the Gourmet Coliseum was created and how the IGO get its funding from the patrons who gamble on the battles to maintain operations. When the Battle Wolf appeared, Toriko notice that it was in labor through his sense of smell. He then entered the Gourmet Coliseum in order to assist it with its birth, and get all the spectators out of the stands so the Battle Wolf can give birth in peace by breaking the glass dome, and making the chain animals escape. But a bystander remained in the arena as the bystanders were leaving. When Manson approached him, he was stabbed in the stomach. It was revealed that the Republic of Roto's President was none other than a GT Robo in disguised. By using the Gourmet ID of the Roto President, he was able to bypass security because it's not mandatory to update the ID. Manson then realized that the operator was Bei of the Gourmet Corp. who was there to acquire the Jewel Meat from the Regal Mammoth, and used Knocking on the Chief but it was ineffective. When Manson use his Frying Pan Sandwich on GT Robo, he was attack with its laser, temporary making Manson unable to fight. During this battle, The Battle Wolf was able to give birth and defeated the Devil Serpent in a display of skill that left Toriko, Komatsu, and the baby Battle Wolf in awe. After it exhausted itself, the GT Robo shot it through its side and berating it all the while. This angered Toriko and made all the animals that were in their cages frightened. Manson noticed this and explained that Toriko rarely gets angry. As Toriko and Bei's GT Robo fought, Toriko was having some difficulty damaging the GT Robo due to its Super High Polymer Special Polyethylene and its Peeler Shot. Toriko was able to defeat the GT Robo by using the One Point Concentrated Ice Pick Nail Punch as Bei was about to fire its laser from its mouth. Bei was about to self-destruct the GT Robo, but Manson had the control room attack it before it gets the chance to finish it. When the Core Antenna was about to escape, Manson called Rikky to finish it off. Toriko was able to comfort the new baby Battle Wolf after seeing its mother's final moments. After bonding with it, Toriko named it Terry Cloth because of how soft its fur was. After the battle was over, Mansam invited them to eat his full course meal to recover from their battle with the GT Robo. They discussed about how to capture the Regal Mammoth, but Rin revealed that [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny) was already on the island and was informed that it was already captured by him. When they went outside to meet Sunny, he was surrounded by a bunch of [Gang Hoods](/wiki/Gang_Hood). He was easily able to defeat them while holding the Regal Mammoth with one hand. When Sunny came to them, Toriko explained his abilities and was informed by Manson that the Regal Mammoth that Sunny captured was a \"child\"; which had made the mother Regal Mammoth furious. Toriko, Rin, Komatsu, Sunny, & Terry began their search for the adult Regal Mammoth before the Gourmet Corp. obtain it first. When they went to the [Black Grass](/wiki/Black_Grass) and tried it out with [Cocomayo Tree](/wiki/Cocomayo_Tree), [Rock Drums ](/wiki/Rock_Drum) have appeared to attack them. Toriko vexed Sunny into helping them out when he told him that a Rock Drum's skin can be turned into a beautiful marble once its processed. As Sunny displayed his attacks, one of the Rock Drum kicked them to different locations. Toriko and Rin in one place, Sunny and Komatsu in another. Toriko and Rin landed at the [White Forest](/wiki/White_Forest) where lots of wild beasts are attacking them. In order to defeat the wild beasts in the shortest amount of time, Toriko asked Rin to use the Battle Fragrance on him to make his Intimidation more powerful. As it went into effect it scared all the wild beast that was in their way except for the [Obsaurus](/wiki/Obsaurus), as it refuses to move because of the orders of its owner, a GT Robo. After a long fight they was able to control the Obsaurus which gave them a ride to the Devil Athletics where Toriko and Rin was having a hard time with [Mysterious Bird Rubanda](/wiki/Mysterious_Bird_Rubanda). With its ability to create hallucination effects and use it powerful speed to overwhelm the opponent, Toriko and Rin was having a tough time defeating the devilish beast until Terry came and forced the Mysterious Bird Rubanda back. Terry then lead Toriko and Rin through a safe route out of the Athletics where they can continue their search for the Regal Mammoth. When they arrived where the Regal Mammoth was along with Sunny and Komatsu (who also made it to Regal Plateau), it was falling from the Regal Hill. Toriko made a small hole using his Knife in order to protect them from getting crushed. As the Mammoth rolled over the tiny safe haven, Sunny used his Hair Net to protect them from the weight of the mammoth. As the four exit outside, the [Heavycliffs](/wiki/Heavycliff) began to ready themselves for battle when Coco appeared and paralyzed them and the mammoth with his poison. After a quick quarrel between Sunny and Coco, the Giant GT Robo appeared and fought Coco. As Coco begun to buy time for Toriko, Komatsu, Rin, and Sunny, the Regal Mammoth sucked them in from his mouth. The teeth of the humongous mammoth was about the crush them but Sunny's Spatula was able to deflect it enough for them to not get eaten. As they fall into an area of the Regal Mammoth, they meet the GT Robo which is piloted by [Cedre](/wiki/Cedre). Sunny wanted to fight him because of the way he desecrated the animals in the swamp and told Toriko, Komatsu and Rin to go on ahead. When they were near the Jewel Meat, The GT Robo piloted by [Starjun](/wiki/Starjun) appeared before them. When Toriko tried to use the 5 Hit Kugi Punch on Starjun, he was swatted off breaking his neck in the process. The shockwave of the attack left Toriko in a coma, while the aftershock hit Rin and Komatsu. When Starjun finished his attack the GT Robo was damaged by the Kugi Punch; making Starjun compliment that it was able to graze him a bit. After seeing this, Rin shot a Fragrance Bazooka at Starjun to no avail, as Starjun dodged and pierced her through the abdomen. When Toriko was in his coma state, he saw his intimidation image eating him (this represent his gourmet cells going into Autophagy). His intimidation image gave him a quick warning that he has only 5 minutes of this extra strength. When he was able to wake up due to Rin's Endorphin Smoke, he came back and attacked Starjun. Toriko explains that Rin was willing to die and he has no respect for the Gourmet Corp. for they operate at a distance and that he will convey them the fear of death. As the battle rages on, Starjun explained that Autophagy will destroy the gourmet cells if it goes on too long. When Toriko hesitated to remember what his intimidation image had warned him before, Starjun took advantage of the situation and begun his counter assault. When Starjun used a Mixer Punch, Toriko wasn't able to fight anymore due to the Autophagy reaching its limit. Seeing this as the limitations of Toriko's power, Starjun decided to kill Toriko to finish the mission. With that he shot a laser through Toriko's stomach; consequently making Toriko to find the Jewel Meat. As Toriko saw the Jewel Meat, his mouth watered and thought that the smell of the raw Jewel Meat can put high class fragrances to shame. When Toriko scooped it out with his hands, he described it as having a wild feeling when chewed. The gorgeous clear sound that came from eating the raw Jewel Meat is like a gizzard. Toriko later recovered from his wounds after eating the Jewel Meat and appeared behind Starjun and Komatsu. He then tells Starjun to remove the \"sense of pressure excess\" to test his resolution where Starjun complied with Toriko's request, stating that he's fine without having it because the GT Robos are a hindrance to him with no exceptions. He even told Toriko to show him his true power so he can accurately measure it. Before Toriko can launch a 10 Ren Kugi Punch, Starjun used a Mixer Punch to stop Toriko to no avail. Toriko used his Knife consecutively to cut off the GT Robo's left arm. It then became clear that it was a one-sided fight; in favor of Toriko. Before finishing of the GT Robo Starjun was piloting, Starjun asked about the Jewel Meat and wanted to taste it, but later said that he wants meet Toriko again; but in the flesh. The battle ended when Toriko's 10 Ren Kugi Punch hit its target, promptly destroying the GT Robo and him thanking Starjun for the meal. Toriko then ate the [Jewel Meat](/wiki/Jewel_Meat) with the others with him and Sunny arguing on who gets to have the Jewel Meat placed on their full course, with Sunny eventually winning. BB Corn Arc[ ] One day, while out at [World Kitchen](/wiki/World_Kitchen), [Tom](/wiki/Tom) found an ingredient for Terry to possibly enjoy. He reasoned to Toriko why Terry didn't have much of an appetite in the Human World; is because there are not many ingredients in the Human World that would suit Terry's taste, due to Terry being a Battle Wolf clone, with memories of [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World) ingredients engraved in her DNA. Tom mentioned that Jiro brought him a whole bag of the Gourmet World delicacy, [Blue Blood Corn](/wiki/Blue_Blood_Corn), and that Terry would like it, as it comes from the Gourmet World, where even the beasts there enjoy BB Corn. But the corn can only be found at a remote place of the Human World, the [Wul Jungle](/wiki/Wul_Jungle), where carnivorous plants and dangerous beasts thrive. So Toriko and Terry decided to venture into the Wul Jungle and discover the location where the corn was growing. They eventually found it near the jungle, and after a full-powered Nail Punch was Toriko able to make a few kernels emerge from the giant ear of BB Corn itself. Toriko, after using all his strength to make a few kernels pop, was shocked to discover that a whole ear of BB Corn was easily cut down and taken by [something](/wiki/Jack_Elephant) big. In order to make a kernel into popcorn, they needed a massive amount of heat, so Toriko brought the kernels near [Wul Volcano](/wiki/Wul_Volcano). Using stones as a pan, he set the corn down and used the searing heat of the volcano to heat up the kernel. To protect themselves from the heat, Toriko and Terry used the pelts of the native [Magma Rat](/wiki/Magma_Rat). Finally, at 1,200 degrees, the kernel exploded, creating enough popcorn for a hundred people. Toriko is overjoyed at the fact that Terry finally found its favourite food, but before they could enjoy the BB Corn, it was all sucked up and eaten by a passing [Grinpatch](/wiki/Grinpatch), whose intentions was not to fight Toriko at first, as he was waiting for his pet Jack Elephant to pick him up from his recon mission to retrieve a GT Robo left behind at Biotope 1 by [Gido](/wiki/Gido). Grinpatch discussed his motives with Toriko, and when they mentioned that the Gourmet Corp. were also after [GOD](/wiki/GOD), Toriko realised that Grinpatch was evil and prepared to fight him. At first, Toriko had difficulty battling Grinpatch, as Fork and Knife were close-range weapons, and Grinpatch was [shooting air missiles](/wiki/Devil_Mosquito_Straw) at long range. As the battle dragged on, Toriko tried out a new ranged maneuver: Flying Fork and Flying Knife which had added range capability, but was not yet strong enough to injure Grinpatch at a distance. Using the new moves, Toriko closed the distance between himself and Grinpatch and used Knife to break Grinpatch's straw. Just as both parties were becoming serious at their standoff, Grinpatch received a call from the [Head Chef](/wiki/Kuromado), being told to return to their base just as his pet Jack Elephant arrived. With a shock, Toriko realized that the beast that was able to cut down an entire ear of BB Corn was the Jack Elephant. As Toriko and Terry recovered from their recent bout, Toriko remarked that Grinpatch was not fighting seriously at all and they have to get stronger in order to beat the Gourmet Corp. Toriko also attended the tasting of the [Bubbly Tuna](/wiki/Mermaituna) by the President [Dohem](/wiki/Dohem), and using the volcanic ash from the Wul Volcano as an ingredient, Komatsu was able to create the Bubbly Tuna Dohem loved. To celebrate the victory of the summit, Toriko treated everyone at Hotel Gourmet to the BB Corn he had brought back from the Wul Jungle. Century Soup Arc[ ] While dining in Hotel Gourmet, Toriko invited Komatsu to go with him to [Gourmet Town](/wiki/Gourmet_Town) to meet a certain person. From vending machines to restaurants, Toriko and Komatsu enjoyed their food stroll through Gourmet Town, encountering [Zongeh](/wiki/Zongeh) and other Gourmet Hunters. To prepare for the meeting, Toriko asked Komatsu to wear a suit, which surprised Komatsu, as Toriko usually wears casual clothes, indicating that person is important. Komatsu then requested that they visit the [Gourmet Department Store](/wiki/Gourmet_Department_Store) to buy a [Gourmet Case](/wiki/Gourmet_Case) while they are at it, and was amazed by the items there ( [Kuriboh Pots](/wiki/Kuriboh_Pot), [Melk Kitchen Knife](/wiki/Melk_Kitchen_Knife)). At the same time, [Colonel Mokkoi](/wiki/Colonel_Mokkoi) was seen buying a ton of items. Looking around, they witness a robbery by some [Gourmet Robbers](/wiki/Gourmet_Robbers), who were stopped by [Setsuno](/wiki/Setsuno), the person they are supposed to meet. Right away, she demanded that Toriko change his hairstyle to a pompadour if she were to take them to her kitchen, which Toriko forcefully agreed too, in hopes of tasting her Century Soup. She got Komatsu to introduce himself, and when she heard he's from the IGO, inquired about Ichiryu's well being, and explained how she was in a combo with his friend, Jiro, and thus had Toriko make a pompadour beforehand. Awaiting the [Century Soup](/wiki/Century_Soup), they welcomed with some [Air Aqua](/wiki/Air_Aqua) and [Garlic Bird](/wiki/Garlic_Bird) Donburi, until the Soup was finally cooked. After delighting themselves in the taste, Komatsu mentioned how the Soup is missing something, which amazed Setsuno that she invited them further into the store, where her preparation kitchen is. She lead them to the mountain-sized pot where the Soup is cooked, and admitted it is incomplete like Komatsu felt; missing something she is not aware of. She mentioned that they will soon be hired by someone in the Town to go capture the real Soup, and advised them both to go taste the real thing. Like Setsuno predicted, Toriko got an invitation, and went to [Bar Heavy Lodge](/wiki/Bar_Heavy_Lodge), where every Gourmet Hunter gathered there was shocked to see him, and the owner, [Morijii](/wiki/Morijii), blamed him for not visiting much since he became famous. Soon, Colonel Mokkoi entered with his request; 10 billion for finding the Century Soup. He escorted them aboard his ship to [Ice Hell](/wiki/Ice_Hell), and on the way explained its location and gave them [Lighter Suits](/wiki/Lighter_Suit). [Gourmet Knights](/wiki/Gourmet_Knights) member, [Takimaru](/wiki/Takimaru), introduced himself to Toriko, and Toriko inquired about their leader, [Aimaru](/wiki/Aimaru)'s well being, and as he did, [Great Legs](/wiki/Great_Leg) (Sharkcrocodile in the anime) attacked the ship. Toriko fended one off with a finger-knocking, and then the other Gourmet Hunters each dealt with the rest. They finally reached Ice Hell, but as soon as they did, a huge piece of ice fell of the mountain towards them, which Toriko dealt with using a combination of Flying Knife, Fork, and Nail Punch, surprising everyone aboard. Reaching their destination, a helicopter took a group of them a few stories up, where they climbed the rest of the mountain themselves. Toriko was shocked to see the guard of Ice Hell, the [Tundra Dragon](/wiki/Tundra_Dragon), frozen, along with many other Gourmet Hunters. Toriko lead a group of them (Komatsu, [Match](/wiki/Match) and his men, Takimaru) and continued forward. Toriko dug them a hole under the ice for them to rest, and kept watch outside for any wild beasts or enemies, suspecting other people to be on the continent. Meanwhile, the Gourmet Corp. started moving on the continent. Toriko's group continued the walk, and just when they were about to break down from the intense cold, they encountered some [Freezer Bisons](/wiki/Freezer_Bison), whom they used their fur for heat, after the group showed of their skills against the beasts. After multiple stops and walks, Toriko's group finally reached the [Ice Mountain](/wiki/Ice_Mountain), where the wind has stopped and turned warm. There, they sat for rest, and each explained their reason for venturing through Ice Hell. Also, a baby Wall Penguin took a liking to Komatsu and accompanied him. Suddenly, they heard a near explosion, and Toriko was convinced it is the Gourmet Corp. again. A swarm of [Jungle Stag Beetles](/wiki/Jungle_Stag_Beetle) attacked them, causing them serious injuries, followed by the arrival of the Gourmet Corp., lead by [Tommyrod](/wiki/Tommyrod). Tommy rushed at Toriko, punching a hole through his body, which Toriko used as an advantage to stop Tommy's movement and greet him with a punch up-close. As he tried though, Tommy released an insect from his mouth, freezing Toriko's hands. Then, two huge [Wall Penguins](/wiki/Wall_Penguin) appeared, wrecking the place, which opened a hole down the ground, leading them to the [Gourmet Show Window](/wiki/Gourmet_Show_Window). Toriko asked Komatsu to go take the Soup while he dealt with Tommy, and Match and Takimaru stopped [Barrygamon](/wiki/Barrygamon) and [Bogie Woods](/wiki/Bogie_Woods) from halting Komatsu's advance. Komatsu then advanced through the cave, and eventually met with [Teppei](/wiki/Teppei). Meanwhile, Tommy killed the two Penguins, which angered Toriko's group. Match and Takimaru then had a bloody battle with Bogie and Barry, whom they won against, but without heavy causalities. After his fight, Match thought to help Toriko in his fight, but was overwhelmed by the level of power Toriko's fight was at, and knew there was no way he can help. Toriko went against hundreds of Tommy's insects and had his Lighter Suits ripped, rendering him at a disadvantage in this cold along with his frozen hand. Match tried giving Toriko his Suits, but Toriko thanked him and refused. When Tommy noticed his comrades were beaten, he was enraged and sent insects to kill them, which angered Toriko into using Shivering to keep the insects away, and to melt the ice around his hands. Meanwhile, Teppei, Komatsu, and Zongeh were searching for the Soup, to no avail, as it seemed to have finished, but they eventually discovered there's still a tiny amount left. Still, Tommy refused to fight Toriko head on, and relied on his insects, even after Toriko's attempts at luring him by challenging him. Tommy threw the thousand bugs at Toriko all at once, until they covered him whole. Then to make sure Toriko's dead, Tommy attacked personally to finish him off, but was caught in Toriko's trap, and got a 10-Hit Nail Punch handed to him, sending him flying back. Tommy was curious as to how Toriko did not die even while covered with insects, and came to the conclusion that Toriko's cells released Phytoncide as defense. Enraged, they both enter the real deadly battle; Tommy tore off Toriko's finger, while Toriko did Tommy's wing in. Tommy then used Shivering in a different way to throw blasts of steam at Toriko, and Toriko approached with a 12-Hit Punch, only to get his hands eaten by Tommy. Still, Toriko sent the punch flying at Tommy, even while missing his hands. Still, Tommy threw even more steam blasts to finish off Toriko's whole arm. Toriko used the other hand to deal Tommy a 13-Hit to the face. More fighting depleted Toriko's energy, and at that time, Tommy unveils his true form as a respect to Toriko, and advances a barrage of punches on Toriko, which almost killed him. But, Toriko suddenly realizes the heavy wound he dealt Tommy with his kick at some point in the fight, and then unleashes his new techniques, Leg Knife and Leg Fork, dealing heavy damage to Tommy, but completely depleting his stores, leaving him unconscious. Tommy, in rage, was about to deliver the final blow to the unconscious Toriko, but Teppei stepped in. After Teppei used Knocking on Tommy, he used his techniques to help save Toriko's group, whom were all dying from freezing. To their misfortune though, they headed back to Komatsu only to find the Soup was stolen by the Gourmet Corp. Teppei strangled and broke down the Show Window until it released a drop of Century Soup, which they decided to have Komatsu drink, in hopes that he would be able to remember the taste and cook the exact same one. Zongeh then led them to a shortcut outside the cave, where Setsuno came to pick them up with her [Limousine Jellyfish](/wiki/Limousine_Jellyfish). They had their share of rest and food there, where Setsuno advised Toriko to try and get his arm healed at the country, [Life](/wiki/Life). In Life, Toriko took a rest by the [Cactus Doctors](/wiki/Cactus_Doctor) to refresh himself, and then had Teppei give them a tour through the country, showing them the different kinds of Onsen, where they coincidentally meet with Sunny in one. They had a little talk with Sunny, where they learned they are all aiming to meet Teppei's master, [Yosaku](/wiki/Yosaku), who sent him on the request to check on the Gourmet Show Window. As it turned out, Yosaku was dining right next to them, and came to greet them when he saw Teppei. Yosaku then took them to Food Inn, where many Saiseiya meet. He took them to his place, and helped them all with their injuries and gave Takimaru the medicine. To their surprise though, he mentioned Toriko's arm may take 20 years to return back. Yosaku cut Toriko's hair for DNA info, and along with [Revival Seeds](/wiki/Revival_Seed), made a new seed off Toriko's DNA, and implanted it into Toriko's wound to regrow, then had Toriko rest in a [Healing Jelly](/wiki/Healing_Jelly) to speed up the process. Toriko struggled with the process, as the seed eats up all the nutrients in his body, and if he doesn't replenish with food quick, he may die. Three months passed in the process, and Toriko was progressing nicely. On the other hand, Komatsu was also progressing with his Soup. And just when Toriko's condition was getting worse, Komatsu finished his Soup with [Yun](/wiki/Yun)'s saliva and Toriko's body revived, reacting to the finished Soup. Finally, Toriko's group gathered at Hotel Gourmet to taste the Soup Komatsu completed. The Soup completely stunned them with how delicious it was. Toriko then asked Komatsu if he can put the Soup in his Full Course Menu, to which Komatsu gladly accepts. This makes the 3rd item on Toriko's Menu. After this, Hotel Gourmet went up to become a 6-Star Hotel. Aboard a train to Life, Toriko explained to Komatsu about Aimaru's disease, and how he is an old friend of his who is competing with him on who will have GOD as part of his Full Course Menu. They reached Life, where Sunny was training with Yosaku, and offered them both some Soup, which Sunny refused due to the vulgar face it makes. Toriko went back home only to find his candy house gone, eaten by beasts. Then, Terry welcomed him home by capturing him a [Crab Pig](/wiki/Crab_Pig), and Toriko noticed how big he has become. Ob also grew a bit. Toriko decided to call the Gourmet Architect, [Smile](/wiki/Smile), and offered to let him taste the Century Soup if he were to build Toriko a new Sweets House. Toriko invited Komatsu, Coco, Mansam, Tom, and Rin for a party commemorating his new house. In the end, after they got Smile's smile back with the Soup, they took it away when they ate the whole house in one night. Gourmet King Deciding Battle Arc (Filler)[ ] After Toriko's house party, Toriko, Coco,, and Sunny are informed by newscaster [Tina](/wiki/Tina) about the [Gourmet King Deciding Battle](/wiki/Gourmet_King_Deciding_Battle), to decide who is the best bishokuya. The three then enter the competition to see who is the best and upon arriving they find out that the competition was created by the wealthy millionaire [Fond De Bohno](/wiki/Fond_De_Bohno) in order to find an ingredient that would satisfy his pet [Seven-Color Nessie](/wiki/Seven-Color_Nessie), [Chris](/wiki/Chris) who has apparently lost its appetite and is slowly starving. Toriko then thinks that the ingredient that would satisfy a dragon beast such as Chris would be the [Grand Berry](/wiki/Grand_Berry) on [Megamori Island](/wiki/Megamori_Island). He, Komatsu, and Terry then set off to the island to seek out the berries but are attacked soon after arriving by a [Chestnutmadillo](/wiki/Chestnutmadillo). After getting away from the the Chestnutmadillo, they manage to find some Grand Berries, but discover that the berries are being guarded by a ferocious [Shark Box Turtle](/wiki/Shark_Box_Turtle). Toriko and Terry try to attack it, but it uses its shell to protect itself and its burrowing abilities to avoid attacks. Komatsu then notices that it hasn't stopped moving for a second, making Toriko realize that it needs to stay in constant motion for it to breath much like regular sharks do underwater. He then uses his Nail Punch on the ground causing it to fly out and into the air, he then throws a Flying Knife at it making the Shark Box Turtle to flip over and falls on its back, causing it to become short of breath. The shark then runs away and Toriko is able to capture the Grand Berries for Chris. Once they return however, Chris refuses to eat them or any of the ingredients brought by Coco, Sunny and the other bishokuya. Komatsu then realizes that Chris has actually been craving an incredibly sweet and rich dessert, after seeing it go for Rin's parfait. He then prepares the berries together with Coco's [Honey Dragon](/wiki/Honey_Dragon) honey and Sunny's [Milk Whale](/wiki/Milk_Whale) milk to make a delicious giant parfait for Chris which he happily gobbles down. After finishing his parfait, Chris becomes larger and grows a pair of wings, having finally gone through his final metamorphosis. Chris then bids farewell to a tearful Bohno, as he flies to follow his instincts, but not before leaving a [Grow Apple](/wiki/Grow_Apple) behind as a sign of his gratitude. Toriko then explains to the tearful Bohno that all animals must one day return to where they belong once they have grown and that there is no need to feel saddened when parting ways for they will always be friends. Toriko then affectionately looks up at Terry Cloth who is standing above the stage, knowing that some day they too will part ways. Everyone in the audience and the competitors then partake of the delicious Grow Apple. Ozone Herb Arc[ ] Toriko and Komatsu pay a visit to the famous [Yakiniku Healthy](/wiki/Yakiniku_Healthy) restaurant where both enjoy many of the high-class grilled vegetables they serve there. As soon they finish their meal, Toriko reveals that his true reason for bringing Komatsu was to get him excited for their next destination, [Vegetable Sky](/wiki/Vegetable_Sky) the divine vegetable garden in the aether where he plans to take him in order to help him acquire the king of vegetables, the [Ozone Herb](/wiki/Ozone_Herb) as part of a request given to him by IGO president Ichiryu. The next day both set off to their destination on a private IGO jet and both are eager as ever to reach it. Toriko then remembers the important words spoken to him by Ichiryu about the importance of a chef partner and how his own lack of a partner made the ingredients he collected in his long life seem worthless. Ichiryu's words then encourage Toriko to try and ask Komatsu to be his partner, but he dismisses his question as nothing important. Just then their plane is attacked by a giant [Sea Lion Bird](/wiki/Sea_Lion_Bird) but luckily they are able to shake it off and proceed to their destination. Komatsu then tries to wonder what Toriko was going to ask but he simply states that he was just going to say that he will protect Komatsu as best he can, he then points out the windows and states they've arrived to their destination, the [Sky Plant](/wiki/Sky_Plant) which will lead them to Vegetable Sky. The two then begin their dangerous and harsh trek up the giant plant which caused Komatsu a great deal of fear. Along the way they encountered a flock of harmless [Pseudo-Rubandas](/wiki/Pseudo-Rubanda), a few mishaps and a large [Gegon](/wiki/Gegon) which they cooked and ate during their first night camping on Sky Plant. The next day, they continued their long journey upward all the while resisting some harsh winds, dehydration, reduced oxygen levels, a [Rat Dragon](/wiki/Rat_Dragon) and harsh rainfalls. As night finally came, they set up camp once more and enjoyed the astonishing view of the stars from their altitude at 3,000 meters, Toriko then recalls Ichiryu's words on how he must adapt to unexpected climates, otherwise he will not be able to enter the Gourmet World, Toriko then resolves to conquer the environment of Sky Plant. The following day Toriko and Komatsu set off once more, this time with Komatsu riding on his back who has been weakened due to the lack of oxygen. Soon after setting out they encounter a group of [Air Gorillas](/wiki/Air_Gorilla) who try to attack the two but soon the beasts themselves are devoured by [Wicked Beanstalks](/wiki/Wicked_Beanstalk) who then try to attack Toriko and Komatsu, forcing the two to makes some quick evasive maneuvers but soon they are thrown off the Sky Plant by one of the beasts, luckily Toriko uses the special \"gliding\" feature of his Flying Squirrel Suit to try and ride the windy updraft back to safety but this soon fails when they are attacked by a flock of [Drill Birds](/wiki/Drill_Bird) who tear through Toriko's suit, forcing him to take them out with his \"Flying Knife\". After some struggle, they are able to grab on to a leaf and get back on the Sky Plant, but before they can proceed upwards, they see that a giant \"monster cloud\" is being formed, creating very dangerous [Cumulonimbus Clouds](/wiki/Cumulonimbus_Clouds) that now stand between them and Vegetable Sky. The two then prepare themselves and begin their entry into the cloud where they are hit by a powerful downburst of cold air that almost freezes them, but are able to stave it off thanks to Toriko's \"Shivering\". Toriko then begins to move forward but the storm oddly enough stops much to their surprise but the moment of calm comes to end as a huge onslaught of giant hail begins to fall nearly crushing the two, but Toriko is able to fight them off using his \"Knife\" and some quick evasive moves. Komatsu then tries to convince Toriko to turn back, but Toriko puts Komatsu at ease with some encouraging words and tells him to believe in his strength. The two then begin to move forward once more, this time trying to survive against a fierce storm of lightning as they enter the fearsome cloud itself where the lightning and wind is even more unpredictable and dangerous, flinging the two around making them barely able to move. As Toriko begins to lose consciousness he realizes that the strap holding Komatsu to him has broken but then notices that Komatsu is still clinging and claims that he still has faith in Toriko's strength. Toriko then regains his focus and creates a method to properly breath in the terribly cold environment. Once he regains his footing, the two see a bright light which turns out to be the legendary [Lightning Phoenix](/wiki/Lightning_Phoenix), Toriko realizing that its feathers make excellent lightning-resistant shields, takes one for himself and uses it to safely climb up the rest of the Sky Plant. After much hardship, the storm finally begins to calm and the top of the clouds can finally be seen which eagerly excites both Toriko and Komatsu as they run the rest of the way upward while breaking through the clouds, where they finally reach their long desired destination, [Vegetable Sky](/wiki/Vegetable_Sky) putting the two ultimately at ease at having passed all their difficult trials. The excited pair begin their exploration of the environment, noticing how ash and minerals from nearby volcanoes froze within the clouds, allowing for grass to grow and creating a sturdy land-like platform. They then finally reach the vegetable garden in the aether, with countless giant vegetables of unparalleled deliciousness growing for as far as the eye can see. They then dig into their surroundings, eating as much as they can fit in their mouths while being marveled at the amazing flavors of the heavenly vegetables. After traveling past the garden, however Toriko notices the footprint of an unknown creature which looks similarly to the feet of a [Gourmet Corp.](/wiki/Gourmet_Corp.) [GT Robo](/wiki/GT_Robo), but before he can ponder on it, Komatsu calls him to show him the cloudy fields where the [Ozone Herbs](/wiki/Ozone_Herb) grow. The two finally having reached their goal and begin peeling off one of the Ozone Herbs but it quickly evaporates before they are able to reach its pit, making them realize it is a [special preparation ingredient](/wiki/Specially_Cooked_Ingredients). After several tries, the two are still unable to succeed but Toriko convinces Komatsu to use his skill in hearing the \" [Voice of Ingredients](/wiki/Voice_of_Ingredients)\" to find out how to properly peel them. After several more tries they are finally able to reach the pit where the true Ozone Herb lies underneath all the giant blades of grass. They then bite down on it only for it evaporate into a gross black mulch. They both then realize that they have to bite it at the same time. They then manage to finally succeed after another try and become mesmerized by its nutritional taste, even causing Toriko's cells to evolve further. Toriko then takes the opportunity to ask Komatsu if he will be his chef partner and form a [combo](/wiki/Combo) with him, to which Komatsu happily agrees. Before they can celebrate however, a strange [birdman-like creature](/wiki/Nitro) appears to take a bite out of their Ozone Herb after seeing their method. The Nitro successfully manages to bite both sides of the herb at the same time without spoiling it, however it quickly spits it out in disgust and then leaps into the air and disappears. Toriko and Komatsu are shocked at the birdman's speed and power, but Toriko then realizes it is not from the Human World and hence it must be from [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World), and if an ingredient of such caliber as the Ozone Herb was unimpressive to it, then that means that ingredients of Gourmet World are beyond extraordinary, further fueling his desire to go there one day. After returning from Vegetable Sky with the Ozone Herb, Toriko and Komatsu pay a visit to the [IGO Headquarters](/wiki/IGO_Headquarters) to deliver the herb to President [Ichiryu](/wiki/Ichiryu), who is happy to see how far Toriko has progressed and that he has found a combo partner. He then gives Toriko a special [list](/wiki/Ichiryu%27s_List) detailing several ingredients which Toriko needs to capture in order to complete his training for [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World). Ichiryu then tells Toriko that he will be leaving for Gourmet World soon and tells him to follow him there when he is ready, which Toriko excitedly agrees too. The Reality of Gourmet World Arc[ ] Sometime after delivering the Ozone Herb to Ichiryu, Toriko meets up with [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny) in [Rain Town ](/wiki/Rain_Town) to talk about the [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World) and its entryways in. Sunny tells him the easiest and least obstructed route would be [Zabel Island](/wiki/Zabel_Island)'s [Waterfall Basin of Life](/wiki/Waterfall_Basin_of_Life). Toriko eagerly tells him of his plans to go into Gourmet World after hearing Sunny's detailed explanation, however Sunny makes no effort to stop him knowing Toriko's insatiable desire to enter it. Later on, Toriko travels to Zabel Island and reach the [IGO](/wiki/IGO)'s [18th Barrier](/wiki/18th_Barrier) where the Basin of Life is located. After a brief conversation with the barrier's overseer [Elboh](/wiki/Elboh), Toriko jumps down the basin only to have his skydive obstructed by a powerful air blast from a [Breath Dragon](/wiki/Breath_Dragon) that easily crushes him into the basin's stone wall. The wounded Toriko then painfully falls into the area 20,000 meters below sea level at the bottom of the basin, Gourmet World's [Underground Forest](/wiki/Underground_Forest). He is attacked by gravity far greater than what is on the surface of the Human World and is barely able to move, his situation worsens when he comes face to faces with an [Asura Tiger](/wiki/Asura_Tiger) which walks towards him in hopes of making him its next prey. Toriko attacks the beast with his Leg Knife but barely manages to cut the surface of its paw, it then retaliates by knocking Toriko near an [Air Tree](/wiki/Air_Tree) whose intense air pressure causes Toriko's breathing to falter and his eyes to gush out blood. Toriko also happened to hit a King Landler when he was flung and the angry beast attacked the newly spotted prey. Luckily Toriko was able to muster enough strength to attack it with his 15-Ren Kugi Punch and successfully knocks back its arm, however, it rises again unfazed from his attack and lunges at him again. Just then the Asura Tiger reappeared and attacked the King Landler and both began to brawl, knocking Toriko into another area with unusual heat. The source of heat above him is the intense [Heat Planet](/wiki/Heat_Planet) which quickly begins dehydrating him and increases the intense gravity of the forest even further. He attempts to break a cactus for water but spikes break out of the cactus and knock him into a foggy area, where Toriko is then bombarded by an extremely powerful waterfall from a [Fall Tree](/wiki/Fall_Tree). He rushes out of the waterfall to breathe, and is then attacked by a pack of bird-like creatures known as [Mamews](/wiki/Mamew). Before they can reach him, Knocking Master [Jiro](/wiki/Jiro) appears and uses his powerful Knocking Rifles to knock it out. Jiro then tell Toriko that Mamews always travel in groups, and will call for backup when in trouble. A flock of Mamew then appear and proceed to attack, luckily Jiro manages to incapacitate all the Mamews with his Hard Type Knocking Rifles. The Asura Tiger and King Landler then appear out of the nearby forest still in their brawl, but Jiro uses his knocking on the upper half of his body. Using Ikkaku Knocking and Intimidation together, he is able to intimidate the two and forces them to flee. Toriko and Jiro then settle down and talk. Jiro then kindly scolds Toriko for his impatience and tells him to always keep his guard up, for if he lets it down for even a fraction of a second he will die in Gourmet World. Jiro then explains that he was a lot like Toriko, attempting to do it all alone, but it didn't work. Instead, he tells Toriko that he should trust in his chef partner and that next time he should bring [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu) along. In fact, the one who sent Jiro was none other that Komatsu, who was worried for Toriko. Toriko then returns to the Human World, where Komatsu holds a celebratory feast in honor of Toriko returning safely. Melk Stardust Arc[ ] Seeking the next on [Ichiryu's [Melk Stardust](/wiki/Melk_Stardust) and a Toriko and Komatsu set out to [Melk Mountain](/wiki/Melk_Mountain), where the discoverer of the ingredient, the #1 knife sharpener in the world [Melk](/wiki/Melk_the_First) lives. Upon arriving they meet a young \"man\" claiming to be Melk, Toriko knowing full well he is lying challenges \"Melk\" to a match and manages to defeat him but he soon reveals his true identity as Melk's pupil and adopted \"son\", [Melk the Second](/wiki/Melk_the_Second). After all understandings are made, Melk the Second reveals that his father had left to [Heavy Hole](/wiki/Heavy_Hole) for training, a famed canyon that goes deep underground and is known for its intense gravity levels. Toriko knowing this to be a perfect chance for training too, goes to seek Melk the First and takes Komatsu's knife along with him for good luck while Komatsu stays behind to idolize Melk the Second's amazing craftsmanship. While Komatsu was staying with Melk the Second he finds out that Melk is actually a \"she\" after dropping on her during her bath. She soon reveals her history to Komatsu and her belief that she can never match up to her father, however Komatsu tells her otherwise and the two soon grow a deep bond. Meanwhile Toriko arrives in Heavy Hole where he is ambushed by a hoard of [Balbamoths](/wiki/Balbamoth), he luckily manages to escape their pursuit and as he goes deeper the gravity begins to take its toll on his body, but soon enough his Gourmet Cells begin to adapt and allow him to produce more energy with which to cope with the intensity. He soon comes up with a method to go down the rocky walls, however Komatsu's [knife](/wiki/Komatsu%27s_Knife) falls out his pocket and he's forced to make hasty moves, luckily the knife leads him into the den of some [Ruby Crabs](/wiki/Ruby_Crab), a rare high-class ingredient which quickly restores his stamina, his meal however is cut short by the arrival of a very fearsome foe, the [Sasori Magyuu](/wiki/Sasori_Magyuu), but as it turns out it is actually the animal partner of none other than Melk the First himself who soon arrives to stop the battle between the two. Melk gives an order to the Sasori Magyu to bring a specific rock and the cow immediately takes the task. After that Melk starts to explain some things to Toriko and pointing to some rock, but his voice is so tiny that Toriko can't hear a thing. When Melk was about to leave, the Sasori Mangyu returned with a rock known as a Speaker Stone. A rock that is harvested from the vocal chords of a [Rock Condor](/wiki/Rock_Condor) and it has the effect to magnify nearby sounds many times over. With the help of it, Toriko now can hear him normally. Melk explains that even though Sasori Mangyu is a kid, it's still more stronger than Toriko right now. Since Sasori Magyu's are very intelligent, he was able to tame it and make it his guard, so that no one interferes with his job. Melk states that Toriko is just like the person Ichiryu described and Toriko says that Melk talks a lot and it's not like what he was expecting him to be, as Ichiryu described him as a shy and silent person. Melk says he usually talks a lot, but probably because of his appearance he gets ignored by the people for some reason. Toriko ask him since when he started using the Speaker Stone, Melk replies that he found it recently and is using it because it makes the Sasori Magyu move very quickly. Then Toriko shockingly realizes that Melk is not shy or silent at all, but his voice is so tiny that nobody could hear him. After that they start to talk about The Second, and Melk The First praises her that she is amazing and has sharpening skill no different than his. Melk explains that he took a request from Ichiryu, to make a knife capable of preparing the salad from Acacia's Full Course Menu, AIR and after taking on the request, he decided to retire, since in order to make the knife, he needs to spend many long months and use a large amount of Melk Stardust and that this knife will be his final work of his life. He explained all that to his daughter and entrusted the title of The Second to her. But Toriko says that she probably didn't hear anything, which surprises and shocks Melk, who realizes that all those moments of affection when she was little, were probably her trying to hear what he says. Toriko calms him down stating that she is doing a fine work and has taken the role of the second generation. After that Toriko says he came for a reason here and Melk says he knows and will show him the location of the Melk Stardust. Toriko also shows him Komatsu's knife and after looking at it, Melk stated that it has been a long time since he last a knife that made him interested in the owner and that Toriko have made quite an outstanding combo. Melk also wanted to look at the list of requests Ichiryu gave to Toriko. He saw the Mellow Cola on the list and advised Toriko to get it as fast as possible, because now is the time, when the cola is most delicious. Melk then leads Toriko to a large cavern with brilliant [Melk Stardust](/wiki/Melk_Stardust) which shined like gold. Toriko then collected all the stardust he needed and traveled back to [Melk's Workshop](/wiki/Melk%27s_Workshop) to give the good news to [Melk the Second](/wiki/Melk_the_Second) and [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu). After telling Melk the news, she is relieved to hear her father is well and that he truly did choose her to be his successor. After seeing the Melk Stardust, all became enamored by its taste, and this inspired Melk to use the stardust to repair Komatsu's knife by using a piece of the fang of the long extinct [Derous](/wiki/Derous). Toriko and Komatsu then go outside to enjoy the hot spring bath and Toriko takes the opportunity to tease Komatsu about his \"relationship\" with Melk the Second, much to his embarrassment. Meanwhile, Melk the Second is able to reforge the knife thanks to the stardust's unique properties, and is able to merge it with the Derous fang, turning it into a whole new blade with amazing sharpness, the [Derous Knife](/wiki/Derous_Knife). After swinging it only a little, she sends out a powerful slash that slices up part of her house and the mountain, and nearly cuts Toriko and Komatsu who both immediately become excited at the sight of the amazing knife. With their task complete, Toriko and Komatsu set off back home the following day. Mellow Cola Arc[ ] The next item on the training list from the IGO President was the Mellow Cola. Shortly after the events of obtaining the Melk Stardust, Komatsu and Toriko find themselves aboard the Deluxe Carriage, a special cruise liner sized carriage towed by level 64 [Giga Horses](/wiki/Giga_Horse). Sunny and Coco are also aboard the Carriage with the intention to get off at various points on missions related to the two getting ready for the Gourmet World, while Toriko and Komatsu mean to get off when the Carriage arrives at the Entrance to Hell (AKA the entrance to the Honey Prison) , Sunny and Coco emphatically decline Toriko's request for them to join him and Komatsu in picking up Zebra who was imprisoned at the Honey Prison at the time. When Toriko and Komatsu pass trough the gates , Zebra trough his specialized voice technique acknowledges Toriko's arrival to the confusion of Komatsu , who does not hear anything. Komatsu with Toriko dragging many animal carcasses (as an intended gift for Zebra's feast) , finally arrive at the Honey Prison where they are welcomed by the monstrous Assistant Warden [Ohban](/wiki/Ohban), who explains that the Honey Prison is one of 3 maximum security \"Gourmet Prisons\" , with the other two being the Sky Prison and the Prison Submarine. Ohban explains to them the inner workings of the Honey prison and is finally introduced to Warden Love, warden love is a short woman dressed like a bee, who is able to control the prison and its powerful execution beasts through the use of highly effective pheromones which are even able to fool Komatsu and Toriko. They are finally led to Zebra's cell where he showcases his strength by easily overpowering the 4 execution beasts bound to his limbs. Warden Love who happens to be infatuated by Zebra (who seems to be immune to her pheromones) is reluctant to see Zebra released but since the order came from the President himself she was compelled to release him , although under the conditions that Zebra capture 500 wanted criminals and discover 100 new food ingredients during his release, during the meal to celebrate his release a level 70 magma tortoise along with creatures of at least level 60 are acting unruly outside of the Honey Prison and seeing that as the creatures getting \"cocky\" Zebra showcases the power that Toriko acknowledges as the greatest of the Four Kings by unleashes the Thunder Noise and the and the Voice Missile that eradicates the creatures, and Toriko reveals to Komatsu that Zebra is responsible for the extinction of 26 species and is rated as a first class dangerous creature. Shortly after the World is in an uproar in reaction to Zebra's release as many news and economy networks predict his movement and effect on food supplies and the economy. Once Zebra is released, Toriko, Komatsu and Zebra head towards the Gourmet Pyramid, which is the location of the Mellow Cola. Zebra, Toriko and Komatsu then travel on a Lift House across the Valley of Dust Clouds to get to Sand Gardens. As they travel, Toriko sews up Zebra's ripped left cheek as a form of camoflague, but just as he finishes, Zebra rips it by opening his mouth after hearing that a meal is ready. This causes Toriko to get annoyed, and they start fighting, another out of many they've had on the 1 month long trip. When the Bishokuya sit down to eat, they compliment each other on their growth. Zebra then turns his attention to Komatsu, and advises the Chef to treat him as an environment, since if an environment isn't maintained, creatures around it start to die, scaring Komatsu. Zebra is then annoyed as Toriko told Komatsu that he doesn't need to treat the Problem Child that way. When they finally reach the Sand Gardens, Zebra finds a local, who begs Zebra to spare his life, which the Bishokuya complies on the condition that he is treated to some delicious cuisine, seperating Zebra from the Combo. They eventually reach a sand villiage and Toriko witnesses Zebra killing a large 8-tailed Scorpion saving the people of the town (though he only did it cause the creature was cocky). He then reveals to Komatsu that Zebra killed all those creatures in the past also cause they were dangerous and a threat to the environment. With that they saddle up their camels and head for the location of the Mellow Cola, the Gourmet Pyramid. When the old lady who rents them the camels heard of their intended destination, she warns against it, saying that the place is nick-named the Bishokuya Graveyard. While Toriko and Komatsu were riding a Water Storage Camel, Zebra got a Wine Camel, which the Problem Child states is because he's an adult, though the Glutton refutes this, saying that Zebra gets easily drunk and then tends to go on a rampage. As they travel, a school of Desert Sharks attempt to attack the party, but was chased of by Zebra's Weak Point Voice, once he learnt that they weren't edible. They endure some minor difficulties in their travels, but eventually they reach the 'Red Maze of Sand', also known as the Desert Labyrinth, to which Toriko says is due to oxidized iron in the sand, though, Zebra also adds that blood from various beasts have mixed into the sand and looks like he is enjoying himself. Soon after they enter the maze, Komatsu disappears, the camels collapses and falls into quicksand, and the two remaining Bishokuya are surrounded by a bizzare mirage. Zebra confirms that Komatsu was taken by a mirage soon after entering the 'Red Maze', and agreed to find Komatsu if Toriko took care of the incoming beasts. Zebra, getting annoyed at the Desert Labyrinth for getting cocky and 'lying' to him via mirages, uses Echo Map to see the truth, and is surprised to see how far away Komatsu has gone. When Toriko asks about Komatsu, Zebra confirms his safety and that the Chef was sucked into quicksand. However Toriko was surprised that Zebra's voice was breaking, meaning that the Problem Child was exerting his voice to the maximum range of approxtimately 70km. Toriko expresses his worry for his Combo, and requests that they go after Komatsu, to which Zebra says that he'll send Roar Bullets to chase of any beasts trying to attack Komatsu, and questions whether the Chef has really adapted to the Glutton. They then go after Komatsu, with Zebra guiding, who advises Toriko to stay close and follow him through the mirages. They start to slow their pace due to the intense heat, and the two Bishokuya start teasing each other, claiming the other to be suffering from the environment. Soon a Sand Flower Fish bursts out of the desert, which Zebra requests that Toriko captures. After eating the meat, Zebra's Gourmet Cells evolved to handle the intense desert heat. When Toriko asks how Zebra is coping to the environment, the Problem Child responds that it is the environment that needs to cope with him. When Toriko says that if Komatsu is still alive, the Chef is really lucky, Zebra acknowledges this by saying that Komatsu's 'luck' may be the real deal, since chasing him has lead them to their ultimate destination, the Gourmaet Pyramid. As Zebra scans the structure using Echolocation, he is shocked at the size of it, for what they see is actually the tip of an immense castle, with the tip alone being approwtimately 500m in height. Zebra informs that Komatsu is already within the pyramid, and that even though he has taken precautions, there were many mysterious things in the structure. When Toriko asks about how cooperative Zebra was on this trip, the Problem Child responds with an evil grin that it will be a problem if something were to happen to Komatsu, who was the reward for this capture. Zebra then guides Toriko downstairs, saying that most people who make it this far make the mistake of going up instead of down. Unfortunately though Zebra lost track of Komatsu's voice as they started descending. Just as they started, they encountered an unfortunate Gorgops, which ended up as the Bishokuya's meal. However, soon after entering an open space, Zebra started to show signs of fatigue, as he has been continuously been using Echo Map for five hours, consuming alot of calories. The open space then started to shift to reveal a Unicorn Cerberus, and though Toriko started attacking it, Zebra was the one who finished it. Zebra then wrote on his cloak with the beasts blood, revealing that he closed his map and lost track of Komatsu. After eating the beast and claiming that it wasn't enough for him to recover, he tells Toriko, using his own developed sign language, to tell Toriko to follow him, and then to punch a hole in a specific spot in the wall. They then descend a staircase. As the Bishokuya's descend to find Komatsu, they encounter various wild beasts along the way, like Dangoal, Tiger Fang, Mimic Bagworms and Evil Hunter, which they kill and eat, steadily recovering their energy, all the while rushing ahead, until finally, Zebra can properly use his voice. He then reactivates his Echo Map, but finds that Komatsu has stumbled onto a powerful beast. He tries to Intimidate it using a Roar Bullet, but fails. Realizing how powerful the beast is, he cancels the map, informs Toriko that they're taking a shortcut, and destroys the floor using Sound Bazooka. The Bishokuya fall upon Komatsu's location much to the Chef's joy. Realizing that something has broken through the Sound Armor he put around Komatsu, he assumes it's the beast in front of him, the master of the Pyramid, the Salamander Sphinx. Zebra and Toriko prepare to battle the Salamander Sphinx for its Mellow Cola. Zebra starts attacking it, starting of by firing an attack upwards, followed by a Voice Missile directly at the beast, and then a Voice Cutter at it's belly. Zebra then thought it was defeated after the Thunder Noise descended, so was shocked to see it seemed unaffected, and instead attacked the Bishokuya with it's tongue. Zebra tried to defend using Sound Wall, but was surprised when the beasts tongue curved around it. Toriko managed to push Zebra aside, and revealed that, according to the information he received from Melk the First, the Mellow Cola, matures within this beast, and confirms it with his nose, much to Zebra's surprise. The Salamander Sphinx then goes on the attack, and with a simple wave of its paw created several powerful slashes. Zebra finds this amusing, and with that the two Bishokuya engage the beast. Zebra attacking the Salamander Sphinx with his Machine Gun Voice with little effect. Zebra used Machine Gun Voice, but the Sphinx merely shook it off. Toriko follows with a Flying Fork, which the Sphinx catches with it's teeth, and then a Leg Knife, which the beast avoided, displaying its incredible speed. Seeing that the attacks won't hit unless they are at the speed of sound, Zebra uses Single Slash Voice Cutterto cut the Sphinx's shoulder, and taking a mouthful of its blood, believing it to be the cola. However he spits it out, realizing that it isn't the case, and both he and Toriko are pushed back by the beast's assault. When he questions Toriko about the cola, the Glutton says that he heard it matured inside the beast, but he never said it was the blood, causing Zebra to think that it was the beasts urine. Komatsu then reveals that the cola is the Sphinx's tears. When they ask how he knows this, Komatsu reveals an ancient cook book he found, and when Zebra questions whether he can actually read the ancient writing, the Chef completely denies it. He goes onto say that he has read hundreds of cooking books, and by observing the pictures, and the length of the lines, he can somehow guess the preparation for getting the Mellow Cola. With that, the Bishokuya entrust Komatsu with directing them, as they attack the Sphinx. Though at first Komatsu seems hesitant, Zebra tells the Chef to pull it together, giving him new found resolve. Komatsu's first order is to evenly beat every inch of the beast, which Zebra did using Sound Bazooka. They then had to hit the Sphinx in the solar plexus, which Toriko did with a 10-Hit Nail Punch, while Zebra covered him with Sound Wall. When the beast went on a rampage again, Komatsu wavered, but regained his focus with the Bishokuya's encouragement. When they had to slice of the scales of it's back, Zebra distracted it while Toriko cut the scales with Leg Knife. This was followed by Zebra having to cut at the back of the beasts leg, clockwise from its right fore leg. They then had to pull a feather from each of its wings at the same time. Komatsu guided the two Kings through each stage until the last step, which was to tenderize the Sphinxs snake tail. Putting all their remaining power into it they pummel the tail, Toriko with his 15-Hit Nail Punch, and Zebra with his Voice Missile. They then turn to see the beast start tearing. However, at their jubilance to see the Salamander Sphinx releasing its cola, they let down their guard, allowing a mysterious Birdman creature to attack Komatsu with a fatal blow, and knock the two exhausted Bishokuya away easily and consumes the cola. However, after seeing the fallen Komatsu, and remembering their conversation about the Problem Child's condition, together with the fact that the new threat stole the Mellow Cola, gave Zebra new energy in the form of intense rage, Toriko also stands up using Autophagy, and together the two Kings attack the creature, Zebra with Meteor Noise, Toriko using a 17-Hit Nail Punch. The creature first went for Toriko but was blown away by the Nail Punch, and then hit by Zebra's attack. Zebra then grabs the Birdman by its head, and hit it at point-black with several Voice Missiles. However it managed to get away with a weak imitation of Toriko's Nail Punch. It was then that Zebra realised that he has seen a child version of this creature being held in Honey Prison. Toriko, knowing that both their power ups will only last a short time, proposes that they use joint attacks, though Zebra seems reluctant. Toriko then lets loose a barrage of Rapid Flying Forks, which the creature dodges, managing to get close and hitting Toriko. However that puts him in position for Zebra's Machine Gun Voice, leaving it open for Toriko's Leg Fork and Leg Knife, though it managed to dodge Toriko's 17-Hit Nail Punch. It got into position to get hit by the Meteor Noise that Zebra prepared at the beginning but managed to dodge that as well. Toriko then silently communicates with Zebra, asking him to combine their attacks, and after glancing at Komatsu and remembering their promise, launches his voice at Toriko. He uses Sound Wall to prevent the creature from escaping the attack, as Toriko uses the propulsion of Zebra's voice to perform 17-Hit Speed of Sound Nail Punch. The Bishokuya were slightly startled when the creature was still alive after that attack, however Zebra could tell it was dieing, and as 'thanks' for giving them such a 'fun' battle, ends its life with Death Noise. They briefly talk about the creature, when Zebra heard a heart beat. At first they thought it was the Birdman, before they realize that Komatsu is still alive. Zebra reveals he wrapped a stronger Sound Armor around Komatsu after the first one was destroyed, and thought that the creature broke through it. After Komatsu thanks Zebra, he suddenly asks about the cola, causing the Bishokuya to realize their fatigue. Toriko apologizes to Komatsu, saying that the creature drank it, and when the Chef asks where the Salamander Sphinx is now, Zebra pointed it out. Komatsu then revealed that it is not done, that what came out earlier was the oxidized scum, and that the true Mellow Cola is 10 to a 100 times more than that. As the Bishokuya turn to face the the Salamander Sphinx, it burst into tears, revealing the true Mellow Cola. Zebra then tells the shocked Toriko about the conditions he and Komatsu had for the Problem Child's cooperation on this trip. When Zebra asks what Komatsu thought about his Full Course, Komatsu reluctantly had to say that he couldn't make a decision with only one position filled starting an argument between Zebra nad Toriko about their Full Courses. Komatsu then states that he agreed to this condition because he believed that there is no way that Toriko's Full Course would lose to anybody else. Seeing the amount of trust the Chef has for Toriko, Zebra agrees, and states that he'll make a Full Course Menu that will amaze Komatsu, and in return, Komatsu has to prepare the banquet when the return home. Komatsu happily agrees, then pulls out a Gourmet Rucksack and sucks up as much of the Mellow Cola as he can. When Toriko asks Zebra to open his Echo Map for the way out, Zebra indicates that he can't do it since his throat is sore. Toriko then decides to guide the way by following their scent. Toriko thanks the Salamander Sphinx for its tears, however, it gets angry and chases them away, though Zebra seems to want to stay and fight it for getting cocky. When they reached the outside, Zebra's voice returned, and he protected Komatsu with a Mellow Cola enhanced Sound Armor. As they traveled back through the Sand Gardens, they picked up samples of desserts on the way, like Black Sugar Desert and Rice Desert. When they got back, Toriko wanted to give the old lady who rented them the camels some Mellow Cola as thanks, though ended up fighting Zebra who didn't want to share. When they eventually got back, Zebra and Toriko were invited to Hotel Gourmet for the promised celebratory banquet, though it caused a massive ruckus with the guests. When Komatsu greeted them, Zebra suddenly told the chef not to get cocky. Startled, Komatsu wondered what he did that was cocky, when Toriko revealed that Zebra was actually embarrassed since he became a fan of Komatsu's cooking after the banquet at Honey Prison. Zebra, overhearing this, suddenly attacked Toriko for saying too much. After having a toast with Mellow Cola, the two Heavenly Kings eat their feast of Komatsu's cooking, which eventually had the staff buying food from other hotels. With the meal done, Komatsu came out of the kitchen and asked how their meal was, though Zebra wanted to know why Komatsu didn't prepare the Birdman. As Komatsu starts to explain that he didn't think that it could be cooked, three people make their appearance. Chief Mansam and Chief Rei of the IGO send Rapp to get the creature, but Zebra gets in the large mans way, threatening for trying to take his 'prey'. Mansam warns against it, saying that Rapp is part of 0th Biotopes staff. Mansam explains about the 0th Biotope, located in the Gourmet World, and it's staff. When Zebra hears that the Saiseiya Yosaku was part of it, and that Rapp has strength comparable to him, the Problem Child gets even more interested in fighting him. However, Rapp asks not to, saying that he might not get away unharmed. Zebra is impressed by his honesty, and turns his attention to Mansam who he knew was lying about the creature. After confirming with Zebra that no one can hear their conversation, Mansam, Rei and Rapp explain about the mysterious creature, Nitro and their recent actions, like targeting Chefs in the Human World. When Zebra said that he knew that Mansam was still hiding something, the Chief then revealed that the Gourmet Corp. were involved, and that the creature possibly held a hint to Acacia's Main Course, GOD. Toriko's Break Arc[ ] Some time after the events involving the [Mellow Cola](/wiki/Mellow_Cola), Toriko takes [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu) to [Bar Meria](/wiki/Bar_Meria) to enjoy its menu and discuss the possibility of another [Gourmet War](/wiki/Gourmet_War) starting once [GOD](/wiki/GOD) reveals itself. Toriko tells Komatsu that he plans on hastening his progress and conquering the challenges of the [Human World](/wiki/Human_World) in order to be ready for [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World) and help save the world from another Gourmet War by keeping GOD from falling into the hands of the [Gourmet Corp](/wiki/Gourmet_Corp). Just then, they hear a familiar voice coming from an unknown man sitting across from them, the man is soon recognized by Toriko and he asks what he is doing there to which he replies that he is searching for a special ingredient. The man then faces Toriko and compliments his growth and combo but then tests his abilities by attacking everything around Toriko at an inhuman speed and proclaims him to still be too slow and that he could've easily killed him 10 times in less than a second. He then states that there will come in time in which they will fight, the moment when GOD's mellow cry signals its return and [Acacia](/wiki/Acacia)'s revived Full Course is put on the line. Toriko infuriatingly accepts the man's challenge and yells out his true name, [Starjun](/wiki/Starjun). After this, Starjun takes his leave and Komatsu tearfully expresses his joy at not having been killed by Starjun and Toriko is pleased that luck was on their side that night. Their fortunate luck interests Toriko as it is something he never much believed in until recently; this encourages him to go visit the [Gourmet Temple](/wiki/Gourmet_Temple), a holy place of good fortune that also houses shrines to Acacia's Full Course Menu, in hopes of improving his [Food Luck](/wiki/Food_Luck). The following day, Toriko and Komatsu arrive at the [Gourmet Temple](/wiki/Gourmet_Temple) to pay their respects and see the holy grounds of Acacia by taking part in Acacia's Full Course Pilgrimage. After paying their respects at each of the shrines dedicated to Acacia's Full Course, they finally arrive at the main temple, where they get to see the life-size golden statue dedicated to Acacia. They then utter a small prayer to it and make their way outside where they see that the temple is starting its lucky Food Man Competition to the side this year's Food Men. The first test being who can pull out a knife from a giant cutting board made from the [Bishoku Cedar](/wiki/Bishoku_Cedar) trees. Naturally Komatsu's great Food Luck and cooking knowledge allows him to effortlessly pluck out the knife from the board. The second half of the competition then begins to see who has the lucky golden seed of the Bishoku Cedar fruits. Toriko luckily finds the seed amongst his fruits that he had purchased earlier, making him and Komatsu the year's Food Men, much to their joy. The temple keeper, [Pahpoh](/wiki/Pahpoh) is seen watching them from afar and is amazed by their great [Food Luck](/wiki/Food_Luck), he then notices Acacia's statue \"smiling\" at the two Food Men. Shining Gourami Arc[ ] After returning from his short vacation, Toriko and Komatsu meet up with [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny) to have lunch. During the meal, Toriko informs Sunny that he will need his unique abilities in capturing the next ingredient on his [list](/wiki/Ichiryu%27s_List), an ingredient that is sure to interest him, the beautiful [Shining Gourami](/wiki/Shining_Gourami). Sunny immediately becomes excited at the thought of catching such a beautiful creature and agrees to assist him. A giant [Mother Snake](/wiki/Mother_Snake) then appears and Sunny introduces her as his new [Animal Partner](/wiki/Animal_Partner), who he has named [Quinn](/wiki/Quinn). The trio then jump onto Quinn's head and she dashes off at remarkable speeds, much to Toriko's amazement. In no time at all they are able to reach the [Mors Mountain Range](/wiki/Mors_Mountain_Range), the location of the [Death Falls](/wiki/Death_Falls) where the Shining Gourami resides. After getting over the sight of the deadly waterfall and the creatures it holds, the trio leap off of Quinn and ride Sunny's Hair Raft to get up close with the falls and reach the caverns behind it where the Shining Gourami resides. Toriko then uses his powerful Leg Knife to cut most of the oncoming water in two which proves quickly ineffective, forcing him to release a 18-Hit Kugi Punch which unfortunately also proves ineffective. Sunny then uses his new and improved Supper Spatula technique to deflect most of the deadly water in a massive blast, leaving Toriko quite impressed. This encourages him to use his new 36-Hit Twin Kugi Punch which pushes the water away even further with an equally impressive blast. Before they are able to move forward however, a gigantic mountain begins to fall down the massive waterfall, leaving the trio horrified at the sight. Toriko performs a Leg Knife on it which proves ineffective. Toriko then comes up with a strategy involving his Twin Kugi Punch being deflected by Sunny's Super Spatula and rebounded with several times the force towards the oncoming mountain. They then prepare themselves and Toriko releases another 36-Hit Twin Kugi Punch at Sunny's Super Spatula which deflects it upwards with 30 times the force. Upon hitting, it easily obliterates the mountain to smithereens as the trio cheer at their victory. The explosion from the attack also open up the way past the waterfall and into the caverns which they quickly dash towards before the rubble from the mountain crushes them. Upon entering, they appear to be caved in and Komatsu is forced to go alone further into the cave to capture the Shining Gourami while Toriko and Sunny recover their stamina. Eventually Komatsu returns with a [Gourmet Case](/wiki/Gourmet_Case) full of [Shining Gourami](/wiki/Shining_Gourami) much to their amazement, and [Quinn](/wiki/Quinn) then appears from the wall of boulders, having found a way for them to escape through the rubble's openings. After finally escaping, the group sits down atop Quinn's head and prepare to deep fry the Shining Gouramis in [Mors Oil](/wiki/Mors_Oil), turning it into a delicious tempura whose flavor is further increased by the addition of [Melk Stardust](/wiki/Melk_Stardust), leaving Toriko and Komatsu enthralled by its taste and Sunny by it having evolved his [Gourmet Cells](/wiki/Gourmet_Cells) and bringing beauty to his skin. Both then continue to celebrate and enjoy their spoils. Elsewhere in the distance, the trio is observed by a [mysterious figure](/wiki/Chin_Chinchin) who is impressed with their great accomplishment. Autumn Break Arc (Filler)[ ] Toriko, travelling with [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu), ventures to find the rare [Supear](/wiki/Supear), an ingredient that grows in the Gourmet World but ended up also growing in the Human World, on [Autumn Mountain](/wiki/Autumn_Mountain), a forested mountain range of 20,000 kilometers, longer than even the Mors Mountain Range. While they go deep into the forest, they encounter [Terry](/wiki/Terry) and [Yun](/wiki/Yun). While they continue on their path, they encounter different flora and fauna which attack (albeit only as a prank). They then find [Coco](/wiki/Coco), [Kiss](/wiki/Kiss), [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny) and [Quinn](/wiki/Quinn) also trying to find the Supear, which shows that the ingredient must be a delicious one, because it is highly sought after by three of the Four Heavenly Kings. As they split up, Komatsu and Toriko encounters some [Mutton Boars](/wiki/Mutton_Boar). Komatsu gets snatched up by one and carried away. Toriko chases after them on Terry, whose speed has increased exponentially. As they chase the Mutton Boars up the mountain, Toriko discovers that the Mutton Boars and Komatsu have disappeared from sight completely. After Toriko explains the situation to Coco and Sunny, Terry detects the scent of the boars higher in the mountains. Toriko tries to climb up the mountain, but gets blown back by the strong winds blowing down the mountain. With Kiss and Quinn's help, Terry and Toriko successfully climb up the mountain, but they find the Mutton Boars incredibly weak. Coco detects their weak electromagnetic waves and deduces that they are starving, even with all these autumn ingredients growing. They realise as the ingredients grow more delicious, so do the monsters that eat off these ingredients, leaving no room for the boars to gain more food for themselves and their off-spring. However, Terry detects another scent again and finds the Supears growing quietly on a tall tree further in the mountain. They then capture the rare fruits and share it with the Mutton Boars. At the end, as Toriko reminisces about his childhood with the other Kings and Ichiryu, he asks Coco and Sunny if they want to try to capture Ichiryu's Full Course again. Meteor Garlic Arc[ ] The next item on Ichiryu's list is the [Meteor Garlic](/wiki/Meteor_Garlic). Toriko and Komatsu set out to acquire it, with the assistance of Coco, knowing his fortune telling skills are needed. And with that, Toriko, Coco, and Komatsu set off to the [Jidar Kingdom](/wiki/Jidar_Kingdom) in hopes of obtaining the Meteor Garlic from the world famous [Gourmet Casino](/wiki/Gourmet_Casino). [[4]](#cite_note-4) They arrive and eventually are reacquainted with Match, who accompanies them into the Gourmet Casino. Match informs them that in order to find the location of the Meteor Garlic, they will need to talk to the boss of the Underground Cooking World and the owner of Gourmet Casino, [Livebearer](/wiki/Livebearer). Komatsu reveals he knows his name, mentioning he is also one of the top 100 chefs in the world, holding the 17th spot on the IGO Chef Ranking making him one of the top 20 greatest chefs in the world. However, in order to meet Livebearer, Match informs them they will need to win at the Gourmet Casino for ingredients rather than money. [[5]](#cite_note-5) With Coco's help, they are able to win the Gourmet slot machines and meet Livebearer. He subsequently approaches Toriko's entourage upon its entry into the VIP area, inviting them to an area \"Beyond the VIP area.\" [[6]](#cite_note-6) He proceeds to explain that what is wagered in the premises is not ingredients, but rather, memories of ingredients that people had consumed. Such a venue allows extinct ingredients to be exchanged in the form of data directly implanted into gamblers' minds, albeit at the risk of losing their own. He verifies the existence of the Meteor Garlic as a prize, albeit stored in his memory, and challenges Toriko and Coco to [Food Concentration](/wiki/Food_Concentration), wagering their memories in exchange for the prize, an offer which Toriko quickly takes up. [[7]](#cite_note-7) During the game, it is revealed that the secret to Livebearer's winning streak is special [Trick Contact Lenses](/wiki/Trick_Contact_Lenses) that are used in conjunction with the Gourmet Casino's [Gourmet Tasting Cards](/wiki/Gourmet_Tasting_Card) to enable the user to see in detail the flip side of the cards used in the game, hence granting him knowledge of all the ingredients and their point values. This allows him to pick and eat the ingredients with the highest point values, contributing to a huge point difference between himself and Toriko's team. Nontheless, with Coco's synaesthesia and Toriko's glutton-like stomach, the duo make a powerful team against Livebearer. As the game progresses, Livebearer becomes even more confident and reveals his true colors, gloating loudly when Toriko becomes heavily injured after eating the [Nitro Cherry](/wiki/Nitro_Cherry), giving up on the [Hannya Panda](/wiki/Hannya_Panda) because he believes that he will win, and finally revealing that he knows how to capture and eat every single ingredient in the Gourmet Casino. However, he fails to realize that Coco is setting him up to eat ingredients that would be deadly when paired with the final ingredient that he has to eat, the [Poison Potato](/wiki/Poison_Potato). Before his turn to eat the Poison Potato, Coco and Komatsu reveal their eating plan with each ingredient and how it greatly benefits them compared to Livebearer's own reckless eating order. [[8]](#cite_note-8) Despite learning of Coco and Komatsu's strategy, Livebearer still refuses to accept the events that occurred and how they took advantage of each ingredients nutritional value to counteract and recover from eating the Nitro Cherry, as well as to increase the lethality of the Poison Potato back to its highest potency. At first he believes that it makes no difference, since he took precautions and coated his entire digestive system with a biodegradable plastic as well as cut off his sense of pain, but before he declares his intention to eat, Coco reveals that he already knew about the coating and that when Livebearer copied Toriko eating Cheese Chinese Cabbage, he made the fatal mistake of allowing the microbes from the vegetable break down the coating and render it useless. After declaring his second give up, Livebearer decides to just forget about the game and have his entire society take what he wants by force. He then fights against Coco, but is quickly defeated by his Poison Knocking, and Coco says that he might have had a better chance if he tried his luck at the game instead. Toriko eats the Poison Potato that Komatsu prepared, which evolves his Gourmet Cells. He then walks up to Livebearer and says that despite being asked to form a combo together, he had already found a partner and the best possible combo. [[9]](#cite_note-9) While still weak from the Knocking, Livebearer takes them to see the Meteor Garlic, sending Toriko, Coco, and Match to be seated for the meal. While watching Komatsu to prepare the garlic, he is shocked to see the young chef go so far into preparation for such a difficult ingredient, but notices the Knocking wearing off. Once they consume the Meteor Garlic, Toriko and the others gain a much more muscular physical appearance. After Livebearer has a change of heart, he explains to the group about a man who is able to remove the poison from the Poison Potato perfectly and has information about the ingredient, ATOM. He tells them that the man's name is Joie, the personal chef to the King of the Jidar Kingdom. [[10]](#cite_note-10) They go to visit him and [Darnil Kahn](/wiki/Darnil_Kahn), but they find no one. [[11]](#cite_note-11) Bubble Fruit Arc[ ] Toriko and Komatsu make a Fortune Role to lead them to the Bubble Fruits, After a encounter with Gourmet National Treasure Chin Chinchin who takes them to Shokurin Temple Toriko is seen along with Komatsu learning Food Honor. After Toriko and Komatsu completed their Ehou Maki to locate Shokurin Temple, the home of the fabled Bubble Fruit, they followed it to the Lost Forest where they discovered that the final part of their Ehou Maki had been scooped from the ground along with the surrounding terrain, leaving them lost. Luckily they stumbled upon the elusive restaurant Disappearing Cuisine where they met none other than master [Chin Chinchin](/wiki/Chin_Chinchin), who agreed to take them to Shokurin Temple for their training. Upon arriving they saw no trace of the temple in sight. Chin explained that the temple, much like Disappearing Cuisine is made out of Ongyoujyu Tree wood, which allows it to conceal its presence from those it does not consider worthy. In order for it to appear, one must show absolute gratitude and humbleness to it. Toriko and Komatsu comply and upon showing their manners, the temple reveals itself thus allowing them to proceed. Once inside, Chin gives them info about the temple and also reveals that it was he who sent that mountain at them in Death Falls to test their strength and resolve. He then assigns one of the temple's assistant masters, Shuu to be Toriko and Komatsu's instructor in the art of Food Honor and when they're ready he will reveal to them how to acquire the Bubble Fruit. When Shuu decides to show Toriko the power of Food Honor, they engage in a brief fight with Shuu easily dodging all of Toriko's attacks and using only a small blade on Toriko which does no damage but easily cuts his clothes to pieces. Seeing this, Toriko takes the training seriously. After much harsh yet empowering training, Toriko and Komatsu mastered the minimal requirements of master-level Food Honor and with their task complete Chin escorts Toriko to the entrance of the long and arduous Bubble Way where the true Bubble Fruit lies and both set off on their journey. After much time which Toriko felt was like weeks or months, he began to loose much stamina and nutrients and questioned how Chin remained so healthy. He explains that he mastered the art of Food Immersion which has allowed him to store up countless nutrients within his body and that if Toriko should master this test he might be able to do it as well. After traveling for so long Toriko ends up using his Autophagy to keep himself going, but even that isn't enough for him to last. However soon enough Toriko begins to die from fatigue and gives his last gratitude to all the food he's enjoyed in life, this causes the Bubble Fruits to finally show themselves while Chin looks on with pride at Toriko's accomplishment, he then hands a massive portion of Bubble Fruits to Toriko so he can regain his strength and life energy, Chin then heads off back to the temple as quickly as possible for he senses a powerful force heading their way. While Chin rushes back to the temple to save his people from the Gourmet Corp., Toriko gathers many Bubble Fruits and regains his stamina. He takes several of them back with him for Komatsu and arrives in time to fight against the Golem of the Gourmet Corp. Though seeing all of the injured all around him, Toriko, having learned about Food Honor can't help but express his thanks to even his anger. And with that, he uses a normal Kugi Punch on the Golem and it easily kills it. Just then, Chin emerges from his battle with Chiyo and is left defeated. Toriko then fights off Chiyo to save his master, but before it can escilate further, Starjun (in a GT robot) arrives and comes to pick his combo partner, Ootake, up from his fight with Komatsu. Afterwards, though Komatsu was saddened at Ootake's choice in life, Toriko reasured him they will save him and meet them both again in the future. He then listened to Chin about Chiyo's reason for joining the Gourmet Corp. was to gain an ingredient from Acacia's Full Course. Golden Wheat Arc (Filler)[ ] Toriko and Komatsu are sent on an important request by Setsuno to capture the [Golden Wheat](/wiki/Golden_Wheat), a necessary ingredient to create the [Zenmen](/wiki/Zenmen), the phantasmal noodles created by Setsuno. A [GT Robo](/wiki/GT_Robo) that the [Gourmet Corp.](/wiki/Gourmet_Corp.) Branch Chief Yuu operates arrives at the scene and shoots the surroundings with its beam. Toriko attacks the GT Robo but they are held at a stalemate due to the both of them holding back. Toriko mentions to Yuu that he is not even serious due to holding back as Komatsu is still in the vicinity and if they clashed seriously, all of the Golden Wheat may be destroyed. After overpowering the robot and as Yuu escapes, Toriko returns to Gourmet Town successfully delivering the requested ingredient. Setsuno gives Komatsu advice on how to prepare the Golden Wheat, a super [Special Preparation Ingredient](/wiki/Special_Preparation_Ingredient). As Komatsu begins sale of the Zenmen, Toriko trys out every single noodle Komatsu created. Meanwhile, the Four Beast begins to awaken and attack Human World. Four Beasts Arc[ ] After returning back to [Gourmet Town](/wiki/Gourmet_Town), Toriko discovers it entirely empty, desolate of all human life. The reason being that a week earlier news of the awakening of the [four beasts](/wiki/Four_Beasts) had been spread around the world and panic ran through the hearts of the majority of the human race. Every country relatively close to the gourmet world (The Edge of the human world.) was placed in a above level 5 state of emergency (Worse than that of Zebra's release.) and told to evacuate and seek shelter in the center of the human world; there was a great migration of over 30 billion people. With most of the Human world gathered at Food Park Plaza at the center of the human world. Fear and panic run rampant throughout the crowd of 800 million; they fear that the end is near. Their voices are quickly silenced when Mansom appears on the large broadcasting screen, the people howl with excitement and hope as they now believe that the IGO president Ichiryu will rise to fight the four beasts as he did before but are surprised when Mansom tells them that instead of Ichiryu it will be the four heavenly kings that will take on the beasts. Menwhile Komatsu and Rin riding on Terry's back rushed toward the Gourmet towers with a case of now peeled bubble fruit. At the top floor of the Gourmet Knife Tower the \"Over Look Floor\" all four heavenly kings are gathered at a table eating together. Toriko, Sani and Coco begin to talk about amongst themselves about failure and victory they each pitch in their own thoughts and turn to ask Zebra his thoughts he in turn replies \"Who the fuck cares\". The conversation is disturbed as [Yuda](/wiki/Yuda) the owner chef of the towers and \"Trey King\" of the gourmet age (one who does not leave a single millimeter of disorder on his plate) arrives with several platters of food for them. Toriko compliments him on being one of the few people to run in fear of the arrival of the Four Beasts. Yuda places the food on the table and before he could even finish a sentence explaining how his food is optimal for food immersion Zebra eats all the food to the surprise of Yuda and the frustration of Toriko who then engages in a choke fight with Zebra. They are soon interrupted by the gleeful voices of Komatsu and Rin bringing with them and bustle of cook bubble fruit and a CD containing a message form IGO president Ichiryu. Instead of watching the CD first the group decides to eat the bubble fruits first. Upon their first bite each of the four heavenly kings is infused with a rush of energy as their Gourmet Cells evolve to a new level, Yuda then comments \"It would seem that all your cells are compatible with the bubble fruit.\" The group then decides to play the CD given to them by Ichiryu. In the video Ichiryu details the plan of attack upon the four beasts stressing the importance that if any of them where to fall that it would be the end of the Human world as they knew it, that even one of the four beasts would bring the Human world to its knees. Ichiryu then begins to speak strong the boys have grown since their early youth and how proud he is of them. He then begins to start talking about two more things but is quickly cut short as Zebra turns of the TV and comments that they have heard enough and that their animal partners are waiting for them, the group moves to the terrace of the building as each of their respective Animal Partners rush up the building. Rin comments that Zebra still has not found an animal partner yet, he replies that he does not need a partner but does have transportation as a tremor can be felt in the distance. All members of the group look to see a massive Dharma Horse approaching the towers. Zebra reveals the Daruma Hermit loaned it to him. With that, Toriko heads out to confront his opponent with the other Heavenly Kings do the same. Toriko and Terry later arrive in front of one of the Four Beasts, the [Gaoh](/wiki/Gaoh). It was greatly angered when the Battle Wolf looked away from it, and pounded the ground using a single paw with the force of a nuclear missile. It then tried to bite them whole, though all its attacks were avoided by Terry. They then got close and hit the beast with a 30-Hit Nail Punch to its stomach, which it endured. The Gaoh then slashed at them with its claws as they tried to get close to use the Measuring Tongs. Toriko shoots a Leg Knife that the Gaoh dodges. Toriko then uses his Flying Forks, which increased their numbers due to food honor. He then matches them altogether and they become Fork Cannon. Just then, the Gaoh is suddenly slashed and cut by Toriko's Leg Knife, which he could now control. Then, Toriko shoots his Fork Cannon, which is shot at the Gaoh and kills it. Though he believes that he and the others successfully killed the creatures, it was later revealed by Rin (who finished Ichyru's message after Zebra stopped it halfway) that the Four Beasts were all one creature to begin with and that the beasts they fought were its limbs. Toriko and the others rush back after realizing the creatures they beat were all traveling underground to the city. After the Four Beast arrived underground in the center of the Human World, it then extracted its \"limbs\" that were defeated by the Four Heavenly Kings to replenish its energy. The Four Beast surfaced above ground, towering over the standing crowds of shocked people. The Four Beast started its rampage in the city and started gorging up humans, until it started sensing the intimidations of the Four Heavenly Kings behind it and swiped out several skyscrapers, that were protected by Teppei's \"Protect Tree\", realizing nothing was behind it. Its limbs reach the center of the Human World and began absorbing through the roots and bulked up. It then released a large green cloud, that poured down \"Green Rain\" that could kill the Humans within one hour. It then stood in front of the Four Heavenly Kings who arrived. Knowing over 100 million people would die, Rin and Komatsu offered to stall the Green Rain as long as possible while the four kings fought the Four Beasts. The four attempt to assault it individually as its poisonous cloud rapidly fills the sky apparently spreading to every corner of the city and beyond. Despite their best efforts, they are beaten back quite easily by the monster who quickly adapts to each of their techniques, shrugging off each attack and striking back at them with even greater force. During the battle, Rin was able to get close enough to the Four Beast undetected to get a reading of its capture level, which reveals its monstrous growth. Later on, after Komatsu finished creating a method to simplify the preparation of the Purple Mochi so as to cure all those infected by the Green Rain, the Four Beast is shown hollering in victory as the Four Heavenly Kings lay defeated. As it saw them recovering, it tried to attack, but Zebra managed to dodge it with his Jet Voice. When it began its second assault, Terry, Kiss, and Quinn protected the Four Heavenly Kings, while they prepared their ultimate combo technique, the Ou Shoku Bansan that was taught to them by Ichiryu when they were younger. As the Four Beast was battling its new opponents, it remembers fighting their ancestors in the past and quickly defeated them knowing that they had dangerous potential. As Quinn was about to be ripped in half by it, it senses the Four Heavenly Kings' new attack and tried to finish them off, but realized it was too late and it could only look on in horror as their power easily overwhelmed it with fear. All the Appetite Energy they held was released in that single attack which took on the form of a fanged orb of energy that quickly devoured the powerless Four Beast, leaving not a single shred or remain of the beast behind, even its fearsome Green Rain faded with it. All its meat remained within the pure orb of energy created by the Four Heavenly Kings' appetite. They soon noticed a smaller orb next to it, which Coco and Zebra discovered that it actually contained the human victims that were swallowed alive by the Four Beast, much to everyone's excitement. The orb soon popped, releasing thousands of humans in an instant which were all safely caught by Sunny's \"Hairnet\". Just then, the orb containing the Four Beast's meat fell to the ground and released its sparkling meat everywhere. The Four Heavenly Kings and the IGO then gathered all the rich meat and prepared a great feast within the city, where they freely distributed the Four Beast's meat to all the millions of humans there and the rest of the Human World population worldwide, everyone then rejoiced over the wondrous blessing of food. Cooking Festival Arc[ ] Toriko is requested by the [IGO](/wiki/IGO) to capture [ingredients](/wiki/Ingredients) for the [Cooking Festival](/wiki/Cooking_Festival) and [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World) beast called \" [Mon Planc](/wiki/Mon_Planc)\". Toriko heads out along with [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu) to the [Baron Archipelago](/wiki/Baron_Archipelago) in order to capture the threatening Gourmet World plant. When they arrive there Toriko is attacked by a mysterious person who turns out to be [Aimaru](/wiki/Aimaru) along with [Takimaru](/wiki/Takimaru). Aimaru comments on Toriko's newfound power as they keep walking they come a cross the Mon Planc. Toriko and Aimaru confront the beast, until Toriko orders Takimaru, Komatsu and Aimaru to stay back. The Mon Planc proves to be a formidable opponent, until Toriko reveals his new technique, the [Nail Gun](/wiki/Toriko/Abilities#Battle_Techniques) and successfully defeats the Plant Beast. Toriko and the other then eat the 'Mon Planc' and leave nothing behind for the Cooking Fest. When the [Bishokuya](/wiki/Bishokuya) returns with nothing but the bur, [Johannes](/wiki/Johannes) gets furious at [combo](/wiki/Combo), until the legendary chef [Zaus](/wiki/Zaus) appears, resolving the situation. After defeating and eating the Four Beast, Toriko is shocked to hear that Chef [Komatsu](/wiki/Komatsu) has just marked in at the 88th position on the [Ranking IGO's Top 100 Chef Ranking](/wiki/IGO_Chef_Ranking) thus lending a invitation for him to enter the 50th Cooking Festival. Toriko then accompanies him to the Fest along with the other Four Heavenly Kings. He is then seen cheering for Komatsu in the audience. As Cooking Fest goes into the finals, Komatsu and Zaus begin their \"Dark Cooking Duel\" in the pitch black tent in the stadium. Komatsu begins to search for his ingredients, but he is suddenly grabbed by a mysterious figure who is none other than [Starjun](/wiki/Starjun)! He then tells the young chef he is there to collect him. Toriko and the other Heavenly Kings notice his presence is quickly noticed. The other kings use their power to guard Komatsu while Toriko rushes over to protect him. Toriko and Starjun unleash their might. However, Starjun easily overpower the king's techniques with Thermal Disinfection. As Komatsu yells for Toriko, his partner appears behind Starjun wearing an angry expression. The Sous Chef then says he's been waiting for him. As Toriko demanded Starjun to go outside to fight, he replied that they were already \"outside\" as he proceeded to destroy the tent with his Camp Fire Medium Flame. Once the tent was disintegrated, Toriko launched a barrage of attacks that took Starjun by surprise, and led him to comment on how good the attack was. To test Toriko's power, Starjun allowed him to unleash another sequence of the most powerful attacks he has shown so far (including the 50-Hit Nail Gun), causing him to be slightly wounded and his armor to break. Expressing satisfaction with his strength, he proceeded to use his ' [Intimidation](/wiki/Intimidation)' and started to fight. As their fierce battle continues Komatsu arrives just in time to see an unconscious Toriko being lifted up by Starjun. The Starjun proceeds to kidnap the chef, but is promptly punched by Toriko, who was awakened by Komatsu's cries. The tide of the battle seems to turn against him when Toriko starts the [Ultimate Routine: Conduct of the King](/wiki/Routines) to defeat him. Toriko manages to injure the Sous Chef but, as he prepares to attack him with a barrage of Flying Forks and Flying Knives, he realize that Toriko emotions have caught up to his. Starjun then unsheathes his sword, melting them all and begins to go on the offensive. Starjun then tells Toriko about his Burner Knife and slashes at him. The hunter dodges in the nick of time, while the ground at his side is melted deeply. He then attacks the Gourmet Corp. with another volley of techniques, but they are all stopped. Exploiting the light created by the Burner Knife, he moves behind Starjun, who stabs his shoulder through several layers of Fork Shields, and counterattacks with a Knife Nail Gun. With both of them wounded, Toriko looks fiercely at Starjun, whereas the latter grins. Starjun is amazed at how Toriko can continually come up with new techniques as their fight went on. Toriko imagines cutting Starjun's Burner Knife as Starjun began imagining cutting Toriko's right leg. However, as both released their attacks, Starjun's Burner Knife was broken, creating an opening for Toriko's barrage of attacks, releasing a fountain of blood from Starjun body. When Toriko stopped after realizing that his leg was cut off, Starjun revealed that it went just as he imagined it. He then attacked Toriko with his Burner Punch to his right abdomen. When Toriko attempted to use his 70 Ren Nail Gun, Starjun used his Fire Spear to destroy his arm. Stopping Toriko's kicks with his Fire Shield, Starjun \"shoots\" his Burner Shot at him, causing Toriko to fall unconscious from the assault. The battle is over with Starjun as the winner. As the outcome of the battle turns in Starjun's favor, Komatsu uses his [Derous Knife](/wiki/Derous_Knife) to attack Starjun, stating that he would be Starjun's opponent. Starjun commented that he is a reliable combo partner but uses his flames to force Komatsu back, stating that his knife was never meant to hurt others. However, this angered Toriko, which caused him to release his inner demon through the use of [Appetite Energy](/wiki/Appetite_Energy) to punch a hole through Starjun's stomach. As Starjun collapses, he notes that his wounds were critical as he would have used that Dark Technique to survive. Komatsu then surrenders to Starjun as he couldn't bear Toriko being hurt anymore. However, he asks Starjun to let him do 'one swing' to save Toriko. This shocks Starjun momentarily, wondering when Komatsu had mastered the \" [dark technique](/wiki/Revitalizing_Kitchen_Knife)\". He then tells Komatsu that he is returning to the Cooking Stadium due to the fact that \"the dark clouds were not clearing\". After Starjun kidnaps Komatsu, Toriko awakens with new limbs. These limbs were somewhat different from the other parts of his body. He then bursts into tears saddened by his lack of strength and not being able to protect Komatsu and the Human World. Some time after the events of the Cooking Festival, Toriko is seen with a new outfit staring out into space. As the worried [Rin](/wiki/Rin) peeks at him, Knocking Master [Jiro](/wiki/Jiro) approaches to talk with Toriko. Jiro sits near the distressed Toriko and offers him a cup of [Maboro Sake](/wiki/Maboro_Sake), but he implies that he has no appetite to drink at the moment. The Knocking Master then remembers Rin's words about Toriko not having eaten for days, which makes him think that Toriko's energy is incomparable to how he was before. However, when Jiro states the sake was [Ichiryu](/wiki/Ichiryu)'s favorite, Toriko accepts the offer. The two men then drink together under a starry sky. Jiro comments on the sake being cheap and not too strong either. Toriko then asks why he brought such a liquor specifically right now, making Jiro reveal the shocking truth about Ichiryu's demise in his fatal battle with the [Gourmet Corp.](/wiki/Gourmet_Corp.) Boss [Midora](/wiki/Midora). He then continues to say the President was a gentle but strong individual who purposely let others win in battles. Ichiryu was a kind and caring person even to his enemies. Toriko is bewildered with the news of the death of his adoptive father, then he walks away from the Knocking Master with a saddened face. Toriko states that Ichiryu had never let him win a battle to which Jiro responds that the President had sensed the Heavenly King's potential and wanted him to get stronger. Toriko interrupts Jiro stating that he is weak and that he can't protect a single chef, his very own combo partner The latter questions about Toriko's dream as a Bishokuya, but with no response to hear from the young hunter. Jiro then encourages Toriko by stating that despite Ichiryu is gone forever, Komatsu is still alive and that there is a bright future in front of them. He concludes by saying \"Jump off and flap your wings to the infinite, dazzling future stretching out in front of you.\" Many weeks have passed since the events at Cooking Fest, but Toriko still has no sign of hunger due to his sadness, he walks alone on a street that is full of wreckage. Suddenly, a teenager carrying a Stripe Salmon appears in front of Toriko. He states that it is his favorite fish in the world and the founder of this fish, is none other than Toriko. As more and more people who were once helped by the ingredients Toriko discovered approach, they encourage Toriko to the point where he remembers the ingredients he discovered and the people he helped, is touched by their words and sheds tears. The people who he helped say that because of him, their lives and future can be so pleasant The Heavenly King recalls his dream, about completing his Lifetime Full Course Menu, along with Komatsu so they can share it with the people of the world Toriko's stomach growls out of hunger and the crowd hears the sound, they offer the ingredients that they have to him. However, Toriko states he is a Gourmet Hunter and is able to capture his own ingredients. Once again, Toriko enters the Gourmet World, where he then throws a Flying Fork toward a [Breath Dragon](/wiki/Breath_Dragon) in his way (the same one before), defeating the beast in one blow. As he dives into Gourmet World, Toriko vows to save Komatsu and bring back food for the Human World. Billion Bird Arc[ ] After a year and half of searching, Toriko finally rescued Komatsu from the Gourmet Corp. While in the Gourmet World, Toriko was seen taking a nap in the afternoon somewhere in the [Gourmet World](/wiki/Gourmet_World). Toriko is wearing worn out clothes probably due to not changing his clothes in a long while. Toriko was able to catch an hour of sleep and he should be able to keep moving for two weeks without sleep. He finds a candy on the ground and soon a rain of candies falls. More of confectioneries rain and Toriko enjoys them. Suddenly a mountain falls from the sky. A big bird eats the mountain. It was a [Mountain-Eater Pelican](/wiki/Mountain-Eater_Pelican). Toriko decides to get one of the bird's eggs while it is away as one egg would be able to provide food to 100,000 people. Toriko notices the environment at the [Landsea](/wiki/Landsea) getting rough. He takes the egg and goes somewhere. He puts the egg in a hole in a large tree which rolls in and falls on many other ingredients hinting Toriko was collecting food. Toriko feels that he had collected enough food and says aloud that its time to head back to the [Human World](/wiki/Human_World) to Komatsu. Komatsu was happy as he had been waiting for that day for a long time. While eating Toriko remembers that he forgot to get a [Feather-Robed Mushroom Child](/wiki/Feather-Robed_Mushroom_Child). Komatsu stops and assures him that they will get it next time. Komatsu asks how they will transport all the ingredients back to the Human World. Toriko says that it will be easy if they just move their house. Toriko cuts the tree open revealing their house. Toriko finds his hair growing back instantly after he cuts it. Toriko cuts his hair as well as Komatsu's. Toriko then carries the food he collected on his back. Upon arriving, Toriko sees how much the Human World has suffered at the hands of Midora's Meteor Spice and Toriko then makes the food in the rice bowl project in the air randomly creating a rain of food. According to Toriko they were souvenirs from the Gourmet World. The rain of food washed away all of the people's sadness and filled everyone in happiness. Komatsu while walking towards the boy uses a portable stove and his [Melk Kitchen Knife](/wiki/Melk_Kitchen_Knife) to make food out of the ingredients Toriko collected from Gourmet World. Later Toriko reunited with the other Four Kings and couldn't believe that Mansam became the president. Komatsu greets [Zebra](/wiki/Zebra), [Sunny](/wiki/Sunny) and [Coco](/wiki/Coco) who were already present.Toriko understands nothing much has changed in the Human World. Just then Rin, The new IGO Gourmet Research Chief enters who is more than glad that Toriko returned after a long time. Rin states that she always believed that Toriko would come back in great shape. Toriko thanks Rin for her help in cheering him after his return. Rin couldn't keep waiting anymore and asks Toriko to marry her. Toriko instantly agrees to it creating confusion as the answer was not expected. Rin asks Toriko again to marry her. Toriko says okay to her. This makes everyone present get dumbfounded and do some intense talking as marriage is something that is not easily decided, Sunny especially given that he and Toriko will now become Brother-in-laws. Later, The [Four Heavenly Kings](/wiki/Four_Heavenly_Kings) and Komatsu then head to the [1st Biotope](/wiki/1st_Biotope). Toriko feels that he has to dom something after seeing Human World's condition. Zebra had looked everywhere in the Garden but couldn't find Ichiryu's Main Dish. The terrain's condition was enough to conclude that Zebra was searching for it. It is revealed that when all the items are brought together, they become an infinite source of Food and since each item was located in one of the 8 Biotopes, the Main Dish was supposed to be there but they could not find it even with Zebra's Echo Location. Coco's eyes couldn't find any electromagnetic waves and Sunny couldn't find anything with his Dining Kitchen. Toriko then starts searching as the food he brought from the Gourmet World will not last long. Toriko then spots a bit of original surface left and sniffs it. Toriko finds that the last beast to step of the spot was a Kucolsaurus. Sunny is amazed by this and asks him if he can still smell something. Toriko finds that before Kucolsaurus a [Rock Drum](/wiki/Rock_Drum), [Jabrasnake](/wiki/Jabrasnake), Pig Baboon, Namagorgon and other beasts passed there. Toriko then finds the scent of Ichiryu and tells the others about it. He then leads them they as he knew which way Ichiryu went much to the surprise of the others. Coco is amazed by Toriko's skills as they could not find anything and thinks if this was the result of spending time in the Gourmet World. Komatsu then reveals that Toriko did the same thing in Gourmet World using his smell as a compass to return to him everyday during the days in the Gourmet World. Coco could also feel how Komatsu had changed by living in Gourmet World. Everywhere Toriko went could have been considered as a off-limit area in the Human World and he had to find a relatively safe place he and named it a Gourmet [Restroom](/wiki/Rest_Room). A Rest Room is a place which has unique climate and in a rare ecosystem created by momentary safe spot. After Toriko found disappearing rocks and trees, he made a disappearing environment and created a comfort zone within their unseen space as it became a blind spot to surrounding beasts. According to Toriko, it was like being in an another universe in isolation but whenever the environment in Gourmet World evolved, that spot would be destroyed but in Human World it may prove otherwise. Toriko found an area of ground which was totally clean of any rubble. Toriko finds the entrance to the Rest Room that was situated there. Toriko enters it and disappears from the other's sight, Toriko then comes out and calls them in saying the treasure hunt is over. Everyone are amazed seeing a place inside the 1st Biotope. Coco finds that they can see everything from inside but he can't feel any electromagnetic waves. They find a treasure chest on the stump of a tree and see a strange looking tree house nearby and an old [Nitro](/wiki/Nitro) is sitting inside. A pretty old [Gourmet Case](/wiki/Gourmet_Case) held Ichiryu's Main Dish. Toriko notices that someone was inside the tree house but decides to leave it for that moment. Then they reach a place called \"17th cultivation court\" in the 1st Biotope. Komatsu is glad after seeing the world's top chefs with whom he competed at the [Cooking Fest](/wiki/Cooking_Fest) who were [Damala Sky XIII](/wiki/Damala_Sky_XIII), [Yuda](/wiki/Yuda), [Chiru](/wiki/Chiru), [Sumire](/wiki/Sumire) [Livebearer](/wiki/Livebearer). The chefs were also glad to see Komatsu and then Chiru asks about the other cooks who were kidnapped along with them and taken to the Gourmet Corp's. Headquarters in the Gourmet World. Komatsu doesn't say anything and then Toriko says that it was already in shambles when he arrived and no one other than Komatsu and one other person were waiting for him there. Komatsu then assures that the cooks were safe even though they were taken to some other place. To make the Human World back to how it was before, they will need the help of lots of chefs and a lot of ingredients. The chefs have gathered there because they heard the ingredients' voice. Komatsu opens the box and finds an egg. Livebearer reveals that it was the egg of the phantom bird, the [Billion Bird](/wiki/Billion_Bird)'s egg. Yuda explains that the Billion Bird is a bird which lived in the Gourmet World during ancient times whose every body part is very nutritious and the most amazing point of the bird is that its reproduction ability to give birth under any condition or environment and also self fertilize to lay infinite number of eggs. Komatsu couldn't believe when he heard this. Yuda continues saying that its life span is about thousands to hundreds of millions of years, a bird which can live hundred million years, the Billion Bird. With this bird they can fill the stomachs of every person in the world. Komatsu then grabs the egg with him body and asks everyone to huddle closely to share body heat so that the egg would hatch faster. Toriko then says that for the bird to hatch, its needs Ichiryu's full course. Toriko says that first the Appetizer, The Million Seed should be planted as the Billion Bird's Egg must be incubated on a nest made on the Million Tree and the soup Chameleon's Tears will help the Million Tree to sprout immediately and next for the nest, Ichiryu's salad Princess Straw Grain must be planted as the egg won't hatch unless its in a nest made from the straw. Toriko continues that Ichiryu's Drink Lord Roasted Mochi will fertilize the grain and the Princess Straw grows, With that they make a nest and keep it on the top of the Million Tree and place the egg on the nest and wait for it to hatch. Coco could already sense some Electromagnetic waves. Zebra could hear its heartbeat and he predicts that it will hatch in a few days. The rest of the chefs depart to ready their shops which they have closed due to lack of ingredients. While waiting, Komatsu asks Toriko that if there was such an awesome bird then why no one has ever mentioned it until then. Toriko answers that the bird tastes awful and long ago the Billion Bird who couldn't fly had many predators, developed an ability to lay countless number of eggs every time it was attacked so it wouldn't die out and since it tasted bad, nobody wanted to eat it and since it was stopped being hunted, It didn't lay eggs and became extinct. Komatsu feels sorry for the bird as it lived thousands of years and became extinct just because no one desired it. In the Gourmet Age where taste mattered the most, It couldn't be helped. Komatsu then remembered [Setsuno](/wiki/Setsuno)'s words which were \"ingredients choose the chefs\". Komatsu wonders if the Billion Bird Choose them. Komatsu then decides to stay with the egg till it hatches. Next morning on the first rays of the sun, The Billion Bird's egg hatches. A baby bird who was not really cute emerges from the egg. Komatsu calls out to everyone saying the bird hatched. Sunny finds the bird to be ugly but Komatsu finds it really cute. Toriko then feeds it Ichiryu's Fish Dish, Mitarashi Kelp and the Billion Bird instantly grows out to its adulthood. Toriko then gives Ichiryu's Dessert, Dry Melolon to Ichiryu's Meat Dish, Survival Bug's larva. The survival bug grows after eating it. The Billion Bird then eats the Survival Bug and an antenna on its head becomes longer. Now the Billion Bird was ready to lay their infinite supply of eggs and all that's left is to surprise the bird with an attack. Toriko scares the Billion Bird and it lays countless eggs at a go. The eggs hatch right away. Toriko then says aloud that it was Ichiryu's Full Course, An infinite supply of Billion Birds. Coco and Sunny feel that the Human World will be saved with this while Zebra tells that the problem is that they taste just like how they look. Komatsu and the cooks of the Human World assure that they will definitely make tasty food. Then they spread the Billion Birds across the Human World. Damala, Yuda, Chiru, Wabutora, Sumire, Livebearer, all make different dishes. The people tasted real food after a gap of a year and half. All the people were happy and though it was not the best tasting ingredient but it was lot better than the Food Tablets and people once again remembered happiness. Toriko realizes that the Human World's chefs were really something as what they made couldn't compare to what he ate from the brain data in the [Gourmet Casino](/wiki/Gourmet_Casino). Komatsu never thought that the Billion Bird would taste bad but saw it as an ultimate ingredient. Komatsu then comforts the Billion Bird as its predators from long ago didn't understand its flavor and sympathizes with the Billion Bird as it lived from thousands of years without having an eye turned towards it but people now talking about how delicious it was and thanks it for being born again into the world. Hearing all this, The Billion Bird becomes happy flaps its wings and the wings suddenly grow out to become long and beautiful. Toriko is surprised by this as he never thought of that. The Billion Bird takes off the ground and flies away. Toriko knew that the bird wasn't supposed to fly. Komatsu has never before seen wings so beautiful. Toriko remembers Ichiryu and says that his Full Course is flying after being accepted by all the people in the world. The Billion Bird is very happy and while it was flying it lays some eggs. Komatsu catches a sparkling egg and Toriko understands that the Billion Bird is a Special Preparation Ingredient. Toriko and Komatsu decide to share the food they got with their friends and the whole world. They head to the Gourmet Hotel and sit with Coco, Sunny and Zebra. Sunny couldn't believe that the Billion Bird flew with beautiful wings. Komatsu explains to the rest that the eggs they got were laid when the bird was not being attacked and they were eggs which came by appreciating and complimenting the bird for the first time in its life. Everyone break an egg and pour the contents into a wine glass. Toriko felt it like a pudding and couldn't find its yolk. Coco found that the yolk has been scattered through and gold dust was sprinkled in the egg. Toriko drinks the yolk and his hair grows out instantly. The egg was so good that Toriko couldn't resist it. The flavor has aged itself for millions of years and layered upon itself all the time making it so delicious. Sunny drinks it and his eye lashes grow out long. Coco, Zebra and Komatsu drink and their hair also grows out due to the drink. Toriko then says that the moment those eggs were laid, he decided with Komatsu. Toriko breaks another egg and fills his glass and says a toast for the ingredient as he decided it as his lifetime Drink. Just then Rin enters wanting to talk about her wedding with Toriko and is astonished at the sight. Much later, Toriko and the others are ready to enter the Gourmet World as the strongest representatives of the Human World. Before they leave, Toriko takes everyone back to the 1st Biotope. Toriko reasons that for every single item of Ichiryu's Full Course, there always was a guardian protecting it and they couldn't retrieve it without defeating the beast first. Komatsu says that there wasn't anybody there in Restroom where they found the treasure. Toriko and the others reach the Restroom and Toriko says that there must be something in the [tree house](/wiki/Chichi%27s_Tree_House). Zebra being impatient uses his Voice Cutter on the tree house but it doesn't even get a scratch. Toriko says to him that it was a Gourmet World tree as a normal one couldn't stand an attack. Sunny asks them to find and entrance. Coco says there's an entrance on the third floor. Everyone uses the leaf stairs on the tree and go inside the tree house. They find most of the things made out of leaves and also normal household stuff. Komatsu finds a refrigerator made out of leaves and says that it can also work as an [Gourmet Case](/wiki/Gourmet_Case). Coco sees a bookshelf and finds most of the books to be explicit. Then they go to the second floor and it looks like a bedroom. This time Coco finds books again and there happen to be some cook books along with some explicit ones. They couldn't find any stairs going to the first floor. Toriko finding no choice uses his Nail Gun on the floor but the floor comes out clean. Zebra uses his Sound Bazooka but it also doesn't do anything. Komatsu then finds an open window to the first floor much to the amazement of the other four. Toriko kicks open the door and they enter. They find a [Nitro](/wiki/Nitro) inside. Toriko asks them to bring some water as it was in cryptobiosis. The Nitro suddenly scratches Toriko's head and says that it was awake. The Nitro goes berserk and scolds everyone. Komatsu asks who he was. The Nitro gets angry and asks if Ichiryu didn't tell them about him and then says he will say who he was. He then says that he is Chichi, the Taste Hermit and Ichiryu's partner. The five get instantly amazed and Chichi says that the partner part was a lie. Chichi says to the Heavenly Kings and Komatsu about his connection with Ichiryu. He says that about 500 years ago Ichiryu found him in the cryptobiosis state and revived him and then he says that that brings them to the present. Komatsu and Coco say to him that he skipped way too much. Chichi then says that he was pretending to be in cryptobiosis when they found the treasure chest as he was planning to surprise them and was surprised when they ignored him and he was glad that they found him. Chichi plants a few seeds and asks them to be seated on the plants he called as \"Chair Leaf\". Toriko says that he they no choice back then as their main priority was to complete Ichiryu's Full Course and didn't meet him as he thought it would be troublesome. Chichi finally gets serious and says that since they were going to the Gourmet World, Ichiryu asked him a favor a while back. Chichi says that Ichiryu asked him to provide them with an ingredient. The spot they were sitting on then goes down a floor. Chichi introduces them to his kitchen and points to an apple and says that that was the ingredient he was going to give them. Just by looking at the apple, all the Heavenly Kings's [Appetite Devils](/wiki/Appetite_Devil) forcefully take control of their host and almost complete take over their body but Chichi hits them with his claws and everyone return back to normal. Komatsu asks Chichi what was that ingredient as it made everyone lose their sense of reason by just looking at it. Chichi replies that it was an item of Acacia's Full Course. Everyone get utterly surprised. Chichi says that it was just a lie. Toriko gets angry and says to him that there are something which shouldn't be joked about. Chichi replies that though he told a lie, the ingredient got the scent on it. Chichi continues and says that though it was an ordinary apple, the smell of an item of Acacia's Full Course was stained on it. Chichi then says that the allure of the real thing was not anything like that and the place they were going in next has tons of ingredients like it. Toriko says that he spent a year and half in the Gourmet World but never felt a shock like this. Chichi replies that he must have been in safe spots. Toriko says that Acacia's Full Course must be in a different level that the other ingredients. Chichi asks them for a final dinner and asks them to eat the apple together. Komatsu asks him if he can use his kitchen. Chichi replies that he can do so as they will be using that place for the opening of their journey. Chichi says that there are many things that they will not achieve unless they work together. He then says that the 'Night' the Gourmet World is about to enter is a place where the strength of the wild beasts is not anything like during the 'Daytime'. Chichi asks them to get going if they have resolve. The Heavenly Kings and Komatsu reply that they are ready. AIR Arc[ ] After meeting up with Chichi and getting Ichiryu's message, Toriko, Komatsu and the other heavenly kings, ready to head into the Gourmet World, say their farewells to Chichi. Just as they are about to depart, a fairly big Octopus possessing a body pattern like a watermelon emerges. With a Capture Level of 265, the beast's name is dubbed as \"Camping Monster\", Octomelon. The beast is said to have unbreakable \"safe zone\" and is to be used by the kings in the harsh environment of the Gourmet World. Sunny expresses his disgust, however finding out Ichiryu prepared it himself for their convenience reduces his distaste. The Four kings and Komatsu then say their farewells to Chichi and hope to cross paths with him once again in the Gourmet World. Chichi tells them baton's been passed to them youngsters as Toriko's party departs for the Harbor where everyone awaits. Toriko, Komatsu, Coco, Sunny and Zebra then arrive to the Toriko Harbor where they find everyone waiting for them. Toriko says his farewells to Rin, promising to bring GOD as their wedding cake. Mansam hands Toriko a bag that containing key things for use in Gourmet World, among them being the new Capture Level Measuring Device. He also explains the method of territory marking and how it is to be used for supplying the human world populous. Toriko, Sunny and Coco call forth their animal partners who come prepared with a bag around their back. The animal partners enter the Octomelon's \"insides\" using it as a \"room\". The Four Kings announce their goals for venturing in the Gourmet World firstly Toriko stating he will get \"GOD\" and complete his full course menu, Secondly, Coco goes on and declares he will capture \"ATOM\", Thirdly, Sunny discloses that he will attain \"EARTH\", Fourthly, Zebra issues that he will eat anything tasty as Komatsu concludes by promising he will prepare it all. Then they head to the third entrance of Gourmet World, Yutou Island, the Harbor of Evil Spirits. The Octomelon which Toriko and the others are riding cruises through the ocean. Everyone are residing in Chichi's Tree House which was on the top of the Octomelon. Komatsu is holding a tray and they ask what it was. Komatsu explains that it is a tablet computer terminal which doubles as a food tray and is also the new Capture Level Measuring Device. Toriko asks how it works. Komatsu explains that they have to wear a wristband and then point the a laser which comes out of it to an ingredient and then the tablet shows its Capture Level and other information available. Zebra asks how the tray can show the details of Gourmet World beasts. Komatsu says that it was manufactured based on certain Gourmet ID Cards which were left beside the pillow of Mansam while was sleeping and when he checked the cards, he found that it had data of 300,000 Human World ingredients along many Gourmet World ingredients. Toriko says that only a few people in the world have eaten so many ingredients. Komatsu tells the name of the device as the Riddle Chapter. Then, they get caught along a large sea. Coco says that they were in the Thorn Sea. Komatsu notices beasts of Capture Level 200 getting stabbed by the Thorn Sea. Toriko asks Komatsu to get in the house. The Heavenly Kings use their attacks to stop the waves which were going to stab the Octomelon. Toriko then notices a Frosh riding the waves unaffected. He tries to point the laser of the wristband he was wearing but fails to do so. They get out of the Thorn Sea safely. Toriko wonders what that Frosh was. Coco says that they have reached harbor and the third entrance to the Gourmet World, Yutou Island, the Harbor of Evil Spirits. They see a large number of ship wrecks. Coco says that Yutou Island is a continent of mist that deceives all invaders and even the most advanced ships will run aground without ever finding land if they lose their way. Toriko points to a floating ship and says that even spirits are waving at them much to the surprise of Komatsu. Toriko says that Gourmet World has 8 major continents and according to Chichi, they are divided into different areas and they will first enter Area 8 through Yutou Island which is said to have Acacia's Salad, AIR located somewhere within it. They reach the shore and are excited about taking their first step into the land of Gourmet Food. Just as the Octomelon took the first step on the land, the fog clears up and they fall through it. Just as they were panicking, Quinn comes out of the Octomelon's stomach and grabs a piece of land with its mouth. The Octomelon grabs Quinn and stops the free-fall. But then a school of Torpedo Sausages attack Quinn and almost cut her body into two parts but Kiss timely saves her by drilling into the Torpedo Sausages. Then another beast Armlan Phoelynx flies towards them and catches the Torpedo Sausages. Just as Zebra who was feeling bored and decides to head into the house to take a nap, Komatsu points out to a huge head embedded in a wheel shows up. Then fog surrounds Coco and Toriko and takes them away from the Octomelon by grabbing them. Terry comes out of the Octomelon's stomach but Toriko asks her to stay away and protect the others and asks Zebra to set up a barrier. Komatsu asks Zebra why he is not helping them. Zebra replies that they must avoid being wiped out and Sunny says that Toriko and Coco will be fine and asks if the Riddle Chapter had a communication device. Komatsu says it has it but he cannot get a connection. Zebra couldn't use his Echo Location due to the dense fog but Sunny had made sure to have a tracker on them. Meanwhile Coco and Toriko are being carried away by the fog. Coco notices something and asks Toriko if he can smell anything. Toriko says that it was food. Then they reach a street filled with shops serving hot food. After seeing restaurants lined up in a street in Gourmet World, Toriko and Coco are amazed as even the food was real. Then a Frosh who was sitting at a restaurant says that the Real Mist was neither a lie nor a truth and in Gourmet World all there was believing or disbelieving and only those who believe can eat and asks if they will eat with him. Toriko readily begins to eat the food while Coco isn't quite sure. Since Toriko says he believes and the Frosh decides to treat him. Toriko says that he never found a spot like this during the one and half years he spent in the Gourmet World. Coco finds that there was no poison in the food. When the mist cleared, the frosh commented weather didn't matter as everyday was a perfect day to eat in the Gourmet World. Toriko replies that it was the same in the Human World and asks his name as he never met a frog who can speak. The Frosh explains that whatever common sense they had will be crushed and a new common sense will take its place piece by piece which goes for appearances, smell and even tastes. Coco asks the Frosh what the Real Mist was and it replies that Real Mist is a simple form of weather in the Gourmet World but it holds infinite possibilities. Toriko apologizes for pointing the laser at him in the Thorn Sea. The Frosh assures that it doesn't mind it. Toriko then points the laser at the Frosh and asks why it isn't dodging it now and who he was as he was not the same one he saw at the Thorn Sea. The body of the Frosh suddenly dries up and it says that while everyday was a perfect day to eat, it was also a perfect day to die at the Gourmet World. Toriko tries to contact Komatsu through the wristband. A mysterious creature comes out of the restaurant and says that the price for the meal was blood and the Frosh's blood was not enough to pay. It then attacks Coco and Toriko. They dodge the attack but soon find themselves surrounded by the beasts. The creature was a Leech Heel having a Capture Level of 307 and it says that they cannot dine and dash on their watch. Toriko's body suddenly gets blood sucked out. After seeing the a leech on the Frosh, removes his shirt and finds leeches all over his body. The street then vanishes and Coco understands the working of Real Mist and why the beasts are not sucking on his blood as it contains poison. The beasts attack him with 'Leech Bullet' but Coco dodges it and uses his Poison Boomerang. But a beast catches him and blasts him with its attack but it just happens to be 'Poison Doll' of Coco. The leeches die from sucking the poison. Coco says that what they have been fighting were his Poison Dolls. Coco says that they were Dolls from the moment they found the town and they should be more aware of what was around them. Coco uses his 'Poison Mist' which he spread using his poison boomerangs. All the Leech Heels die from Coco's poison. The real Coco and Toriko emerge from the mist and Coco states that the life of his poison doll was almost up. Toriko asks him if it was the power of the monster inside him. Coco explains that his 'Poison Life' animates poison and makes dolls which have same emotions and behavior of the original human and can only make 2 dolls at present as it takes up considerable amount of energy and that it was annoying since Sunny's touches were warning him non stop. Then the boss and mastermind of the island shows which were the same strange Wheel Heads which brought them to the island in the first place. Toriko asks Coco to stand back as it was his turn. The Soy Milk Roads says that it has been a long time since a Human came to the Harbor of Evil Spirits and they will enjoy eating them. Toriko who knew that they have been seeing illusions from beginning asks the beasts if they like to see his illusions. Toriko then creates an intimidation with his Appetite Devil on the Soy Milk Road. The intimidation was so mortifying that the Soy Milk Roads got a number of illusions of them getting fried, taken in a barbeque stick and made into soup. Due to this the Soy Milk Road loses consciousness and the mist clears up. Everyone gets surprised when the mist clears up as they find themselves on land with Toriko being very near to the Octomelon. Zebra and Toriko already knew the trick behind the mist. Toriko explains to the rest about the mist and the illusions they saw because of the mist. Coco understands the effect on Toriko during his year and half time in the Gourmet World and applauds Toriko for defeating the beast with just intimidation. Toriko replies that he used his Ultimate Routine and he can handle beast of capture level 500-600 with just intimidation. Toriko notices the Soy Milk Road he defeated and says that 'Soy Milk Tears' are flooding from his eyes and the smoke around his body is the 'Tofu Skin'. Komatsu decides to have a meal and cooks all the ingredients they defeated so far and makes tasty dishes. Everyone including the animal partners and the Octomelon have a good meal. Komatsu expresses his happiness upon being able to journey and eat together. Just then a Frog riding a car arrived. It spoke in a language Toriko and the others didn't understand. Toriko and the others don't understand a thing even after it completed speaking. The frog upon realizing that Toriko and the others couldn't understand him apologies for speaking to them in frog-speak. Toriko understands that it was the same frog he saw riding a wave in the Thorn Sea. The frog says that Toriko was correct and starts speaking frog-speak again as he was about to introduce himself. The frog corrected himself and said he was Mappy, a Travel Frog from the Hex Food World and also introduced his beloved car, Croakswagon. He then said that he came to pick them on the request of the Daruma Hermit. Mappy and the others climb on Octo-chan and says to follow Croakswagon. Croakswagon disappears in a second and Octo-chan tries hard to keep up. While traveling through the Yutou Island, Mappy explains that the island is like a maze and is really hard to go through even when the Real Mist clears up and especially during the 'Night'. Mappy says that their basic fighting ability was more than enough as they easily defeated the Soy Road Silk and even made it past the Thorn Sea. Komatsu asks Mappy why the Nights in the Gourmet World are dangerous. Mappy replies that the 'Night' in the Gourmet World is when all the Eight Kings become active. Just as Mappy was about to tell them about the current Eight Kings, Toriko and the others felt a strange aura which affected their senses. The Croakswagon went through there as it was a shortcut. Octo-chan quivers at the sight of a large footstep. Mappy explains that Heraku is one of the Eight Kings and the ruler of Area 8 continent and the footprint was the one it made several thousand years ago. Zebra notices that there was not a single blade of grass growing on the footprint. Mappy says that Heraku might have been angry when he made that footprint and further explains that depending on the mood of the Eight Kings, the footprints can become flower fields or beautiful lakes. Komatsu says that a single footprint like that would be enough to be registered as a World Gourmet Natural Heritage site in the Human World. Mappy says that the beasts become stronger and the environment harsher during the Night and among them are travel paths that have been formed since ancient times by creatures that pioneered the Gourmet World avoiding harsh environments and the Eight Kings known as Gourmet Highways which are some the very few safe roads in the Gourmet World which don't cover the whole Gourmet World and also have some dangerous places in them too. Toriko wonders if he and Komatsu entered a Gourmet Highway during their stay in the Gourmet World. Mappy says to him that without exceptional Food Luck, one may never enter a Gourmet Highway and the Gourmet Highways connect the Seven Civilizations that once existed in the Gourmet World and one of those civilizations still exist in the Area 8 which is the Hex Food World. Mappy says to them that they have reached Golden Swamp which was made out of gold dust with high specific gravity and also one of the Gourmet 100 Famous Views. He adds that passing the swamp will take them to the Area 8 mainland and the Hex Food World. Everyone is enjoying the beautiful view of the swamp especially Sunny when Mappy notices something in the sky and panics. Mappy says that Steel Clouds are descending and they need to dive into the Golden Swamp and if that do so they are guaranteed to die. Mappy says that they have to cross the swamp fast as the Iron Foot is coming down. Countless number of steel foot land on the swamp making Octo-chan panic and dodge them. Mappy explains that Steel Clouds are clouds made of steel which have accumulated due to the island's Real Mist and due to their weight they descend slowly and almost touch the ground and to float back up, they release steel thunderstorms which are called Iron Foot. Toriko tries to counter the steel foot but fails as they were extraordinarily hard. Meanwhile the Croakswagon returns and says something to Mappy. Mappy asks everyone to get in it as they will go inside of Octo-chan's body. Octo-chan quickly changes to 'Diving Mode' and dives into the swamp. Toriko and the others join up with Terry, Kiss and Quinn and find the inside of Octo-chan to be very spacious. They find a lot of Flora and Fauna thriving in the Golden Swamp. Mappy becomes very demoralized and goes into the tadpole stage. Toriko enquired why he is so disheartened. Mappy says that there is no hope left for them as as it is impossible for them to get through the Golden Swamp underwater as there is a huge cave to which the gold dust flows which was the entrance to a maze which one can never come out of, the Gold Labyrinth. Toriko suggests to wait in the swamp till the Steel Clouds ascend again. Mappy says that they won't do so until for some years and it is impossible to resist the flow of the gold dust as Octo-chan can't swim while in the 'diving mode'. The Four Heavenly Kings turn to Komatsu and say that his turn has come up. Komatsu unknowingly presses a button on the steering rod and Octo-chan releases a beam at the beast. The beast gets angry upon the attack and chases them. Mappy who was still demoralized thinks why they are having fun when they can get killed in the giant maze. He then thinks why they are having fun as if they know where the exit of the maze is. He then thinks maybe their footprints were on the Track to Success. They eventually reach the exit thanks to Komatsu. Mappy understands that Komatsu could really see the path to escape the Gold Labyrinth. Sunny points out to the treasure chests they found in the hidden rooms of the Gold Labyrinth. Komatsu then notices an eyeball to which Mappy says is a Medama which came to greet them from the village. Mappy then says that they have reached the entrance to his village, the Hex Food World. Toriko's party reach the entrance to the Hex Food World. As they are welcomed with bizarre fireworks, Brunch orders his employees, a pair of bird-like entities, to prepare a feast and welcome the Four Kings and Komatsu. The animal partners are told to stay put near Octo-chan until the Kings' and Komatsu's return. They walk through the cave and finally reach the Hex Food World, a medium-sized town with buildings and paths made of rock and soil. Toriko eats his serving of Eyeball Ojiya and finds it very delicious. Sunny shows displeasure at the presence of eyeballs in the dish and decides to have a banana. Sunny to his dismay he finds a strange banana, and they say it is a Bananattou. After drinking all the alcohol, everyone feels drunk and decide to get going while Sunny who didn't drink feels they forgot something. Suddenly Brunch who was irritated shows up. Brunch angrily asks them how long they will take to reach his shop as he has food prepared for them and it was for the first time in a while that he prepared food. Komatsu becomes happy after seeing Brunch but vomits as he had drank too much. Brunch tries to calm him and then Coco also starts to feel sick as he had Ghost Au Lait. Brunch stops him from vomiting as Coco's vomit would be no less than a poison vomit. Brunch then takes them to his restaurant, the Tengu Castle. He serves them the IE Tea which sobers up people in a drunken state. Toriko recalls that Brunch provided Human World with food during the food crisis following the Meteor Spice's attack and thanks him for his deed. Brunch remembers it and says that since he gave away most of the ingredients to the Human World, for a while all they had to eat in the Hex Food World were the Takoyakintama. Brunch then curses the Gourmet Corp.s Boss for wrecking the Human World and vows to smash his head if he ever meets him. Toriko says that it will be a load off him if he actually did that as when he had gone to fetch Komatsu from him he felt that he powerful enough to destroy the whole world if he left like it and also the most hungriest person out there. Coco then says to Brunch that they came to meet the Daruma Hermit. Brunch says that they are luck as the Hermit was sick and could die any moment. He further explains that the Hermit was taking a cure bath at the Kappa Hot Spring and has a famous doctor from the Human World looking after him. Just then Mappy comes running with bad news that the Daruma Hermit was in a bad condition. They all rush to the Bizarre Valley where the Kappa Hot Spring is located. Brunch tries to speak to the Hermit but he doesn't speak anything and then loses his consciousness. Brunch tries wake him up and the Hermit opens his eyes and then closes them again. Brunch gets irritated and asks him to either live or die. A women in doctor's outfit explains that the hermit was alright and is a little over excited as he peeped into the Kappa's Female Bath. Brunch gets angry hearing this and curses the Hermit to die. Komatsu recognizes the women to be Atashino. Sunny becomes serious as he heard that she could cure any illness or injury with a single kitchen knife and is also one of the strongest Bishokuya in the Human World. Coco also remembers that she was a member of the 0th Biotope and she went with Ichiryu to find Acacia's Full Course a year and half ago. Atashino says that she was not the only one to be saved. Toriko notices Melk standing at a distance. Komatsu remembers the kitchen knives he saw at one of the shops and guessed that it would be him who taught the shop keeper. Melk says something but Komatsu and Coco couldn't hear it as he said it in a small voice. Zebra who was not with the group arrives and translates what Melk said to them. According to Zebra Melk said that he would tell them what happened a year and half ago and the method to capture Acacia's salad, AIR. Atashino explains that to avoid the risk of everyone dieing simultaneously as when 'Night' arrives, the weather becomes quite severe in the Area 8 mainland. She further explains that the region gets heavier as one goes towards the center of Area 8 and the maps show an ocean but its actually an wasteland where different kinds of torrential rain fall. She then asks the Heavenly Kings to split up into four teams since they don't have members to form more teams. After the teams are set, Mappy is taking Toriko and Komatsu on his Croakswagon on the fourth path. Toriko asks Mappy if anyone from the village has ever eaten AIR. Mappy replies that no one did so far and only the village chief knows how to cook it as he learnd it from network of sources. Toriko then explains the procedure of capturing Acacia's Full Course which has some proper road and route. According to him, they cannot capture Acaicia's Soup, PAIR as the Area 7 continent will be hidden unless they eat AIR. Mappy then tells them some rumors relating to obstacles one need to clear in order to capture Acacia's Full Course which include a mountain range which one cannot breathe on, a cave where one ages 200,000 times the normal speed, a door through which only souls can pass by and a valley where one's thoughts slip by. Toriko suddenly starts trembling and sweating, so does Komatsu. Mappy explains that they have reached their destination, the Nightmare Hill, the nest of Heraku, ruler of Area 8. Eight horses of different shapes and sizes stand in a vast plain. Mappy then explains that the reason why their unique civilization developed was because the eight kings protected them each time they gave a sacrifice and in the whole of Gourmet World, one cannot go to capture the continent's food king without the permission of the ruler. Toriko begins to get desperate as the air around him became too heavy to breathe. He looks at the Riddle Chapter's wristband and concludes that the Horse King's level cannot be measured with the device. Mappy introduces Heracles, one of the Eight Kings to Toriko and Komatsu. Toriko couldn't breathe easily as the air is thin in the Nightmare Hill. Toriko notices an Air Tree and remembers seeing it at the Underground Forest. Saying that the Horse Kings want more air, Mappy bids farewell to Toriko and Komatsu to become fertilizer for the Air Trees. Since the Air Trees can produce more good quality air if they have a strong life force as nutrients, Mappy intends to sacrifice his life. Mappy's Croakswagon becomes sad on seeing Mappy ending his life. Mappy cheers him up and then asks Heracles if the sacrifice of his life alone will be enough to let them capture AIR. Toriko wants to stop Mappy from giving up his life understands that fighting Heracles is his only option while Komatsu finds something interesting on the Air Trees. Komatsu hears the Voice of the Ingredients and takes out his Melk Kitchen Knife. While Mappy is scared, Toriko grins as he knew Komatsu found something. Heracles gets enraged at this event and prepares to attack. Mappy gets restless as Komatsu hears the Voice of the ingredients in the direction of Food King AIR. Heracles gets even more angry as AIR is off limits without his permission. He sends out a strong gale of wind while still sitting on the ground. Mappy stops Toriko from taking any rash action as AIR is equivalent to the Horse King's life. Toriko isin't interested in sacrificing Mappy's life and asks him take Komatsu and head for AIR riding on his Croakswagon. Before Mappy could protest anymore, Toriko reminds him that they cannot eat AIR together if he dies. Toriko then prepares to confront the Horse King and asks Komatsu to go as AIR was calling him. Komatsu drags a protesting Mappy into his Croakswagon and requests him to go as fast as he can. Mappy's Croakswagon protrudes two wheels between his front and rear wheels on both sides and inhales a large amount of air and changes to 'Top Gear'. Before a huge Daruma Horse could step on them, Mappy zooms past the area within a second. Toriko taking this opportunity uses his kugi punch on the ground to stop any of the horse beasts from pursuing the Croakswagon. Toriko then taunts Heracles and challenges him to get this attention. Heracles stands up and Toriko prepares to fight him with everything he has got. Toriko and Heracles are ready to clash with Toriko forming a huge intimidation. Toriko then moves forward to attack Heracles. Heracles just snorts off some air from his nose towards Toriko's right. Toriko suddenly finds his vision be halved. Toriko then finds a deep crater just right of where he was standing and then finds his right half of body missing. Toriko begins to bleed and loses consciousness and falls down. Heracles leaves unimpressed by Toriko's abilities. As Toriko lays defeated, a bottle of Cure Water is shown broke. Toriko's cells multiply and divide in drastically and soon sprout over the part where his body was missing. Heracles stops and looks back, not because of Toriko's regeneration but a change in one of the Air Trees there. The Air Tree began to release more amount of air and let out a sweet fragrance. Heracles couldn't understand on what brought out this change. In Toriko's subconsciousness, The Red Appetite Devil which often came out in form of his Intimidation, opened a door leading to another individual. The individual comments that it was a rare sight of him coming there. The red devil explains that it came there because if the main body dies, everything is lost. The red devil expresses his inability to defeat Horse King Heracles as in his present state, it is impossible for him. The other Appetite Devil questions him if Toriko can hold out if he takes over. While sweating, the red devil explains that the Cure Water has made Toriko's injuries back to zero but they just need to eat a single ingredient and hold out for a few minutes. The other Appetite Devil decides to play with Heracles for the time being. Toriko's right hand begins to expand slowly and vibrate. The Air Tree which Heracles was observing then combines all its branches and makes a single fruit and drops it. Heracles understood that Komatsu had cooked it back then. The other Appetite Devil takes over the right half of Toriko's body making Toriko regain his consciousness. The Appetite Devil expands his arm and catches the Air Fruit and makes Toriko eat it. It then comes out of Toriko's body while keeping one of its legs still attached to him and expands its right arm intending to punch Heracles. Heracles snorts out some air again but the punch goes right through it and punches Heracles on his face. It then mocks Heracles for displaying such a funny face. Heracles's anger reaches its ultimate point. The blue devil launches a 'Devil Fork' on Heracles but he counters it with his 'Herac kick'. This single clash causes a huge Emperor Ring to form over Nightmare Hill. A lot of beasts start running away and appear to be leaving the continent. Inhabitants of Hex Food World also get concerned over the events taking place. At the Atmosphere Garden, the Daruma Hermit couldn't understand the cause why Heracles is fighting as it was pre-planned to give Mappy as a sacrifice to him. The animal partners of the Heavenly Kings who were waiting at the entrance of Hex Food World, begin to move forward to the place where the calamity happened. Back at the Nightmare Hill, Toriko's blue devil gets impressed by Heracles's kick as it had enough power to send him to space if he had took it directly. He then explains to Toriko that he and the red devil are originally the appetites present in his body. Toriko who was still recuperating from having regenerated his body listens on as his scars look longer and his hair having turned black. Toriko's blue devil instantly realizes that Heracles had been pregnant the whole time and begins to insult the beast. Heracles knew that there was no damage to the child but did not take the risk of having the it killed so she inhales for the first time, causing a vacuum that instantly deprived the area of air. Toriko's blue devil is forced to retreat due to the lack of air and Toriko himself also struggles to breath for the same reason. PAIR Arc[ ] ANOTHER Arc[ ] GOD Arc[ ] Chichi uses a Dark Technique to heal the Four Heavenly Kings and to strengthen them with the Red Nitros' cells from its own body. When Toriko awakens, the Nitro bids farewell and dies. Toriko then hears Komatsu's voice and looks towards GOD. "}
