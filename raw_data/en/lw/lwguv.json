As homeopaths we are doctors, scientists, artists, healers, therapists etc. and when we put all these hats on appropriately, we are able to be instrumental in helping our patients find their \"higher purpose of existence\" In our practice, we integrate homeopathy with various other modalities- especially meditation and Yoga. It comes naturally to both Prajakta and me as seekers. And what we learnt from our teachers Dr. Rajan Sankaran, Dr. Jayesh Shah and others is how to integrate meditation in our \"case taking\" as well. And this revolutionized our practice as with that meditation not only became means in our quest to find the similimum but also a therapeutic process by itself in our consulting room. Meditation can mean different things for different people. You may choose to meditate for its physical benefits, mental benefits, for inner peace or to discover your true self or as a therapeutic modality. Over time we have come to realize that while our remedies do their role, it is equally essential that an inner cleansing, healing, an awareness to our inner patterns. As this is what brings about the real lasting change. This journey to bring fragments to whole culminated into \"Karvaan- a wellness retreat\" a few years back. You can look it up on [www.karvaanretreat.com](http://www.karvaanretreat.com) All of us carry a \"seed\" within us that has the potential to grow into a beautiful tree bearing colorful flowers and sweet fruits. If this seed receives adequate sunlight, nutritious soil and the right amount of water this potential becomes reality. And the absence of these will result in the seed remaining a seed. And a seed is no different than a pebble if it does not flourish. Isn't it? As human beings and more so as Homeopaths who carry these seeds of potential within us, as species who has the ability of making this journey of self-discovery- we owe it ourselves. And as homeopaths if we can make this journey ourselves and help our patients do the same- we will in the true sense find our \"higher purpose of existence\" At Healing Harmony & Karvaan we practice various meditation techniques from different schools and thought cultures. If you think you cannot meditate, cannot possibly close your eyes and breathe - we will delightfully prove you wrong. We use breath, art, movement, music, detox, guided techniques and chakras to help you meditate. The methods are colorful, practical, and easy take back home in your world.
