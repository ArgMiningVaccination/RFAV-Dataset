The prevalence of PE is as high as 20% to 30%, but few affected individuals seek medical help [ [2](#B2) [3](#B3)]. According to a previous study, approximately 25% to 40% of adult men may develop PE at certain stages in their lives [ [4](#B4)]. [5](#B5)]. At present, methods for the treatment of PE include nonmedical therapy (behavioral therapy and psychotherapy), medical therapy (pharmacology and surgery), and combination therapy. Of these options, nonmedical therapy is both safe and effective [ [6](#B6)]. [7](#B7)]. Fangzhongshu, which mainly deals with sexual skills and techniques in intercourse between men and women, is an important summary of the experience of experts on sexology and contains valuable information regarding interventional treatments for various types of sexual dysfunction [ [8](#B8)]. Fangzhongshu ( [Fig .1](#F1)) contains many treatments for erectile PE, anejaculation, and other types of sexual dysfunction. Fangzhongshu is quite similar to the concepts of behavioral therapy and psychotherapy that are employed in modern medicine. In a work entitled Yufangmijue (Sexual Secrets), 7 harmful and 8 beneficial sexual behaviors are described, of which \"drainage\" is similar to the concept of PE in modern medicine. A series of 10 movements mimicking the sexual movements of 10 types of animals can be found in the Mawangdui [a place name] Medical Book of Sexual Activity, which reflects a combination of yin and yang. A work entitled Sheshengzongyao (Summary of Nourishing of Life), which was written during the Ming dynasty, is a comprehensive document of fangzhongshu that impressively describes the art of sexual activity. [9](#B9)]. LATEST DEFINITION OF PREMATURE EJACULATION BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY [10](#B10)]. In 1970, Masters and Johnson [ [11](#B11)] reported a similar maneuver, the squeeze technique, which was slightly different from the technique described by Semans [ [10](#B10)]. These methods were designed to help men recognize moderate levels of excitement, and are postulated to attenuate various stimuli and responses to prolong stimulation by gradual exposure of patients to more intense stimuli. The progress attained gradually leads to sexual confidence, self-esteem, and an increase in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, although this parameter has only been evaluated in few controlled studies [ [12](#B12)]. Although short-term benefits of behavioral therapy have been reported (success rate, 45%~65%), the problem typically reoccurs [ [13](#B13) [14](#B14)]. [6](#B6) [15](#B15) [16](#B16)]. However, the outcomes in a majority of psychotherapy studies are not well controlled or randomized, and few of them meet the requirements of evidence-based studies. Moreover, similar to behavioral therapy, such studies generally only have short follow-up periods [ [17](#B17)]. NONMEDICAL THERAPIES OF ANCIENT CHINESE ANCIENT FANGZHONGSHU 1. Idea transferring [11](#B11) [18](#B18)]. These 2 methods can help men control ejaculation and prolong sexual intercourse by shifting their attention and relieving their stress. A man's attention is shifted visually by raising his head, opening his eyes, and looking around in the first method, whereas the tactile method of clenching a pill in the hand is used in the second method. Moreover, tianwangbuxin dan is considered a tranquilizer in TCM. By clenching it in the hand, it can stimulate the Laogong (PC8, a type of acupuncture point), which belongs to the hand (Jueyin) pericardium meridian and has the function of sedation. This method has the joint effects of pharmacology and massage and can reduce anxiety and stress in patients. 2. Suppressing Yin and Raising Qi [19](#B19)]. Pressing the lower abdomen can raise the ejaculation threshold and achieve the goal of PE treatments [ [20](#B20)]. The technique of \"pressing the meridian behind the scrotum,\" which means pressing the Huiyin meridian (RN 1, a type of acupuncture point), can postpone the ejaculation reflex and raise the ejaculation threshold to delay ejaculation. In addition, \"taking long exhalations\" and \"chattering one's teeth\" are used to divert one's attention and stabilize one's mood to delay ejaculation. The key point of this method is to be mindful of time. The phrase \"sperm is fluctuating rapidly and on the verge of coming out\" means that the feeling of ejaculation has just started. This technique will fail to raise the ejaculation threshold if used too early or it will fail to control ejaculation if used too late. 3. Interruptions or intermissions in sex [17](#B17) [21](#B21) [22](#B22)]. The first method involves the interruption of sexual intercourse, and the source points out that the penis should be moved out immediately when imminent ejaculation is felt. This technique involves pressing the front of the anus (Huiyin [RN 1] in the perineum) and breathing deeply to control the mind and suppress excitement. The method of controlling ejaculation after continuing sexual intercourse involves repeating the suppression of sexual excitement by interrupting it again, breathing in, and contracting the anus as when one controls urine. The key point of this method is to interrupt sexual intercourse immediately when imminent ejaculation is felt by shifting one's attention and suppressing yin while raising qi. 4. Special posture [23](#B23)]. This method states that a man should stand next to the bed, raise the woman's feet, and insert the penis into the vagina. This method received its name because the woman's legs are held outward and resemble flying seagulls. The positions of standing and lying in this method are easy to implement and are especially suitable for men without a firm erection or much sexual experience. For the man, the standing position, which is comfortable and conserves physical strength in comparison to clinostatis, makes it easier for the penis to enter the vagina. This may alleviate patients' mental stress, prolonging the duration of sexual intercourse and delaying the ejaculation. For women, this position makes it easier to stimulate the G-spot located in the anterior vaginal wall, approximately halfway between the pubic bone and the cervix [ [24](#B24)]. Hence, this position improves sexual satisfaction for both men and women. 5. Touching three peaks and foreplay "}
