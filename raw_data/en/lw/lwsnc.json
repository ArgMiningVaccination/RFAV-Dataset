In fact, it can be quite uncomfortable especially as the body begins to release toxins. Some common physical symptoms of a 21-Day Cleanse can include: headaches, fatigue, and skin issues. Most people enter a cleanse expecting to experience various amounts of physical discomfort, however, many are shocked (and frustrated) once they begin to feel emotional discomfort as well. WHY AM I SO EMOTIONAL DURING A CLEANSE? People often feel more emotional than usual while cleansing. When we cleanse physical toxins from the body, we also begin to release old emotional toxins like fear, stress, sadness, loneliness, and anxiety. This can be quite scary, especially if you are not ready to tackle these emotions. Once the body begins to release emotional toxins, it's common to experience varying levels of irritability, impatience, heightened sensitivity, anger and crying at the drop of a hat for what appears to be no reason. When these emotions and behaviors come up, try not to suppress them. This is a great time to sit with these emotions and just observe them. Get quiet, take a deep breath and ask your higher self where are these emotions stemming from? You might be surprised at the answer you receive. COMMON EMOTIONAL THEMES THAT SHOW UP DURING A CLEANSE: 1. You are forced to Process Emotions that You Continue to Suppress The first time I did the Cleanse, I felt like it was a walk in the park. Then, I did the Cleanse again and I had a completely different experience. My second cleanse was an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. Week one was a piece of cake, but as soon as I entered week two, I began to feel depressed and moody, I could not stop crying. Before the cleanse I numbed my emotions with chocolate bars, Kombucha and very hearty late night meals. The cleanse did not afford me the opportunity to hide from my emotions anymore. All of our emotions are real and deserve validation and attention. Show them some love and attention and then they will chill out. 2. Mental Clarity Stimulates Growth and Tough Decision Making Mental clarity is a common benefit of cleansing. Mental clarity has the capacity to shake up and transform your whole life. This transformation does not always look graceful, in fact, it can appear and feel quite tumultuous. With newfound mental clarity, some cleansers find themselves reexamining the key relationships in their lives. Some find that they are holding onto platonic, romantic and/or business relationships that no longer serve them. As a result, it is quite common to begin severing ties with romantic partners, friends or business partners during or immediately after the cleanse. 3. How to Cope when you are Going through an Emotional Healing Crisis During a Cleanse: Drink lots of water: If you are feeling quite emotional, chances are you are also dehydrated. Drink lots of water to help you bloom and grow through the pain. Get lots of sunlight: Just as plants need sunlight, so do we! We need to be fortified by the sun's vitamin D daily. No matter the weather, make an effort to take a 10-minute walk outside every day. If you are unable to soak in the sun rays on a daily basis, you might find it helpful to take a vitamin D supplement. You might also find it beneficial to look into using light therapy such as sun lamp. Ground yourself in nature: Take your shoes off and walk barefoot in the grass. Go to the park or the beach and take a hike as often as possible. Observing the natural rhythm of nature usually helps us to put a lot of our problems into perspective. Use Alternative Healing Modalities: Reiki, acupuncture, crystal therapy and aromatherapy might assist you in achieving a calm and balanced mindset. Keep a Journal: Keep a journal during your 21-Day Cleanse. Create a morning practice of writing in your journal before you start your day. Write down your thoughts and feelings so that you can understand them more clearly. Help Move the Waste Out: Make sure that you are having at least one sufficient bowel movement per day to help push the toxins out of your body. If you are constipated, those toxins will try to come out through other channels of elimination such as your skin. When we are constipated we are more likely to become moody because we are so full of waste. Get Creative or Get Active: Do something you enjoy to help channel all of your pent-up emotions. Paint, skate, bike ride, dance, sing, play basketball, etc. Press Pause on Social Media: Mindless scrolling on social media can make it pretty difficult to hear your unique inner voice. Consider whether it might help you to take a break from social media while on the cleanse. Breathe: Last but not least, breathe through it all and be gentle with yourself. Take full deep breaths and feel how alive you really are! Sit back as an observer and allow your emotions to come and go as you would observe waves washing up against the shore. Don't abandon ship when the waves get a bit scary, they will settle down with time.
