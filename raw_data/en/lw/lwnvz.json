She has widely published her peer-reviewed work in several high-impact scientific journals, including Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, CHEST, and Human Genetics. She continues to present her research at international and national scientific meetings, and belongs to several professional groups, including The Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BOLD Public Health Center of Excellence on Dementia Risk Reduction. Overall, Dr. Glover dedicates her work to eradicating health disparities and creating health equity - globally, nationally, and locally. "}
