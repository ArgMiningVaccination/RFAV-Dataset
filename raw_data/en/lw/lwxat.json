We look at factors impairing the immune system and causing damage that need to be balanced to allow the body to start fighting and containing any infection. For chronic infections like Lyme, it is a bacterial infection, immune dysregulation and toxic illness that will need to be addressed. There is no protocol to treat these infections as each person is fighting and responding differently to these infections. We take into account that your detoxification issues may be adding to the problem, your bowel dysfunction is making it harder to control the immune system and help detox, or you might have nutritional deficiencies that are starting to make things much more difficult as your body is struggling to function normally. Hormones are complicated from thyroid dysfunction, adrenal mismanagement, menstrual irregularities, to even erectile dysfunction. When the hormones are balanced we function better and maintain healthy weights. Whether you are trying to start a family, having severe menstrual irregularity, or entering menopause; bio-identical hormone management can be a powerful answer Alternative fertility treatments to enhance conception prior to the use of IVF or pharmaceutical drugs. We strive to teach women about their own ovulatory cycle to start learning how to track their own fertility. Looking at some of the genetic and hormonal factors that frequently cause problems with a woman's fertility allowing her greater control of her own feminine health and wellness Autoimmune diseases are variable and vast in nature. In general conventional treatments focus on suppression and controlling the immune system. In some cases as in Hashimoto's thyroiditis the immune system is ignored and treatment might result in removal of the thyroid at some point. Autoimmune disease is a dysfunction that has occurred in the regulation of the immune system throwing it out of balance. We focus on discovering why the immune system became imbalanced and strive to balance the immune system as best as possible. Neurotransmitters control our moods and cognitive function. Many things can throw these small messengers out of balance from a toxin, medication, or our genetics. Some of these imbalances can be easily fixed and others may be a permanent genetic defect that needs to be managed long term. Treatment can vary from simple nutritional or lifestyle changes to taking a precursor of one of the neurotransmitter to even needing to take a pharmaceutical drug. Each of us are a unique individual with different genetics and experiences. None of us are the same, but we might have similarities. How you experience life is different to everyone else. Our diets are fluid and should be unique to each person that WORKS FOR YOU. There is NO one diet. There are diet's that might work for periods of time to allow you to get healthier, but it may not be a long term option. Knowing how you actually digest proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Knowing how you metabolize these nutrients and if you need more specific nutrients can help simplify this complex aspect of our lives. Visceral manipulation and Cranial Sacral therapy assists functional and structural imbalances throughout the body. It is a way to evaluate and treat structural issues between the viscera (organs) and their fascial or ligamentous attachments to the musculoskelatal system. Strains in the connective tissue of the viscera can result from surgical scars, adhesions, illness, poor posture, or trauma. Tension patterns can form through this fascial network deep within the body creating a cascade of effects throughout the body. The body then has to compensate around this abnormal tension leading to chronic irritation and inflammation leading to restricted movement and possibly pain. Cranial Sacral therapy focuses more on the nervous system and how it communicates with the rest of the body. Supportive Oligonucleaotide Therapy (SOT) is a personalized therapy for cancer, viruses and some pathogens like Lyme disease. SOT is a manufactured protein that has the ability to bind to a specific gene of interest that controls the cancer cell or pathogen by disrupting the critical process that promotes its survival or growth. It will activate an immune response to attack the target (cancer or pathogen) and trigger apoptosis (triggered cell death). It can continue to be active in the body for several months triggering a \"herx\" reaction from the die off of the cancer cells or the pathogen it is targeting. SOT can be given intravenously (IV) three times per year and we can treat up to two pathogens at a time. Lab tests are required every 6 months to check for the presence of a particular pathogen or how many of the cancer stem cells are in the blood to determine if a shift in therapy will be needed. We recommend this therapy in conjunction with supporting detoxification and natural therapies. Within a month we may recommend adding in an anti-microbial or anti-viral herb or antibiotic depending on the patient. In combination with diet and lifestyle changes, this therapy can help to change the terrain in the body to better health. Detoxification refers to the removal of toxic material from the body via a series of enzymatic reactions, mainly preformed in the liver. There are two phases of detoxification in the liver to get rid of waste materials. Waste or toxic material comes from everyday physiologic functioning of the body meaning living life (lactic acid, urea, etc), old hormones, medications, or other substances the body comes into contact with (pollution, heavy metals, etc). These phases of detoxification require many important nutrients as co-factors, or helpers to complete an enzymatic detoxification reaction. Enhancing the function of the liver can increase weight loss, improve energy and wellbeing, and improve normal physiological functioning of the body. The best way to support the liver is by eating good foods, drinking enough water, and exercising on a routine basis. To start any detoxification program it is best to \"prime\" the liver for 14 days to aid it in its ability to function better. This process also helps to switch the body's fuel source from running primarily on sugar to running on fat as a primary fuel source, thus enhancing weight loss and overall normal physiological function. This can start with the Nutritional Genetic Counseling to see what detoxification issues we might be dealing with that is making our journey to health harder. Putting together a good detox program with diet and lifestyle changes, nutrient supplementation, binders for toxins, hydrotherapy, and IV therapies. We offer several IV therapies ranging from IV ozonated blood therapy to help with treating chronic infections and helping with detoxification to High dose Vitamin C IV or Modified Myer's IV therapy to help support the immune system and detoxification.
