But just like with any other part of your body, there can be problems with your immune system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an example of a virus that damages the immune system so that the body is unable to fight infections. And sometimes the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells. This is known as an autoimmune disease. This kind of disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, can be very hard to deal with. Our topics can help you cope with immune system problems. We can also show you how to strengthen your immune system against common diseases. Get the information you need in our immune system topics, such as: Immunizations.
