I entertained disordered eating habits. I polluted my body with drugs and alcohol. I lived off little to no sleep. I pushed myself way too hard in order to 'succeed'. I thought Starbucks' skinny caramel lattes were healthy and an acceptable meal substitute. I lived off pain killers every day for almost a year when I was a dancer at the Moulin Rouge. I was nursing a torn hammy, which I pushed through for 12 shows a week doing Can Can kicks and jump splits (ouch!). I quickly opted for antibiotics whenever I had a sniffle. I took cortisol tablets and creams whenever my eczema would rear its ugly head. And I burnt the candle at both ends many, many times until my body conked out. That was in 2010. But, even today, I am still paying the price. I am undoing years and years of damage. Today, I have trabecular oedema in my right hip from dancing and pushing through that torn hammy. This causes lower back pain and pretty much puts my whole body out of whack. I wake up in pain pretty much every day. I am twenty-seven years old and I wake up in pain... Seriously! I am not saying all this to get sympathy. I am sharing this with you simply to show you the repercussions of how I treated my body when I was younger. When you put things into perspective, this is nothing compared to what some people are going through. People are dying. Others have serious illnesses and diseases. I want to share this with you because I don't want you to trash your beautiful body and pay the price later. I see too many beautiful women self-sabotaging, letting their Mean Girl win, and feeling like total crap along the way. But we have to stop. I am so grateful for everything I have been through because it has led me to where I am today. I am on the mend. However, my body is still paying the price. Here's what I've learned from my journey: - Treat your body like a temple. - Honour it. - Cherish it. - Fuel it. - And nourish the heck out of it. We all know what our bodies need in order to thrive. So, do it, my dear friend. Do whatever it takes in order for you to feel 100%. Don't push your self-care to the bottom of your \"to do\" list. It's time to make self-care your number one priority so that you can show up in life as the best version of you. Here's a list of some of the things I do most days in order to nourish my temple: - I eat organic foods. - I meditate twice a day and do some gentle yoga in the morning. - I [dry body brush](http://pathtowellness.com.au/get-your-body-brush-on/)every morning. - I get to bed by 9 p.m. and get eight hours of sleep every night. - I drink loads of filtered water and herbal teas throughout the day. - I lather my body in coconut oil and only use organic products on my body. - I hardly ever wear makeup and don't use perfume. - I have plants in my office and around my home to filter the air. - I have three large [Himalayan salt lamps](http://www.rocksaltlamps.com.au/)around my home and office. - I drink a glass of [bone broth](http://pathtowellness.com.au/bone-broth/)each day. - I make sure I connect with Mother Nature every day. - I do something for myself each day, whether it's reading in the bath, swimming in the ocean, or walking in nature. This list might seem quite long. But, I don't even think twice about it now. These habits have become so embedded that it's just like brushing my teeth. I never have to think about self-care; I just do it. The above list is what works for me. Now, I want to hear what lights you up, my darling. Share with me in the comments below what you do each day to nourish your sweet temple. Share your tips and secrets to inspire our beautiful tribe. Before I go, together I want us to make a public declaration here to stop trashing our bodies. Let's honour these beautiful temples we were given. If you're in \u2014 if this rings true \u2014 share with me in the comments below how you plan to nourish your body.
