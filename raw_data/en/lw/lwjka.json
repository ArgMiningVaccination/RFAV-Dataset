The purpose of this Special Issue is to advance dietary supplement science by presenting commissioned overviews on four nutrients of particular current interest and controversy: Vitamin D, iodine, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids. To supplement these contributions, we welcome the submission of manuscripts describing original research or providing systematic reviews related to various issues in dietary supplement science. Manuscripts across a broad range of topics will be considered, but we are particularly interested in manuscripts that address the following areas: Health effects, both positive and negative, of single nutrients, such as vitamin D, iodine, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, with an emphasis on human studies.

Journal of Nutrition Education 1983 There is need for those within the industry to become more vigilant in their use of terminology with increasing consumer awareness as it applies to terms such as nutraceutical, functional, medical and novel foods. Dietary supplements have also been developed to manage a variety of diseases. Recognition of variation in functional food and nutraceutical composition will provide opportunity for the industry to give consumers a variety of new products that can be developed for niche or specialized markets. \u2014 Introduction: Nutritional supplements provide nutrients, which may not ingest in sufficient quantities. Dietary supplements may be vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids or other substances, and are present in the form of pills, tablets, capsules and liquids. Purpose: The purpose of this review is to present the correlation of nutritional supplements to the human body through food, in order to protect and promote health. Review Methods: The methodology of this study included search of review studies and research in leading databases such as PUBMED, MEDLINE and IATROTEK. The criterion for the selection of the articles was the Greek and English language, with keywords: nutrition, food supplements, health. Results: It is true that today our diet is much richer than before. On the other hand, the abundance of processed food and ignorance of the basic principles of nutrition have led much of the population to an unbalanced diet. Thus, the phenomenon of a very rich food in calories and fat and poor in proteins, vitamins and minerals. So sometimes recommend the consumption of food supplements to meet these human needs. Nutritional supplements help in improving performance, physical appearance, to avoid making dangerous drugs and meet the increased needs of the organization or deficiencies in nutrients caused by and which cannot be met by normal diet.

Roczniki Pastwowego Zakadu Higieny 2021 The use of dietary supplements (supplementation) is the individual enrichment of the diet with ingredients naturally occurring in food. As a rule, dietary supplements should be used periodically. In nutritional practice, there are many indications for dietary supplementation, but the decision to take dietary supplements should be made by consumers wisely and only in justified situations, when there is a risk that the usual diet does not provide vitamins and minerals in an amount adequate to meet dietary recommendations. However, we should remember about the real dangers of taking too large doses of vitamins and minerals. Many people using dietary supplements, especially several types at the same time, may experience undesirable side effects and deterioration of health, and in addition, people taking medicines may seriously disrupt or weaken the effect of the drug, or even lack the therapeutic effect of the drug. The document presents 10 steps and rules for the use of dietary supplem... The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2007 PeerJ The significant attention gained by food-sourced vitamins has provided insights into numerous current researches; for instance, the potential reversal of epigenetic age using a diet and lifestyle intervention, the balance between food and dietary supplements in the general population, the role of diet and food intake in age-related macular degeneration, and the association of dietary supplement use, nutrient intake and mortality among adults. As relevant literature about food-sourced vitamin increases, continuous synthesis is warranted. To supplement existing information, this perspective review discussed food-sourced vitamins for consumer diet and health needs, scoping from vitamin absorption, metabolic functions, utilization, to balancing nutritional requirements. Relevant literatures were identified through a search of databases like Google Scholar, Web of Science, the Interscience Online Library, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We demonstrated that vitamins whether from plant- and an...
