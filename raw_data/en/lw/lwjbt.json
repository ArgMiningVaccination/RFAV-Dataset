However, it is recommended to refer to the product label or consult with a healthcare professional for specific instructions regarding the best way to take the supplement. A: All the cells in your body use NAD and therefore require NR, its precursor, to function properly. NAD helps cells regulate a number of essential functions that help keep your cells running smoothly, including: - energy metabolism - DNA repair - gene expression - cellular stress responses It's essential that your cells have plenty of NR to produce enough NAD to support these functions. Your NR levels naturally decline over time, and, as a result, your levels of NAD decline too. This may contribute to some of the health effects you might experience during aging. Research has shown that people with different age-related conditions, including diabetes and liver diseases, may have lower levels of NR and NAD. Test-tube and animal studies also suggest that NR may play a role in other aspects of aging, including heart and brain health. Since taking NR may help your body produce more NAD, it's also important to consider the research behind the benefits of NAD. Studies investigating NAD shed light on its potential benefits: - It may increase longevity. In your cells, NAD activates a group of proteins called sirtuins, which help repair your DNA. The activity of sirtuins is linked to longevity. On the flip side, low-NAD levels are associated with age-related diseases. - It may have protective effects on the brain. NAD is thought to modulate the production of a protein that helps guard cells against impairment of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. These cellular stressors are related to some neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. - It may help reduce heart disease risk. In mice, high NAD levels in the blood reversed age-related arterial damage, which may help guard against heart disease. - It may protect against cancer. Elevated NAD levels may help protect cells against oxidative stress and DNA damage, which are associated with cancer development. - It may improve sleep quality. NAD may help adjust your internal clock, potentially helping to correct circadian rhythm disorders. - It may help aging muscles. In older mice, it has been shown that high blood NAD levels helped improve muscle function, strength, and endurance. A: Reishi Mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is deemed the ultimate \"Anti-Stress Herb\" within the kingdom of medicinal mushrooms. Reishi mushroom has shown to be neuroprotective, helps calm an overactive nervous system, supports the adrenals, reduces stress and anxiety, clears mental fog, boosts antioxidants, lowers inflammation, and may have anti-depressive effects. Stress is a key factor for increasing free radical production, causing disruption in neurotransmitters, and further drives neuroinflammation. Reishi mushroom helps boost brain health by decreasing the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways such as PGE2 and TNFa that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and depression. Reishi mushroom has also shown to inhibit the creation of amyloid beta plaque that causes neurodegenerative diseases being both protective and an active additional to treatment approaches. Common health benefits of Reishi Mushroom*Stress Reliever* Reishi mushroom is a powerful adaptogenic herb that modulates the stress response by acting on the HPA axis - the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis - through its polysaccharides compounds. Reishi increases the effectiveness of the adrenal glands and support a balanced secretion of stress hormones. Cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory. However, when the body is chronically exposed to stress and cortisol is constantly released by the adrenals, the stress response goes haywire and it's difficult for the body to restore homeostasis until we get out of this \"flight or fight\" response. In this unbalanced state, symptoms such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and chronic fatigue start to arise and may cause further breakdown and dysfunction of numerous systems in the body. The ability for Reishi mushroom to support the adrenals and preserve healthy release and circulation of cortisol helps decrease \"cortisol resistance\" and reduce a chronically overactivated and overworked nervous system. In respect to brain health, stress as we've explored is a key driver of oxidative stress, free radical creation, and the creation of neuroinflammation and amyloid beta plaque. By Reishi acting as a stress reliever, it's able to support healthy brain function and increase resistance to perceived stressors.Immune System Booster* An imbalanced immune system increases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNFa. As we know, inflammation drives neurodegenerative diseases and is linked to anxiety, depression, fatigue, poor memory, and a decline in cognition. Reishi mushroom helps modulate the immune system and improve the balance between Th1 / Th2 immune activation, decreasing the over-release and presence of these pro-inflammatory mediators while still supporting a healthy immune response.Anti-Inflammatory* Reishi Mushroom is a potent anti-inflammatory adaptogen that helps modulate and support healthy activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and mediators. By reducing inflammation in the body, this greatly improves and supports overall brain health and function.Helps with Insomnia* The link between sleep and brain health is a well-known and established connection. A lack of sleep and poor sleep quality accelerates neurodegenerative diseases and causes a decline in cognitive function. Insomnia is caused by a disruption to sleep-wake patterns and a reduction in REM sleep, which has been seen in all patients with Alzheimer's and Dementia, as well as sleep disorders. A lack of proper sleep is also a common symptom and driver of depression and anxiety. Reishi mushroom is able to help improve sleep patterns and sleep quality by calming an overactive mind and stressed nervous system, promoting sleep and relaxation. It's thought that the triterpenoid compounds in Reishi may help promote calmness and improve sleep quality.Anti-Aging benefits* Aging is classified as the reduction in structure and function of our cells. As humans, we tend to apply this to our own appearance in the signs of aging, whether it be wrinkles, pain, and a reduction in mobility and cognition. For centuries, Reishi mushroom has been revered as a superior longevity tonic throughout history with potent anti-aging benefits. In Traditional Chinese medicine, Reishi is known as the \"divine mushroom of immortality\" and historically, its consumption was only reserved for the royal family. The Reishi mushroom has many benefits and is an ideal supplement to calm your nerves, boost your creativity, and extend healthy aging.* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
