PRODUCT INFORMATION SereneSkin is a probiotic-powered skincare supplement that supports a radiant, youthful complexion as well as supporting total body health. SereneSkin is a unique blend of four spore-forming Bacillus probiotic strains with added vitamin K2 for overall skin microbiome and gut-skin axis support. Beauty From Within The skin is the body's first line of defense, so it's essential to know how to keep it healthy. The skin, like the gut, has a unique bacterial community \u2014 its own microbiome. Probiotic supplements represent a breakthrough in skincare innovation. They can help improve the skin's natural microbial balance by supporting the health of the gut microbiome. Probiotics help support digestive balances, working to maintain skin moisture retention, texture, and radiance. Maintaining a flourishing microbiome supports your skin's beauty, health, and clarity. The SereneSkin supplement will help to promote beauty from within. The Gut-Skin Axis The gut and skin have an intimate relationship that is much more than skin deep. Both organs contain rich microbial communities that interact with the immune system. Researchers coined the term \"gut-skin axis\" to describe the communication pathway between the gut and skin. The two organs communicate and influence each other through molecules transmitted through the bloodstream, forming the gut-skin axis, where the gut and skin enjoy a constant dialogue. The gut microbiome supports numerous processes throughout the body. The skin is often a great indicator of what's going on inside the gut microbiome \u2014 a healthy gut microbiome is often mirrored as healthy, vibrant skin.1.
