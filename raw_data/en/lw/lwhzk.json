In 2019, as in previous years, the medical conditions associated with the most medical encounters, the largest numbers of affected service members, and the greatest numbers of hospital days were in the major categories of injuries, musculoskeletal disorders, and mental health disorders. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? The aforementioned categories of illness and injury disproportionately reduce the readiness and fitness of service members and detract from their ability to execute the missions of the Armed Forces. Such disorders remain high-priority targets for preventive action and research to lessen their impact on the ready force.Perceptions of the relative impor - tance of various health conditions in military populations often deter - mine the natures, extents, and priorities for resources applied to primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention activities. However, these perceptions are inherently subjective and may not reflect objective measures of the relationship between the conditions and their impact on health, fitness, military operational effectiveness, healthcare costs, and so on. Several classification systems and mor - bidity measures have been developed to quantify the \"public health burdens\" that are attributable to various illnesses and injuries in defined populations and set - tings.1 Not surprisingly, different classifica - tion systems and morbidity measures lead to different rankings of illness- and injury- specific public health burdens.2 For example, in a given population and setting, the illnesses and injuries that account for the most hospitalizations are likely different from those that account for the most outpatient medical encounters. The illnesses and injuries that account for the most medical encounters overall may differ from those that affect the most indi - viduals, have the most debilitating or long- lasting effects, and so on.2 Thus, in a given population and setting, the classification system or measure used to quantify con - dition-specific morbidity burdens shapes to a large extent the conclusions that may be drawn regarding the relative impor - tance of various conditions and, in turn, the resources that may be indicated to prevent or minimize their impacts. This annual summary uses a standard disease classification system (modified for use among U.S. military members) and sev - eral healthcare burden measures to quan - tify the impacts of various illnesses and injuries among members of the active com - ponent of the U.S. Armed Forces in 2019.METHODS The surveillance period was 1 January through 31 December 2019. The surveil - lance population included all individu - als who served in the active component of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps at any time during the surveillance period. All data used in this analysis were derived from records routinely maintained in the Defense Medical Surveillance Sys - tem (DMSS). These records document both ambulatory encounters and hospitaliza - tions of active component members of the U.S. Armed Forces in fixed military and civilian (if reimbursed through the Military Health System [MHS]) treatment facilities worldwide. For this analysis, DMSS data for all inpatient and outpatient medical encoun - ters of all active component members during 2019 were summarized according to the primary (first-listed) diagnosis (if reported with an International Classifica - tion of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code between A00 and T88, an ICD-10 code beginning with Z37, or Department of Defense unique personal history codes (DOD0101-DOD0105). For summary purposes, all illness- and injury-specific diagnoses (as defined by the ICD-10) were grouped into 151 burden of disease-related \"conditions\" and 25 \"categories\" based on a modified version of the classification sys - tem developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.1 Prior MSMR anal - yses grouped illness- and injury-specific diagnoses into 142 conditions. Review of preliminary results of the 2019 burden analysis revealed that within 8 of the 22 \"all other\" conditions, large numbers of medi - cal encounters were attributable to 9 diag - nosis codes or groups of codes (cervicalgia, chronic pain, vaginitis and vulvitis, urinary tract constipa - tion, testicular hypofunction, and gout). Based on this finding, these diagnosis codes or groups of codes were broken out and treated as separate burden of disease- related conditions in the current analysis. In general, the GBD system groups diagnoses with common pathophysiologic or etiologic bases and/or significant inter - national health policymaking importance. In this analysis, some diagnoses that are grouped into single categories in the GBD system (e.g., mental health disorders) were disaggregated to increase the military rel - evance of the results. Also, injuries were classified by affected anatomic site rather than by cause because external causes of injuries are incompletely reported in mili - tary outpatient records. The \"morbidity burdens\" attributable to various \"conditions\" were estimated based on the total number of medical encounters attributable to each condition May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 3 FIGURE 1 a. Numbers of medical encounters,a individuals affected,b and hospital bed days, by burden of disease major category,c active compo - nent, U.S. Armed Forces, 2019(i.e., total hospitalizations and ambulatory visits for the condition with a limit of 1 encounter per individual per condition per day), numbers of service members affected by each condition (i.e., individuals with at least 1 medical encounter for the condition during the year), and total bed days during hospitalizations for each condition. The new electronic health record for the MHS, MHS GENESIS, was imple - mented at 4 military treatment facilities in the state of Washington in 2017 (Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Naval Hospital Bremerton, Air Force Medical Services Fairchild, and Madigan Army Medical Center). Implementation of the second wave of MHS GENESIS sites began in 2019 and included 3 facilities in California (Tra - vis Air Force Base [AFB], the Presidio of Monterey, and Naval Air Station Lemoore) and 1 in Idaho (Mountain Home AFB). Medical data from facilities using MHS GENESIS are not available in the DMSS. Therefore, medical encounter data for indi - viduals seeking care at any of these facilities after their conversion to MHS GENESIS were not included in the current analysis. RESULTS Morbidity burden, by category In 2019, more active component ser - vice members (n=542,914) received medi - cal care for injury/poisoning than any other morbidity-related category (Figures 1a, 1b) . In addition, injury/poisoning accounted for more medical encounters (n=2,933,393) than any other morbidity category and one-quarter (25.4%) of all medical encoun - ters overall. Mental health disorders accounted for more hospital bed days (n=177,298) than any other morbidity category and half (50.2%) of all hospital bed days over - all (Figures 1a, 1b) . Together, injury/poison - ing and mental health disorders accounted for about three-fifths (60.9%) of all hospital bed days and more than two-fifths (41.9%) of all medical encounters. Of note, maternal conditions (includ - ing pregnancy complications and delivery) accounted for a relatively large proportion of all hospital bed days (n=54,598; 15.5%) but a much smaller proportion of (n=186,936; 1.6%) (Fig- ures 1a, 1b) . Routine prenatal visits are not included in this summary.

More - over, the 9 conditions that accounted for the most medical encounters accounted for more than half (51.9%) of all illness- and injury-related medical encounters overall. In general, the conditions that accounted for the most medical encounters among active component service members in 2019 were predominantly musculoskeletal dis - eases (e.g., back problems), injuries (e.g., knee, arm/shoulder, foot/ankle, or leg), and mental health disorders (e.g., adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disor - ders, or substance abuse disorders) (Table, Figure 2) . Individuals affected, by condition In 2019, more active component ser - vice members received medical care for all other signs and symptoms than for any other specific condition (Table) . Of the 10 conditions that affected the most ser - vice members, 3 were injuries (knee, arm/ shoulder, foot/ankle), 2 were musculoskel - etal diseases (other back problems and all other musculoskeletal diseases), 2 were signs and symptoms (all other signs and symptoms and respiratory and chest), 1 FIGURE 2.

Hospital bed days, by condition In 2019, mood and substance abuse disorders accounted for more than one- quarter (30.9%) of all hospital bed days. Together, 4 mental health disorders (mood, substance abuse, adjustment, and anxi - ety) and 2 maternal conditions (pregnancy complications and delivery) accounted for three-fifths (60.0%) of all hospital bed days (Table, Figure 3) . Slightly more than 10 per - cent (10.7%) of all hospital bed days were attributable to injuries and poisonings; head/neck injuries, other complications not otherwise specified, leg injuries, and back/abdomen injuries accounted for 7.3% of the injury- and poisoning-related hospi - tal bed days.Relationships between healthcare burden indicators There was a strong positive correlation between the number of medical encoun - ters attributable to various conditions and the number of individuals affected by the conditions ( r=0.86) (data not shown) . For example, the 3 leading causes of medical encounters were among the 9 conditions that affected the most individuals (Table) . In contrast, there were weak to moderate positive relationships between the hospi - tal bed days attributable to conditions and either the numbers of individuals affected by (r=0.18) or medical encounters attrib - utable to ( r=0.37) the same conditions. For example, labor and delivery and substance abuse disorders were among the top-rank - ing conditions in terms of proportion of total hospital bed days; however, these conditions affected relatively few active component service members.EDITORIAL COMMENT This report reiterates the major find - ings of prior annual reports on morbidity and healthcare burdens among U.S. mili - tary members. In 2019, as in prior years, the burden of disease categories of muscu - loskeletal disorders, injuries, mental health disorders, and pregnancy- and delivery- related conditions accounted for relatively large proportions of the morbidity and healthcare burdens that affected active component service members. Of the 151 burden of disease-related conditions, just 9 (6.0%) accounted for slightly more than half of all illness- and injury-related medical encounters of active component members. These conditions included 3 anatomic site- defined injuries (knee, arm/shoulder, and foot/ankle), 2 musculoskeletal conditions (other back problems and all other muscu - loskeletal diseases), organic sleep disorders, May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 9 all other signs and symptoms, and 2 men - tal health disorders (adjustment and anxiety disorders). It is important to note that this pattern of illness and injury among U.S. active component members is distinctive from that of other population groups that are different in terms of demographic dis - tribution and occupational hazards. Exam - ples of such different populations include not only the general U.S. population but also other MHS beneficiaries such as fam - ily members and retirees. The differing burdens of disease and injury for the other MHS beneficiaries are described in another article in this issue of the MSMR .3 Mental health disorders (including substance abuse disorders), injuries, and musculoskeletal disorders of the back have been leading causes of morbidity and dis - ability among service members throughout military history.4-9 It is well recognized that the prevention, treatment, and rehabilita - tion of back problems and joint injuries, and the detection, characterization, and management of mental health disorders\u2014 including substance abuse and deployment stress-related disorders (e.g., post-trau - matic stress disorder)\u2014should be the high - est priorities for military medical research, public health, and force health protection programs. In summary, this analysis, like those of prior years, documents that relatively few illnesses and injuries account for most of the morbidity and healthcare burdens that affect U.S. military members. Illnesses and injuries that disproportionately contrib - ute to morbidity and healthcare burdens should be high-priority targets for preven - tive action, research, and resources. REFERENCES 1.

MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 10 Hospitalizations, Active Component, U.S. Armed Forces, 2019 WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS? The annual hospitalization rate for any cause in 2019 was unchanged from the rate in 2018 at 50.9 per 1,000 service member person-years. The rates for 2018 and 2019 were the lowest rates in the past 10 years. Rates of hospital - ization in most of the ICD-10 major diagnostic categories have declined in recent years, but numbers and rates of hospitalizations for men - tal health disorders have increased. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? Declining rates of hospitalization for most cat- egories of illness and injury may reflect the relatively recent decrease in numbers of ac-tive duty military personnel involved in peace - keeping and combat operations. The reasons for the increase in mental health disorder- related hospitalizations are not known, but this trend warrants continued research and emphasis on preventive measures for this relatively common category associated with lengthy hospitalizations.This report documents the frequen - cies, rates, trends, and distributions of hospitalizations of active compo - nent members of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps during calendar year 2019. Summaries are based on stan- dardized records of hospitalizations at U.S. military and non-military (reimbursed care) medical facilities worldwide. For this report, primary (first-listed) discharge diagnoses are considered indicative of the primary reasons for hospitalizations; summaries are based on the first 3 digits of the International Clas - sification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD- 10) codes used to report primary discharge diagnoses. Hospitalizations not routinely documented with standardized, automated records (e.g., during field training exercises or while shipboard) are not centrally avail - able for health surveillance purposes and thus are not included in this report.Frequencies, rates, and trends In 2019, there were 66,989 records of hospitalizations of active component mem - bers of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps (Table 1) ; 33.0% of the hos - pitalizations were in non-military facilities (data not shown) . The annual hospitalization rate (all causes) for 2019 was 50.9 per 1,000 service member person-years (p-yrs). This rate was unchanged from the rate for 2018 (50.9 per 1,000 p-yrs). The rates for 2018 and 2019 were the lowest rates reported during 2010-2019, the years covered in this report (Figure 1) . Hospitalizations, by illness and injury categories As in prior years, in 2019, 3 diagnostic categories accounted for three-fifths (60.0%) of all hospitalizations of active component members: mental health disorders (28.1%), TABLE 1.

ICD, International Classification of Diseases; No., number.May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR pregnancy- and delivery-related conditions (22.5%), and injury/poisoning (9.4%) (Table 1). Similar to 2015 and 2017, in 2019 there were more hospitalizations for mental health disorders than for any other major diagnos - tic category (per ICD-10); 2008 was the last year in which the number of hospitaliza - tions for pregnancy- and delivery-related conditions exceeded the number for mental health disorders (data not shown) . Comparing 2019 to 2015, numbers of hospitalizations decreased in all major cat- egories of illnesses and injuries except for mental health disorders and respiratory system disorders, which increased 20.9% and 7.1%, respectively (Table 1) . The largest drop in the number of hospitalizations dur - ing 2015-2019 was seen in the category of \"other factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" (excluding pregnancy-related) (hospitalization differ - ence, 2015-2019: -1,063; 33.0% decrease). Hospitalizations, by sex In 2019, the hospitalization rate (all causes) among females was more than 3 times that of males (120.2 per 1,000 p-yrs vs. 36.9 per 1,000 p-yrs, respectively). Excluding pregnancy and delivery, the rate of hospitalizations among females (52.0 per 1,000 p-yrs) was 40.9% higher than among males (data not shown) .Overall hospitalization rates were higher (i.e., the rate difference [RD] was greater than 1.0 per 1,000 p-yrs) among females than males for mental health disor - ders (female:male, RD: 7.7 per 1,000 1,000 p-yrs); and neoplasms (RD: 1.6 per 1,000 p-yrs) (data not shown) . With the exception of pregnancy- and delivery-related condi- tions, hospitalization rates were relatively similar among males and females for the remaining 13 major disease-specific catego- ries (data not shown) . Relationships between age and hospi - talization rates varied considerably across illness- and injury-specific categories. For example, among both males and females, hospitalization rates generally increased with age for musculoskeletal system/con - nective tissue disorders, neoplasms, and circulatory, genitourinary, ner - vous, and endocrine/nutrition/immunity disorders (Figure 2) . Among service mem - bers aged 30 years or older, there was a pro - nounced difference by sex in the slopes of the rates of neoplasms, with the rates among females notably higher than among males in the same age groups. Rates decreased with age for mental health disorders but were rel - atively stable across age groups for injury/ poisoning, signs/symptoms/ill-defined con- ditions, and infectious/parasitic diseases.Most frequent diagnoses In 2019, adjustment disorder was the most frequent discharge diagnosis among males (n=4,473) (Table 2) . Alcohol depen- dence without psy - chotic features] (n=1,123), other symptoms and signs involving emotional state (n=605), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=581) were the next 6 most frequent diag-noses in males (Table 2) . In 2019, pregnancy- and delivery- related conditions represented 4 of the top 5 leading causes of hospitalizations among females, and this category alone accounted for 56.9% of all hospitalizations of females (Table 3) . The top 5 discharge diagnoses in this condition category included post-term (late) pregnancy (n=1,183), abnormality in fetal heart rate and rhythm (n=1,013), pre-mature rupture of membranes [onset of labor within 24 hours of rupture] (n=936), maternal care due to uterine scar from previ - ous surgery (n=840), and second degree lac - eration during delivery (n=759). Other than pregnancy- and delivery-related diagnoses, leading causes of hospitalizations among females were adjustment disorder (n=1,305), recurrent major depressive disorder without psychotic features (n=532), major - sive - mental health disorder diagnoses accounted for one-sixth (17.3%) of all hospitalizations of females. Injury/poisoning As in the past, in 2019, injury/poisoning was the third leading cause of hospitaliza - tions of U.S. military members (Table 1) . Of all injury/poisoning-related hospitalizations in U.S. military medical facilities (n=3,798), more than half (58.6%) had a missing or invalid NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) code (Table 4) . Nearly one-third (31.9%) of all \"unintentional\" injury/poison-ing-related hospitalizations in U.S. military facilities (n=1,425) were considered caused by falls and miscellaneous (n=455), while land transport (n=320) accounted for 22.5% of \"unintentional\" injury/poisoning-related hospitalizations (Table 4) .FIGURE 1.

ICD, International Classification of Diseases; No., number. hospitalizations varied considerably across major diagnostic categories. For example, median lengths of hospitalizations varied from 2 days (e.g., musculoskeletal system disorders; genitourinary system disorders; signs, symptoms, and ill-defined condi - tions) to 6 days (mental health disorders). For most diagnostic categories, less than 5% of hospitalizations exceeded 12 days, but for 6 categories, 5% of hospitalizations had longer durations: nervous system/ sense organ disorders (13 days), hemato- logic disorders (13.5 days), injury/poison - ing (18 days), neoplasms (20 days), other nonpregnancy-related factors influencing health status and contact with health ser - vices (primarily orthopedic aftercare and rehabilitation following a previous illness or injury) (27 days), and mental health dis- orders (30 days) (Figure 4) . Hospitalizations, by service Among active component members of the Navy and Air Force, pregnancy- and delivery-related conditions accounted for more hospitalizations than any other category of illnesses or injuries; however, among active component members of the Army and Marine Corps, mental health disorders were the leading cause of hospi - talizations (Table 5) . The crude hospitaliza- tion rate for mental health disorders among active component Army members (16.6 per 1,000 p-yrs) was higher than among mem - bers of all other services. Injury/poisoning was the third lead - ing cause of hospitalizations in the Army and the Marine Corps, fourth in the Navy, and fifth in the Air Force (Table 5) . The hos - pitalization rate for injury/poisoning was highest among Army (6.6 per 1,000 p-yrs) and Marines Corps members (5.8 per 1,000 p-yrs) and lowest among Air Force mem - bers (3.0 per 1,000 p-yrs). EDITORIAL COMMENT The hospitalization rates for all causes among active component members in 2018 and 2019 were the lowest rates seen in the past 10 years. As in past years, in 2019, mental health disorders, pregnancy- and delivery-related conditions, and injury/poisoning accounted for more than half of all hospitalizations of active component members. Adjustment and mood disor - ders were among the leading causes of hos-pitalizations among both male and female service members. In recent years, atten-tion at the highest levels of the U.S. military and significant resources have focused on detecting, diagnosing, and treating mental health disorders\u2014especially those related to long and repeated deployments and com - bat stress. Annual numbers and crude rates of hospitalizations for mental health disor - ders increased between 2015 and 2017 and remained relatively stable between 2017 and 2019; the number of mental health disorder-related hospitalizations in 2019 was more than 3,000 greater than in 2015 and the crude rate was 19.6% higher. The reasons for the recent downturn in the trends for annual numbers of hospital - izations overall and for the slight increase in mental health disorder-related hospi - talizations in particular are not clear. It is conceivable that there has been a decline in the impact of combat and peacekeeping operations on overall morbidity among ser - vice members since the withdrawal of U.S. May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 17 forces from Iraq and the official end to com - bat operations in Afghanistan. Continued monitoring of hospitalizations and all other healthcare encounters over time may permit elucidation of the possible reasons for the recent trends in hospitalization. This summary has certain limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. For example, the scope of this report is limited to members of the active components of the U.S. Armed Forces. Many reserve component members were hospital - ized for illnesses and injuries while serving on active duty in 2019; however, these hos - pitalizations are not accounted for in this report. In addition, many injury/poison - ing-related hospitalizations occur in non- military hospitals. If there are significant differences between the causes of injuries and poisonings that resulted in hospitalizations in U.S. military and non-military hospitals, the summary of external causes of inju - ries requiring hospital treatment reported here (Table 4) could be misleading. Also, this summary is based on primary (first- listed) discharge diagnoses only; however, in many hospitalized cases, there are multiple underlying conditions. For example, mili - tary members who are wounded in combat or injured in motor vehicle accidents may have multiple injuries and complex medi - cal and psychological complications. In such cases, only the first-listed discharge diagno - sis would be accounted for in this report. Finally, the new electronic health record for the Military Health System, MHS GENESIS, was implemented at 4 military treatment facilities in the state of Washington in 2017 (Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Naval Hospi - tal Bremerton, Air Force Medical Services Fairchild, and Madigan Army Medical Cen - ter). Implementation of the second wave of MHS GENESIS sites began in 2019 and included 3 facilities in California (Travis Air Force Base [AFB], the Presidio of Mon - terey, and Naval Air Station Lemoore) and 1 in Idaho (Mountain Home AFB). Medical data from facilities using MHS GENESIS are not available in the Defense Medical Surveil - lance System. Therefore, medical encounter data for individuals seeking care at any of these facilities after their conversion to MHS GENESIS were not included in the cur - rent analysis. Even with these limitations, this report provides useful and informative insights regarding the natures, rates, and dis - tributions of the most serious illnesses and injuries that affect active component mili - tary members. MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 18 Ambulatory Visits, Active Component, U.S. Armed Forces, 2019 WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS? In 2019, the average active component ser- vice member had about 13 ambulatory en - counters. About 74% of illness- and injury-related encounters were for musculoskeletal system/connective tissue disorders, mental health disorders, nervous system/sense or - gan disorders, and signs/symptoms/ill-de-fined conditions. Rates for most illnesses and injuries tended to be higher among females than males. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? Conditions affecting the musculoskeletal sys- tem (including injuries) and mental health disorders are common causes of ambulatory encounters among active component service members. These encounters themselves limit affected members' availability for duty. These conditions that affect readiness continue to warrant research and preventive measures to reduce their impact on the force.This report documents the frequen - cies, rates, trends, and characteris- tics of ambulatory healthcare visits of active component members of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps during 2019. Ambulatory visits of U.S. ser - vice members in fixed military and non- military (reimbursed through the Military Health System [MHS]) medical treatment facilities are documented with standardized, automated records. These records are rou - tinely archived for health surveillance pur - poses in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS), which is the source of data for this report. Ambulatory visits that are not routinely and completely documented with standardized electronic records (e.g., during deployments, field training exercises, or at sea) are not included in this analysis. As in previous MSMR reports, all records of ambulatory visits of active component service members were categorized accord- ing to the first 4 characters of the Inter - national Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes entered in the pri - mary (first-listed) diagnostic position of the visit records. 1 The analysis depicts the distri - bution of diagnoses according to the 17 tra - ditional categories of the ICD system. Frequencies, rates, and trends During 2019, there were 17,431,300 reported ambulatory visits of active com - ponent service members. The crude annual rate (all causes) was 13,255.3 visits per 1,000 person-years (p-yrs) or 13.3 visits per p-yr; thus, on average, each service member had approximately 13 ambulatory encounters during the year (Table 1) . The rate of docu - mented ambulatory visits in 2019 was 4.7% higher than the rate in 2018 (12,661.4 visits TABLE 1.

In 2019, 30.9% of ambulatory vis - its were classified into the \"other\" category (i.e., other factors influencing health status and contact with health services, excluding pregnancy-related), which includes health care not related to a current illness or injury (Table 1) . Such care includes routine and spe - cial medical examinations (e.g., periodic, occupational, or retirement), therapeutic and rehabilitative treatments for previously diagnosed illnesses or injuries (e.g., physi-cal therapy), immunizations, counseling, deployment-related health assessments, and screening. In 2019, there were 12,048,041 docu - mented ambulatory visits for illnesses and injuries (ICD-10: A00-T88, including rel- evant pregnancy Z-codes), not including diagnoses classified as \"other, \" for a crude annual rate of illness- and injury-related vis - its of approximately 9.2 visits per p-yr (Table 1). The rate of ambulatory visits for illnesses and injuries in 2019 was similar to the rate in 2017 (9.1 visits per p-yr) but slightly higher than the rate in 2015 (8.0 visits per p-yr). Ambulatory visits, by diagnostic categories In 2019, 4 major diagnostic categories accounted for almost three-quarters (73.7%) of all illness- and injury-related ambula- tory visits active component service members: musculoskeletal system/connec-tive tissue disorders (36.7%); mental health disorders (16.2%); disorders of the ner - vous system and sense organs (11.3%); and signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions (9.6%) (Table 1) . Between 2015 and 2019, there were increases in the numbers of visits in 8 major diagnostic categories of illness and injury and decreases in 8 categories (Table 1) . In terms of both the numbers of ambulatory visits and the percentage change in the num-bers of visits for illnesses and injuries, the largest increases during 2015-2019 were for musculoskeletal system/connective tis - sue disorders (change: +1,204,311 visits; +37.5%) and disorders of the nervous sys - tem and sense organs (change: +304,882; +28.8%). The largest decrease in numbers of visits between 2015 and 2019 was for injury and poisoning (change: -39,049; -4.9%) (Table 1) . The largest percentage decreases in ambulatory visits during 2015-2019 were for congenital anomalies (change: - orders of the circulatory system (change: -20,840; -14.6%); and infectious and par - asitic diseases (change: -20,132; -9.5%); moreover, the rates of ambulatory visits for illnesses and injuries in 3 of these categories (congenital anomalies; endocrine, nutrition, and immunity disorders; and infectious and parasitic diseases) showed consistent decreases during the 5-year period (2015-2017 and 2017-2019). In general, the relative distributions of ambulatory visits by ICD-10 diagnostic cat-egories remained stable over the surveil - lance period (Table 1) . In a comparison of the numbers and rates of visits attributable to each of the 17 major diagnostic categories in the years 2015 and 2019, the rank orders of 1 pair of categories were exchanged: hema-tologic and immune system disorders (17th to 16th) and congenital anomalies (16th to 17th). The rank orders of the 17 major diag - nostic categories were the same in 2017 and 2019. Ambulatory visits, by sex In 2019, males accounted for nearly three-fourths (73.2%) of all illness- and injury-related visits; however, the annual crude rate among females (14.6 visits per p-yr) was 81.2% higher than that among males (8.1 visits per p-yr) (data not shown) . Excluding pregnancy- and delivery-related visits (which accounted for 10.5% of all non-Z-coded ambulatory visits among females), the illness and injury ambulatory visit rate among females was 13.1 visits per p-yr. As in the past, rates for illness- and injury-related categories were generally higher among females than males (Figure 2) . Among all illness- and injury-specific diagnoses, 3 of the 5 diagnoses with the larg - est numbers of ambulatory visits were the same for males and females. However, the crude rate (per 1,000 p-yrs) was at least 41% higher among females than males for these 3 common diagnoses: pain in joint (female: 1,853.0; male: 266.3; RR: 2.33) (data not shown) . Five other diagnoses were among the 10 most common diagnoses for both males and females: pain in limb, hand, foot, fingers, and toes; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); sleep apnea; alcohol dependence; and cervicalgia. Of note, sleep apnea was the 3rd most frequent illness- or injury-specific primary diagnosis dur - ing ambulatory visits of males, but it ranked as the 9th most common diagnosis among females. Among females, the 7th most common diagnosis was anxiety disorder, unspecified, which was the 11th most com - mon diagnosis among males (Tables 2, 3) .FIGURE 1.

ICD, International Classification of Diseases; No., number.May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 23 Across diagnostic categories, rela - tionships between age group and ambula - tory visit rates were broadly similar among males and females (Figure 2) . For example, among both males and females, ambula-tory visit rates for neoplasms and circula - tory disorders among those aged 40 years or older were 15 or more times the rates among those younger than 20 years old; in contrast, clinic visit rates for infectious and parasitic diseases were lower among the oldest com - pared to the youngest service members. As in the past, ambulatory visit rates for disor - ders of the nervous system; immu-nity; and musculoskeletal system/connec - tive tissue rose more steeply with advancing age than most other categories of illness or injury (for which rates were relatively stable or only modestly increased) (Figure 2) .Dispositions after ambulatory visits Because disposition codes are assigned to ambulatory medical encounters that occur only at military treatment facilities (MTFs), the following metrics do not include out- sourced care. Approximately 61.7% of all ill- ness- and injury-related visits resulted in \"no limitation\" (i.e., duty without limitations) dis - positions (data not shown) . Approximately 1 in 52 (1.9%) illness- and injury-related visits resulted in \"convalescence in quarters\" dis - positions (data not shown) . The illness- and injury-related diagnostic categories with the highest proportions of \"limited duty\" dispositions were injuries and poisonings (12.6%) (Figure 3) . The illness- and injury-related diagnostic categories with the highest proportions of \"convalescence in quarters\" were infectious and parasitic diseases (14.4%) and diseases of the respiratory system (13.6%). Musculo-skeletal system/connective tissue disorders (55.4%) accounted for more than one-half of all \"limited duty\" dispositions, and mental health disorders (15.4%) and injury/poison- ing (11.3%) together accounted for more than one-quarter (26.8%) (Figure 4) . Diseases of the respiratory system accounted for about three-eighths (37.8%) of all \"convalescence in quar - ters\" dispositions\u2014more than twice as many (n=87,207) as any other disease category, except signs and symptoms (21.9%). EDITORIAL COMMENT During the 5-year period, the distribu - tion of illness- and injury-related ambulatory visits in relation to their reported primary causes has remained fairly stable. In 2019, musculoskeletal system/connective tissue and mental health disorders accounted for more than one-half (52.9%) of all illness- and injury- related diagnoses documented on standard - ized records of ambulatory encounters. Over the course of the surveillance period (2015- 2017 and 2017-2019), 5 major illness- and injury-related categories (musculoskeletal sys-tem/connective tissue disorders; disorders of the nervous and sense organs; hema- tologic and immune disorders; signs/symp - toms and ill-defined conditions; and disorders of the respiratory system) showed consistent increases in numbers of ambulatory visits and rates and 3 major illness- and injury-related categories (endocrine, nutrition, parasitic dis- eases; and neoplasms) showed consistent decreases. The former upward trend is likely due, at least in part, to an increase in active duty military strength. At the end of Septem- ber 2019, there were approximately 25,000 more military personnel on active duty than at the same time in 2015. 2 During 2015-2019, the relative ranking of injuries and poisonings (rank: 6) as a pri - mary cause of ambulatory visits remained stable. However, the numbers and rates of vis - its declined by 3.5% and 5.8%, respectively, since 2017. Nevertheless, the potential mili-tary operational impacts of various conditions cannot be assessed by numbers of attributable ambulatory visits alone. For example, in 2019, injuries and poisonings accounted for approx- imately 1 of every 23 ambulatory visits overall; FIGURE 3.

Of particular note, in relation to injuries and musculoskeletal conditions, in 2019, as in the past, joint and back injuries and other disorders accounted for large num - bers of ambulatory visits; resources should continue to be focused on preventing, treat - ing, and rehabilitating back pain and injuries among active component members. It should be noted that the summary data using the major diagnostic categories of the ICD-10 system presented here deserve as detailed an examination as presented in Tables 2 and 3 . For example, the general category identified as \"nervous system\" encompasses diseases of the nervous system and the sense organs (eyes and ears). Results presented in Tables 2 and 3 indicate that the more com - mon diagnoses in this category refer to sleep disorders, disorders of refraction and accom - modation, and pain disorders. Closer scrutiny reveals that the overall increase (n=304,882) in annual visits for this category from 2015 to 2019 (described earlier) can be attributed mostly to a rise in diagnoses of organic sleep disorders from 365,822 in 2015 to 563,981 in 2019.3 Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this report. For example, ambulatory care that is deliv - ered by unit medics and at deployed medical treatment facilities (such as in Afghanistan or Iraq or at sea) may not be documented on standardized, automated records and thus not archived in the DMSS. In turn, this summary does not reflect the experience of active com - ponent military members overall to the extent that the natures and rates of illnesses and inju - ries may vary between those who are deployed and those who are not deployed. In addition, this summary is based on primary (first-listed) diagnosis codes reported on ambulatory visit records. As a result, the current summary discounts morbidity related to comorbid and complicating conditions that may have been documented in secondary diagnostic positions of the healthcare records. Furthermore, the accuracy of reported diagnoses likely varies across conditions, care providers, treatment facilities, and clinical set - tings. Although some specific diagnoses made during individual encounters may not be definitive, final, or even correct, summaries of the frequencies, natures, and trends of ambu - latory encounters among active component members are informative and potentially use - ful. For example, the relatively large numbers of ambulatory visits for mental health disor - ders in general and the large numbers of vis - its for organic sleep disorders among males reflect patterns of responses by the MHS to the effects of combat- and deployment- related stresses on active component service members. Also, this report documents all ambu - latory healthcare visits but does not provide estimates of the incidence rates of the diag - noses described. In contrast to common, self- limited, and minor illnesses and injuries that require very little, if any, follow-up or continu - ing care, illnesses and injuries that necessi - tate multiple ambulatory visits for evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation are overrepre - sented in this summary of the ambulatory burden of health care. Finally, the new elec - tronic health record for the MHS, MHS GEN - ESIS, was implemented at 4 military treatment facilities in the state of Washington in 2017 (Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Naval Hospital Bremerton, Air Force Medical Services Fair - child, and Madigan Army Medical Center). Implementation of the second wave of MHS GENESIS sites began in 2019 and included 3 facilities in California (Travis Air Force Base [AFB], the Presidio of Monterey, and Naval Air Station Lemoore) and 1 in Idaho (Moun - tain Home AFB). Medical data from facilities using MHS GENESIS are not available in the DMSS. Therefore, medical encounter data for individuals seeking care at any of these facili - ties after their conversion to MHS GENESIS were not included in the current analysis. REFERENCES 1.

The numbers of medical evacuations of ser - vice members in 2019 were roughly similar to the numbers for the previous 4 years. The proportions of evacuations that were due to battle injuries (5%) and to disease/non-battle injuries (95%) remained steady during this period. Evacuations for mental health disor - ders were the most common among the ICD- 10 major diagnostic categories. Most service members who were evacuated were soon returned to duty. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? Only 1,142 service members were evacuated during 2019, but the process of medical evac - uation of service members to Europe and CONUS is logistically demanding. The effort expended to evacuate service members to sources of definitive, modern health care is a reassuring investment in the health, welfare, and importance of the men and women serv - ing overseas. Although there have been substan - tial reductions in combat opera - tions taking place in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility (AOR) in Southwest Asia,1 the number of service members deployed to the CENTCOM AOR is still signifi - cant. Recent reports and budget docu - ments indicate that there may be as many as 15,000 service members in Afghani - stan for Operation Freedom's Sentinel and another 7,200 in Iraq and Syria for Operation Inherent Resolve.2-5 In theaters of operations such as Afghanistan, most medical care is provided by deployed mil - itary medical personnel; however, some injuries and illnesses require medical management outside the operational the - ater. In these cases, the affected individu - als are usually transported by air to a fixed military medical facility in Europe or the U.S. where the service members receive the specialized, technically advanced, and/ or prolonged diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative care required. Medical air transports, or medi - cal evacuations, are costly and generally indicative of serious medical conditions. Some serious conditions are directly related to participation in or support of combat operations (e.g., battle wounds); however, many others are unrelated to combat and may be preventable. This report summarizes the natures, numbers, and trends of conditions for which male and female military members were med - ically evacuated from CENTCOM AOR operations during 2019 and compares them to the previous 4 years. METHODS The surveillance period was 1 Janu - ary 2015 through 31 December 2019. The surveillance population included all mem - bers of the active and reserve components of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps who were deployed to the CENTCOM AOR during the period. The outcome of interest in this analysis was medical evacuations during the surveil - lance period from the CENTCOM AOR (e.g., Afghanistan or Iraq) to a medical treatment facility outside the CENTCOM AOR. Records of all medical evacuations conducted by the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) maintained in the TRANSCOM Regulating and Command & Control Evacuation Sys - tem (TRAC2ES) were utilized. Evacua - tions were included in the analyses if the affected service member had at least 1 inpatient or outpatient medical encounter in a permanent military medical facility in the U.S. or Europe during a time interval extending from 5 days before to 10 days after the reported evacuation date. Medical evacuations included in the analyses were classified by the causes and natures of the precipitating medical con - ditions (based on information reported in relevant evacuation and medical encoun - ter records). First, all medical conditions that resulted in evacuations were classified as either \"battle injuries\" or \"non-battle injuries and illnesses\" (based on entries in an indicator field of the TRAC2ES In 2019, there were 1,142 medical evacuations of service members from the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility that were followed by at least 1 medical encounter in a fixed medical facility outside the operational theater. There were more medical evacuations for mental health disorders than for any other single category of illnesses or injuries. The number of medical evacua - tions attributable to battle injuries increased steadily from 2015 through 2017 then decreased in 2018 and remained relatively stable through 2019, for an overall increase of 65.7%. The number of medical evacuations attributable to non-battle injuries and illnesses remained relatively stable through 2017, rose slightly in 2018, and decreased in 2019. Compared to their respective coun - terparts, non-Hispanic white service members, those aged 20-24 years, Army members, junior and senior enlisted personnel, and those in repair/engineer - ing occupations accounted for the largest proportions of medical evacuations. Most service members who were evacuated were returned to normal duty sta - tus following their post-evacuation hospitalizations or outpatient encounters. MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 28 evacuation record). Evacuations due to non-battle injuries and illnesses were subclassified into 17 illness/injury cate - gories based on International Classifica - tion of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions (ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively) diag - nostic codes reported on the records of medical encounters after evacuation. For the purposes of this report, all records of hospitalizations and ambulatory vis - its from 5 days before to 10 days after the reported date of each medical evacuation were identified. In most cases, the primary (first-listed) diagnosis for either a hospi - talization (if any occurred) or the earli - est ambulatory visit after evacuation was considered indicative of the condition responsible for the evacuation. However, if the first-listed diagnostic code specified the external cause (rather than the nature) of an injury (ICD-9 E-code; ICD-10 V-, W-, X-, or Y-code) or an encounter for something other than a current illness or injury (e.g., observation, medical exami - nation, or vaccination [ICD-9 V-codes; ICD-10 Z-codes, other than those related to pregnancy]), then secondary diagnoses that specified illnesses and injuries (ICD- 9: 001-999; ICD-10: A00-T88) were con - sidered the likely reasons for the subject evacuations. If there was no secondary diagnosis or if the secondary diagnosis also was an external cause code, the first- listed diagnostic code of a subsequent encounter was used. The disposition after each medi - cal evacuation was determined by using the disposition code associated with the medical encounter that was used for documenting the category of the medi - cal evacuation. Inpatient disposition cat - egories were returned to duty (code 01), transferred/discharged to other facility (codes 02-04, 09, 21-28, 43, or 61-66), died (codes 20, 30, 40-42, 50, or 51), sep - arated from service (codes 10-15), and other/unknown. Outpatient disposition categories were released without limita - tion (code 1), released with work/duty lim - itation (code 2), immediate referral (code 4), sick at home/quarters (codes 3 or S), admitted/transferred to civilian hospital (codes 7, 9, A-D, or U), died (codes 8 or G), discharged home (code F), and other/ unknown. RESULTS In 2019, a total of 1,142 medical evacuations of service members from the CENTCOM AOR were followed by at least 1 medical encounter in a fixed medi - cal facility outside the operational theater (Table 1) . Overall, there were more medi - cal evacuations for mental health disor - ders (n=309; 27.1%) than for any other single category of illnesses or injuries. In addition, the numbers of evacuations for non-battle injuries and poisonings (n=275; 24.1%); signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions (n=111; of musculoskeletal system/con - nective all higher than the number of evacua - tions for battle injuries (n=58; 5.1%).

During 2015-2019, the annual num - ber of medical evacuations attribut - able to battle injuries increased steadily from 2015 (n=35) through 2017 (n=71), decreased in 2018 (n=56), and remained relatively stable through 2019 (n=58) (Fig- ure). Over the 5-year period, the annual number of battle injury-related evacu - ations increased 65.7% from the nadir in 2015. The annual number of medi - cal evacuations attributable to non-battle injuries and diseases remained relatively stable at low levels in 2015 (n=1,050), 2016 (n=1,010), and 2017 (n=1,024), increased in 2018 (n=1,209), and decreased in 2019 (n=1,084). In general, the annual numbers of medical evacuations over the course of the 5-year period varied in relation to the numbers of deployed service members, with the highest yearly counts of medical evacuations occurring in 2017 and 2018. The monthly numbers of medical evacua - tions decreased or remained stable in 2019 (Figure) . Demographic and military characteristics The number of medical evacuations in 2019 was higher among males (n=962) than females (n=180) (Tables 1, 2) . The most frequent causes of medical evacua - tions among male service members were non-battle injury and poisoning (n=250; 26.0%); mental health disorders (n=236; signs, - tive system disorders (n=92; 9.6%) (Table 1). Among female service members, the most frequent causes of medical evacua - tions were mental health disorders (n=73; 40.6%); non-battle injury and poison - ing (n=25; symptoms, and ill-defined conditions (n=18; 10.0%); and digestive system disorders (n=14; 7.8%). Compared to males, female service members had notably higher percentages of medical evacuations for mental health disorders and genitourinary system dis - orders (Table 1) . In contrast, male service members had higher percentages of evac - uation for injuries (both battle and non- battle related). There was just 1 medical evacuation of a female service member during 2019 for a battle injury. Within the various demographic and military characteristics of those service members who were evacuated, the largest numbers and proportions of evacuees were among non-Hispanic white service mem - bers, those aged 20-24 years, members of the Army, junior and senior enlisted per - sonnel, and those in repair/engineering occupations (Table 2) . In 2019, most medi - cal evacuations (85.2%) were character - ized as having routine precedence. The remainder had priority (10.9%) or urgent (3.9%) precedence. All but 27 (2.4%) of the medical evacuations were accomplished through military transport (Table 2) .

Of the remain - ing 5 most common 3-digit diagnoses associated with evacuations of males, 1 was related to digestive system diseases (\"inguinal hernia\"); 3 were injuries (\"frac - ture at wrist and hand level, \" \"intracranial injury, \" and \"injury of muscle, fascia and tendon at shoulder and upper arm level\"); and 1 was related to musculoskeletal dis - orders (\"dorsalgia\") (Table 3) . Of the remaining top 5 diagnoses most frequently associated with evacua - tions of female service members, 1 was a condition that primarily affects women (\"unspecified lump in breast\"); 1 was an injury (\"fracture of lower leg, including ankle\"); 2 were mental health disorders (\"other anxiety disorders\" and \"major depressive disorder, single episode\"); and 1 was related to musculoskeletal disorders (\"dorsalgia\") (Table 3) . Disposition Of the 1,142 medical evacuations reported in 2019, a total of 486 (42.6%) resulted in inpatient encounters. About three-quarters (75.7%) of all service mem - bers who were hospitalized after medical evacuations were discharged back to duty. Slightly less than one-fifth (18.7%) of ser - vice members who were hospitalized after medical evacuations were transferred or discharged to other facilities (Table 4) . Return to duty dispositions were much more likely after hospitalizations for non-battle injuries (72.3%) than for battle injuries (30.0%). The majority (70.0%) of battle injury-related hospitalizations and a little more than one-sixth (17.0%) of non-battle injury-related hospitalizations resulted in transfers/discharges facilities (Table 4) . Nearly three-fifths (n=656; 57.4%) of all medical evacuations resulted in out - patient encounters only. Of the service members who were treated exclusively in outpatient settings after evacuations, the majority (80.9%) were discharged back to duty without work/duty limitations; 13.9% were released with work/duty limitations; and less than 1% each were admitted/transferred to a civilian hospital, imme - diately referred, or discharged to \"home sick\" for recuperation. Service members treated as outpatients after battle injury- related evacuations were more likely to be released without limitations (n=14; 77.8%) than medical evacuees treated as outpatients for non-battle injuries (n=125; 69.1%) (Table 4) . EDITORIAL COMMENT This report documented that only 5.1% of all medical evacuations during 2019 were associated with battle injuries. Counts of evacuations for battle inju - ries peaked in 2017, likely reflecting an increase in the number of service mem - bers deployed to the CENTCOM AOR. More evacuations in 2019 were attrib - uted to mental health disorders than to any other category of illness or injury; the next most common categories, in descending order of frequency, were non-battle injuries and poisonings; signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions; digestive system disorders; and muscu - loskeletal disorders. during the entire 5-year surveillance period fol - lowed a similar but slightly different pat - tern, with mental health disorders being the most frequent followed by non-bat - tle injuries; musculoskeletal disorders; signs, symptoms and ill-defined condi - tions; and digestive system disorders. Of the major diagnostic categories for which there was more than 1 medical evacuation for both men and women, only percent - ages of evacuations for injuries (battle and non-battle) were noticeably higher among males compared to females. As in previ - ous years, the majority of service mem - bers who were evacuated were returned to normal duty status following their post- evacuation hospitalizations or outpatient encounters. However, about one-half of those evacuated for battle injuries were returned to duty immediately after their initial healthcare encounters. Overall, the changes in numbers of medical evacuations over the course of the surveillance period reflect the end of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2014, TABLE 2.

Moreover, the fact that very few medical evacuations were conducted for chronic conditions such as hemato - logic disorders and congenital anoma - lies supports the idea that most deployers were sufficiently healthy for deployment. However, it is not surprising that such conditions are occasionally diagnosed among deployed service members. For example, there was 1 medical evacuation for congenital anomalies in 2019 that was due to an instance of \"other congenital malformations of nervous system\" (data not shown) . Because congenital anomalies may not be identified and diagnosed until later in life,7 the infrequent detection of such diagnoses during deployment is not unexpected. The proportion of medical evacua - tions attributed to mental health disor - ders (27.1%) was similar to the proportion reported in recent MSMR analyses of medical evacuations in 2018 (28.2%) but slightly higher than the proportion reported in 2017 (23.6%) and consider - ably higher than the proportion (11.6%) reported in an earlier MSMR report examining evacuations from Iraq during a 9-year period between 2003 and 2011.1,8 However, that article also reported that during the last 4 years (2008-2011) of the surveillance period, as the proportion of evacuations for battle injuries fell sharply, the proportions of evacuations for mental disorders increased dramatically for both males (peak of 20.9% in 2010) and females (peak of 26.6% in 2010). Although some studies have indicated improved access to mental health care in deployed set - tings, the results from the current analy - sis indicate that mental health diagnoses still represent the single most common basis for medical evacuations out of the CENTCOM AOR.9 This could be due, at least in part, to variations in the availabil - ity of mental health care in deployed set - tings. In these settings, the distribution of providers and clinics that deliver such services is uneven and varies according to factors such as the number of deployed personnel and the assessed needs of the particular unit.9 In addition, although the number of mental healthcare providers in MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 32 Afghanistan increased from 2005 through 2010, this number decreased after 2013 as part of the overall drawdown of U.S. troops from the region.9 Several important limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis. Direct compari - sons of numbers and percentages of med - ical evacuations by cause, as between males and females, can be mislead - ing; for example, such comparisons do not account for differences between the groups in other characteristics (e.g., age, grade, military occupation, locations, and activities while deployed) that are signifi - cant determinants of medical evacuation risk. Also, for this report, most causes of medical evacuations were estimated from primary (first-listed) diagnoses that were recorded during hospitalizations or initial outpatient encounters after evacuation. In some cases, clinical evaluations in fixed medical treatment facilities after medical evacuations may have ruled out serious conditions that were clinically suspected in the theater. For this analysis, the causes of such evacuations reflect diagnoses that were determined after evaluations outside of the theater rather than diagno - ses\u2014perhaps of severe disease\u2014that were clinically suspected in the theater. To the extent that this occurred, the causes of some medical evacuations may seem sur - prisingly minor. Overall, the results highlight the continued need to tailor force health protection policies, training, supplies, equipment, and practices based on char - acteristics of the deployed force (e.g., combat vs. support; male vs. female) and the nature of the military operations (e.g., combat vs. humanitarian assistance).

The MSMR editorial staff will review suggested topics for feasibility and compatibility with the journal's health surveillance goals. As is the case with most of the analyses and reports produced by Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch staff, studies that would take advantage of the healthcare and personnel data contained in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) would be the most plausible types. For each promising topic, Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch staff members will design and carry out the data analysis, interpret the results, and write a manuscript to report on the study. This invitation represents a willingness to consider good ideas from anyone who shares the MSMR' s objective to publish evidence-based reports on subjects relevant to the health, safety, and well-being of military service members and other beneficiaries of the Military Health System (MHS). In addition, the MSMR encourages the submission for publication of reports on evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, or trends of illness and injuries among members of the U.S. Armed Forces and other beneficiaries of the MHS. Information about manu - script submissions is available at www.health.mil/MSMRInstructions .

Three categories of morbidity burdens (injury/ poisoning, musculoskeletal diseases, and signs/symptoms and ill-defined conditions) accounted for more than half of the total bur - den in theater. In 2019, the percentages of encounters due to mental health disorders decreased to levels much lower than dur - ing earlier periods of combat engagements. Compared to garrison disease burden, de - ployed service members had higher propor - tions of encounters for respiratory infections, skin diseases, and infectious and parasitic diseases. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? The similarities between the burden of dis - ease and injury among deployed and non- deployed service members emphasize the continuing need for surveillance, research, and preventive measures for those ever-pres - ent health threats. The dissimilarities highlight those special health threats associated with the more austere environments of deploy - ment areas and the needed area-specific pre - ventive measures of importance.Every year, the MSMR estimates ill - ness- and injury-related morbid - ity and healthcare burdens on the U.S. Armed Forces and the Military Health System (MHS) using electronic records of medical encounters from the Defense Med - ical Surveillance System (DMSS). These records document health care delivered in the fixed medical facilities of the MHS and in civilian medical facilities when care is paid for by the MHS. Healthcare encoun - ters of deployed service members are doc - umented in records that are maintained in the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS), which is incorporated into the DMSS. This report updates previous analyses examin - ing the distributions of illnesses and inju - ries that accounted for medical encounters (\"morbidity burdens\") of active component members in deployed settings in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) areas of operations during the 2019 calendar year.1 METHODS The surveillance population included all individuals who served in the active or reserve components of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps and who had records of healthcare encounters cap - tured in the TMDS during the surveil - lance period. The analysis was restricted to encounters where the theater of care specified was CENTCOM or AFRICOM or where the theater of operation was missing or null; by default, this excluded encounters in the U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Euro - pean Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Com - mand, or U.S. Southern Command theater of operations. In addition, TMDS-recorded medical encounters where the data source was identified as Shipboard Automated Medical System (e.g., SAMS, SAMS8, SAMS9) or where the military treatment facility descriptor indicated care was pro - vided aboard a ship (e.g., USS George H.W . Bush or USS Dwight D. Eisenhower ) were excluded from this analysis. Encounters from aeromedical staging facilities out - side of CENTCOM or AFRICOM (e.g., the 779th Medical Group Aeromedical Staging Facility or the 86th Contingency Aeromed - ical Staging Facility) were also excluded. Inpatient and outpatient medical encoun - ters were summarized according to the pri - mary (first-listed) diagnoses (if reported with an International Classification of Dis - eases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] code between 001 and 999 or beginning with V27 or with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code between A00 and T88 or beginning with Z37). Pri - mary diagnoses that did not correspond to an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code (e.g., 1XXXX, 4XXXX) were not reported in this burden analysis. In tandem with the methodology described on page 2 of this issue of the MSMR , all illness- and injury-specific diag - noses were grouped into 151 burden of disease-related conditions and 25 major categories based on a modified version of the classification system developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.2 The morbidity burdens attributable to vari - ous conditions were estimated on the basis of the total number of medical encounters attributable to each condition (i.e., total hospitalizations and ambulatory visits for the condition with a limit of 1 encounter per individual per condition per day) and the numbers of service members affected by the conditions. In general, the GBD system groups diagnoses with common pathophysiologic or etiologic bases and/ or significant international health policy - making importance. For this analysis, some diagnoses that are grouped into single cat - egories in the GBD system (e.g., mental health disorders) were disaggregated. Also, injuries were categorized by the affected anatomic sites rather than by causes because external causes of injuries are not completely reported in TMDS records. It is important to note that because the TMDS has not fully transitioned to ICD-10 codes, some ICD-9 codes appear in this analysis. In addition to the examination of the dis - tribution of diagnoses by the 151 condi - tions and the 25 major categories of disease burden, a third analysis depicts the distri - bution of diagnoses according to the 17 tra - ditional categories of the ICD system. RESULTS In 2019, a total of 191,887 medical encounters occurred among 69,405 indi - viduals while deployed to Southwest Asia/ Middle East and Africa. A majority of the medical encounters (77.4%) and individu - als affected (81.8%) occurred among males (Figures 1a, 1b) . MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 34 Medical encounters/individuals affected, by burden of disease categories During 2019, the percentages of total medical encounters by burden of dis - ease categories in both deployed men and women were generally similar; in both sexes, more encounters were attributable to injury/poisoning, musculoskeletal diseases, and signs/symptoms (including ill-defined 1b, 2a, 2b) . Of note, females had a greater proportion of medical encounters for genitourinary diseases (5.6%) com - pared to males (1.2%). Females also had a higher proportion of medical encounters for mental health disorders (9.1%) com - pared to males (5.2%). Among both males and females, 5 bur - den conditions (other back problems, arm and shoulder injuries, knee injuries, foot and ankle injuries, and upper respiratory infections) were among the top 6 burden conditions that accounted for the most medical encounters in 2019 (Figures 3a, 3b) . The remaining burden conditions among the top 6 were organic sleep disorders (specifically, circadian rhythm disorders) among males and all other signs and symp - toms among females. The 4-digit ICD-10 code with the most medical encounters in the other back prob - lems category during 2019 was for lum - bago/low back pain (data not shown) . For all other musculoskeletal diseases, the most common 4-digit ICD code for both males and females was for cervicalgia. The most common 4-digit ICD-10 code for arm and shoulder injuries among males and for knee injuries among males and females was for pain in the specified body part (e.g., pain in right or left shoulder or pain in right or left knee) (data not shown) . Of note, among males, less than 0.3% of all medical encounters during deploy - ment were associated with any of the fol - lowing major morbidity categories: other neoplasms, metabolic/immunity disorders, endocrine disorders, congenital anomalies, blood disorders, malignant neoplasms, nutritional disorders, diabetes, and perina - tal conditions (Figure 1a) . Among females, less than 0.3% of all medical encounters during deployment were associated with endocrine disorders, other neoplasms, blood disorders, nutritional disorders, maternal conditions, congenital anomalies, malignant neoplasms, metabolic/immunity disorders, perinatal conditions, and diabe - tes mellitus (Figure 1b) . Among both sexes in 2019, injury/ poisoning, musculoskeletal diseases, and signs/symptoms were the top 3 cat - egories that affected the most individuals; FIGURE 1 a.

Medical encounters, by major ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnostic category In 2019, among the 17 major ICD-9/ ICD-10 diagnostic categories, the largest percentages of medical encounters were attributable to musculoskeletal system and \"other\" (includes factors influencing health status and contact with health ser - vices as well as external causes of morbid - ity) (Figure 4) . The percentage of medical encounters attributable to musculoskele - tal system conditions increased from 2015 through 2019, and the percentage attribut - able to \"other\" decreased during the same period. Of note, the percentages of medi - cal encounters attributable to mental health disorders decreased slightly from 6.4% in 2015 to 4.7% in 2019. However, the per - centage of medical encounters attribut - able to disorders of the nervous system and sense organs more than doubled from 3.5% in 2015 to 7.8% in 2019. The percentages of medical encounters attributable to other major ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnostic catego - ries were relatively similar during the years 2015, 2017, and 2019. EDITORIAL COMMENT This report documents the morbidity and healthcare burden among U.S. mili - tary members while deployed to South - west Asia/Middle East and Africa during 2019. Similar to results from earlier sur - veillance periods,1,3 3 burden catego - ries\u2014injury/poisoning, musculoskeletal diseases, and signs/symptoms\u2014together accounted for more than 50% of the total healthcare burden in theater among both male and female deployers. However, the 2019 percentages of encounters due to mental health disorders among males and females (5.2% and 9.1%, respec - tively) were much smaller than sponding percentages during 2008-2014 (13.1% and 13.8%, respectively).3 Compared to the distribution of major burden of disease categories doc - umented in garrison, this report dem - onstrates relatively greater proportions of in-theater medical encounters due to respiratory infections, skin diseases, and infectious and parasitic diseases. The lack of certain amenities and greater expo - sure to austere environmental conditions may have compromised hygienic prac - tices and contributed to this finding.

However, 4 of the top 5 major burden of disease categories in-theater\u2014injury/ poisoning, musculoskeletal diseases, signs/symptoms, and mental health dis - orders\u2014were the same as those reported in non-deployed settings.4 Injury and musculoskeletal diseases ranked first and second in both settings. In garrison settings, mental health disorders, signs/ symptoms, and neurologic conditions ranked third through fifth.4 In contrast, sign/symptoms, respiratory infections, and mental health disorders ranked third through fifth in deployed settings. The similarity in these top conditions is likely attributable to the fact that both deployed and non-deployed populations generally comprise young and healthy individuals undergoing strenuous physical and men - tal tasks. Some of the similarity in the top conditions could also be attributed to service members receiving follow-up care once out of theater. For example, a ser - vice member medically evacuated out of theater for an injury could have encoun - ters for injury recorded in both deployed and non-deployed (hospital or ambula - tory care) settings. Encounters for certain conditions are not expected to occur often in deploy - ment settings. For example, the presence of some conditions (e.g., diabetes, preg - nancy, or congenital anomalies) makes the affected service members ineligible for deployment. As a result of this selec - tion process, deployed service members are generally healthier than their non- deployed counterparts and, specifically, less likely to require medical care for conditions that preclude deployment. The overall result of such predeploy - ment medical screening is diminished healthcare burdens (as documented in the TMDS) related to certain disease categories.

Not all medi - cal encounters in theaters of operation are captured in the TMDS. Some care is rendered by medical personnel at small, remote, or austere forward locations where electronic documentation of diag - noses and treatment is not feasible. As a result, the data described in this report likely underestimate the total burden of health care actually provided in the areas of operation examined. In particular, some emergency medical care provided to stabilize combat-injured service mem - bers before evacuation may not be rou - tinely captured in the TMDS. Another limitation derives from the potential for misclassification of diagnoses due to errors in the coding of diagnoses entered into the electronic health record. Although the aggregated distributions of illnesses and injuries found in this study are compatible with expectations derived from other examinations of morbidity in military populations (both deployed and non-deployed), instances of incor - rect diagnostic codes (e.g., coding a spi - nal cord injury using a code that denotes the injury was suffered as a birth trauma rather than using a code indicating injury in an adult) warrant care in the interpre - tation of some findings. Although such coding errors are not common, their presence serves as a reminder of the extent to which this study depends on the capture of accurate information in the sometimes austere deployment envi - ronment in which healthcare encounters occur.REFERENCES 1.

In 2019, as in previous years, findings em - phasize the considerable differences in the types of diseases and injuries affecting non- service member beneficiaries compared to those affecting service members. Many of the differences can be attributed to differences in the age distributions of the 2 populations. The results of this analysis document that most healthcare services in the Military Health System are delivered to non-service member beneficiaries instead of service members. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? The care rendered to non-service member beneficiaries represents an important benefit to the families of service members and to re - tired service members. The provision of such care offers reassurance to service members that their families are receiving good health care, freeing them from worries about their families while engaged in national defense.Individuals who are eligible for care through the Military Health System (MHS) (\"beneficiaries\") include active component service members and their eli - gible family members, activated National Guard and Reserve service members and their eligible family members, and retir - ees and their eligible family members. In 2019, there were approximately 9.51 mil - lion beneficiaries eligible for health care in the MHS: 1.38 million active duty and acti - vated reserve component service members, 1.68 million active duty family members, 190,000 Guard/Reserve members, 780,000 Guard/Reserve family members, and 5.49 million retirees and their family members.1 Some beneficiaries of MHS care do not enroll in the healthcare plans provided by the MHS (e.g., they use insurance through their own employment), and some of those who are enrolled do not seek care through the MHS. MHS beneficiaries may receive care from resources provided directly by the Uniformed Services (i.e., military medical treatment facilities [MTFs]) or from civil - ian healthcare resources (i.e., outsourced [purchased] care) that supplement direct military medical care.1 In 2019, approxi - mately 6.5 million non-service member beneficiaries utilized inpatient or outpa - tient services provided by the MHS (data source: the Defense Medical Surveillance System [DMSS]). In the population of non-service member MHS care recipients in 2019, there were more females (56.8%) than males (43.2%); more infants, chil - dren, and adolescents (those younger than 20 years old: n=1.67 million; 25.5%) and more seniors (those aged 65 (data not shown) . Since 1998, the MSMR has published annual summaries of the numbers and rates of hospitalizations and outpatient medical encounters to assess the healthcare burdens of 16 categories of illnesses and injuries among active component military members. Beginning in 2001, the MSMR complemented those summaries with annual reports on the combined healthcare burden of both inpatient and outpatient care for 25 categories of health care. Since then, the MSMR 's annual burden issue has contained a report on hospital care, ambu - latory care, and the overall burden of care each for active component service mem - bers. In 2014, for the first time and using similar methodology, the MSMR published a report that quantified the healthcare bur - den for illnesses and injuries among non- service members in calendar year 2013.2 The current report represents an update and provides a summary of care pro - vided to non-service members in the MHS TABLE.

Nearly all records of encounters with first-listed diagnoses that were Z-codes (care other than for a cur - rent illness or injury\u2014e.g., general medi - cal examinations, after care, vaccinations) or V/W/X/Y-codes (indicators of the exter - nal causes but not the natures of injuries) were excluded from the analysis; however, encounters with primary diagnoses of Z37 (\"outcome of delivery, single liveborn\") were retained. For summary purposes, all illness- and injury-specific diagnoses (as defined by the ICD-10) were grouped into 151 burden of disease-related conditions and 25 major categories based on a modified version of the classification system developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study.3 The methodology for summarizing absolute and relative morbidity burdens is described on page 2 of this issue of the MSMR .

Implementation of the second wave of MHS GENESIS sites began in 2019 and included 3 facilities in California (Tra - vis Air Force Base [AFB], the Presidio of Monterey, and Naval Air Station Lemoore) and 1 in Idaho (Mountain Home AFB). Medical data from facilities using MHS GENESIS are not available in the DMSS. Therefore, medical encounter data for indi - viduals seeking care at any of these facilities after their conversion to MHS GENESIS were not included in the current analysis. RESULTS In 2019, a total of 6,576,473 non-ser - vice member beneficiaries of the MHS had 89,409,223 medical encounters (Table) .

Direct care vs. outsourced care In 2019, among non-service mem - ber beneficiaries, most medical encounters (91.4%) were in non-military medical facil - ities (outsourced care) (Table) . Of all ben - eficiaries with any illness or injury-related encounters during the year, many more received exclusively outsourced care (n=4,868,156; 74.0%) than either military medical (direct) care only (n=627,589; 9.5%) or both outsourced and direct care (n=1,080,728; 16.4%). By far, most inpa - tient care (93.2% of all bed days) was received in non-military facilities. The proportions of medical encoun - ters by morbidity-related categories were broadly similar for direct and out - sourced care (Figures 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b) . How - ever, encounters for injury/poisoning and respiratory infections were relatively more common in direct (13.1% and 8.0%, respec - tively) compared to outsourced (10.0% and 3.5%, respectively) care. Musculo - skeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurologic conditions, and malignant neo - plasms were relatively more common in outsourced (12.3%, 9.4%, 4.9%, and 3.3%, respectively) compared to direct (9.1%, 5.4%, 2.2%, and 1.5%, respectively) care. Maternal conditions accounted for 21.6% of all direct care bed days but only 3.9% of all outsourced care bed 3a, 3b) . diseases, mental health disorders, and musculoskeletal diseases accounted for rel - atively more of all outsourced than direct care bed days (% of outsourced vs. % of direct care bed days: cardiovascular, 17.7% vs. 11.8%; mental health, 10.2% 5.7% vs. 4.6%). Pediatric beneficiaries (aged 0-17 years) In 2019, pediatric beneficiaries accounted for 14.3% of all medical encoun - ters, 23.1% of all individuals affected, and 7.8% of all hospital bed days (Table) . On average, each affected individual had 8.4 medical encounters during the year. Mental health disorders accounted for slightly more than one-third (34.9%; n=4,449,523) of all medical encounters and 59.8% of all hospital bed days (n=302,508) among pediatric beneficiaries (Figures 4a, 4b). On average, each pediatric beneficiary who was affected by a mental health disor - der had 15.2 mental health disorder-related encounters during the year. More than two- thirds (68.3%) of all medical encounters for mental health disorders among pedi - atric beneficiaries were for autistic disor - der (35.0%), developmental disorders of speech and language (22.9%), and atten - tion deficit disorders (10.4%) (Figures 4c, 4d). On average, there were 49.2 autism- related encounters per individual affected with autistic disorder and 16.3 encounters for developmental disorders of speech and language per individual affected with those specific disorders (data not shown) . Despite the high numbers of encounters associated with these 3 categories of mental health disorders, 44.0% of mental health disorder- related bed days were attributable to mood disorders and 42.1% of mood-related bed days were attributable to \"major depres - sive disorder, recurrent severe without psy - chotic features\" (data not shown) .

Of note, among pediatric beneficiaries with at least 1 illness or injury-related diagnosis, those with malignant neoplasms had the second highest number of related encoun - ters per affected individual (13.5). The high - est numbers of malignant neoplasm-related encounters were attributable to leukemias, \"all other malignant neoplasms, \" and brain neoplasms, while the highest numbers of bed days were attributable to leukemias, brain neoplasms, and \"all other malignant neoplasms\" (data not shown) . Finally, respiratory infections (includ - ing upper and lower respiratory infections and otitis media) accounted for relatively more medical encounters and bed days among pediatric beneficiaries (12.3% and 4.3%, respectively) when compared to any older age group of beneficiaries (Figures 4b, 5b, 6b, and 7b) .

On average, each indi - vidual affected with an illness or injury (any cause) had 8.5 medical encounters during the year. Among beneficiaries aged 18-44 years, the morbidity-related category that accounted for the most medical encounters was mental health disorders (n=2,356,465; 19.2% of all encounters) (Figures 5a, 5b) . Among these adult beneficiaries, mental health disorders accounted for 20.7% of all bed days, and, on average, each adult affected by a mental health disorder had 6.9 mental health disorder-related encounters during the year. Mood disorders (32.7%), anxiety disorders (28.8%), and adjustment disorders (17.2%) accounted for nearly four-fifths (78.7%) of all mental health dis - order-related medical encounters among beneficiaries aged 18-44 years (data not shown) .

Normal deliveries accounted for 10.7% of mater - nal condition-related medical encounters (data not shown) . Adults aged 18-44 years accounted for nearly all (99.3%) maternal condition-related bed days among benefi - ciaries not in military service. Although adults aged 18-44 years had the lowest percentage of total medical encounters (13.7%), if morbidity burdens associated with maternal conditions were excluded from the overall analysis, this age group would account for even lower percentages of total medical encounters (12.8%) and the lowest percentage of total hospital bed days (6.4%) when compared to any other age group (data not shown). Among beneficiaries aged 18-44 years with at least 1 illness or injury-related diag - nosis, those with malignant neoplasms had the second most (along with maternal con - ditions) category-specific encounters per affected individual (6.3). Of all malignant MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 48 neoplasms, breast cancer accounted for the most malignant neoplasm-related encoun - ters (28.9% of the total) (data not shown) . Beneficiaries (aged 45-64 years) In 2019, non-service member ben - eficiaries aged 45-64 years accounted for 20.4% of all medical encounters, 22.9% of all individuals affected, and 14.4% of hospital bed days (Table) . On average, each affected individual had 12.1 medical encounters during the year. Of all morbidity-related categories, musculoskeletal diseases accounted for the most medical encounters (n=2,771,318; 15.2%) among older adult beneficiaries (Figures 6a, 6b) . In addition, in this age group, back problems accounted for 44.4% of all musculoskeletal disease-related encounters (data not shown) . Cardiovas - cular diseases accounted for more hospi - tal bed days (16.5% of the total) than any other category of illnesses or injuries, and cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease accounted for 32.4% and 18.0%, respectively, of all cardiovascular disease- related bed days (data not shown) . Digestive diseases accounted for a larger percentage (9.4%) of total hospital bed days among beneficiaries in this age group compared to those in the other age groups. The most medical encounters per affected individual were associated with malignant neoplasms (6.3), mental health disorders (6.0), maternal conditions (5.3), musculoskeletal diseases (5.0), neuro - logic conditions (4.5), injury/poisoning (4.3), and respiratory diseases (4.2) (data not shown) . Malignant neoplasms (7.9%) accounted for a larger proportion of total bed days among beneficiaries aged 45-64 years than among the other age groups of beneficiaries. Breast cancer accounted for nearly one-fourth (24.0%) of all malignant neoplasm-related encounters among older adult beneficiaries (data not shown) . Beneficiaries (aged 65 years or older) In 2019, non-service member benefi - ciaries aged 65 years or older accounted for slightly more than half (51.6%) of all medi - cal encounters, nearly one-third (31.9%) of all individuals affected, and slightly more than two-thirds (66.7%) of hospital bed days (Table 1) . On average, each affected individual had 22.0 medical encounters during the year. Of all morbidity-related categories, musculoskeletal diseases (n=6,476,843; 14.0%) and cardiovascular diseases (n=6,297,744; 14.0%) accounted for the most medical encounters, but cardiovas - cular diseases accounted for the most bed days (941,244 days; 21.9%) (Figures 7a, 7b) . Back problems accounted for a little more than one-third (36.3%) of all musculoskeletal disease-related medi - cal encounters but only 1.6% of hospi - tal bed days (data not shown) . Essential hypertension (26.3%), ischemic heart dis - ease (14.3%), and cerebrovascular disease (9.8%) accounted for slightly more than half (50.4%) of all cardiovascular disease- related medical encounters, and cere - brovascular disease accounted for over one-quarter (29.1%) of all cardiovascular disease-related bed days (data not shown) . Among the oldest age group of bene - ficiaries, the most medical encounters per affected individual were associated with musculoskeletal diseases (6.6), malig - nant neoplasms (5.8), respiratory diseases (5.7), diseases of the genitourinary system (5.4), cardiovascular diseases (5.2), and mental health disorders (5.1) (Figure 7a) . In this age group, melanomas and other skin cancers (20.2%); prostate cancer (14.5%); breast cancer (12.2%); and tra - chea, bronchus, and lung cancers (10.6%) accounted for more than half (57.5%) of all malignant neoplasm-related encoun - ters (data not shown) . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounted for more than two-fifths of all medical encounters (41.4%) and approximately one-third of all bed days (35.3%) attributable to respi - ratory diseases (data not shown) . Infectious and parasitic diseases (8.1%) accounted for a larger proportion of total bed days among the oldest age group compared to the other age groups of ben - eficiaries (Figures 7a, 7b) . In contrast, men - tal health disorders accounted for smaller percentages of medical encounters (2.6%) and bed days (2.5%) among the oldest age group compared to the younger age groups.EDITORIAL COMMENT This report describes the seventh esti - mate of overall morbidity burdens among non-service member beneficiaries of the MHS. The report notes that a large major - ity of the healthcare services for current illness and injury (excluding encounters with diagnoses identified by Z-codes) that are provided through the MHS to non-ser - vice member beneficiaries are delivered in non-military medical facilities (i.e., out - sourced [purchased] care). The report also documents that there are pronounced dif - ferences in the types of morbidity and the natures of the care provided for evaluation and treatment across age groups of benefi - ciaries. Of particular note, individuals aged 65 years or older \u201431.9% of all non-service member beneficiaries \u2014accounted for more than half (51.6%) of all medical encounters and two-thirds (66.7%) of all hospital bed days delivered to all such beneficiaries. In 2019, as in previous years, men - tal health disorders accounted for the largest proportions of the morbidity and healthcare burdens that affected the pedi - atric (aged 0-17 years) and younger adult (aged 18-44 years) beneficiary age groups. Among pediatric beneficiaries, 68.3% of medical encounters for mental health dis - orders were attributable to autistic disorder, developmental speech/language disorders, or attention deficit disorders. Of particu - lar note, children affected by autistic dis - order had, on average, 49.2 autism-related encounters each during the 1-year surveil - lance period. Although mental health disorders also accounted for more medical encoun - ters among young adult (18-44 years) ben - eficiaries than any other major category of illnesses or injuries, the proportion of all encounters attributable to mental health disorders was markedly lower among young adult (19.2%) than pediatric (35.0%) beneficiaries. Also, as expected, the men - tal health disorders that accounted for the largest healthcare burdens among younger adults (18-44 years)\u2014mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders\u2014differed from those that most affected the pediatric age group. It is not surprising that the highest numbers and proportions of hospital bed May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 49 days among adults aged 18-44 years were for maternal conditions because this age group encompasses nearly all women of childbearing age. Among older adults (aged 45-64 years), musculoskeletal diseases were the greatest contributors to morbidity and healthcare burdens, and among adults aged 65 years or older, cardiovascular dis - eases accounted for the most morbidity and healthcare burdens. Of musculoskeletal diseases, back problems were a major source of healthcare burden; of cardiovascular diseases, essen - tial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease accounted for the largest healthcare burdens. These find - ings are not surprising and reflect the inev - itable effects of aging on the health and healthcare needs of the older segment of the MHS beneficiary population. However, many of the health conditions associated with the largest morbidity and healthcare burdens among beneficiaries in older age groups are also associated with unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., unhealthy diet, inadequate exercise, or tobacco use). As such, to vary - ing extents, the most costly health condi - tions may be preventable and their disabling or life-threatening long-term consequences may be avoidable. Illnesses and injuries that disproportionately contribute to mor - bidity and healthcare burdens in various age groups of MHS beneficiaries should be targeted for early detection and treatment by comprehensive prevention and research programs.REFERENCES 1.

Ryan A. Steelman, MPH; John F. Ambrose, PhD, MPH WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS? The burden of COVID-19 in the Army AC population is being evaluated through active and passive surveillance daily; however, a summary of the prevalence of comorbidities in confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Army AC has not yet been published. The most common comorbidities in Army service mem - bers hospitalized for COVID-19 were history of obesity, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and neurologic conditions. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? COVID-19 is a highly infectious and poten - tially serious respiratory illness that can lead to hospitalization or death. Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions should exer - cise extreme caution to prevent this illness. In early January 2020, the China Cen - ters for Disease Control announced they had identified a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coro - navirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) as the cause of a cluster of viral pneumonia of previously unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. As more countries continued to report wide - spread community transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 March 2020. As of 8 April 2020, over 1.35 million cases and over 79,000 deaths had been reported by WHO.1 As of the morning of 6 April 2020, a total of 873 cases of COVID-19 had been reported to the Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) from Army installations and some joint installations; the case counts include all cases reported from these installations, regardless of service, patient, or beneficiary status.2 The majority of cases were not hos - pitalized (n=773; 88.5%); 96 cases (11.0%) were hospitalized for this illness and 4 died (0.4%) (data not shown) . Of the reported cases, a total of 328 (37.6%) were identified as active component (AC) service members from any military service (data not shown) . Several preliminary reports have sum - marized the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients.3-8 The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infectious and appears to have more negative impacts on patients 60 years or older than on adults under 40 years old or children.2,3,5,9-11 Several underlying health conditions are thought to increase the risk of severe illness, including pre-existing conditions such as immuno - compromised status, history of cancer, car - diovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus.9 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Response Team examined these conditions and other select underlying health conditions among the first 122,653 reported cases in the U.S. and concluded that persons with under - lying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, or cardio - vascular disease had a higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated disease than those without these conditions.9 Service members in the U.S. Army have to meet occupational health and fit - ness standards in order to continue their careers in the Armed Forces. As such, compared to the general U.S. population, service members are typically character - ized as younger, more physically fit, and with lower rates of chronic disease; this is sometimes referred to the healthy sol - dier effect. However, a study of cardio - vascular disease comparing 2012 Periodic Health Assessment data to data from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is exhibit - ing widespread community transmission throughout most of the world. Pre - vious reports have evaluated the risk of serious illness in civilians diagnosed with COVID-19; however, similar reports have not been compiled for the Army active component (AC) population. COVID-19 has been a reportable condition for the Department of Defense since 5 February 2020, and, as of the morning of 6 April, a total of 873 cases were reported to the Disease Reporting System internet from Army installations. Of these cases, a total of 219 (25.1%) were identified as Army AC service members. The majority of these cases did not require hospitalization (n=207; 94.5%). The most com - mon comorbidities present in nonhospitalized cases included other chronic illnesses (43.5%), neurologic disorders (24.6%), and obesity (21.7%). Over - all, 12 cases (5.5%) required hospitalization. Hospitalized cases had a his - tory of obesity (58.3%), neurologic disorder (50.0%), other chronic illnesses (41.7%), and hypertension No comorbidities were present among 27.1% of nonhospitalized cases and 25.0% (n=3) of hospitalized cases.Special Report May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 51 Examination Survey noted that service members had an increased prevalence of elevated blood pressure and had a simi - lar prevalence of body mass index in the overweight and obese ranges compared to the general population.12 Periodic reports by the U.S. Army Public Health Center (APHC) echo these findings for the preva - lence of certain chronic diseases among AC Army members.13 For example, in 2018, among the AC service members evaluated in the APHC reports, 19% had 1 or more diagnosed chronic conditions13 and preva - lence ranged from 13% to 37% across Army installations. Arthritis (9.3%) was the most common of the conditions assessed, fol - lowed by cardiovascular conditions (6.0%) and hypertension (5.6%).13 Additionally, 17% of service members were classified as obese during Army physical fitness tests, with the prevalence of obesity ranging from 11% to 25% across Army installations.13 This report provides preliminary infor - mation on the prevalence of select underly - ing conditions among confirmed cases of COVID-19 among U.S. Army AC service members. Of interest was the distribution of these conditions by hospitalization sta - tus and age. Causal relationships were not explored. METHODS Study population All confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the DRSi from 11 February 2020 through 6 April 2020 by 0500 EDT were evaluated for this report. Per Depart - ment of Defense (DoD) Office of the Under Secretary of Defense memorandum \"Force Health Protection Guidance for the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak, \" all cases of COVID-19 must be reported to the DRSi.14 The DRSi is a passive surveillance system for selected diseases identified as report - able medical events and has served as the main system of record for surveillance of all cases of COVID-19 in the Army popu - lation. Identities of cases were confirmed by patient identifiers (e.g., social security number) for an existing electronic medi - cal record. To confirm that all reported cases were valid cases, the laboratory and encounter sections of all case patients' medical records were searched for a report of a positive COVID-19 laboratory result. Throughout the study period, con - firmed cases of COVID-19 included all patients with positive or presumptive posi - tive laboratory results. At the time of this study, the only laboratory tests performed within the Military Health System (MHS) and civilian hospitals were SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests. All con - firmed cases among Army AC service mem - bers reported to the DRSi from 11 February 2020 through 6 April 2020 (by 0500 EDT) from any military treatment facility (MTF) were included in the analysis. A COVID- 19 reporting page was not available in the DRSi until 11 February 2020. Until this time, a temporary reporting page was used; however, no confirmed cases of COVID- 19 were reported in the Army AC service member population before 11 February 2020. National Guard members and Army Reserve active duty members, dependents, and retirees were excluded from the anal - ysis, as reportable medical events among these groups are not as reliably reported to the DRSi because of differences in pro - cedural policies. Because the processes for validating cases of COVID-19 reported to the DRSi differ between the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, all cases among Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps AC service members reported to the DRSi were also excluded from the analysis. February 2020 population data for active duty Army soldiers were extracted by age group and sex from the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System population summary. This summary con - tains aggregate demographic information for service members, civilians, and their eligible family members. These data were extracted using the MHS Management Analysis and Reporting Tool. Study design All COVID-19 patients meeting the case definition during the study period were identified, and their healthcare his - tories were searched for the underlying health conditions under consideration. Medical record reviews were performed using the Armed Forces Health Longitu - dinal Technology Application (AHLTA) electronic medical records system. AHLTA is the global electronic health record sys - tem used by the DoD. Each case's medical records include a listing of all past diagno - ses. These lists for each case were examined by epidemiologists for the select underlying conditions of interest. The same list of underlying health con - ditions considered in the CDC COVID- 19 Response Team report was used in this analysis.9 In brief, these include chronic lung disease (i.e., asthma, chronic obstruc - tive pulmonary disease, and emphysema), cardiovascular disease, chronic renal dis - ease, cancer or history of cancer, diabe - tes, current pregnancy, current or former smoking, liver disease, and neurologic disorder. The \"neurologic disorder, neu - rodevelopmental, intellectual disabil - ity\" category in the CDC report included headache/migraine. For the current study, cases with a diagnosis history of headaches were counted as having a neurologic disor - der if they also had a diagnosis history of migraine or a concurrent history of a diag - nosed head injury, such as traumatic brain injury. The other neurologic conditions included in the CDC report (i.e., dementia, memory loss or Alzheimer disease, seizure disorder, stroke, autism, aneurysm, multi - ple sclerosis, neuropathy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, myasthenia gravis, intracranial hemorrhage, and altered mental status) were also included in the current analy - sis. Some common conditions found in the study population, such as obesity and hypertension, were analyzed separately. The CDC report also included the overarch - ing category \"other chronic disease. \" This category included thyroid disease, gastro - intestinal disorder, hyperlipidemia, rheu - matologic disorder, hematologic disorder, arthritis, mental health condition, urologic disorder, cerebrovascular disease, obstruc - tive sleep apnea, embolism, ophthalmic disorder, hypertriglyceridemia, endocrine disorder, substance abuse dis - order, dermatologic disorder, and genetic disorder. Analyses were conducted using Micro - soft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, W A) and SAS/STAT software, MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 52 version 9.4 (2014, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The frequencies of underlying health conditions were calculated for AC service members by hospitalization status (non - hospitalized vs. hospitalized), sex, and age group. No statistical comparisons were per - formed in this analysis. RESULTS A total of 219 AC service member case patients were identified with COVID-19 symptom onset dates ranging from 17 Feb - ruary to 2 April (Figure 1) . The vast major - ity of cases did not require hospitalization (n=207; 94.5%). Although four-fifths of cases were males (n=175; 79.9%), the over - all incidence rate of COVID-19 infection was higher among females (5.9 per 10,000 soldiers) than males (4.2 per 10,000 sol - diers) (Table 1) . The highest rate of COVID- 19 infection was among the oldest (45 years or older) age group for both hospitalized cases (1.6 per 10,000 soldiers) and nonhos - pitalized cases (15.2 per 10,000 soldiers). The highest incidence rate of COVID-19 infection among males was among those 45 years or older (17.9 per 10,000 soldiers), while the highest incidence rate among females was among those aged 35-44 years (11.3 per 10,000 soldiers). Medical record data for the 219 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were exam - ined for 10 underlying conditions of inter - est (Table 2) . About one-third of the total case patients (33.8%; n=74) had none of the selected comorbidities in their medi - cal histories. Among the 207 COVID-19 patients who did not require hospitaliza - tion, 34.3% had no comorbidities (n=71). No case patients were pregnant or had a history of chronic liver disease. Among the 10 underlying conditions that were pres - ent, prevalence ranged from less than 1% (cardiovascular disease) to 43.4% (other chronic disease). The broad category \"other chronic disease, \" which included numerous diagnoses, was most prevalent among all case patients (n=95), followed by neurologic disorder (n=57; were the most common \"other chronic dis - eases\" for all case patients. In comparing the distribution of underlying conditions among hospitalized and nonhospitalized confirmed cases, the small number of hospitalized cases pre - cluded definitive conclusions about differ - ences between the 2 groups. Of the 12 (5.5%) case patients who were hospitalized, 4 (33.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) (Table 3) . None of the hospitalized cases, including those that were admitted to the ICU, required a ventilator. The underlying conditions with the highest prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients included hyperten - sion (25.0%), obesity (58.3%), and neuro - logic disorder (50.0%) (Table 2) . All 4 of the patients who were admitted to an ICU had 3 or more underlying conditions present (Table 3) . In contrast, of the 8 patients who were hospitalized without admission to an ICU, 2 (25.0%) had 3 or more underlying conditions present and 3 (37.5%) had no underlying conditions present. Of the 207 COVID-19 cases who were not hospital - ized, 32 (15.5%) had 3 or more underlying conditions (Table 3) . EDITORIAL COMMENT Because the nature of the popula - tion for this report differs from the CDC COVID-19 Response Team's civilian popu - lation, direct comparisons are not possible. The patient population for this prelimi - nary report is significantly smaller than the population described in the CDC report. In addition, the Army AC service mem - ber population does not include soldiers with underlying health conditions that would disqualify service members from enlistment in the Army, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, intellectual FIGURE 1.

On the other hand, conditions like hypertension, obesity, and neurologic disorders were observed often in soldiers. Diabetes mellitus was a signifi - cant underlying factor in the CDC report, with 10.9% of cases having this condition,9 whereas only 2.7% of the Army study pop - ulation had this disease (including pre- diabetes). Finally, the neurologic disorder category was associated with just 0.7% of case patients in the CDC's report,9 whereas 26.0% of Army patients had some history of neurologic disorder; many had a his - tory of diagnosed migraines (n=28) and/or traumatic brain injury (n=21) (Table 2) . Because obesity was a common under - lying condition for both hospitalized and nonhospitalized Army cases\u2014the preva - lence of obesity was 17% in the Army AC service member population in 2018\u2014this condition may be a prominent risk factor for more severe COVID-19 infection in this particular population.13 While the highest rates of COVID-19 occurred among ser - vice members aged 45 years or older (16.8 per 10,000 soldiers), the Army study popu - lation was on average younger (mean=34.6 years) than the age groups that are consid - ered most at risk for serious illness due to COVID-19. This age difference may be a major contributing factor to why only 5.5% of Army case patients required hospitaliza - tion for this illness compared to 8.5% of case patients in the CDC report (of 74,439 total cases with a completed case report form, 5,285 were hospitalized without ICU admission and 1,069 were hospitalized with ICU admission).9 It is also notable that the rate of nonhospitalized COVID-19 infec - tion was higher among female compared to male service members (5.8 vs. 4.0 per 10,000 soldiers, respectively). The rate of hospitalized COVID-19 infection was lower among female cases compared to male cases (0.1 vs. 0.3 per 10,000 soldiers, respectively); however, the low case count of hospitalized female service members precludes making generalizations about the influence of sex on hospitalization rates among Army AC service members.

Although most Army AC service members receive medi - cal care through the MHS, some condi-tions diagnosed by providers outside of the MHS may not have been captured in the AHLTA electronic medical record. Regard - less, all case patients had diagnosis histo - ries available to review in the MHS, and all of the underlying health conditions of interest diagnosed by MHS providers were captured by reviewing electronic medical records for each patient. Secondly, although the DRSi is the main system of record for surveillance of all cases of COVID-19 in the DoD, there are gaps in this reporting system that are well known. 15 It is likely that the DRSi does not capture all confirmed cases of COVID-19; however, several mitigating procedures were put into practice early on in the pandemic. COVID-19 surveillance training was provided to all DRSi reporters on 25 February 2020 in anticipation of an increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in the DoD population. Additionally, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Army Satellite COVID-19 Surveil - lance Team has provided weekly training to Army personnel who have been assigned to report cases to the DRSi since mid-March 2020. The DHA Army Satellite COVID-19 Surveillance Team has also been collect-ing MHS laboratory data for all confirmed cases and contacting MTFs that have not yet reported cases as identified in the labo - ratory data. These efforts have led to a con - siderable increase in the usage of the DRSi TABLE 3.

Finally, only the more serious cases that require diagnosis from a provider and laboratory confirmation are being captured in this surveillance study. Asymptomatic patients and those with mild illness that did not seek treatment would not be cap - tured in this surveillance system; therefore, selection bias exists. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 is not yet well understood, including within the Army population. All Army AC service members that are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms should immediately contact their healthcare providers. Many Army installations have implemented higher health protection condition levels as their population sees widespread commu-nity transmission of COVID-19; the DHA Army Satellite COVID-19 Surveillance Team, in collaboration with the APHC COVID-19 Taskforce, is evaluating the impact of these strategies on the burden of COVID-19 at each installation.

Commentary: Gaps in report - able medical event surveillance across the De - partment of the Army and recommended training tools to improve surveillance practices. MSMR. 2019;26(8):17-21.May 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 55 On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that an outbreak of dis - ease named 2019-nCoV , later named coro - navirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.1 One day later, on 31 January 2020, WHO convened an emergency meet - ing of the WHO Family of International Classifications Network and Statistics Advisory Committee to create a specific International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 10-CM) code for the new coronavirus: U07.1, 2019-nCoV acute respiratory dis - ease.2 On 20 February 2020, the U.S. Cen - ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statis - tics announced that it would implement the new ICD-10-CM code on 1 October 2020.3 Following the WHO declaration that the novel coronavirus was a global pandemic (11 March 2020) 4 and the Pres - ident's activation of the Stafford Act (13 March 2020),5 CDC, under sections 201 and 301 of the U.S. National Emergencies Act, announced that the effective date of the new diagnosis code would be moved from 1 October 2020 to 1 April 2020.6 The Military Health System (MHS) made ICD-10-CM code U07.1 available for selection by appointers and other admin - istrative personnel in MHS GENESIS and the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) in early April 2020. Soon thereaf - ter, the code became available to medical providers utilizing MHS GENESIS and the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Tech - nology Application (AHLTA) to document the diagnosis of COVID-19. Since the end of April 2020, epidemiologists and analysts have been able to query administrative databases including the MHS Data Reposi - tory (MDR), MHS Mart (M2), the CHCS, and the Defense Medical Surveillance Sys - tem (DMSS) using the new code. The Armed Forces Health Surveil - lance Branch (AFHSB) creates a daily master positive list of COVID-19 cases by combining data from the Disease Report - ing System internet (DRSi) and Health Level 7 (HL7)-formatted laboratory data (HL7 data) extracted from the CHCS and MHS GENESIS by the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center. The availabil - ity of the specific ICD-10-CM code U07.1 provides a new source of data for iden - tification of possible cases of COVID-19 using the electronic health record (EHR). It also provides an opportunity to create a COVID-19-like illnesses (CLI) case defini - tion for syndromic surveillance modeled after influenza-like illness (ILI) surveil - lance. This report documents early explor - atory analysis of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 to assess the potential use of administrative WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS? This study identified possible cases of CO - VID-19 in distinct data record systems that included laboratory tests for the coronavirus, DRSi reports of cases, and records of health - care encounters that included the new ICD- 10 code U07.1 for the disease. Examination of 150 encounter records for individuals who were not identified in the laboratory or DRSi records revealed that 69% had confirmatory lab results in separate records or met clinical criteria for a case of COVID-19. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON READINESS AND FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION? The findings provide evidence that use of the new ICD-10 diagnostic code for COVID-19 is occurring more frequently since its introduc - tion. Search of encounter records for this code will augment the other methods of per - forming surveillance for this disease. Such enhanced surveillance will enable actions to prevent and control the current COVID-19 epidemic, which threatens the health of the force. Early Use of ICD-10-CM Code \"U07.1, COVID-19\" to Identify 2019 Novel Coronavirus Cases in Military Health System Administrative Data Shawn Clausen, MD, MPH; Shauna Stahlman, PhD, MPH; Angelia Cost, PhD, MPHSpecial Report This report describes early exploratory analysis of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [COVID-19]) to assess the use of administrative data for case ascertainment, syndromic surveillance, and future epidemiological studies. Out of the 2,950 possible COVID-19 cases identified between 1 April 2020 and 4 May 2020, 600 (20.3%) were detected in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) and not in the Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) or in Health Level 7 laboratory data from the Composite Health Care System. Among the 150 out of 600 cases identi - fied exclusively in the DMSS and selected for Armed Forces Health Longi - tudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) review, 16 (10.7%) had a certified positive lab result in AHLTA, 17 (11.3%) met Council of State and Territo - rial Epidemiologists (CSTE) criteria for a probable case, 46 (30.7%) were not cases based on CSTE criteria, and 71 (47.3%) had evidence of a positive lab result from an outside source. Lack of full capture of lab results may continue to be a challenge as the variety of available tests expands. Administrative data may provide an important stopgap measure for detecting lab positive cases, pending incorporation of new COVID-19 tests and standardization of test and result nomenclature. MSMR Vol. 27 No. 05 May 2020 Page 56 data for case ascertainment and use of the code for syndromic surveillance and future epidemiological studies (Figure 1) . METHODS On 4 May 2020, the DMSS was searched for all patient encounters that contained ICD-10-CM code U07.1 in any diagnostic position. This list of possible COVID-19 cases was compared to the master positive list (cases identified based on positive test for severe acute respira - tory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS- CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and/or those who were reported as cases in the DRSi between 1 April 2020 and 4 May 2020). A convenience sample (25%) of these cases was selected for record review in AHLTA. Within AHLTA, for each case, information contained in the lab, radiology, previous encounters, Joint Legacy Viewer, and Health Artifact and Image Management Solution sections was reviewed by a licensed medical pro - vider using a standardized Excel spread - sheet and systematic AHLTA review process. Cases in the DMSS-only subset were categorized as probable , confirmed , or determined not to be a case based on the guidelines established by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)7 (Table) . On 8 May 2020, a 10-day \"look-back\" was performed. A separate DMSS list (U07.1 ICD-10-CM code list) from 28 April 2020 was compared with the mas - ter positive list (DRSi and/or HL7 data list) from 8 May 2020 to determine the number of DMSS U07.1 coded cases that were subsequently identified on the mas - ter positive list and, therefore, would have been captured without the use of admin - istrative data. Note that MHS GENESIS medi - cal encounters did not become available in the DMSS until after this analysis was performed. While laboratory results from MHS GENESIS sites were included in this analysis, MHS GENESIS medical encoun - ters were not included here . RESULTS There were 2,350 individuals cap - tured on the master positive list (cases identified based on positive lab test and/ or those who were reported as cases in the DRSi between 1 April 2020 and 4 May 2020) and 865 individuals who were iden - tified as having an encounter for COVID- 19 (ICD-10-CM code U07.1) during the same time period. Among the 2,950 total individuals identified, 2,085 were exclu - sively on the master positive list, 600 were exclusively on the ICD-10-CM U07.1 diagnosis code list, and 265 were on both (Figure 2) . Among the 150 out of 600 cases iden - tified exclusively in the DMSS and selected for AHLTA review, 16 (10.7%) had a cer - tified positive lab result in the laboratory section of AHLTA, 17 (11.3%) met CSTE criteria for a probable case, 46 (30.7%) were not cases based on CSTE criteria, and 71 (47.3%) had evidence of a positive lab result from an outside source (Figure 3). Among the 46 cases that were deter - mined not to be cases, 26 (56.5%) were FIGURE 1.

On 28 April 2020, there were 64 indi - viduals on the U07.1 code-only list. By 8 May 2020, 7 (10.9%) had made it onto the master positive list (3 cases were rep - resented exclusively in the DRSi, 2 cases were represented exclusively in HL7 data, and 2 were represented in both data sources) (Figure 4) . EDITORIAL COMMENT Availability of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 in administrative data is an important new development in COVID-19 surveillance. Given that 600 out of the 2,950 possible cases (20.3%) reviewed here were detected in administrative data and not in DRSi or HL7 data, addition of encounter data appears to be important to ensuring complete case cap - ture moving forward. Among the 150 cases selected for AHLTA review, 16 cases (10.7%) identified in encounter data were found to have a mili - tary treatment facility (MTF)-certified lab result in the AHLTA labs section but were not identified in the DRSi or the HL7 data and, therefore, were not represented on the master positive list. The 10-day look-back revealed that 7 cases were subsequently identified and entered into the master posi - tive list, 2 of which were found exclusively in HL7 data, 3 of which were exclusively in DRSi data, and 2 of which were in both. While some of the remaining lab cases may eventually make it into the HL7 data, 2 of the missed lab results were from early April (2 April 2020 and 3 April 2020), suggest - ing that they might escape recognition alto - gether. Given that SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test names and results are not standardized in CHCS or HL7 data, this is understand - able. While capture of these cases will likely improve as naming conventions are stan - dardized and algorithms aimed at captur - ing COVID-19 test results evolve, lack of full capture of lab results may continue to be a challenge as the variety of tests avail - able continues to expand. Administrative data may provide an important stopgap measure for detecting lab positive cases, pending incorporation of new COVID-19 FIGURE 2.

The CSTE definitions for confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 are pro - vided in the Table.7 Among the 150 cases reviewed, there were 17 probable cases of COVID-19: 2 had presumptive positive lab test results and met clinical or epide - miologic criteria; 15 met clinical and epi - demiologic criteria. Among the 150 cases reviewed, 8 patients were hospitalized and 11 had chest imaging (x-ray or computed tomography [CT] scan) consistent with COVID-19. It could be argued that cases with both clinical and radiographic evidence of COVID-19 should be categorized as cases. This approach is substantiated by Ai and colleagues, who performed serial analyses of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CT scans and found that, using RT-PCR as a reference, the sen - sitivity of chest imaging for COVID-19 was 97%.8 Use of radiographic criteria for case identification would increase the pro - portion of individuals identified as cases in the EHR from 87 total cases (58.0%) to 98 total cases (65.3%). In this analysis, the CSTE case definition was applied to remain consistent with current public health practice. Among the 150 AHLTA cases reviewed, the largest group of patients, 71 (47.3%), received lab testing at an outside facility, such as an urgent care center, hos - pital, or state health department, along with a documented encounter (most frequently a telephone consult) at an MTF. Lab results were sometimes scanned into the record and the test location was documented in 51/71 cases (71.8%). Given that these tests were not entered into the CHCS, they had no opportunity to be detected in HL7 data. The DRSi, a passive surveillance system with known limitations related to person - nel, training, and accessibility, also did not identify these cases.9 This again demon - strates the value of using administrative data for comprehensive case capture. Outsourced medical encounter data are available in MHS systems (e.g., the MDR, M2, and DMSS) after an encoun - ter is billed. The billing process can take weeks to months, especially if a patient is hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. In the current analysis, many outsourced encounters not reported in the DRSi were detected because they were associated with a telephone consult undertaken for case management or public health purposes. Coding of the telephone consultations in the EHR allowed identification of cases at the time of illness rather than weeks later, as would be the case had these consults not been recorded. This finding suggests that the EHR may be an important adjunct to the DRSi for identification of cases requir - ing contact tracing. The current analysis included 46 indi - viduals (30.7%) who did not meet CSTE criteria for COVID-19 but who were, none - theless, documented as having COVID-19, based solely on the ICD-10-CM U07.1 code. This misclassification was due to the use of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 for documenta - tion of pre-deployment screening among asymptomatic service members rather than the appropriate screening code (ICD- 10-CM code Z11.59, encounter for screen - ing for other viral disease) in 56.5% of the 46 cases. Given the prospect of increased screening among recruits and other large military groups, continued improper use of this code for screening purposes could lead to significant misclassification of cases in the future, undermining the value of ICD- 10-CM code U07.1 for case identification and development of a case definition for CLI syndromic surveillance. \"ICD-10-CM Official Coding and Reporting Guidelines, 1 April 2020 through 30 September 2020\" advises against assigning ICD-10-CM code U07.1 to unconfirmed cases, including suspected, possible, probable, and incon - clusive cases. It further directs the use of ICD-10-CM code Z11.59 for asymptom - atic screening.10 The 13 May 2020 Defense Health Agency memorandum \"Standardiz - ing COVID-19 Laboratory Orders to Dis - tinguish Among Diagnostic, Screening and Surveillance Testing Purposes\" elaborates on these recommendations.11 Wide dissem - ination of these guidelines is warranted. This review attempted to rapidly eval - uate early use of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 in order to assure the accuracy of AFHSB's master positive list and to develop of a reli - able CLI case definition. In the interest of timeliness, information in the medical record was extracted by a single individual rather than multiple providers, as would be required in a formal case series or systematic review. In addition, a convenience sample FIGURE 4. Ten-day look-back for identification of cases that were initially not found but sub - sequently identified in DRSi and/or HL7 data DRSi, Disease Reporting System internet; Health Level 7-formatted laboratory data.Figure 4. Ten-day look-back for identification of cases that were initially not found but subsequently identified in the DRSi and/or HL7 data DRSi, Disease Reporting 2020 Vol. 27 No. 05 MSMR Page 59 (the first 150 out of 600 cases) rather than a randomly selected sample of AHLTA cases was designated for review. These factors limit the validity and generalizability of the analysis. This analysis is further limited by the small number of cases reviewed and the fact that it was performed soon after adop - tion of ICD-10-CM code U07.1. Recogniz - ing these limitations, it appears that use of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 to query admin - istrative databases allows identification of cases that would not otherwise be detected using DRSi and HL7 data alone. Advo - cacy for use of administrative data to iden - tify cases is tempered somewhat not only by the potential for misclassification but also by the manpower required to review the electronic medical record and apply CSTE guidelines for appropriate case clas - sification. Lipstitch and colleagues astutely recognized that \"case-based surveillance places exponentially increasing burdens on public health systems\" and highlighted the importance of transitioning from case- based surveillance to automated syndromic surveillance as pandemics evolve.12 The use of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 for syndromic surveillance and future epi - demiological studies warrants continued exploration, especially given use of this code for screening purposes and resultant misclassification. Continued addition of codes such as ICD-10-CM U07.2 COVID- 19, virus not detected13 and refinement of codes sets used for syndromic surveillance will provide greater understanding of how COVID-19 is affecting military members and military-associated populations and ensure the integrity of future epidemiologi - cal studies related to COVID-19.
