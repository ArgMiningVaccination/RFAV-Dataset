Four years ago I was in a devastating accident that ruined my ankle. I had constant pain, swelling and limited mobility. I put all my weight on my good leg, my alignment is off. This gave me back pain and a lot of bad days. I entered Dr Daniel's office a non-believer. On our first visit, I spoke, I demonstrated, he listened, he offered hope, I cried. We continued together and here are the FACTS- I have less swelling, more ankle mobility, less pain and better body alignment. I can do more- like run up and down stairs. I have less anger, irritability, stress and less bad days. Dr Daniel and Heather have created a place in our community to come, to share, to laugh, to heal and to be restored. Your skills and generosity have improved my life. I believe. "}
