We are truly humbled to work alongside everyone who reaches out to us and trusts us to support them on their healing journey. Our center lives up to its name and provides approaches and services that cannot be found at other providers' offices. Integrative medicine is all about providing our valued partners with the right medicine at the right time. As a leader in the naturopathic and integrative medicine worlds, [Dr. Kachko](https://www.nycintegrative.com/meet-dr-robert-kachko/) has developed a cutting-edge program designed to help the many individuals struggling with physical and mental health challenges. Our approach respects your unique experiences and concerns. It transcends the hurried route, \"one-size-fits-all\" visit at other practitioners' offices or the \"quick-fix\" that doesn't really fix anything over the long term. To achieve sustained health and real resolution of concerns, symptoms, and the underlying conditions responsible for them, our center's program and approach integrates the best that conventional, functional, naturopathic, and Chinese medicine have to offer. For instance, an individualized program may pull in acupuncture as well as nutraceuticals and botanical medicine based on sophisticated diagnostics. We can pinpoint imbalances and deficiencies to deliver exactly what your body needs, in precise amounts, at the right time to help your body \"heal\". Of course, no holistic program would be complete without considering the mind and the body - the \"whole\" you. Our mind-body services range from biofeedback to clinical hypnotherapy. Our thoughts and emotions contribute to the condition of the organs and systems that make up our physical body. Likewise, when not in the best physical state, we may feel anxious or depressed. We listen intently to understand your past and help your forge a new more vibrant future. We treat you with an understanding of your needs and underlying problems. We are here for you.
