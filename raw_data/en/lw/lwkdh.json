Administ ration of the Plan State Agency Administering Programs The State of Nevada, Divisio n of Child and Family Serv ices (Division), within the Department of Human Services, is specific ally dedicated to providing services to children and families. The Division is resp onsible for Children's Mental Health (in the two largest populated counties), Youth Co rrections and Child Welfare Services. As such, the implementation and administrat ion of Title IV-E, Title IV-B, Subpart I (Child Welfare Services) and Subpart 2 (Pro moting Safe and Stable Families), Child Abuse and Treatment Act (CAPTA), and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) are the res ponsibility of the Division. State Demographics For the past 17 years, Nevada has been the fast est growing state in the nation. In 2003, the population reached 2, 296,556 inhabitants wit h growth primarily occurring in two counties: Washoe and Clark. The Division's organizational structure and program delivery are influenced by the state size and concent ration of population in these two counties. For the most part, growth in Nevada's rural counties has been minimal. For the purpose of this plan, demographic composites have been compiled to reflect three regional service areas. Clark County: Seventy-nine percent of the grow th the state experienced in 2003 occurred in Las Vegas/Clark County, reaching 1,620,748 residents. This comprises 71% of the state's population. Approximately 26% of Clark County's population are children under th e age of 18. In 2002, the average family income in the Southern Nevada Regi on was $48,890. Of the thre e regions, Clark County has the highest child poverty rate at 14.1% , the most single parent families at 30.8%, and the highest teen birth rates ( 35.5% per 1,000 females (1999-2001). Approximately 23% of the st ate's substantiated reports of child abuse came from this region (22.7%). Washoe County: In 2003, the number of resi dents in Washoe County increased by 3.8% to 373,233 residents or 16.2% of the state's overall population. Approximately 24% of Washoe County's population is comprised of children under the age of 18. In 2002, Washoe County reported the highest average family income at $54,572. Twenty-eight per cent of Washoe County's families are single parent households, and th e child poverty rate is reported to be 12%. Teen birth rates were 34.1 per 1,000 female s (1999-2000). Was hoe County reported the highest substantiated abuse and neglect reports (25.1%). Rural Counties: Rural Nevada comprises 13.1% of the state's population and encompasses 15 counties, six of which lo st residents in 2003. Overall, the region's population grew by just 1% to 302,582 resident s. Approximately 14% of the population are chil dren under the age of 18. The average family income in rural counties is $37,176 and the child pover ty rate averages 12.25%. Teen birth - 2 - rates average 21.31 per 1,000 females. The rural counties have the lowest number of substantiated child ab use and neglect reports (12.6). Integration of Child Welfare Services In addition to geographic challenges, Nevada is the only state that has operated under a bifurcated child welf are system where c ounties with populations of 100,000 (Washoe County and Clark County) provided Child Protective Services and the Division provided child welfare services. Child Protective Services included: Preventative services Investigations of abuse and neglect Family assessments Emergency shelter care and/or short term foster care In-home services Child Welfare Services included: Placement services (family foster care, higher levels including group and residential care) Case management for fo ster care and adoptions Independent living Family preservation Family foster home recrui tment, training and licensing In 1999, a legislatively supported pilot project was conducted in Washoe County between the Washoe County Department of Social Services (WCDSS) and the Division to integrate services. It was re cognized that the bifurcated system caused children to remain in the system for a lo nger period of time due to additional legal actions, multiple case managers, changes in foster homes and service providers. Evaluation results of this tw o-year pilot demonstrated le ss duplication of efforts and more comprehensive and consistent services to children and families in a system that was not bifurcated. Assembly Bill 1 (AB1), as passed by t he 2001 Nevada Special Legislative Session, redefined \"child welfare services\" to include pr otective services, foster care services, and services related to adoption. It permits the transfer of child welfare services from the Division of Child and Family Services (Division) to a county whose population is 100,000 or more (Washoe and Clark). The le gislation also recognizes that the state and counties have a shared fiscal respons ibility for the costs of providing child welfare services and mu st be committed to ensuring, through negotiation in good faith, future maintenance of efforts in providing those services and to equitably sharing future cost s for providing these services. Washoe County Transition of the programs to Washoe C ounty Department of Social Services occurred in two phases, which started in April 2002 and was co mpleted in January - 3 - 2003. Washoe County now provides the full range of child welfare services and is maximizing (utilizing) appropriate federal funding sources such as TANF, Medicaid and Title IV-E. Clark County The transition of programs to Clark County occurs in three phases. The first phase transferred 10.51 FTE in October 2003 to prov ide Family Preservation Services, and the second phase in April 20 04 resulted in the transfer of 42.02 FTE to provide Licensing and Recruitment, Adoption, Inte rstate Compact on the Placement of Children, and Children's Resources Bureau services. The third and final phase will occur in October 2004 when the remaining 101.51 FTE will transfer to the county to provide Case Management and Eligibility se rvices. Clark County utilizes TANF and Medicaid and recently submitt ed its first Title IV-E claim. A. Vision, Principles, Goals, and Objectives The Nevada Division of Chil d and Family Services, toget her in genuine partnership with families, communities and county governm ental agencies, provides support and services to assist Nevada's children an d families in reaching their full human potential. We recognize t hat Nevada's families are our future and families thrive when they: Live in safe, permanent settings; Experience a sense of sustainable em otional and physical well being; and Receive support to consistently make positive choices for family and common good. Service principles guide our work towards achieving this vision and are consistent with children and family services principles specified in federal regulations [45 CFS 1355.25(a) through 1355.25(h)]. These practice model is paramount; Development-Children, youth, and fam ilies need consistent nurturing in a healthy environment to achiev e their full human potential; Permanency-All children need and are entitled to endur ing relationships that provide a family, stability and belonging, a sense of self that connects children to their past, present and future; Cultural Responsiveness-Children and fam ilies have the right to be understood within the context of thei r own family, traditions, history, culture, and community; Partnership-The entire community shares accountability for the creation of an environment that helps families raise ch ildren to reach their full potential; Organizational Competence-Effectivel y structured and m anaged organizations with committed, trained, skilled staff are necessary to achieve positive outcomes for children and families. Stra tegic sequencing of continuous quality improvements must occur to reach Nevada' s child and family services vision; and - 4 - Professional Competence-Children and fam ilies need a relation ship with skilled and empathetic case managers who can pr ovide ethical support, confront difficult issues, and effectively assi st them towards positive change that reinforces safety, permanency, we ll-being and community safety. MISSION The Division of Child and Family Services is responsible for child welfare service delivery in rural Nevada and oversight of urban county-opera ted child welfare services, children's mental health services in urban Nevada, juvenile justice services including state-operated youth training centers and youth parole and child care licensing. Our mission encompasses: Protection and Permanency for Children The Division creates opportunities and prog rams that prevent and respond to issues of parental/caregiver maltreatment, mental health, and delinquen cy. The Division strives to support permanency within the child 's biological or primary and extended family so children may grow and develop within stable environments. The Division also recognizes the responsibility to create and support alternative permanent environments when biological or primary families are unable or incapable of caring for their children. The Division will collaborat ively craft public policies to promote the strength and well-being of families. Preservation of Families The Division supports the value that the fa mily is the best structure to assure stability, nurturing, care, and safety of its members and communities. Services are designed to build upon family strengths, honoring the family's traditions, history, and culture. Juvenile Justice Services for Youth The Division recognizes that services must balance youth rehabilitation, treatment, and community safety. Many juvenile o ffenders have been victims of maltreatment and therefore accountability must be bal anced by the provision of services addressing trauma, loss, substance abuse, and mental health issues. Juvenile offenders are held accountable through a comprehensive system of graduated sanctions that include commitment to st ate-operated juvenile facilities. Children's Mental Health The Division uses a system of care model that strives to provide creative, individualized, strength- based, and culturally responsive services for families with children that experienc e severe emotional disturbances. A developing continuum of care focuses on meeting the needs of children and families in the least restrictive envir onment, including utilization of the wraparound process to coordinate effective service delivery that enables children to reside with families when possible and with the a ssistance of informal supports rather than dependency on government or paid providers. - 5 - PURPOSES The Division is responsible for accomplishing the following purposes: Protecting and promoting the welfare and safety of all children, including individuals with disabilities; homel ess, dependent or neglected children; Preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of problems that may result in the neglect, abuse, exploi tation, or delinquency of children; Preventing the unnecessary separation of children from their families by identifying family problems and assisti ng families in resolving their problems and preventing the breakup of the family where the prev ention of child removal is desirable and possible; Restoring to their families' chil dren, who have been removed and may be safely returned, by the provision of services to the child and the family; Assuring adequate care of ch ildren away from their homes in cases where the child cannot be returned home or cannot be placed for adoption; and Placing children in suitabl e adoptive homes in cases where restoration to the biological or primary family is not possible or appropriate.

Planning Process Nevada's Child and Family Services on- site Review (CFSR) was completed on February 27, 2004. The final report wa s received June 2, 2004. Nevada has chosen to use the results of the Statewide Assessm ent and the Final Report Findings as the foundation for the devel opment of the FY 2005-2009 CFSP. The Division of Child and Family Services has instituted a planning process for the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). T he planning process has occurred in the following four phases: Phase 1: The Division used the development of the Child and Family Services Statewide Assessment as an opportunity to identify crit ical areas to be addressed in the IV-B Plan and in preparation for the Program Improvement Plan (PIP). Internal and external stakeholders, includi ng tribal entities, provided input through surveys and focus groups. Phase 2: In January 2004 the Division partnered with t he National Child Welfare Resource Center for Organizational Improvement ( NCWRCOI) to participate in a training session on the principles of strategic pl anning and the purpose of integrating the five-year plan with child welf are, mental health and youth corrections in order to achieve better outcomes for children and families in Nevada. The federal requirements for planning, best practice for strategic pl anning and the logic model process was presented. The upcoming Child and Family Services Review was discussed, as the outcomes of the review will have direct impa ct on the five-year Child and Family Services Plan. Particip ants included statewide leadership from child welfare, mental health and youth corrections agencies. The 90 participants, included staff from the Division, represent atives from Clark County and Washoe County, Rural Region, mental health services, juvenile services and UNITY, the Division's Statewide Automated Chil d Welfare Information System. Phase 3: A smaller group of state and county policy and decision makers, along with the NRCWRCOI, met in March 2004 to design Nevada 's planning structure and to clarify roles and responsibilities. Key stakeholde rs to include in plan development and oversight were identified. Phase 4: In April 2004, 156 internal and external stakeholders ca me together for a two-day training conference in Las Vegas to devel op Nevada's five-year strategic master plan. The NRCWRCOI, in partner ship with the Nevada Divi sion Administrator and County Child Welfare Agency Directors, facili tated the overall pl anning process. Stakeholders were organized in Action Planning Groups that focused on a specific theme which covered one or more items identified from the CFSR. The Action Planning Groups then, through collaborative efforts, submitted specific objectives, action steps and evaluation crit eria to the Division for analysis. This analysis was - 25 - compiled and submitted to key participants, including the Division Administrator, other Division adminis trative staff, and Directors of c ounty child welfare agencies for additional analysis. Information gleaned from this final analysis was incorporated into the five-year state plan and will al so be incorporated into the Program Improvement Plan (PIP). The participation of all stakeholders in this collaborative effort was the key to the successful comp letion of the Statewide Five-Year Plan. Action Planning Groups Safety Planning Assessment Foster Care Placement and Adoption Service Array Case Review/Legal System Independent Living Training Data & Quality Assurance Each action planning group wa s given the task to develop ac tion strategies linked to outcome measures from the CFSR. Groups r eported to all participants who in turn voted through an automated polling system on pr iority items for immediate action. The Action Planning Groups were facilitated by co-chairs who were responsible for the completion of the acti on plan from their group. An array of statewide internal and exter nal stakeholders participated in the Action Planning Groups. Regional participation was as follows: Clark County 35% Washoe County 36% Rural Counties 26% Internal Stakeholders Internal stakeholder participants repr esented state and county staff from child welfare, mental health and youth services from the following agencies: Division of Child and Family Services Washoe County Department of Social Services Clark County Department of Family Services - 26 - External Stakeholders Consumers Juvenile Services Parents Clark County Juvenile Probation Foster and Group Home Parents Juvenile Justice Commission Current and Former Foster Youth Nevada Association of Juvenile Justice Administrators Contract Service Providers, Tribal Entities and Nonprofit Organizations University Partners Boys and Girls Town UNR School of Social Work Stepping Stones Tribal Shelter Boyd School of Law Nevada Partnership for Homeless Y outh UNLV School of Social Work Health Providers/Community Members Legal Community Medical Community Representativ e Rural and Washoe County Judges Family Counseling Services Attorney General's Office Mental Health Plan Advisory Co mmittee Chief District Attorney Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Committee Court Improvement Project Washoe County Mental Health Consortium Washoe Legal Services- Attorney Representing Children Child and Family Advocates Public Defender's Office Court Appointed Special Advocates Other State Agencies Children's Advocates Nevada Governor's Office Nevada PEP (Parents Encour aging Parents) Division of Mental Health and Developmental Services-Rural Clinics Division of Health - Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division of Health Care Financing and Policy-Medicaid Section III. Child and Family Services Continuum A. Child Abuse Neglect and Prevention Children's Trust Fund Each State has created a State Children' s Trust Fund with the specific goal of preventing child maltreat ment. Each Children's Trust Fund is charged with coordinating prevention activi ties by promoting and fundi ng a variety of community- based programs. In addition, many funds provide leadership in the implementation of statewide public awareness campai gns, convening annual conferences, or undertaking special initiatives with ch ild abuse and neglect prevention goals. In 1985, the Nevada Legislatur e took a progressive approach to curbing child abuse by establishing the Children's Trust Acc ount to fund important programs to address this critical issue. The Committee for t he Protection of Childr en administers these funds. The Committee is composed of vo lunteers who are dedicated to protecting children statewide by strengthening Nevada's families. Since 1985, the Committee - 27 - has granted over six million dollars to various community-based organizations and institutions to prevent child maltreatment. Based on an assessment of Nevada's Child Abuse Prevention Services 2001 and the Five-Year Plan, funds hav e been provided to programs that support the following prevention program models t hat are linked to the child and family services continuum: Home visitation-Homemaker Program funded through Title IV-B in four rural counties Parenting education-fu nded through Title IV-B Public awareness Respite care-support of stat ewide 24-hour crisis hot line Skills-based curricula for childr en conducted in school classrooms with programs designed to increase k nowledge about abuse, to increase resistance skills, and to encourage child abuse reporting. The Committee for the Protecti on of Children and Ch ildren's Trust Fund will increase collaboration with the Title IV -B State Plan on the coordinat ion of services statewide to improve the outcome for the safety of children. B. Intervention and Treatment Services 1. Child Protective Services Nevada Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies conduct activities in preventing, investigating and treating ch ild abuse and neglect in accordance with Chapters 432 and 432B of the Nevada Revise d Statutes (NRS) and Nev ada's Regulations for the Protection from Abuse and Neglect (NAC 4 32B). CPS agencies respond to reports of abuse or neglect of children under the age of 18. There are three distinct agencies that provide child welfare services : State of Nevada, Division of Child and Family Services, Clark County Department of Family Services and Washoe County Department of Social Services. Child Protective Services state and county agencies are committed to building partnerships with local provider s that supply an array of serv ices to children and their families. CPS agencies partner with sch ools, law enforcement, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), juvenile just ice systems, community mental health providers, domestic violence program s, child death revi ew teams and agency multidisciplinary teams. Although Nevada has an array of services that are provided either by a child welfare agency or by a co ntracted provider, the CFSR identified gaps in services, particularly m ental health and substance abuse services. Not all services are always availabl e in all areas of the state. Family Preservation Services The State provides Family Preservation Se rvices programs which are characterized by high intensity immediately accessible tr eatment and ancillary services for at-risk children and families. The goals of Family Preservation Services' programs are to reduce the risk of child abuse/neglect and thus eliminate unnecessary out-of-home - 28 - placement of children and to strengthen the family to better care for the developmental needs of their children. Progr am staff provides crisis intervention, clinical assessment, and family preservation services to a protective services population in six areas: Washoe County, Clark County, Cars on City, Fallon, Elko and Ely. The parents, including married couples and fathers, have better supports and resources to deal with stress and crisis within the family. Clark County Clark County Department of Family Servic es, the agency responsible for the receipt and investigation of reports of child abuse and maltreatment, utilizes an array of prevention services to help children at risk re main safely with their families. Flexible funds can be used to support families in areas such as rent, utilities, apartment deposit, bus tokens, food vouchers and othe r basic needs. CCDFS has collaborative agreements/contracts with Bridge Counseling for assessment and counseling typically related to families with substanc e abuse problems, but also services those with dual diagnosis (mental healt h). Safe House and Safe Nest provide services to high-risk families of domestic violence. There continues to be successful collaboration where domestic violence professionals accompany CPS workers on investigations, despite the end in grant do llars to the Agassi Domestic Violence Center. Although at this time there cont inues to be collaboration with Safe House and Safe Nest, there is a higher need for these services. The outcomes documented where a domestic violence advocate ac companied the CPS investigator on a referral, showed a greater chance of the ch ildren remaining in the home due to this collaborative approach. Choices are acce ssed for families in need of substance abuse treatment. Nevada Parents Encouragin g Parents (PEP) will assign a Family Specialist to provide information and referral, and other resource needs. CCDFS has a full-time nursing position that is paid half by the Division and half by CCDFS. There is also a TANF-funded nursing position to support the full-time nurse to teach and provide health educationa l services. Focus group participants commented that there were many types of par ent training classes offered by, not only the county, but also numerous community agencies. In terms of promising practice s, the System of Care Grant, with significant efforts to ma ke systemic changes with training and the implementation of child and fami ly teams, is a huge effor t. Drug court is a voluntary option for families with substance abuse which is a major factor contributing to child abuse or neglect. The sa me judge hears the drug court and non-drug court dependency cases. This is a structur ed program with frequent drug-testing and treatment requirements. Cases are brought before the Court more frequently and consequences provided. Washoe County Washoe County Department of Social Serv ices contracts with an array of service providers for substance abuse evaluations and testing, psychological evaluations, testing and services and independent living services (including before and aftercare case management and hard services). Additi onally, each child welfare unit is allotted Special Unit Funds, which ar e used to assist parents in overcoming barriers that prevent them from caring for their chil dren. Although not an exhaustive list of - 29 - services, these flexible funds can be used to purchase groceries, utilities, rental assistance, motel housing and transportation . Child Care Block Grant dollars have been significantly reduced stat ewide due to changes in TANF eligibility. For Washoe County that meant a reduction from $1.4 m illion dollars to $242,000. This reduction has had an impact on foster and relative care providers wh o relied on this childcare support. The use of Human Services Support Specialists, typically para-professionals, provide much needed in-hom e services working with families on life skills training, transportation and information and referral. The Smart Marriage Conference and special training sessi ons were attended by a Washoe County Trainer in May 2003. Washoe County maintains an agreement with the Washoe County Health Department for public health nursing services. Social workers are able to access 88 hours per week of nursing services, 40 of wh ich are paid for by the Department. The nurses assist assessment and permanency staff with assessments of neglect and general health and welfare regardl ess of the children's legal status. Additionally, the Department recently employed a full time nurse practitioner to assist assessment workers in forensic evaluations of child abuse. Focus group participants indi cated that a major strengt h for prevention was the information and referral services provided by the agency, the loca l Family Resource Centers and Kids Korner Progr am. Kids Korner is a co llaborative outreach program between law enforcement, the medical community and t he Department for at risk children and families. The participants al so noted there are many free parent training classes offered in the community and WCDSS has contracts with providers for individualized parent trai ning. In addition, there are numerous faith-based support and advocacy groups, which are used to support families. Division Rural Region The IV-B sub grantees are a primary source for pre-placement services for the Rural Region. The Division Intensive Family Serv ices staff, which provide both clinical assessments and home-based family preservati on services, are also a significant pre-placement service. The Carson district office has one full-time homemaker that is utilized similarly to the Human Services Specialist in Washoe County. As part of AB1, the legislation co ntaining funding to support inte gration in the urban counties, the rural region received a number of new positions for \"match-up\" services designed to enhance the Rural Regions service delivery. To that end, three homemakers were allocated to Battle Mo untain, Tonopah and Pahrump areas and additional Intensive Family Service Clinical workers were allocated for Winnemucca, Elko and Silver Springs. Recruitment and re tention of these posit ions is an ongoing challenge. Other Services utilized by the Rural Region include servic es available through other non-profit agencies, as well as Rural Mental Heal th Clinics, which include substance abuse counseling, domestic violence interv entions, truancy, tutoring, parenting and prevention programs for child ren. County welfare progr ams are frequently accessed - 30 - for temporary housing, vouchers for clothing, food , gas, utilities and transportation. Community coalitions exist in each Ru ral community in an attempt to increase availability and accessibilit y through coordinated efforts between public and private agencies. Promising Practices a. Family Preservation Services The State has operated Family Preservation Services (FPS) existing in six sites throughout the state for over 10 years - Las Vegas, Elko, Fallon, Carson City, Ely and Reno. Services, like other FPS programs, are brief, intensive, home-based and family centered. A longitudinal st udy of FPS began in 1998 and spanned 4 years of data collection. What has emerged from t he longitudinal study is a database that contains information on 488 families and 742 children. Outcomes reflect that over 90 percent of the child ren remain safely in their home s 12 months after FPS services are terminated. As part of t he integration of child welfar e services, FPS services in Washoe County are now prov ided by Washoe County D epartment of Social Services and in Clark County by Clark County Department of Family Services. b. Washoe County In-Home Support Services Washoe County Human Services Support Spec ialist (HSSS) program provides in- home support services. There are two leve ls of HSSS services. A HSSS II provides services to families, regardless of the child ren's legal status, at the direction of an assigned social worker. The objective of a HSSS II is to enhance household management skills through budgeting, parenti ng education, transportation etc., in conjunction with creating hous ehold stability by connecti ng families with community based programs (NSWD, Family Resour ce Centers, Medicaid etc.). The second category is called a Senior HSSS. Although service provision is the same, the primary distinction is that a S enior HSSS is the assigned case manager. The Department involves a social worker at the onset of the case to determine the level of intervention necessary. If the fami ly is considered to be at low to moderate risk and is willing to voluntarily participate in preventative services, a Senior HSSS is assigned. The HSSS program works with fa milies for three to twelve months to ensure successful transition from suppor t and assistance to self-sufficiency. c. Clark County After Hours Unit In July 2003, an after hours unit began oper ation in Clark County, providing CPS services and investigations until 10:00pm daily an d all day on the weekends. This unit responds to children and families at the time of crisis. This unit provides immediate response and invest igation, preventing home remo val or allowing children to return home prior to waiting 24 hours to assign the case to a worker. This unit also balances the workload for the day sh ift investigators and allows them to prioritize and respond more efficiently to cases they are assigned. During the first two weeks of operation, over 50 investigat ions were initiated and 22 children were released from the Child Haven Emergency Shelter. - 31 - Statewide Survey Of major concern is the accessi bility of services to help parents in the process of reunification. Through statewide surveys during the CFSR Statewide Assessment of caseworkers, supervisors and foster parent s, as well as statewide focus groups, three services were identified as \"the grea test unmet service ne ed for birth parents,\" thus eliminating or prolonging their ab ility to reunite with their children. The following table identifies three servic es which were most often noted by respondents. Service Caseworker Surveys Supervisor Surveys Foster Parent Surveys a) Mental Health Services 22.5% 35.3% 8.8% b) Substance Abuse Services 20.7% 17.6% 2.9% c) Housing Services 18.9% 47.1% No Response Gaps in services will be addressed in the Nevada Program Improvement Plan. 2. Foster Care Services Statewide Survey During the focus groups conducted during the CFSR Statewide Assessment with child welfare professionals from the Division, extern al stakeholder groups (CASA, Mental Health) and service providers, there was unanimous agreement that accessibility to medical and mental health serv ices is a significant barrier for birth parents and children in foster care. Focu s groups statewide r eported the following: There are long waiting lists for service pr oviders, which cause a time lapse in receiving services to assist with the reunification process; There are concerns with the process of diagnosing children and families for the purpose of achieving referrals for mental health services; and Only children with the most serious em otional disorders are able to access treatment. Mental Health Consortia The 2001 Legislature via NRS 4 33B.333 established a Mental Health consortium in three jurisdictions: Clark County, Was hoe County, and the balan ce of the state (Rural). The functions of the Mental Health Consortia are to assess the need for behavioral health (mental healt h and substance abuse) services for children in each jurisdiction, assess how well the current system is meeting this need, develop an annual plan on how the need can be bette r met, and report this information to the legislative committee on children and youth on a regular basis. - 32 - In the spring of 2002 all three consorti a conducted a needs assessment survey of 757 professionals and family members to assess current behavioral health services and priorities. In addition, 1,457 children in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems were screened using the CALOCUS to determine their level of need for behavioral health services. A review of the plans reveals early access and counseling were rated as the highest priority needs in all three jurisdictions and accessibility to mental health services is sometimes a barrier to reunification. All th ree jurisdictions identified a growing need for bi-cultural and bilingual staff to meet the needs of Asian, Hispanic, and Native American families. Of the ch ildren screened only 56.1 perc ent are receiving mental health services at the level of their need. Although counseli ng was rated as the most accessible service, it was still rated as accessible for just \"s ome\" of the children who are in need. There ar e concerns with the limited availability of Medicaid providers due to the structur e of Medicaid reimburseme nts, procedures and filing requirements. Medicaid r equirements and procedures were seen as a barrier to accessing treatment. The Division is currently working with its sister agency, the De partment of Health Care Finance and Policy, to re-desig n children's behavioral health services throughout the state in incr ease access and availability. Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Services Division regional mental healt h treatment services have primary responsibility for providing services to children and adole scents with severe emotional disturbance (SED), independent of their service catego ry status. For example, regionalized mental health treatment programs provide care for SE D children who enter the child welfare system and/or juvenile justice system. In addition, the Divis ion regionalized mental health programs provide services to SED children in parental custody through community-based programs in the major metropolitan areas of Reno and Las Vegas . Early Childhood Services Early Childhood Services provides behavioral health services to children ages 0-6 with identified treatment needs and their families. Ea rly Childhood Services partners with Head Start, Child Care Assistance Programs, Child Protective Services and child care centers to provide comprehens ive, individualized, family-centered treatment services which support family re lationships and enhanc e children's mental health. Early Childhood Services progr ams are part of t he Neighborhood Care Centers in Southern Nevada. Division of Mental Health and Developmental Services The Division of Mental Health and Deve lopmental Services (MHDS) provides services to SED children and adolescents w ho are in rural area though the operation of its Rural Clinics satellite offices. Co mplementing these, th e Division Intensive Family Services continues to provide cr isis services, case management, and family - 33 - preservation services in rural Nevada comm unities. The Division's rural regional administration works closely with MHDS to provide effective children's mental health services. The two state-operated, communi ty- based clinics, Southern Nevada Child and Adolescent Services (SNCAS) in Clark County and Northern Nevada Child and Adolescents Services (NNCAD) in Washoe County provide early childhood services, outpatient and case management services, day treatment programs, residential treatment services, and crisis residential se rvices. In addition, school-aged children and adolescents are linked to providers offe ring therapeutic foster care, group care, and residential treatment and inpa tient hospitalization services. Substance Abuse Services In addition to the substance abuse services described in Sections III and IV, Nevada has a partnership with the Bu reau of Alcohol and Drug A buse (BADA). The Division recently collaborated with BA DA and received grant funding addressing the issue of juvenile delinquency and substance abuse. The grant was designed to take a comprehensive look at the substance abus e prevention and treatment services for juvenile offenders. The grant inclu des funding allocations for assessment, prevention, and treatment projec ts. One of the intents of this initial partnership with the Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse is that it will create more future opportunities for collaboration and funding of ongoing as sessment and treatment services in the training centers and at youth parole. Housing Services Focus groups conducted for the CFSR st atewide assessment in Washoe, Clark County, Carson City, and Fallon listed hous ing services as a barrier due to the fact that housing vouchers are limited and t he amount cannot meet the needs of the community. The following results were received: Forty-four percent of fo cus group participants feel that there are housing assistance services available, but they are not accessible, while an additional 29 percent see no housing assistance services in the community; Seventy-seven percent of par ticipants feel that housing assistance services are of critical importance in the community. Additionally , when housing services, such as flexible funds are available they are typically limite d to a one-time use or restricted to once every six-months; Utilities assistance services are also se en as available but not accessible (48 percent) but critically important (40 percent) in the community; and Twenty-nine percent of participants feel that cash assistance (monies available to assist with rental needs, utilities, gr oceries or other family needs) is not available in their community, but they are important (57 percent). Promising Practices a. Drug Courts Often issues that are brought to Family and Juvenile Courts involve substance abuse by parents or children. In Clark Co unty, the District Cour t-Family Division has established drug courts to aggressively a ddress drug issues. There is the Juvenile - 34 - Drug Court, which addresses the treatment needs of de linquent children who abuse drugs. The Dependency Drug Court addresse s the needs of abusive or neglectful parents whose children are involv ed with the dependency court. The Eighth District (Clark County) was the fi rst Court in the nation to establish a juvenile drug court and a child support drug court. Dr ug courts are also being utilized in the First District (Carson City/S torey), Third District (Churchill/Lyon), Ninth District (Douglas)-Sierra Region; Second Dis trict-(Washoe); Fourth District (Elko)- North Central Region with a proposal to dev elop a drug court in the Sixth District (Humboldt/Lander/Pershing). The drug cour ts require the frequent oversight of participant(s) by the Judge or Court Ma ster, frequent drug te sting and clinical treatment services. In Clark County, the District Court/Famil y Division has established the Dependency Drug Court, which addresses the needs of abusive or neglectful parents whose children are involved with the Dependency C ourt. Utilization of drug courts, which require the frequent oversight of participants of the Judge or Co urt Master, frequent drug testing and clinical treatment services , has proven very successful in terms of assisting numerous participants who are truly dedicated and committed in reaching their ultimate goal of overco ming drug abuse. Additionally, participants can provide information regarding their status in drug court, in cases where children have been removed from the home, and the court in the dependency case has a much better idea of whether reunification is a viable option for the family. Washoe County's Family Drug Court seeks to ensure child safety by providing treatment and services to parents with subs tance abuse problems. The goal is family reunification when appropriate, but alte rnative permanency placement plans are used as needed. Washoe County Department of Social Services refers 100 percent of the court's cases. The Nevada State Legislature, 2nd Judicial District Court, Washoe Co. Department of Social Servic es, Foster Grandparents Program, various private foundations help to support a self-p ay (sliding scale) program. The court has access to two programs, one of which provides a family housing facility, which includes men, with a target of transitioning families into permanent housing within approximately one year of entering the housing program . Graduated sanctions are used including community service, essays, increased treatment and urine testing, restrictions and civil contem pt (up to 25 days in jail). b. Family Peace Center Project and Other Visitation Improvement Efforts The Family Peace Center Proj ect is continuing in the 2nd Judicial District in Washoe County. With the initial assistance of Court Improvement Project funding, three tracks of visitations are scheduled for people from CPS, and those tracks are full all of the time. Extending hours and scheduling tracks in the eveni ng hours have made it more convenient for families to utilize. The program is now funded by the Washoe County Department of Social Services (approximately $49,000), and through the Safe Haven Grant that provi des supervised visitation to families where domestic violence occurs. - 35 - As a result of the success in the 2nd Distr ict (Washoe), a similar effort was begun in the 9th Judicial District (Douglas) called the Safe Families Visiting Program. c. Child Mental Health Init iative Neighborhood Care Project SAMHSA/CMHS Child M ental Health Initiative Ne ighborhood Care Project is a children's mental health in itiative approved and funded in FY99 in the amount of $6.3 million dollars over a period of five years for the purpose of providing comprehensive community mental health se rvices for children, adolescents, and their families. The SAMHSA/CMHS award enabled the Division of Child and Family Services to develop neighborhood care c enters that provide a broad array of community based services for children a nd families. The project enhanced the existing local interagency service system for children and adole scents in Las Vegas via the development of interagency serv ice coordination teams at neighborhood sites. Neighborhood Care Counc ils include representatives from families, public and private agencies that deliver child welfare, children's mental health, juvenile corrections and education services. The mission of the Neighborhood Care Center project is to provide creative, individualized, and effective services for ch ildren and families in their communities. Services build on and draw from the strengths of the families and their neighborhood. Public and private non-profit agencies are co-located at Neighborhood Care Centers to provide a broad range of serv ices that are accessible at a single, local center. The core val ues of the service system include being child centered, family focused and community based. The goal of the Division of Child and Family Services is to provide flexib le and unconditional services in a true partnership with the fa mily and community. d. Project WIN for Children and Families - Wraparound In Nevada The Wraparound process is a strength-based, family centered model used to improve the quality of life for youth and families who have co mplex needs. The model is not a program or type of service but is inte nded to be a unified response around a common mission that allo ws for youth and family par ticipation. The use of wraparound services results in individualized planning th rough the support of unique community services and natural support systems. This model was introduced to Nevada in th e spring of 2002 in response to AB1 and as a support to youth in the child welf are system with complex mental health needs. The initial implementation involved a tota l of 33 youth with an additional 294 youth who were included in the second phase-in period. Currently, Nevada is serving approximately 327 severely emotionally disturbed (SED) y outh per month. All youth/families involved in the Proj ect WIN have been provided wraparound support to include planning that is family -centered and done in partnership with the significant people who care about the youth/fa mily and individualiz ed specific to the youth/family culture, st rengths, and needs. Services ar e provided in the least - 36 - restrictive and the most normalized envir onment appropriate. The focus is on keeping the youth at home or in their home communiti es whenever possible through a collaborative process betwe en the people prov iding support and services for the youth. This results in a single coordi nated approach includi ng the strengths, needs, culture assessment and sing le plan of care that int egrate elements of the child welfare case plan, mental hea lth treatment plan and plan fo r other providers involved with the youth and that are outcome driven focusing on child safety, permanency and the well being of youth and families. Wraparound facilitators have been hired state wide to provide services to these youth/families. The wraparound facilitators are expected to work in a collaborative partnership with child welfare caseworkers, the youth/fam ily and all other child and family team members. This is to ensur e that youth/families receive comprehensive services while minimizing duplicati on and management ov ersight for the implementation and tracking of the youth/fa mily plan. This partnership and the model to provide services represent a ne w approach to providing services for youth meeting SED criteria within the general population. 3. Foster Care Licensi ng, Recruitment, and Training The recruitment and training of potential Resource Families (foster care and adoption) is accomplished by a small team of professionals in each region. In the Southern Region, the Division's unit transferred to Clark County effective April 2004. Clark County's team is composed of a recruiter, a special needs adoption recruiter/trainer, a resource family trai ner, a clinician, and a supervisor who is responsible for recruitment, training and li censing. Washoe County is now fully integrated and has a unit of recruiters and trainers including a special needs adoption recruiter/trainer and designated res ponsible supervisors. The Division's Rural Region has a small staff placed in some of the rural Division offices. Coordination with Tribal ent ities and foster parents is ongoi ng statewide. Statewide recruitment efforts are continuous for homes for older youth. Currently the Institute for Human Services Foster Parent Traini ng is used for foster parent training and mirrors the training pr ovided to the profe ssional staff. The Spanish version of the curriculum is taught in all the regions. All of the training sessions are co-taught by current and form er foster/adoptive pa rents with state or county professional staff. The Division State Training Specia list assists to facilitate quarterly meetings with the Re cruitment and Training staff from each of the three child welfare agencies. Resources are s hared, while efforts are coordinated and issues resolved. The selection of t he curriculum and the addition of training resources are also discussed in this setting. The workgroup includes staff representatives from the following agencies: Division of Child & Family Services Washoe County Department of Social Services Clark County Department of Family Services - 37 - University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) Foster Parent Associations Potential resource families are required to complete or ientation and foster parent basic training prior to licensure. Accordi ng to regulations, foster parents are required to obtain a minimum of eight hours of traini ng. Each of the ch ild welfare licensing agencies agree that the famili es need additional training in order to adequately care for foster children. Training is provi ded statewide. The pr ocess provides an opportunity for families to obtain pertinen t information to make the decision to continue to pursue licensure. The listing below outlines the basic m enu of classes that are offered: Overview Family Centered Child Protection Services Child Development Separation and Loss Engaging the Family in the Permanency Process Legal Requirements Documentation Major Risk Factors Training is a critical part of the recruitment plan. T he staff that implements the recruitment plan is the same staff that pr ovides the training. Once families contact the agency, the training proc ess is used to increase their understanding and to assist them in deciding if foster care or adoption is the right choice for their family. Advanced Training Licensed foster families are required to co mplete four hours of continuing education on an annual basis. The families achieve th is through the use of books, videos, available Web-based training, Websit e(fosterparents.com), community based training, state and county sponsored training, seminars, workshops and conferences. The advance training may also occur th rough the effort of the Nevada Training Partnership at the School of Social Work , University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and the School of Social Work, University of Neva da, Las Vegas (UNLV). The trainers are either independent contract ors or agency staff. Foster parents have had the opportunity to attend UNR and UNLV's spring conference. Both universities provide a one-day conference with a national keynote speaker and breakout sessions on re levant child welfare topics. Nevada was found to be in subs tantial conformity for the systemic factor of Training. A formal initial training program for all ne w staff child welfare workers includes a shadowing and mentoring component, require s ongoing training for staff and supervisors; and provides training for cu rrent and prospective foster parents, adoptive parents, and staff of licensed facilitie s that care for children. However, there are no child welfare pr ogram-specific supervisory trai ning requirements at this time. Child welfare supervisory tr aining will be address ed in the PIP. - 38 - Promising Practice Social Worker/Foster Parent Design Team In Reno, the training coordinator facilit ated a workgroup, or design team, in 2002 consisting of social workers and foster parents to identify those practices that encourage better collaboration and improved relationships between social workers and foster parents. It is we ll known that improved teamwork between social workers and foster parents results in better outcomes fo r foster children (either in reunifying with their families or in fi nding other permanent families) but such collaboration is often difficult. This design team deve loped a workshop to encourage improved teamwork between foster parents and social wo rkers. This workshop is co-taught by a foster parent and social worker and is now offered to the child welfare staff and foster parents on a regular, ongoing basis. Th is is a beginning effort to address the teaming of foster parents and social workers. 4. Kinship Care and ICPC The 2001 Legislature passed AB15, a kinshi p care bill jointly supported by the Welfare Division and DCFS. The Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) subsidized guardianship program has been operational since October 2002. In an effort to support permanency for children, t he legislation allows for any specified relative over the age of 62 who is caring for a relative child and who has legal guardianship to receive TANF assistance up to the amount of the state foster care payment. They receive medical assistanc e through Medicaid, respite care, child care, and other services. This program does not require that the child be in the custody or care of a child welfare agency. It is open to any qualifying relative guardian. Other requirements ar e included to assure the safety of the child and to provide support services to the families. As mentioned in Foster Care licensing, relatives who wish to receive a foster care maintenance payment must meet the same licensing requirements as family foster care. In Ap ril 2003, 20 percent or 454 of the children in Clark County in Div ision custody were living with kin. Kinship Care Study This was the first phase of an in-depth st udy of kinship care in Nevada. The research was collaboration between the Divisi on of Child and Family Services and the School of Social Work at UNLV, as we ll as the Kinship Care Advisory Board. Eighty kinship caregivers took part in a seri es of focus groups during the fall of 2003. These kinship caregivers comprised four cat egories: (1) relative caregiver; (2) TANF kinship caregiver; (3) non-needy caretaker; and (4) relative caregiver who does not receive a subsidy. The Kinship Care in Ne vada project explores the characteristics, motivations, experiences, and needs of relative caregivers. Phase I and Phase II of the Kinship Care project included a pilot st udy and series of focus groups. The final phase will result in a statewide mail survey. Promising Practice Clark County Kinship Care System of Care Grant In October of 2003 Clark County Family Services was awarded a five-year Caring Communities Demonstration Pr oject Grant which proposes to use Systems of Care - 39 - principles to increase placements with, and supports for, relatives when children must be removed from the home, and im proving the safety, stability, timely permanency and well-being for children in kin care. Ki n Care Coordinators are located at each of five community-based Neighborhood Family Se rvice Centers. They recruit, train and sustai n a culturally/lingui stically diverse network of volunteer kin care mentors, with prio r experience as caregivers to provide home-based support to new caregivers and will assist me ntors to facilitate orientation and support groups for kin caregivers. Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children The Division of Child and Family Services provides statewide administration of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Ch ildren (ICPC) Program. Regional child welfare staff in all DCFS Field Offices as well as Clark Co unty and Washoe County provides direct ICPC services. Chapter 127.330 of the Nevada Revised St atutes incorporates the text of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Ch ildren. The Compact is a uniform law that has been enacted by all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It establishes procedures for the in terstate placement of children and fixes responsibilities for those involved in pl acing the child(ren). The Compact Law defines the types of placements covered by the law, the persons, or agencies that must follow compact procedures, and the re quirements and the protection offered by the Compact. The intent of ICPC is to ensure protection and services to children who are placed across state lines for foster care, adoption, or institutional care. Each state, including Nevada, may be the sending or receiving state. The Compact applies to four types of situations in whic h children may be sent from one state to another: Placement preliminary to an adoption; Placements into foster care, including foster homes, group homes, residential treatment facilities, and institutions; Placements with parents and relatives when a parent or relative is not making the placement; or Placements of adjudicated delinquents in institutions in other states. To achieve its goal of ensuring suitable placement environments for children placed interstate, the compact: Requires notice and evaluat ions of the suitability of a placement before it is made; Allocates specifically t he legal and administrative responsibilities during the time of the interstate placement; Provides a basis for enforcement of ri ghts and responsibilities of the sending and receiving parties; and Authorizes joint actions of the administra tors in all party states to further the effective and efficient operations and se rvices for children in interstate - 40 - placements to ensure that their safe ty, well being and permanency needs are being met. Nevada ICPC collaborates nationally with all other states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nevada ICPC 's Deputy Compact Administrator serves as the statewide point of contact an d liaison with other states' compact administrators and ICPC liai sons; with other federal, st ate and local agencies (instate and out-of-state); and with national organizations and agencies. The Deputy Compact Administrator serves as a voti ng member at annual meetings of the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. The Deputy Compact Administ rator and Alternate provide technical assistance and consultation pertaining to IC PC to Division and Department staff; staff of other federal, state and loca l agencies (instate and out-of-state); professionals (including atto rneys, judges, court staff, ph ysicians, and other service providers); and clients or prospective clients. With the integration of Child Welfare Services in Clark County, the Division successfully implemented a comprehensive, statewide, automat ed child welfare information system, \"UNITY\" (Unified Nevada Information Technology for Youth) on September 9, 2003. The IC PC program specialists c ontinue to coordinate with UNITY to ensure that program functions are support ed in developing the statewide ICPC data management and information system component of the SACWIS system. The 100A, 100B, and 101 (Priority home study) are currently avai lable in UNITY. The information regarding demographics, plac ement resources, narratives, as well as case opening and clos ing dates are currently ent ered into UNITY and are retrievable when reviewing individual cases. ICPC successfully completed integration of incoming and supervisory services with Clark County in the Southern Region on April 1, 2004. Cla rk County also created and filled the new position of ICPC/ICWA Management Analyst. This posit ion promises to provide additional technical support and data management serv ices to the newly integrated child welfare services in Clark County. The ICPC Policy Manual was updated in Fall 2003, and accompanying training curricula was developed. Implementation of training began in November 2003. Training is an ongoing process. ICPC will be collaborating with UNITY until the target dat e of October 1, 2004, to determine whether a newly acquired databas e from the American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) will be co mpatible with UNITY. If the two systems are not compatible and enhancements to the UNITY system cannot be devised, ICPC plans to implement the new st and-alone database for the purposes of maintaining our own statistical data and record s. Prior to this implementation, ICPC data has been manually calculated on a quarterly basis. Central office staff will continue to provide technical assistance and guidance in areas such as developing checklists, and/or providing examples of addi tional tools to be utilized in the field to provide more comprehensive assessments. These tools will be designed to capture comprehensive and uniform information yet a llow flexibility for the regions. The - 41 - recommendations provided in the report gener ated by the Office of the Inspector General will be incorporated as needed and as practical. Nevada's rapid and sustained growth ha s contributed to many children being referred into and out of Nev ada for interstate placement. As evidenced in Chart 1, Nevada anticipates processing approxim ately 500 new ICPC placement requests per quarter and providing ongoing ICPC Administrative serv ices to an open caseload of over 1800 children.

NEVADA ICPC ADOPT IONS FINALIZED BY FISCAL YEAR 5. Guardianship During Legislative Session 2 003, State Assembly Bill 273 was passed and became effective October 1, 2003. The bill esta blished a procedure in Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 432, Administration; Nevada Revised Statute 432B, Child Protection; and Nevada Revised Statute 159, Guardians hip, that at the time of the annual permanency hearing an abused or neglected child may be permanently placed with a guardian pursuant to guardi anship requirements estab lished under NRS159. The provisions of the b ill include the following: Adoption should still be t he primary goal for children who cannot be reunified with their parents, limiting t he provisions of this bill to children for whom adoption is not a realistic option. Termination of the Division's custody when a guardian is appointed, but does not result in the termination of parental rights of the par ent(s) of the child. 202273 272 276 0100200300 SFY 2000 SFY 2001 SFY 2002 SFY 2003FINALIZED ADOPTIONS BY STATE FISCAL YEAR - 43 - The Court has the jurisdiction to enforce, modify, or terminate the guardianship until the child r eaches the age of 18 years. Allows any person having a direct interest in a guardianship so established to move to enforce, modify, or terminate the guardianship. Allows the Court to order the Div ision to file a report and make recommendations in response to any moti on to enforce, modify, or terminate a guardianship so established. 6. Adoption The Division's adoption service program pr ovides a full range of services, including children placed through private, interstate , or international adoption; relative/step- parent adoption when the court determines State agen cy involvement is necessary; and children in foster care. Services include pre-placement and post-placement counseling to birth parents; case managem ent; legal services to free children for adoption; recruitment, traini ng, home study prepar ation for prospective adoptive families; adoption subsidy; limited post legal adoption support; and licensing/administrative oversight to local pr ivate child placing agencies. The data in the table below reflects Nevada efforts to increase adoptions of children waiting in foster care. CHART 6. A combination of funding str eams, including IV-B, is used to facilitate placement services such as: 1) development of purchase of service agreements for adoptive parent training/preparation, 2) home study and 3) post placement services, particularly those involved in locating fam ilies residing in other jurisdictions. Areas of Improvement Information from focus groups conducted during the statewide assessment for the CFSR and interviews with Division staff identified the following barriers to finalizing adoptions of children in fo ster care in Nevada: The Division's role (pre-placement planning services to birth parents; assessing temporary foster care plac ements; prospective adoptive parents; post-placement supervision and court in volvement to finalize adoptions) in 202273 272 276 0100200300 SFY 2000 SFY 2001 SFY 2002 SFY 2003FINALIZED ADOPTIONS BY STATE FISCAL YEAR Finalized Adoptions - 44 - providing adoption services for inf ant and independent adoptions reduces staff availability to serve foster children. Recent efforts by the Division (increased service fees, increased number of priv ate agencies for infant and independent adoptions) have resulted in agencies assu ming a greater role in private adoptions, permitting Division staff less time to focus on the adoptions of children in foster care and children pl aced through Interstate placements. The ability to provide M edicaid assistance to non IV -E children with adoption assistance agreements from ot her states is needed. Cu rrently Nevada is one of approximately seven states that does not provide medica l assistance to children with state funded adoption subsidy agreements. Reciprocating with other states would encourage other states to continue serving Nevada's non IV-E children. If that support is wit hdrawn, Nevada fam ilies will encounter difficulties meeting the medical, and behavioral treatment needs of adopted children when they leave the state. Given the emphasis on the inter- jurisdictional adoptions, this issue may be considered a barrier to families who would otherwise consider accepting plac ement of a child from Nevada with highly specialized treatment needs. Nevada continues to have many older ch ildren awaiting adoption. Increased effort must be placed to recr uit families for the adoption of these older children. Intercountry Adoptions The Division is in the process of evaluating the ability of the statewide data collection system to collect and track information on th e number of children adopted from other countries who are placed in State or County care due to disruption or dissolution of the adoption; information regarding the a gency which handled t he adoption; the reason for the disruption/dissolu tion; and the plans for the child. This information is now collected manually. No children have been identified as being in the custody of the state or county due to a failed intercountry adoption. State and county agencies se rve families adopting inte rnationally. The agencies complete home studies and provide plac ement and post-placement services. Families requiring additional support servic es otherwise available to families through Title IV-B; services funded by adoption inc entive funds; Title XX; Children's Mental Health; other community based service prog rams, etc., may be referred and receive services when eligibility requirements ar e met. Children adopted internationally are not categorically excluded from services. Adoption Incentive Payments For federal fiscal year 2003, the Divisi on received $28,000 in Adoption Incentive payments. A spending plan wa s developed by a statewide gr oup of staff involved in the recruitment and support of adoptive parents which identified the following service needs: specialized recruitment and retent ion activities; purchase of service agreements to facilitate out-of-state plac ements; Adoption Exchange Registration - 45 - membership fees; and individual support se rvices needed by families to prevent disruption. AdoptUSKids Nevada has contracted with the Adoption Exchange to m eet the requirements of AdoptUSKids. All three child welfare agencies are involved in this national campaign effort. Statewide representatives attended the training held in San Francisco and the National Meeting in Washington D.C. AdoptUSKids will be coordinated with regional recruitment plans. *Promising Practice Support of adoptive families by clinical staff Better preparation of foster families expres sing a desire to adopt foster children in their care is needed. Washoe Department of Social Services Adoption Program and the Clark County Child Advo cacy Center have utilized c linical staff to support families' adoption of chil dren with emotional/behavior al needs. This service combined with the develop ment of a \"transition\" case pl an is a promising practice to better support and prepare both fost er-adoption and stranger adoptions. 7. Independent Living For the Description of Nevada 's Independent Living Services - Refer to the attached Independent Living Pl an (Appendix B) - 46 - Section IV. Existing Service Description A. Services Promoting Safe and Stable and Families The primary goals of Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) (Title IV-B Subpart 2) are to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from thei r families, improve the quality of care and services to ch ildren and their families, and ensure permanency for children by reuniting them with their parents, by adoption or by another permanent living arrange ment. The programs include: family support, family preservation, time-limited family reunification and ado ption promotion and support services. The services are designed to help State child welfare agencies and eligible Indian tribes establish and operate integrated, preventiv e family preservation services and community-based family support services for families at risk or in crisis. Funds go directly to child welf are agencies and eligible Native American tribes to be used in accordance with their five-year plans. Other grant funds are set aside for nationally funded evaluation, research, and training and technical assistance projects. In addition, funds are set aside for court improvement programs. PSSF services are based on several key principles. The welfare and safety of children and of all family members s hould be maintained wh ile strengthening and preserving the family. It is advantageous fo r the family as a whole to receive services which identify and enha nce its strengths while meet ing individual and family needs. Services should be easily accessibl e, often delivered in the home or in community-based settings, and they shoul d respect cultural and community differences. In addition, they should be flexib le, responsive to real family needs, and linked to other supports and services outside the child welfare system. Services should involve community organizations a nd residents, including parents, in their design and delivery. They should be inte nsive enough to keep children safe and meet family needs, varying between preventive and crisis services. Definitions of Title IV-B Subpart 2 1. Family Support (Prevention and Support Services) is defined as: Community- based services which promote the well- being of children and families and are designed to increase the strength and stabi lity of families (including adoptive, foster, and extended families), to increas e parents' confidence and competence in their parenting abilities, to afford children a stable and supportive family environment, and to enhance child development. These services may include respite care for parents and other car egivers; early developmental screening of children to assess the needs of these children and assistance in obtaining specific services to meet their needs; mentoring, tutoring, and health education for youth; a range of center-based activiti es (informal interactions in drop-in centers, parent support gr oups); services designed to increase parenting skills; counseling and home-visiting activities. - 47 - 2. Family Preservation is defined as: Crisis Intervention: Services for child ren and families designed to help families (including adoptive and extended families) at-risk or in crisis; Placement Prevention: Services to pr event family disruption and unnecessary removal of children from their homes (as appropriate). These services may include intensive family preservation, post-adoption support services, case management, counseling, day care, respite services, homemaker services, services designed to increase parenti ng skills, family budgeting, coping with stress, health, and nutrition; Reunification Services: Services to hel p children, where appro priate, return to families from which they have been removed or to be placed for adoption or legal guardianship. These services may include day care services, homemaker or caretaker services, family or indi vidual counseling fo r parent(s) and child, follow-up care to families to whom a child has been returned after placement and other reunification services the State identifies and necessary. 3. Time-Limited Family Reunification Serv ices are defined as: Services and activities that are provided to a child t hat is removed from the child's home and placed in a foster family home or a child care instit ution and to the parent or primary caregiver of such a child, in order to facilitate the reuni fication of the child safely and appropriately within a timely fashion, but only during the 15-month period that begins on the date that the chil d, pursuant to section 475 (5)(F), is considered to have entered foster care.

Gaps in Services The most notable gaps in service are Adopt ion Promotion and Suppor t. The State is challenged with a lack of qua lified providers to provide needed adoption support services. Findings from the CFSR i ndicated the three greatest barriers to reunification are mental health and substa nce abuse services and housing services. Funding criteria will be reviewed to addr ess service gaps. All three regions also identified the following service nee ds to be addressed in the PIP: A growing need for bicultural and bilingua l staff to meet t he needs of Asian, Hispanic, and Native American families; A need for mental health serv ices that meet children' s needs (a state survey noted that of the childr en screened, only 56.1% were receiving mental health services at the level of their need); and A need for Medicaid providers. Evaluation of Sub-grantees The Senator Alan Bible Center for App lied Research has bee n working with sub- grantees to develop and report on measur able outcome goals. This year the Center developed a secure web system that allows users to enter monthly reports into a database electronically. The grant ees are at different places in goal development and tracking due to the diverse nature of services they provide and varying degrees of organizati onal structure. See A ppendix E for the complete Evaluation Report. B. Estimated Expenditures for above Services Based upon previous annual exp enditures it is anticipat ed that approximately $259,000 will be available for each of the service areas. Se rvices will be provided in the four areas under the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program: Family Preservation, Family Support, Time-Limit ed Family Reunific ation, and Adoption Promotion and Support Services keeping wit hin the required f ederal expenditure guidelines. C. Decision Making Process Twenty-one (21) community- based providers are funded through out the state. The Title IV-B Steering Committee has served as the advisory body for the Nevada Promoting Safe and Stable Families Pr ogram. Members of the committee represent state and county agenc ies, and community organizations serving children and families. Currently, the commi ttee provides advice and makes recommendations to the Division of Chil d and Family Services regarding child welfare programs and services. Mem bers of the committee served as proposal reviewers during the grant funding proce ss. The IV-B Steering Committee will evolve into a statewide advisory committee wit h broader representation. In addition, to providing input into the CFSP, commi ttee members will have the opportunity to participate in other Div ision initiatives. - 51 - ICWA - Coordination with Tribes The Division of Child and Family Services coordinates and consul ts with four main tribal entities: Northern Paiute Tribe, Southern Paiu te Tribe, Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, and Shoshone Tribe. There are a total of 26 federally recognized tribal entities in Nevada that include bands, colonies and reservations and two urban Indian organizations, the Las Vega s Indian Center and Nevada Urban Indians, Inc. These tr ibal entities work together with the Division and counties through the Indian Child Welf are Steering Committee that was developed to assure compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act. The committee's membership consists of r epresentatives from the Nevada Indian Child Welfare Association, Inter-tribal Co uncil of Nevada, 26 Nevada Tribal Social Service agencies, Bureau of Indian Affair s - Western and Eastern Regional Offices, Nevada Urban Indians, Inc., Las Vegas In dian Center, Nevada Indian Commission, Nevada Division of Child and Family Serv ices, University of Nevada Training Partnership, Clark County Department of Family Services, Washoe County Department of Social Services and community-based service agencies, such as Stepping Stones Tribal Emergency Shelter. The Steering Committee has been collaborating to improve the provision of child welfare services and protec tions under section 422(b)(10) of the Act to Indian children under both State and Tribal jurisdiction. Ther e are no formal arrangements currently made with the tribes for the provis ion of child welfare services to Indian children under both State and Tribal jurisdiction. To address this issue, the Steering Commi ttee started to work on the Indian Child Welfare Best Practice Guidelines: \"Initi ating the Contact and Referral Between Child Welfare Agencies and Tribal Social Service Agencies\" in January of 2004. This draft will be jointly developed by the Division a nd representatives of the Indian Child Welfare Steering Committee by December 31, 2005 to cover the how-to process of making service referrals to agencies for non-tr ibal or ineligible children living on an Indian reservation, the process for contact and service delivery on the Indian reservation and other procedures necessary for the provision of services. Non-tribal or ineligible children living on an Indian Reservation are those children who are not tribal members of that Indian reservation, but live on the Indi an Reservation and are not eligible for services from that tribal entity but may be e ligible for services from the State or county social service agencies. The Nevada Revised Statutes has embodied the provisions of the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act in several subsections of the State law. T hese requirements are contained in the case compliance review and will be consolidat ed into the quality assurance review tool that will incor porate key elements of the CFSR review instrument. The case compliance review in strument has been prov ided to the tribal entities on the Indian Chil d Welfare Act and a matrix was jointly developed on jurisdictional issues relative to the Stat e of Nevada in October 2003 and finalized in January 2004. The specific measures t he Division uses to comply with the Indian - 52 - Child Welfare Act are through case comp liance/quality assurance review and training. The Division will accomplish this through the development of a quality assurance instrument cont aining the ICWA elements. The Nevada Children's Justice Act Task Force has published the \"Indian Child Welfare Resource Guide for Nevada \" that was jointly developed by the members of the Indian Child Welfare St eering Committee in 2002 and finalized in 2003. This publication was designed to assist State and county child welfare agencies on the law and contacts within Nevada Tribes. The publication is a resource guide. Tribes have been invited to participate on the Child Welfare Steering Committee, Title IV-B Steering Committee, State planning activities and in Division training. The mutual goal has been to improve services for all chil dren. The Divisi on will continue to collaborate and coordinate with the Ne vada Tribes and Tribal entities on improving the child welfar e system through the Indian Child Welfare Steering Committee. The committee will develop an action plan outlining coordination between the State/county and tribes to identify and implement best practice standards on arrangements for appropriate referrals and prov ision of child welfare services for Indian children by June 30, 2005. 53 Section V. Evaluation and Technical Assistance National Resource Centers for Child Welfare From the very beginning of th is process, the National Re source Centers for Child Welfare have been providing guidance and technical assistance as follows: National Resource Center for Informati on and Technology in Child Welfare assisted in identifying t he data that helped create the data profile for the CFSR; National Child Welfare Resource Cent er for Organizational Improvement provided technical assistance in develop ing a strategic planning process that incorporates the Program Im provement Plan into the Five Year Master Plan; National Resource Center for Child Welfare Training and Evaluation is assisting in developing a state trai ning plan that would better support Nevada's PIP and Master Plan; National Resource Center for Yout h Development provided technical assistance for issues relating to independent living services; and National Resource Center for Child Maltreatment provided technical assistance in the area of child abuse and neglect. Nevada will continue to utilize technica l assistance from the various NRCCW in order to support the 5-year state plan, the PI P planning process and subsequent implementation. With the collaboration of the County Child Welfare Directors, the DCFS Administrator will oversee the plans and develop strategies for compliance and program improvement based on q uantifiable and qualitative data. The Senator Allen Bible Center for Applied Research will continue to serve as the evaluator for IV-B sub-grantees. The report for 2003 was submitted with the Fifth Annual Progress and Service Report for FFY 04. 54 Section VI. CERTIFIC ATIONS AND ASSURANCES Title IV-B Child and Family Services Plan: Assurances State Chief Executive Officer's Certifi cations for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program State Chief Executive Officer's Certifi cation for the Education and Training Voucher Program, Chafee Foster Care Independence Program State Chief Executive Officer's Assuran ce Statement for The Child Abuse and Neglect State Plan CFS-101, Part II Annual Summary of Child and Family Services 55 APPENDICES 56 APPENDIX A CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES STATE PLAN FFY 2004-2009 Desired Outcome: The incidence of child abuse and neglect will be reduced and the outcomes for safety, permanency and well-being of children in Nevada will be improved. The State of Nevada Division of Child and Family Services actively supports the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, and Children's Bureau, child welfare outcomes. The national goals of safety, permanency, and child well being are th e foundation for the development of systemic and outcome measures aimed at im proving the lives of children who are exposed to child abuse and neglect. The child welfare outcomes required from states pursuant to section 479(a) of the Social Securi ty Act as amended by section 203(a) of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, include the quantitative data provided by the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting S ystem (AFCARS), and the qualitative information from the Child and Family Service Review (CSFR). The purposes of safety outcome measures are to assess the effectiveness of an agency's child welfare system in protecting children from abuse or neglect in their own homes and in foster care. This reflec ts those actions taken by public agencies and their partners to create safety for ch ildren who have experienced or are \"at- risk\" of experiencing abuse, neglect or emotional maltreat ment from the action or inaction of their parents or caretakers. An indication that the child protection system may be achieving the objective of ch ild safety is through the quantitative measure of the reduction of the rate or incidence of re currence of maltreatment. How the incidence rate is reduced is in dicative of the qua litative performance measures that are the mechanisms an agen cy employs to respond to child abuse and neglect. The State of Nevada supports the child welfare outcome goals through NCANDS and AFCARS data collection by the Unifi ed Nevada Information Technology for Youth (UNITY), a State Au tomated Child Welfare Info rmation System (SACWIS), and through program performanc e measures outlined by the CSFR. The following includes the background of the child protection system and organization in Nevada, safety outcomes and indicators, t he child protection goals and objectives, and related program activities that form the basis for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) State Plan for FFY 2004 - 2009. BACKGROUND AND ORGANIZATION The Nevada Division of Chil d and Family Services is the agency res ponsible for planning, coordinating and moni toring child protec tive services pr ovided throughout 57 the state; coordinating its acti vities with and assisting the efforts of law enforcement agencies, the courts, and public and priv ate organizations wh ich provide social services for the prevention , identification and treatmen t of abuse or neglect of children; and involving communities in the improvement of protective services. The Nevada Division of Child and Family Servic es is responsible fo r adopting regulations that establish reasonable and uniform standards fo r protective serv ices provided in the state. Provision of child protecti ve services in Nevada is a combination of State and County administered agencies. Child Protective Services is part of the child welfare service system (Nevada Revised St atutes (NRS) 432B.044). Counties in which the \"population is 100,000 or more shall pr ovide child welfare services for the children in that county and pa y the cost of all those serv ices (NRS 432B .325).\" Clark County in Southern Nevada and Washoe County in Northern Neva da are the two counties that meet this stan dard. The Division administ ers the child welfare program for the remaining fifteen (15) rural counties. The agencies t hat provide protective services are: State of Nevada Division of Child and Family Serv ices (DCFS), Clark County Department of Fami ly Services (CCDF S), and Washoe Co unty Department of Social Services (WCDSS). NEVADA CITIZEN REVIEW PANEL The Nevada Citizen Review Panel was es tablished in 1999 and is maintained by the CAPTA grant. The panel submits an annual report on the progress that the Child Protective Services agencies are making with respect to protecting children. The panel conducts case reviews, po licy and practice reviews and makes recommendations for improving the child protection system. The panel produces an annual report that is submitted with t he Child and Family Services Annual Progress Report. CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVI CES STATEWIDE TEAM The Division of Child and Family Services, Clark Coun ty Department of Family Services and Was hoe County Department of Social Services work together in developing and evaluating standardized policies and procedures, investigative practice, including safety a nd risk assessment, intake, case management and service delivery in child protection that will im prove the system. The CPS Statewide Team provides information and par ticipates in related activities of the Nevada Child Protective Services Citizen Review Panel and the Neva da Children's Justice Task Force. The team is supp orted by the CAPTA grant. CAPTA STATE PLAN GOALS The goals and objectives of CAPTA are found in Section V of the State Plan. These goals are directed at improving the safety, permanency and well-being of children. 58 CAPTA: SAFETY OUTCOME - DATA Description: The safety outcome measures are directed at the reduction of recurrence of child abuse and neglect for th ose reports of children that have been substantiated including children in foster care. The reduction of the rate of recurrence of maltreatment is an indication that the chil d protection system may be achieving the objective of child safety. Th is information is provided by the UNITY- SACWIS computer system. The goal is to provide a baseline for futu re data comparison that will reflect the recurrence and incidence of child abuse. Please refer to Section I, Outcome I. Data Definition: This data will be co llected from the UNITY /SACWIS computer system that should be fully oper ational by 2004. It may require a year to establish a statewide baseline of child specific data for comparative purposes. The data for Measure 1.1 will reflect recidivism rates for children who have had a substantiated report wit hin six months prior to the date of the current report. The data for Measure 2.2 will reflect the incidence of abuse in foster care settings. The data should be available by the end of 2004 or early 2005. The information obtained from these data ma y be an indication of how well the system addresses the needs and safe ty concerns of children. CAPTA SAFETY OUTCOME - PROGRAM PERFORMANCE Description: The CAPTA State Plan adopts the safety outcome measures that are linked to program performance. T hese measures tell about how well the program is meeting its requirements to provi de safety to children. Each measure is taken from the Federal Child Welfare Ou tcomes standard and is found in Section V. Vision, Principles, Goals and Objectiv es, safety outcomes 1 and 2, objectives and action steps of the co mprehensive State Plan. The CAPTA areas selected for improvement are: Sec. 106(a)(1) Improving the intake, a ssessment, screening and investigation; Sec. 106 (a)(3) Improving the case management, including ongoing case monitoring and delivery of services and tr eatment provided to children and their families; Sec. 106 (a)(4) Enhancing the general child protection system by developing, improving, and implementing risk and sa fety assessment tools and protocols. CAPTA funds will be used to improve outcomes for the safety and permanency outcomes through the review, evaluation and development of cons istent statewide statute/regulation, policy, protocols, and practice fo r the intake, risk, safety 59 assessment, screening, decision-making, investigation of reports and referral processes for child abuse and neglect. T hese safety outcomes, objectives and action steps are found in Section V of the Comprehensive Five-Year Child and Family Services State Plan. CAPTA TRAINING CAPTA funds will be used to support traini ng to improve outcomes for the safety, permanency and well-being of children (Sec.106 (a)(1)-(8)). Training activities are included in the training sect ion of the Child and Family Se rvices Plan. There is no significant difference from the activities des cribed in the previous State plan except there will be more emphasis on improving those areas identifie d by the Child and Family Services Review in the Program Improvement Plan. Description of services and training to be provided under the CAPTA State Grant as per section 106(b)(2)(C) CAPTA (i) Services: The CAPTA Basic State Grant provides indirect services to individuals and families through provision of referrals from ch ild abuse and neglect reports received by child protection agencies to contracted Title IV-B community-based service providers. These referrals are aimed at intervening and preventing the re- occurrence of child abuse and neglect by referring families to a family assessment and services system process. The family assessment and services system provides an opportunity for families to receive services, or other appropriate referrals to local community based service providers. (ii) Training: Training will be provided to support direct line and supervisory personnel on child abuse and neglect in the areas of: intake and investigation, screening, safety and risk assessment, use of instruments, decisi on making, court processes, concurrent case planning, case management, and other areas as indicated.

The Division of Child and Family Services is responsible for th e oversight of all independent living programs in Nevada. The oversight responsibility is assigned to the statewide independent liv ing coordinator at the Division Central Office. Nevada is a state-supervis ed and county-administered program in the two major metropolitan counties, Clark and Washoe. Nevada continues to supervise and administer all child welfare programs in the remaining 15 rural counties, comprising the Rural Region. Nevada plans to conti nue the implementation of its IL Program by allocating both federal and state fu nds to the two county-administered programs, the Stat e administered Rural Region, and tribal entities. The State will continue to retain a portion of the feder al funds to develop statewide systems and materials to support county and rural implem entation efforts, to monitor program development and implementation, to provi de technical assistance, and to continue to assess program impact. Nevada a nd its independent li ving partners will cooperate with the national evaluations of the effects of independent living programs in achieving the purposes of the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. Nevada's Independent Living Program is a se t of services available to all foster youth between the ages of 15.5 until the age of 21. The Division considers all eligible foster youth to in clude those youth who are in the care and custody of the Division, Washoe County D epartment of Social Services, or Clark County Department of Family Services. The Divisi on considers foster care to be the legal status of the child. The physical plac ement of the child does not determine the eligibility for independent liv ing services. Independent living services may continue with the child after permanency has been ac hieved, depending on the needs of the child. Nevada will also ex tend independent living services to eligible youth who have relocated to Nevada from another state. Federal independent living f unding is provided to all county and state programs to provide independent living services, expand existing services, and to establish new services to eligible children. Federal funds are combined with existing state funds to provide independent living services to eligible foster youth and former foster youth transitioning to independence. Stat e funds through the Assistance to Former Foster Youth Program are funds dedicated to Nevada foster youth who are 63 transitioning from care and for Nevada youth who have aged out of the Nevada foster care system. In 2000, the Nevada State Legi slature passed legislation creating the Assistance for Former Foster Youth fund by taxing the copying of real estate filing transactions throughout the state. This fund, provided by AB94, wa s specifically created to provide the necessary goods and services to Nevada youth who have aged out of the foster care system until the youth reach ed the age of 21. Goods and services allowable to youth include, but are not lim ited to job training, housing assistance, case management, and medical insurance. The legislation directs the State to limit the administrative costs of the fund to 10% or less. The Legislative Council Bureau, with the concurrence of the Offi ce of the Attorney General, determined that the fund could also be used to assist youth who are currently in the care and custody of the state with their transiti on to independence. During the Child and Family Services Review in Februar y 2004, Nevada was commended for the creation of this fund, and the fund was noted as a promising practice in Nevada. SCOPE OF SERVICES Nevada makes available fede ral and state funds to support IL services to support existing programs as well and encourage the development of new programs. Nevada will continue to enc ourage the counties and Rural Region to out-source its programs through private vendors to fully dev elop the array of services necessary for their region. Funds for the Independent Living Program ar e distributed from the state to the counties and to the Rural Region to support independent living program development and activities. In Clark County, Chafee f unds are currently distributed through the state to the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension Program for eligible youth who are in ca re. The Cooperative Extension Program has a network of Chafee partners within the private non-profit and profit sector to compliment their array of i ndependent living services. In addition, state funds are combined with the Chafee f unds for youth who have left placement and are contracted through Clark County Department of Family Services to the Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth. In Washoe County, all C hafee and state funds are routed through Washoe C ounty Department of Social Services to the Children's Cabinet of Washoe County to pr ovide independent living services to eligible youth who are in care and to t hose youth who have left placement. The Rural Region of DCFS routes both f ederal and state funds through JOIN (Job Opportunities in Nevada), a WIA (Workforce Incentive Act) provider for all independent living program activities for youth in care, and to those youth who have left placement. The Rural Region rout es additional Chafee funds for stipends to youth in care through a IV-B Family Resource Center. Nevada distributes independent living funds to tribal youth th rough the Fallon Paiute- Shoshone Tribal Stepping Stones Shelter. (see Attachm ent, Figure 1, Statewide Programs and Distribution of Funds) 64 Program Activities for Youth in Care Federal independent living funds may be used by Washoe County, Clark County and the Rural Region to support a wide variet y of activities for youth in placement that meet the eligibility requirements for the Chafee Foster Care Independent Living Program. The State provides guidance to Washoe County, Clark County and to the Rural Region, and makes available technical assistance regarding the access of the spectrum of independent living services as follows: 1. Individualized assessment of the independent living needs of eligible foster youth and the development of independent living case plans based on the results of the assessment. 2. Individualized assessment is to include the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment. 3. Life book/portfolio for each youth is developed. 4. Classroom teaching and ex periential learning programs in daily living skills, life skills, self-management, interpersonal relationships, career planning, locating and maintaining housing, etc. 5. Direct stipends. 6. Financial assistance for legal guardianships. 7. Job training, placement, job coaching, and follow-up services. 8.

PROGRAM ACTIVITIES FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND YOUTH IN TRANSITION Nevada incorporates the us e of state funds specified for former foster youth between the ages of 18-21 who meet the eligibi lity requirements with the federal independent living funds and routes the funds to Washoe County, Clark County and the Rural Region for program dev elopment and service delivery. 65 Nevada recognizes that safe and stable housi ng for all former foster youth is key to providing permanence to youth. Nevada uses both federal and state money to provide for room and board for former foster youth. Nevada defines room and board as those ex penses incurred by the youth for rent, utilities, deposits, and food afte r exiting care. These services are provided to youth who are no longer eligible to receive IV-E payment and are available until the youth turns 21 years old. The following program activities are provided: 1. Support youth in transition to independence with s pecialized case management. 2. Support youth in transition to independenc e with individual stipends to assist with transition, e.g., security deposits, utility deposits, application fees, rental deposits, etc. 3. Post-secondary education workshops. 4. Case management to tra ck youth and prov ide outreach. 5. Case management providing refe rrals to community and governmental agencies to provide for the youth's needs, e.g., health care, dental care, counseling, mental health, substance abuse counseling, family planning, housing, social security benefit s, welfare be nefits, etc. 6.

Training of staff, supervisors, admin istrative personnel, care providers and youth in Clark County by the National Resource Center for Youth Services. COLLABORATIONS THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS Statewide public and privat e partnerships are developed to provide IL services throughout the state. Each region develops a service array unique to their community. Representatives from indepen dent living partners from all regions, including tribal representation and inde pendent living youth, contributed to the development of the st atewide CFSP process. Clark County combines the resources ava ilable through the Div ision and the Clark County Department of Family Services fo r their independent livin g partnerships. Chafee IL funds are currently sent from the Division to the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension Program who broadens its scope of services by contracting with the Center for Indepen dent Living, the CASA Foundation, the Business Connection (a private com pany), and Nevada Educational Consultants (a private company). Clark County D epartment of Family Services is responsible for the management of the state funds for former fo ster youth, and cont racts with a private nonprofit, the Nevada Partnership for Homele ss Youth, to provide the spectrum of aftercare and transitional services to y outh. An independ ent living oversight committee meets monthly in Clark County to review independent living programs within the region. The primary focus of the committee has been addressing the needs of foster youth transiti oning from care, and the needs of former foster youth. The committee is chaired by the Director of the Clark County Depa rtment of Family Services and comprised of representativ es from public and private stakeholders, including the court, youth, former foster youth, and foster parents. Washoe County Department of Social Se rvices contracts with the Children's Cabinet, a private, nonprofit agency and is also a IV-B provider. Washoe County uses the Children's Cabinet for the full array of IL services for youth in care and for former foster youth by combining the federal and state indepen dent living funds. The DCFS Rural Region has partnered with J OIN (Job Opportunities in Nevada), a WIA (Workforce Investment Ac t) provider for services to youth in care and for former foster youth by combining the feder al and state independent living funds. In addition, the Rural Region pl aces Chafee funds at the Ron Wood Family Resource Center, a IV-B provider, to assist fost er youth with stipends to meet personal needs. The Division has partnered wit h the Tribal Stepping St ones Shelter in Fallon, Nevada to receive Chafee funds for Native American Youth. St epping Stones was designated to be the Chafee recipient by the Nevada tribal entities after lengthy 67 consultation and deliberation. The St epping Stones Shelter is on the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Reservation. TRIBAL EFFORTS Nevada regularly meets wit h tribal representatives through the Indian Child Welfare Association. This meeting is a forum for state and tribal representatives to discuss issues relating to child welfare and the implementation of program efforts mutual to both parties. The meetings are scheduled through the association and the meetings are held at va rious tribal locations. The tribal representatives and representatives from the Divis ion Central Office staff join tly facilitate the meetings. During these meeting, independent living information and updates are provided to participants. This tribal association, in partnership with the state, determined that the independent living needs of tribal yout h would best be met through their tribal shelter, Stepping Stones. Stepping Stones se rves Native youth from all of the Nevada tribes. Nevada has encouraged its tri bal partners to review its youth who have exited from care to determine if services can be expanded. Nevada has reserved state funds for the tribes to access for this purpose. Nevada increased its Chafee funding to the Stepping St ones Shelter in 2003 in order that the program coul d be expanded, and the funds could assist the shelter in supporting its administrative in frastructure and staff development. STATUTORY/ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS CHALLENGES Legislation was not passed by the Nevada Legislature in 2002 that would allow Nevada to expand its Medicaid option to include youth ages 18-20 years old who have aged out of the foster care system . Advocacy groups within the state have indicated that they will pr opose reintroduction of this legislation in the 2005 legislative session. Nevada will request legislativ e review and modification of the law that provides state funds to former fost er youth in order to clar ify in statute that youth transitioning from care are e ligible for thes e state funds. The integration of child welfare services is finalized on October 1, 2004 when the final transfer to Clark County Department of Family Services occurs. This transfer will provide better coordination and comm unication regarding independent living services in Clark County and will unify all programs under t he management and supervision of one agency. Lack of systemic statewide training for staf f, supervisors, and care providers in the concepts of independent living, i ndependent living resources and youth development has created fragmentation in the service delivery system, and caused youth to be underserved or not served at all. 68 Systemic statewide training for child welfare staff and supervisors and undeveloped policies and procedures regar ding permanency planning for older youth has resulted in the lack of pe rmanency and comprehensive transitional planning for youth. Memorandum of Understanding between the Division and the Division of Mental Health and Developmental Services (MH/DS) to assure transition of youth to adult services has not been optimally utilized. Independent living service array has not been fully developed and implemented statewide to address transiti onal living options, medical services, mentoring, and necessary skill develop for youth to achieve independence. PLANNING NEEDS 1. Statewide Plan Statewide planning fo r independent living was initiated in April 2004. Stakeholders from around the state were invited to participate in the planning process. Participants included representatives from youth, tribes, and independent living providers. The work group focused on improving permanency outcomes for older foster youth and youth likely to remain in care until they age out of the foster care system. The Division will plan a stat ewide meeting of independent living stakeholders within six months to further define the direction of the program. Items to be addressed are to include youth el igibility, eligibility of juvenile corrections youth, expanding the scope of program, statewide youth advis ory board, enhanced coordination of services, planning for youth in transition, parenting youth, ident ification of service strengths and barriers, and comments/conc erns regarding existing and future services. 2. Youth Development Technical assistance and support will be given to Washoe County, Clark County and the Rural Region to develop and implem ent functional youth advisory boards: A statewide youth conference wi ll be planned within six months; A statewide youth advisory board as a re sult of the yout h conference; and Youth leaders throughout the state will be identified to attend the Casey Family Programs youth conference in Sacramento, California in October 2004. 3. Policy and Procedure Nevada will review and amend existing po licies and procedures and develop new policies and procedures, where indicated, rela ted to eligibility of youth for services, case planning, permanency, and youth transitioning fr om care, and will make necessary changes to better reflec t needs of older foster youth. 69 Nevada will develop policies and procedures regarding permanency planning for older youth, especially those youth iden tified as APPLA (Any Planned Permanent Living Arrangement). The development of the policies and procedures are a direct result of the statewide planni ng initiated in April 2004 that focused on improving permanency outcomes for former foster yout h. Diligent search efforts will be expanded at the time the APPLA is order ed. Caseworkers and supervisors will be trained as to the process for conducting a diligent search with an older youth. The diligent search must include the youth's input to identify all signif icant relationships, including family, relationships, friends, partners, mentors, and former caretakers. The following will be implemented: Policies and procedures will be developed to assure that case plans are individualized and youth driven; Policies and procedures will be develo ped to support youth who are parents to assure the contact and engag ement of the other parent; and Policies and procedures will be initiated to develop and maintain Youth Advisory Boards. Nevada will refine Memorandum of Unde rstanding and prot ocol between the Division and Division of M ental Health and Developmental Services (MHDS) to improve access and transition to MHDS. 4. Training Needs The Division recognizes the need for cont inuous training and technical assistance as follows: Nevada will continue to utilize training and technical assistance from the national resource centers for dev elopment and im plementation of independent living prog rams statewide; Nevada will collaborate with foster care training, recruitment, and licensing to develop an independent living traini ng module for new foster parents; Nevada will include independent living foster youth to a ssist in the training of new foster parents; Nevada will provide state wide training to existing foster parents and care providers regarding in dependent living services and resources; Nevada will develop training for st aff and supervisors regarding the identification of significant connections for youth and how to perform diligent search; Nevada will train staff and supervisors to ensure that they are knowledgeable about the full array of housin g options that best meet the individualized needs of youth; Nevada will provide training to e nhance the coordination between IDEA and independent living planning; and 70 Nevada will continue to provide statewi de training to all workers, supervisors, independent living partner s and stakeholders regardi ng independent living, and access to services.

Chafee Independence Program. The State of Nevada's funding allows increased support and services to foster youth transitioning from foster care to independent living and fo rmer foster youth between the ages of 18 and 21 years of age. An additional $4 2 million was earmarked for Chafee Independent Living; Education and Tr aining Vouchers Program under appropriations for FY2003 and this Bill was signed into law on February 20, 2003. The State of Nevada Depar tment of Human Resource s, Division of Child and Family Services was approved and received first year funding of the Education Training Voucher (ETV) Program for fisca l year 2003, with act ual spending period from January 1, 2004 to September 30, 2004. Additional funds were reallocated to Nevada with further funding allotted on an annual basis. The State of Nevada ETV program will expand and supplement the assi stance authorized in the Foster Care Independence Act to help children in foster ca re or who may remain in foster care until emancipation, to enter postsecondar y educational or training programs. The ETV Program allows states to provide funds for y outh who have been in foster care to attend an institution of higher education (as defined by the Higher Education Act, section 101,102). Foster y outh may receive up to $5,000 per year or the total \"cost of attendance\" (as defi ned by the Higher E ducation Act, section 472). For Nevada's foster youth and former fo ster youth who are planning to attend postsecondary schools and specialized tec hnical and/or vocational job training programs, the ETV Program provides support and needed services to allow the attainment of their educat ional goals. The Division supervises the ETV program and distributes ETV funds to eligible youth through a grant to a community nonprofit organization. ELIGIBILITY Youth who are currently eligible for C hafee services are eligible for the ETV program. Additionally, the ET V Program eliminates a gap in eligibility for youth adopted at age 16 or older who are omi tted under the State's Fund for Former Foster Youth. The following categories of eligible popul ations are based on federal program guidelines: 1. Youth Aging Out of Care: all youth exiting licensed foster care at age, eighteen (or legally emancipated earlier than age 18) are eligible to apply for educational assistance and independent living services. 2. Young adults, formerly in foster care, adopted at age 16 or older. 3. Young adults, formerly in foster ca re, exiting at age 18, currently age 18 up to age 21. 72 4. Young adults, formerly in foster ca re, exiting at age 18, currently age 21 remain eligible until they attain 23 years of age, if participating in ETV Program on their 21st birthday and are enrolled in a postsecondary education or training progr am and are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their program. PROGRAM GOALS 1. Help youth make the trans ition to self-sufficiency. Eligible foster youth's educational goa ls are developed with youth and their Social Worker/IL Advisor in the youth' s \"Transitional Plan\" for independent living. Information of the ETV program is provided at the development of Transitional Plan and at exit interview. Until re cently, financial resources and support was limited for foster youth to pursue post-secondary education and vocational training programs. A Clark Count y survey of foster youth found that 75% of youth surveyed planned a po stsecondary educatio n, although few accomplished that goal upon emancipatio n from the foster care system. Currently established co llaborations with community -based independent living contractors have expanded to include outreach and educ ational goal planning for foster and former foster yout h. Improved tracking and reporting requirements, as well as specific outcome-based procedures are in development during first-year program operation. The Division contractors, community partners, stat e and county social workers are coordinating and collaborating to provide t hat services are delivered to the highest number of eligible foster youth and to ensure that youth are encouraged to follow through with postsecondary school application requi rements and funding requests. With an increased focus on postsecondary edu cation from all independent living contractors, which includes assistance in planning e ducational or vocational training, applying for financial aid and additi onal support, more youth will remain motivated to reach their educ ational and vocational goals. 2. Help youth receive education, training, and services necessary to obtain employment. Statewide, the Chafee funds support independent living programs, which provide individualized lif e skills trainings and workshops for foster youth to prepare them for self-sufficiency in the co mmunity. IL Advisors assist youth to determine job interests, necessary educ ation or vocational training, job workshops, budgets, practicing info rmed decision making and other skills necessary for employment. The ETV Progr am fund removes barriers for foster youth to attend vocational school or tr ainings to further their employment opportunities. 3. Help youth prepare for and enter postsecondary training and educational institutions. 73 Education achievement determined by t he number of youth who leave foster care with a GED or high school diploma has dro pped in recent years in Nevada. Approximately 59% of exiting youth rece ive a GED or high school diploma, as many youth are unable to pass the required state basic skills proficiency tests. Additional tutoring in ba sic skills such as English or math is necessary for many foster youth, as these youths often become discouraged and do not make the additional effort to obtain their GED or high school diploma after exiting from foster care. Following state funding initiatives for form er foster youth, a database is under development to track characteristics of t he foster youth transit ioning out of care. This will allow more effective transiti on planning and increased interventions for all exiting youth and provide a more co mplete support system for the youth upon exit. Identifying youth, before exiting care, with educational deficiencies and providing services such as tutori ng, postsecondary education workshops, GED preparation and testing will better prepare youth to enter and complete postsecondary education and/or training programs. To qualify for the ETV program, foster y outh must be planning to graduate from an accredited high school, must have graduated from an accredited high school, or must have a GED or certific ation of high school completion for students who completed the mandator y hours required for high school instruction, but did not pass the high school proficiency exams. The youth's postsecondary school or vocati onal/training program must meet the following criteria: 1. Must be accredited or pre-accredit ed and is authorized to operate in that state. 2. Admits only students with a high sc hool diploma or equivalent and/or students beyond the age of compul sory school attendance. 3. May be a public or nonpr ofit school or training program that awards a bachelor's degree. 4. May be a public or nonprofit school or training program that offers not less than a two-year program and that provides credit toward a degree, or provides training towards gainful employment. 5. May be a vocational progr am that provides training for gainful employment and has been in existence for at least two years. Although youth are encouraged to participate in full-time educational programs, the ETV program does not exclude youth who att end less than full-time, as this would limit the number of youth who would be nefit from this program. The program provides personal and emotional supp ort to youth through mentors and to encourage and promote interact ions with dedicated adults. 74 Independent Living Services are provided by contracted community partners and focus upon services for foster youth in ca re, the transitioning yo uth, and the youth who has aged-out of care. Specialized case management is developed for the youth and allows tracking and outreach. Ea ch program coordinates information and referral for the youth. In addition, state and/or county social workers are available to youth and refer former fost er youth to services. The ETV Program builds upon services available with ex isting programs and youth and their IL Advisors/Social Workers may contact t he State Independent Li ving Specialist by telephone, mail, or electroni c mail for continued ongoing information and support. ETV provides financial, housing, counse ling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster youth between 18 and 21 years of age. ETV funds may be applied for in conjunction with other funding sources, including the State Fund for Former Foster Youth. The amount of a voucher shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining the recipient's eligibility for, or the amount of, any other federal or federally-supported as sistance. Current programs created especially for the former foster y outh provide referrals, goods, and services for this population. The ETV Program is an added component of these services. The total amount of educati onal assistance to a youth under the ETV Program and under other Federal and Federally support ed programs shall not exceed the total cost of attendance or $5000 per year, as defined in section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. T he Division shall take appr opriate steps to prevent duplication of benefits under this and ot her federal and federally supported programs. ETV Funds can be us ed for, but not limited to: Tuition and Fees Tutoring and Required Tests Transportation Books and Supplies Uniforms, Tools of the Trade Computer, Printer, Supplies Childcare Utilities and Deposits Meal Plan, Glasses, Adaptive Software, etc. Vouchers are available fo r education and training, including postsecondary education to youth who have aged out of foster care. The youth's state or county ILP Social Wo rker/IL Advisor shall inform youth of the ETV program and how to apply. The State Independent Living Specialist will inform community service providers and other state agencies, which maybe serving former foster youth of the resources availabl e for the youth. In addition, queries by social service agencies, the foster and adoption community, high schools, vocational schools, colleges and universities concerning the ETV program shall be supplied with information and/or referrals. Y outh may also access applications by 75 contacting contracted aftercare servic e providers, by on-line applications, or contacting the State Independent Living Specialist. Outreach in development in cludes coordination with the admission and financial aid staff of Nevada's community colleges and universities and vocational/ technical schools. All foster youth exiting care are informed of resources and services available and are encouraged to develop a support network within their community. Foster youth participating in the ETV progr am on their 21st birthday shall remain eligible, until they turn 23 years old, as long as they are enrolled in a postsecondary education or tr aining program and are maki ng satisfactory progress toward completion of that program. Nevada Matching Funds Nevada provides additional funding to el igible youth who hav e aged-out of the State foster care system. Funds may be used in conjunction to ETV funds to provide additional financial supports for the foster yo uth while a student. A portion of the state fund for the Assistance to Former Foster Youth Program (20%) is the match for the ETV program grant. 76 Appendix D TITLE IV-E TRAINING PLAN Training offered by the Division of Child and Family Services supports the outcomes for safety, permanency, and well -being, as well as the goals and objectives of the Division' s Program Improvement Plan. Training priorities identified below are based on the Statewide Self-Asse ssment. Once the Division has received the final Summary of Find ings report, the training plan will be modified in order to support the activities identified in the Program Improvement Plan. STAFF TRAINING Through the University Partnership, consisting of the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) & University of Nevada, Las V egas (UNLV), social work education and permanency planning training is prov ided for students in preparation for employment with the Divisi on and partner agencies; and to provide initial training and ongoing training to staff who promot e and provide permanency services and supports. The anticipated outco me is that services will better reflect innovative and effective strategies and techniques. T he training, curriculum development and field placement program is intended to comply with the following: 45CFR1356.60 (c), which allows these types of programs to support activities \"...necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the Title IV-E state plan\"; 45CFR235.62 (A), which permits any su ch program to \"include short term and long term training at educational institutions through grants to institutions or by direct financial assistance to students enrolled in institutions or agency em ployees or persons preparing for employment with the state or local agency.\", and 45CFR235.63 (c)(1), which states t hat \"Grants ar e made for the purpose of developing, ex panding, or improving training for personnel employed by the state or local agency or prepar ing for employment by the State or local agency administe ring the program. Grants are made for an educational program (cu rriculum development, classroom instruction, field instruct ion or any combination of these) that is directly related to the agency's program.\" All new child welfare staff will receive in itial training. Advance training and specialty trainings will be pr ovided on a statewide basis. Upon receipt of the CFSR findings and the development of the PIP, it is anticipated that curriculums and the required training will be modified and/or enhanced. The Academy will provide the in itial training of all child welfare workers. Courses on family centered investigation, s eparation issues, and engaging families in permanency planning are the basic core minimum courses that will be provided. The curriculum will be revised based on the analysis of national curricula that are 77 competency and skill based. UNITY will be int egrated into the training in order to create a strong link between concepts and practice. The training schedule alternates between a week of classroom training and a week of field training. The workers will spend a to tal of four weeks in the classroom. The academy will be offered four times a ye ar, alternating be tween Reno and Las Vegas. Nevada Training Partnership pays fo r the travel expenses of new hires, regardless of location to facilitate timely attendance at the academy. Subsequently, a new worker should be ab le to attend the acad emy within four to six weeks of their actual start date of em ployment. To help orient new workers to their offices and the field, an extens ive series of pre-academy shadowing experiences, reading assignments, comp uter-based training, and videos have been developed that must also be complet ed before attending the academy. Required Classes, such as Culture & Diversity, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), and the Multi-Ethni c Placement Act (MEPA) ar e offered statewide. Advanced Training will be based on t he CFSR findings and the Program Improvement Plan. CFSR findings indicate th at state training priorities should focus on: Supervisory Training Safety and Risk Assessment Case planning and Family Engagement Visitation as Proactive Strategy Court/Legal Issues Training Assessing Needs and Services Culture and Diversity Supervisory Training has been identified as one of the highest priorities. Based on the CFSR findings, f eedback from the field and a review of existing curriculums, training will be developed and implemented. The Educational Stipend Program at UNR and UNLV are used to encourage bachelors degree level and masters degree leve l social work students to go into the Child Welfare field. In Nevada, ther e is an additional need to recruit and retain qualified professionals willing to work in areas th at are considered \"hard to recruit\". Targeted stipends places the priorities as: Candidates willing to work in rural offices; Professional candidates that are Bi-lingual; New workers to the field; and Enhancement of current workers skill levels. Resource Family Training Resource Family (Foster Parents and Adopt ive Parents) traini ngs are primarily provided by each of the three agencies (Division, Washoe County and Clark County) staff with former or current Resource Families as co-trainers. The Institute of Human Services Foster Parent Curriculum is used in all three regions. Each of the training programs provides: 78 Resource Families Ori entation and Pre-Service Tr aining to all potential Resource Families. The training addresse s the issues related to abuse and neglect, the importance of relationships, the effects of care giving and permanency issues; and Resource Families Ongoing Training topics will be identif ied by the PIP, feedback from the Resource Families and child welfare workers. The ongoing training may be accessed through the University Partnership, local Foster Parent Associations, Agen cy sponsored events, and web based training, audio conference training and videos/books. Funding Sources Staff Training is provided through Child Welfare (IVE) traini ng contracts with UNR and UNLV. Both universities provide the match and the services. Both universities contracts are in effect until June 30, 2005. Resource Family training funds are within the three agencies. Washoe County and Clark County hire full time staff to provide coordination and implem entation of training. The Division rural region has one recruitment/trainer staff person and initiates contracts with local organizations to provide servic es throughout the rural region. Training Activities/Events Charts The training classes are described in det ail in the \"Training Activities/Events Charts\", which reflects staff development through the Nevada Training Partnership (NTP), UNITY training, Clark County and Resource Families training. These charts are available and ma intained by the Division. The information on the charts includes the following in formation for each course: Brief narrative of the training activity; Allowable IV-E administrative functions; Setting for the training activity; Duration of the training activity; Proposed provider; Approximate number of hours/days; Audience; Estimated total cost, and Cost allocation methodology. Nevada Training Partnership The workers from three child welfare agenc ies will have the opportunity to attend the Academy (initial training) and advance s pecialty trainings. Detailed information on this training is noted in the secti on of the plan containing the \"Training Activities/Events Charts\" for the eight Ac ademy classes, as we ll as ten additional classes. UNLV will work with NTP to provide training through the Training Series (Web cast) and on topics ident ified in the Program Improvement Plan. 79 The following is a listing of the available courses: ACADEMY ONGOING TRAINING Overview Family Centered Child Protection Services Child Development Separation & Loss Engaging the Family in the Permanency Process Legal Requirements Documentation Major Risk Factors Culture & Diversity Indian Child Welfare Act Multi-Ethnic Placement Act Safety Assessment Forensic Interviewing Domestic Violence Foster Parent/Relationship Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Staff Safety Training of Trainers UNITY In the first five months of 2004, the tw o UNITY training staff have provided 1,770 hours of training to 327 work ers statewide.
