He is the founder of the Rhys Thomas Institute and the creator of the Rhys Method\u00ae, a powerful system self-discovery, transformation, and healing. Rhys' greatest inner gift is the ability to awaken you to your deepest inner knowing of who you were born to be and what you are here to do to inspire others.
