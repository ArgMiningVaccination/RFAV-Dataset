Most energy healers and medical intuitives lack formal medical training, and that's unfortunate. Today's medical system discounts the role of emotions, intuition, and even touch on health... yet when you think back on your life, each of those has probably been involved in very significant events. An integrative energy healer such as myself is fully medically trained. I've been an M.D. for over 25 years. As a physician, I've run an integrative practice in Hong Kong for much of that time, and I've enjoyed the opportunity to help heal thousands of people, including some very famous performers. My willingness to use and integrate the best of what actually works, from traditional healthcare through alternative medicine, Chinese medicine, and energy healing has kept me in high demand as an energy medicine doctor. DEFINING INTEGRATIVE ENERGY HEALING Integrative energy healing is simply - combining energy healing with other forms of healthcare to give the best possible outcome for the patient. Integrative Energy healing is a combination of disciplines. Rather than focusing only on conventional western medicine, or a single alternative discipline like acupuncture or light therapy, it combines a range of methods, bringing all of these to bear in helping you along your healing journey. In my experience, this creates a synergistic effect that leads to better healing outcomes. The fundamentals of integrative energy medicine come from eastern and Chinese medicine. While western medicine has focused on treating illness, which often means focusing only on symptoms, Chinese medical practitioners set their sights on learning to recognize the elements of a truly healthy body and spirit. This gave them something to guide their patients toward, rather than simply overcoming an illness. Whether you are stressed, anxious, or have a physical/emotional issue you can't resolve. Together, we can help you to shift from dis-ease, stress, and anxiety to energy, peace, and health. I am a medical doctor board certified in the U.K. and Hong Kong, with over 100,000 hours in masterhood of using these skills: Medical Intuitive Dietary and supplement advice Breathwork and somatic exercises Energy Psychology and Energy Medicine Integrating light quantum healing with wellness, I am able to access your 'Higher Self', enabling a customized, totally individualized therapy plan. I use the ancient Celtic wisdom of 'The Power of Three'. This is a three-level healing 'wholeness' combining: Eastern and Western philosophies and techniques (including the Chinese Qi and Indian Auyrvedic medical systems) Mind ~ Body & Light (Spirit) Your energy; my energy and the healing energy From the Highlands of Scotland, I use Ancient Celtic wisdom combined with Eastern philosophy techniques, so blending indigenous wisdom with quantum neurology and biophysics, to connect with your inner light, your inner resources. Healing comes from truly aligning mind body, and spirit! Integrative energy medicine can help you deal with numerous issues, from the physical to the spiritual. - ACUTE OR CHRONIC PAIN AND ILLNESS Integrative medicine can help manage pain through a variety of techniques, including Reiki massage. - MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS GRIEF, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND TRAUMA Emotional and spiritual pain require treatments that focus on their roots, not on managing their symptoms. - TRUE AWARENESS OF OUR LIVES AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS Integrative energy medicine treats patients holistically, looking at all aspects that make us up, including our relationships with colleagues, friends, and family. - BALANCING OUR SUBTLE ENERGIES Integrative medicine seeks to bring us back into balance with ourselves and the world around us. Integrative energy medicine focuses on healing the body through natural techniques. These are typically noninvasive, which limits the chances of damaging side effects. Practitioners treat the body, mind, and spirit as a whole, rather than as disparate units that need to be treated separately. Conventional medicine is slowly coming around to this perspective, as we can see in research that shows depression isn't purely a mental illness, and that imbalances in gut bacteria can be a serious contributing factor. But integrative medicine goes beyond this, recognizing that our bodies and spirits change day by day. What moved us forward on our healing journey can change as our needs change. Just as we consume different foods each day, our spirits face different influences every day, good and bad. Healing is a partnership. True healing comes from both the healer and the patient. Conventional medicine is not separate from other forms of medicine; instead, it complements them. The patient part of an environment, one that is physical, emotional, and spiritual. A healer must address all of these for the patient to truly heal. Good medicine of any kind should be based on sound science and open to change when warranted. Non-invasive natural treatments should be used whenever possible. Invasive techniques should always be a last resort. Health is more than simply treating an illness or removing discomfort. Practitioners must commit themselves to self-improvement and exploration, always seeking new ways to better the lives of their patients. PRINCIPLES HEALING ISN'T ALL ABOUT WELLNESS! Healing isn't all about beginning when you're sick and stopping when you're well. Energy medicine seeks to restore joy and enthusiasm for life, to make you a vibrantly healthy human being once again. As children we experience this daily, living in a world full of wonders. Integrative energy medicine attempts to bring you back to this state, to re-experience this sense of joy. Joy at having a body free of disharmony, joy at having a mind that wakes up each day inspired to discover what life has to offer. Joy at being a spirit that greets the setting sun with a sense of calm relaxation that a fulfilling day has passed. This is ultimately the goal of healing, and integrative energy medicine helps to bring you here. "}
