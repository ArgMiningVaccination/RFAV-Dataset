As of January 5, 2021, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines would be harmful to a breastfeeding mother or child, but the available data is extremely limited. Lactating (breastfeeding) mothers who are considering COVID-19 vaccination should discuss the benefits and risks with their health care providers. Additionally, staff at Upstate's Breastfeeding Medicine Program is available to answer questions and can be reached at 315-464-2192. Any theoretical risks of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation must be weighed against the documented benefits of obtaining protection from COVID-19-related illness and against the well-known benefits of continued breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers who receive COVID-19 vaccine can join a registry developed by researchers at the University of Washington to track outcomes after vaccination. [Information on joining the registry may be found here.](https://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=87JFRCL8R8) Additionally, the CDC has developed a smartphone-based tool for individuals to check-in after COVID-19 vaccination and report possible side effects. [Information may be found here.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html) Summary of currently available information and recommendations - The safety of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation not yet been well-studied because lactating individuals were not included in the early vaccine research trials. As of January 5, 2021, there is no published clinical data on the use of COVID-19 vaccines during lactation. - As of January 5, 2021, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination in a lactating woman poses risk to her breastfeeding child. However, this has not yet been well-studied or proven. - It is possible that antibodies present in milk after administration of COVID-19 vaccine to a lactating mother may protect her breastfeeding child. This has not yet been studied or proven, however. - The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not advise against administration of COVID-19 vaccines to lactating (breastfeeding) individuals, but instead notes the lack of available data. - The Center for Disease Control (CDC) notes there are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women and no data on the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The CDC states that mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant and that people who are breastfeeding and part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g. healthcare personnel) may choose to be vaccinated. [Additional information may be found here.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) - The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine does not recommend cessation of breastfeeding for individuals who are vaccinated against COVID-19. [The full statement discussing considerations for COVID-19 Vaccination in lactation may be found here.](https://abm.memberclicks.net/abm-statement-considerations-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-lactation) - The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends COVID-19 vaccines be offered to lactating individuals similar to non-lactating individuals, and notes that while lactating individuals were not included in most clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines should not be withheld from lactating individuals who otherwise meet criteria for vaccination. Additionally, ACOG states that theoretical concerns regarding the safety of vaccinating lactating individuals do not outweigh the potential benefits of receiving these vaccines. [The full practice advisory may be found here.](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19) - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that while the COVID-19 vaccines were not specifically tested in breastfeeding women, it is not likely (based on the mechanisms of action of the vaccines in US trials) that there would be any risk to a breastfed child.
