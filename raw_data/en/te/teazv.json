October 2017 To: Complement ary Medicines Reform Section Complementary and OTC Medicines Branch Therapeutic Goods Administration PO Box 100 Woden ACT 2606 complementary.medicine.reforms@health.gov.au From: Comple 10 Introduction Compleme ntary Medicines Australia (CMA) is exclusively committed to a vital and sustainable complementary medicines sector, and represents stakeholders across the value chain, including manufacturers, raw m aterial suppliers, distributors, consultants, retailers and allied health professionals. The increasing consumer demand for complementary medicines has resulted in the industry becoming a significant pillar in preventative healthcare, both economically a nd as an employer. Over the last few decades the Australian complementary medicines sector has evolved into a major world class industry supporting domestic jobs, rese arch, manufacturing and exports. CMA welcomes the opportunity to review and provide comm ents on the draft list of permitted indications for listed medicines , and the opportunity to propose additional in dications or evidence qualifiers. The following submission is in relation to a particular subset of indications. Further submissions to the dr aft list may follow. Page 3 of 10 Indications referring to substrates or other markers Included indications in Draft List (July) The draft list of permitted listable indications includes some indications referring to cholesterol, blood sugar and triglycerides. Thes e are shown in Table 1 below. Body part/system Complete Indication Specific requirement applying to use of the indication CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Helps maintain/support cholesterol health Must not be for lowering or raising blood cholesterol levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Helps reduce the oxidation of LDL cholesterol Must not be for lowering or raising blood cholesterol levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Helps reduce intestin al absorption of cholesterol from dietary sources Must not imply lowering or raising the cholesterol levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Helps maintain/support blood sugar/glucose health Must not be for lowering or raising blood sugar/glucose levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Aid/assist/helps the transport of glucose into the cells Must not be for lowering or raising blood sugar/glucose levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Aid/assist/helps glucose/sugar/carbohydrate metabolism Must not be for lowering or raising blood sugar/glucose levels from outside of the normal healthy range CARDIOVASCULAR - BLOOD Helps in the maintenance of healthy blood lipids /blood fats Must not be for lowering blood lipids, blood fats and triglycerides Page 4 of 10 These indications refer to normal body substrates and processes and CMA agrees with their continued inclusion in the list of permitted indications. It i s consistent with the approach to other biological structure s and substrates described throughou t the permitted indication list. Excluded indications in Draft List (July) , and application for these indications Indica tions commonly used in listed medicines for some decades refe rring to the normal levels of these biological substrates such as glucose and cholesterol have been omitted from the list . Included in Table 1 of Appendix 1 at the end of this document are a list of indications for addition to the list. Below is a discussi on of the suitability of these kinds of indications, including discussion of an additional s pecific requirement applying to use of the indication s. Serious conditions Health benefits for 's erious forms' of diseases, conditions, ailments or defects are not eligible for listing. The TGAC restricts advertising of serious forms of diseases, conditions, ailments or defects which are : Generally accepted not to be appropriate to be diagnosed and/or treated without consulting a suitably qualified healthcare profes sional, and/or Generally accepted to be beyond the ability of the average consumer to evaluate accurately and to treat safely without regular supervision by a qualified healthcare professional. 'Levels ' of thes e substrates are not intrinsically diseases, c onditions, ailments or defects . Glucose and cholesterol for example are ubiquitous biological molecules . Regulatory mechanisms within the body (production, excret ion, transport) operate to keep bodily substrates and processes in balance. A normal range is recognised, above this th ere is a range recognised as a ' pre-disease' state, followed by a range that characterises n amed disorders such as diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia . Wh ile elevated levels of cholesterol, glucose, etc. may be cons idered serious disorders, undefined levels o r 'normal' levels of these substrates are not. Page 5 of 10 The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Clinical Guidelines for cholesterol and other lipids1 recommends that : 'Adults should have their blood lipids (a fasting sample should be used when assessing elevated triglycerides [TG]) assessed every five ye ars starting at 45 years of age.' Further, they recommend that for low risk individuals age 45+, lipids should be measured every 5 years, and for mode rate risk individuals, every 2 years. When not at high risk of cardiovascular disease requiring pharmacolo gical intervention, individuals may take lifestyle approaches. It is not in appropriate for individuals be fore the age of 45 and individuals over 45 who are low/moderate risk and not recommended for pharmacological treatment, to seek to maintain normal or healthy levels of such substrates via lifestyle measures inbetween the norma l, recommended Australian testing protocol . Lifestyle measures may encom pass a whole range of approaches, including diet, exercise, meditation, and functional f oods or complementary medicines . Indications consistent with low risk principles for listed medicines The indications proposed in Table 1 of Appendix 1 to this documen t are suitable for listing and consistent with low risk principles for listed medicines. They pass the criteria referred to in the TGA's Permitted Indication Fact Sheet2: Permitted indications must be low risk. Low risk indications may refer to: Health mai ntenance: The normal physiological effects of substances on growth, development and normal functions of the body. (E.g. 'Supports healthy liver function'). We are aware that the regulator has raised issues in relation to evidence, but the body of evidence is constantly changing and the holding of appropriate evidence is the responsibility of individual sponsors. It is a discussion that is not materially relevant to the discussion regarding whether the indications are of a suitable nature for listed medicines. 1 Page 6 of 10 Exclusion of indications inconsistent with list of Permitted Indications The omission of these indi cations represents an inconsistency within the list of permitted indications. Many indications in the list refer to other biological substrates/conditions t hat occur within normal ranges such as oxygen, thyroid hormone, oestrogen, testosterone, vitamins an d minerals . Like blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure, all these substances may exist in the body in normal or abnormal ranges and abnormal levels give rise to recognised medical conditions that require medical intervention. These other substrates /conditions have not been omitted from the permitted indications list, they have only been omitted in the abnormal range. In addition, as for blood gluco se and cholesterol, all require testing to assess the normality of the range. We also draw your attenti on to the inclusion of indications within the draft list of permitted indications that refer to the maintenance of cardiovascular health. Helping support/maintain lipid, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels are just one part of cardiovascular health and it is reasonable to include indic ations referring to these items. Comparable Australian food regulation and overseas regulators Many food items con tain health claims that are far higher than the indications that CMA are requesting to remain in the list of permitted indications. These food items are also available for self-selection by consumers . It doesn't appear to be a concern of the Australian government that consumers attempting to reduce cholesterol with food items presents a serious risk to consumers seeking adequate care by health care pro fessionals for serious conditions. Page 7 of 10 Indications relating to the reduction of blood lipid and blood glucose levels have similarly been included in herbal monographs published by comparable regulators ( eg Health Canada monographs for garlic, flaxseed and Irvingia gabonensis ). The claims for all such products are higher than those being propose d in this submission. Low risk i ndications Indica tions must not claim to be effective in al l situations . As such th e proposed indications are mitigated by the use of qualifying terms such as 'assists in the maintenance' or 'helps to support'. Indications must be considered in terms of whether it would pass the test of how a reasonable person would interpret and act upo n provided information. CMA does not believe that it would be possible for a reasonable person to interpret the proposed indications as for the treatment of seriously abnormal levels of such substr ates. Nor does it appear that any reasonable person would go against the advice of a medical practitioner and inappropriately self -treat serious conditions with listed medicines , or a void usual medical care because they are taking a listed medicine. Page 8 of 10 Consumer information and transparency There is a great deal of in formation relating to the use of complementary medicine substances in connection with influencing physiological processes. Removal of such indications removes transparency for the consumer under circumstances where no harm is being caused. However, it may introduce risk for consumers if they are not aware that certain supplements may influence these physiological processes. It is inherently safer to include such indications with a risk mitigating statement as proposed below, so that consumers have the choic e to not purchase such a product, or so that they may be reminded to check with their medical practitioner. Additional r isk mitigators At a certain point d uring the last decade, the TGA began requiring the use of the term 'in healthy individuals' to satisf y concern that listed medicines would not be used by perso ns with potentially serious conditions such as hyperlipidaemia . In recent times it appears that use of the term has not been considered sufficient to ensure safe use , although it has not been clear that this h as been connected to any identified problem with the use of the goods by individuals . Although as outlined above CMA believes the situation is low risk, we acknowledge the concern in this regard and therefore are pr oposing to replace the existin g qualifier with a stronger disclaim er to even further mitigate risk. Use of a label advisory statement could be : Not for treatm ent of high cho lestero l/blood sugar /blood pressure/triglycerides. OR: 'Please see about your cholestero l/blood sugar /blood pressure/triglycerides '. CMA does no t believe both label statements is necessary and would be difficult due to label constraints, therefore we are suggesting the use of one or the other statement. Page 9 of 10 Regulatory Impact The removal of these long used indications, that are consistent with low risk principles for listed medicines, represents a change in regulation that has regulatory impacts. It also does not appear to be in response to any primary problem or consequences that have been occurring . It has impacts upon Australians who are being blocked from receiving appropriate information and affecting their ability to make positive choices for maintaining their own health. There are questions outlined in the Australian Government Regulation Impact Statement Preliminary Assessment Form: Is a RIS Required? . It does not appear that the concern for this group of indications matches a problem of any magnitude, and does not appear that the removal or banning of these indications is warranted. The stronger disclai mer proposed in this submission will already constitute an increase of regulation, and we propose that this increase is suffi cient to addr ess concerns . Summary The proposed indications do not meet the requirements of being a serious form of a disease, ailment, condition or defect. They do meet the TGA requirements for health maintenance claims. Excluding the indications, tha t have been safely used for decades, reduced transparency for consumers, possibly introduces risks, and reduces their ability to choose acceptable lifestyle interventions to maintain their health. Therefore, it has regulatory impacts upon individuals, as well as many businesses that have these indications on their products without any harm having been caused. However, CMA has proposed increased regulation to address the concerns by way of label advisory statements to further mitigate the possibility of any risk. Page 10 of 10 Appendix 1. Table 1.
