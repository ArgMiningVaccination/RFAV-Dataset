Penn State researchers are collaborating on ways that human health is being impacted, from pollution and toxins to infectious disease and climate change. Systems In Sync Dynamics of disease, environmental change, and gene-environment interactions have been affecting human, animal, and plant health for decades. From indoor pollution to infectious disease to climate change, health is being impacted. Researchers are addressing these important factors in order to disrupt infectious disease vectors, enable precautionary design of chemicals and materials, and develop medical treatments to minimize negative impacts. Scientists are also identifying an increasing number of beneficial human/environment interactions, including the microbiomes in our digestive systems and on our skin. Penn State continues to grow in this area with the College of Health and Human Development's focus on [Environmental Health Sciences](https://hhd.psu.edu/Environmental-Health-Sciences).
